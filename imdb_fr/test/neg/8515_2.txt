I will give him a two because there is a lot of music, otherwise it would be one. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time tonight and this is the first "Road" image I saw. I was expecting better waaaaay. Robert Osborn says it's the best of Road movies. If it's true, I do not need to see others. The best thing about this movie is that it contains a lot of songs in the first part, but only a production number allows you to dance in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie. . Neither Hope nor Crosby got along so well, their characters were not very charming, the movie was not funny at all, most of the dialogues were just crazy, there was not a lot of action, of show. The movie was not what I expected. I was expecting more "road", but there are not many. They go quickly to the palace and then most of the film takes place there, until the end. I also expected much more of the famous "road" style of breaking the fourth wall, in which the characters speak directly to the public or comment on the plot. There were only 4 cases of this. One of these is an example of the funny humor of this script: <br /> <br /> (Hope recaps the plot so far for Crosby) Crosby: I know all that! Hope: Yeah, but people who came halfway to the photo do not do it. Crosby: You mean they missed my song? <br /> <br /> These are two weak typing lines, but at least they are jokes. Much of the rest of the script does not even have jokes. Here's an example: Crosby: Remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning. (Hope's indirect call to a rat). <br /> <br /> It's not funny at all, it's hardly a joke, but it's the kind of joke-free dialogue that contains most of the film. Many scenes do not even look like a joke, just using an uninspiring generic dialogue like: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Hey, what do you take me for? You think you can just throw me to the dogs? Hope: Well, why not, you did it to me, did not you? Crosby: Yes, but that's because I was looking for us. You are not looking for anyone Hope: Oh yeah? So why did I pay the check? <br /> <br /> (The above is just my memory, it's not correct, but it illustrates what I mean). <br /> <br /> And so on .... just a generic dialogue without jokes. <br /> <br /> My note: a waste of time.
