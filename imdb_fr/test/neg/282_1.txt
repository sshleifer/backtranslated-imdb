Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) catches Danny Ocean and his team and asks them to pay back the money they stole from him (in Oceans 11) plus interest. He abstains however from any violent action, because it follows the instructions of the biggest robber of the world, the Night Fox. The team then has to take a series of steps to reimburse Beno√Æt while testing his abilities against the Night Fox, who wants to maintain his position as the greatest thief of all time. In simple terms, this movie is a complete mess. The masses can say it's "cool" and that Clooney and Pitt are performing well, but they are the same people who have a subscription to the magazine "Hello" and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is complicated, it is neither complex nor intelligent and it does not have any intelligent twists, it's just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the public will find it cool and intelligent ( Hello readers of the magazine). Any respectable moviegoer will however see the movie for the farce it is. Although Oceans 11 was not a good movie, its rhythm, style and twists were decent. This film loses its way very quickly and gives up basically. It's as if the director and the actors are saying: hey, it does not really work, we laugh! Indeed, the actors seem to have fun but I was not. I will not enter the plot, its confusing evolution does not warrant any examination. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The scenes where Julia Roberts masquerades as an identity (with Bruce Willis in a cameo role) while being slightly amusing seem to be a desperate attempt to maintain public interest. The film is so full of holes in the plot that it's as if Arnie had emptied a 9mm Uzi in the movie studio. The merit can only be attributed to certain scenes where Night Fox uses Caopeira to hold a hold-up against the return of a funky music, but that does not justify the viewing of the film. The final scene presents the team in a state of absurd drunk stupor; that sums up the movie well. Stick to the original.
