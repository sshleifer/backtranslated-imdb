Thus, after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to resemble no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released a warm welcome and now a fan base dedicated. And the reason for the film's success is understandable because it features lush graphics, fast-paced action sequences, and some cool, cool characters. However, if you have not played FF7 yet, it is likely that you will not enjoy this movie because it has a continuous scenario without explanation and you may lose some of the plot even if you played the game. Secondly, there is no character development, without prior knowledge of the game, your opinions on the characters are limited to "cool" and "not cool". Of course, for fans of FF7, it is almost certain that the film will entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool to see all the characters you've come to love from the game in a pretty incredible computer animation. One last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, has tried to do too much in less than two hours and so the last half hour seems horribly rushed. If you played and enjoyed FF7, then it's a worthwhile watch, but nothing special. If you have not played FF7, it is best to play it before watching this movie.
