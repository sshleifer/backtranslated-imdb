In about 5 minutes, the first fight scene I was watching allowed me to report the lack of tension on the stage. The cameras that were crossing showed that he had no idea what he was doing. only the best. I'm not a low budget movie and you will not get the top 40 songs, but at least some music that goes with a scene that's not really hard to play, well, if I saw one I will let you know with pleasure. the script was so badly written that it would surprise me now, a piece of the director wrote this beep, I will give a 10/10 to the person and it is for the jacket of the DVD, because if I actually saw "before watching that "in a movie I would have bought it, so why if you take a look at the cover, it's really good that you go back and you see that it was awarded. Now, it's a very misleading thing because even in a small film festival, I would never believe in my life that it would win all I can say, it's "wow if it was the best I would not like not know what the shit in the film festival was like "<br /> <br /> movies that are as bad have only one good use, that is to say, a filmmaker in grass is inspired by such films are better tools than good movies, because If you know a movie you know almost immediately, there is a good chance that you do not make a movie as good, but if you use a movie like this, you can look at all the things that the director or writer have done wrong so you do not make the same mistakes, and you have the benefit of watching this movie and saying that if a beep like this one can be issued, there is hope for anyone
