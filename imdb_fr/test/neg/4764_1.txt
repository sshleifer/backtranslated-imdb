This film is about a group of people infected by a powerful man-made virus. Government men pursue them in the desert. <br /> <br /> The film has an interesting meaning, but the rendering is extremely boring. The film does not engage with the viewer at any time. Admittedly, the tiny budget is a problem but is not the reason for the failure of the film. The very polite delivery is even more involved. There is a lot of narration but, unfortunately, the narrator has an extremely dramatic voice. It seems that very little is happening for these people and well before the end, you will be rooted for the members of the government. The sooner they kill the protagonists, the sooner the film will end. A much better title for this film would have been Four people run in the desert with some images of a helicopter. Overall, very tedious.
