To put in simple words or rather a word, would be better adapted by PATHETIC !!!!!! The film begins to arouse some interest in the plot, but, BUT just a few minutes per audience become agitated for the toilet and snacks, or to breathe fresh air outside the dark, closed room .... <br /> <br /> It looks like a 1960s movie where the colors were dull, made by a beginner and interpreted by college students! The film tells the story of an up-and-coming American actress trying to make her comeback in the movies by playing in one of the worst Indian films. His game is real, sad, complimented by the worst delivery of dialogue. <br /> <br /> OverAll: I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie. You still want to watch: then try to watch it at home, when a TV channel broadcasts it, Believe me, it would be fun if this movie does not receive a single advertisement or sponsor. <br /> <br /> And better carry an aspirin, you may need it if you can not find a remote control to change channels! p.s.I have no idea, if the other critics even watched the movie? I made and wasted my $ 10 on the ticket!
