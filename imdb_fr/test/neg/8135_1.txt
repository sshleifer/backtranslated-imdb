I entered Heart Of Gold thinking that I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed a selfish tribute to the arrogance of aging baby boomers who have lost their advantage and forgotten their roots. Highly regarded by aging baby boom critics, directed and performed by more baby boomers, Heart Of Gold is a thrilling event from start to finish - if you succeed to get past the film in two hours. Neil Young and his team have long lost their advantage and want the rest of us to join them on a rocking chair padded mediocre in the middle of the road. What happened to the scorching guitar of his first solo efforts? I guess all his boxes of fluff rusted and his overworked suction tubes exploded in the hot air of his generation. Regarding Demme, here is the bold director of Something Wild & Melvin And Howard? A student filmmaker could have made a more daring film than this poorly visualized surface performance film. Do not waste your money in Heart Of Gold and go directly to The Last Waltz and Gimmie Shelter. And if you really want to deepen the personality of a rock and roll icon, get yourself a copy of Chuck Berry: Hail Rock and Roll Hail, which is terribly exhausted. And baby boomers, do not bother to say that this review is jaded by a younger person. I, too, am one of those boomers who listened to Acid Cinnamon Girl and danced on the street in front of the Street Fighting Man of the Stones. Go back and look Do not look back or Gimmie Shelter, then come back and tell me that Heart of Gold has all its value as a document.
