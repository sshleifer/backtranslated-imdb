The only reason I rented the movie was to see Jeri Ryan inside! OMG, it was the most boring and useless movie I have ever seen !!! WHAT PARTY !!! I mean really, give me a break! After Voyager, I would hope that we would offer him better roles! <br /> <br /> If I were one of the last people on Earth, I would not live in a caravan for dessert !! It's just such a bad movie !! The thing about the Indian tribe and how he compared it every 10 seconds really, really aged. Poor Jeri, better luck next time!
