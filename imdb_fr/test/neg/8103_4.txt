"Black Dragons" is a second feature film of popular propaganda at the time. It's not as bad as you might think. <br /> <br /> A secret meeting led by respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke) is interrupted by a mysterious stranger named Mr. Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly afterwards, the participants in the meeting begin to be murdered, their bodies being placed on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Columbus is suspected. Federal agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay), who tries to assist her. The reasons behind Columbus' actions are not explained until the last reel. Until everything is explained in the end, the story is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, who at that time had been reduced to appearing in a series of low budget quickies, is actually quite good at it. He is not allowed to play as much as he usually does and the credit goes to director William Nigh. The character of Lugosi slips into the shadows and recalls his Dracula even to the point of seeing his piercing eyes close. <br /> <br /> Clayton Moore, at best a one-dimensional actor, would become Lone Ranger on television a few years. Joan Barclay is a good heroine. <br /> <br /> Although a bit dated, "black dragons" are not a bad way to spend an hour.
