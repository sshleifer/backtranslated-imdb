Usually, I do not plan to turn off a movie unless it's REALLY bad. Homegrown is a movie I would have liked not to have lit. The plot is interesting, but the acting and the writing are too clear. I did not care about the characters. Any movie that shows drug use and free nudity as highlights is not commendable. The characters have spent their time busting themselves and believe me, this is the only way to get through this movie.
