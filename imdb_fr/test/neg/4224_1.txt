A desperate attempt to make a sci-fi thriller "black film", but the film is short. There is no credible plot, some of the key players were a joke (NOT Lars Bom, he's cool!). I liked the "maximizing bandwidth access restriction" though. I finished it as a matter of principle, but I went home feeling that I had lost two hours of my life ...
