First of all, I really do not understand how some people have "enjoyed" this movie. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. Even the actors seem to be bored ... and I think that says it all! <br /> <br /> However, I must give my applause to the creators of the opening credits - this team seems to have a very good future. That's why I recommend to major studios to ONLY watch the opening credits and one or two special effects sequences (if they are viewed outside of this movie, it looks almost like a good movie). <br /> <br /> Better luck (or judgment) next time for the producers of this, this ... this "thing!"
