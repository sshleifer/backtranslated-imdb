I saw the trailer of this movie before watching Titanic, and I must admit that it whetted my appetite. The volcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise. But what a wet mood. Corny is not the word for the script, and the characterizations are often ridiculous. The stupid girl is just unbelievable - she's supposed to be 13 but not 4. But scientists, firefighters and peripheral characters do not offer any more. This movie ranks right in front of Cruise II and Twister, but only because these 2 movies are completely appalling. This has reasonable effects, but overall it's a 1 in 10. Do not waste your time
