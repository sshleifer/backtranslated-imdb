This TV show is a stupid waste of time if you want to learn <br /> <br /> about animals watching the discovery channel. If you want to watch <br /> <br /> nincompoops on TV, just watch MTV. MTV is synonymous with TV music <br /> <br /> and is not afraid of crooks who make delayed sketches or stupid children who cry <br /> <br /> their heart for not having had a BMW for their 16th birthday. I bet <br /> <br /> if you like this show, I bet you like viva the Bam and jackass huh? I think my IQ lost ten points by watching this show. <br /> <br /> It's a combination of two jackass shows and the animal world <br /> <br /> Some people think it's a good combination. <br /> <br /> On the other hand I think it's a delay. <br /> <br /> And if you notice that it's a bit like moron <br /> <br /> and viva la Bam <br /> <br /> just a note, this show is horrible
