Well ..... horror it is not, but ....... !!! ??? A terrible budget of a very bad budget, somehow AND ... so pretty charming and fun to watch ... at least on my TV !!! A cross between Pete Walker, Herschell Gordon Lewis and ... let's say ... damn, I'm giving up ... I just can not find any more pretty similarities for this trash movie. Everything is so bad that I just have to enlist it in my film collection alongside .... Death In Venice ..... Nekromantik ..... Blue Velvet and The Good, Bad, Ugly ... to right !! ?? People with a little talent for adding bloody insertions or sexy happenings to the movie they buy from other people, should go get this movie right away.
