I love Hedy Lamarr. I think she was largely underestimated as an actress in the 1940s. She was the Nastassja Kinski of that time and the critics did not take her seriously. That said, this movie is a nuisance. When I watched it for the first time, I was shocked by the lack of continuity, not only in the story, but also in the makeup and costumes. Hedy's makeup changes from one shot to the next. The same goes for the length and style of the hair. Reason: This film has had so many writers and has suffered so many stops and starts that it's amazing that they have never published it. Her "Lady of the Tropics" started filming AFTER this one, but it was published before "I Take This Woman". In fact, at the time, he was known in Hollywood as "I Re-Take This Woman". That should tell you something. I'm also a fan of Spencer Tracy, but he's AWFUL here. I've read in various movie stories that he despised Hedy Lamarr absolutely, and that sounds perfectly obvious on film. No chemistry whatsoever. The story advances one after the other and ends up arriving at a very strange end. I can not recommend this one at all.
