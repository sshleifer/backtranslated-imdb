Nice attempt to revive the Shakespearian language in a post-apocalyptic setting, but the end result is terrible. Futuristic Liverpool is not convincing at all; the budget was obviously not very important, but the designer of the production could have proposed a slightly more creative approach in the matter. Alex Cox made some good movies, for example Repo Man and Highway Patrol Man, but I really do not know what he was thinking about here. Just a notice.
