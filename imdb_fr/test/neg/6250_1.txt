Before I begin, I must inform you that I love horror movies with passion. LOVE THEM! I have seen thousands of people and few people I do not like. I very much forgive the kind of horror. One of the biggest stories in the film's history is in the movie "Ed Wood" where Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) gets upset and shouts against the overly critical producers after commenting on "cheap turns and continuity problems" from "Plan 9" I do not know anything! Have you ever heard of the "suspension of disbelief ?!" "Well, I'm trying to bring that philosophy of" suspension of disbelief "to every horror film that I see and it usually works.Unfortunately, it did not work for me during the projection of Cheerleader Massacre. <br /> <br /> First strike: <br /> <br /> The first thing you will notice about this "film" is that it is filmed in video and has this style of A very poorly maintained portable digital camera The workmanship and quality of the camera are so poor that the daytime soaps are breathtaking in comparison - in fact, it makes the Troma and Full Moon video outputs pretty. is bad. <br /> <br /> Second strike: <br /> <br /> Jim Wynorski This "filmmaker" probably thinks he has a little advantage over old Corman, but nothing could be further Roger Corman turned quickly, furiously and on budget, but managed to produce a tight original film Although Wynorski delivers a cheap movie, he cheats his viewers (and perhaps other artists) by stealing whole tracks from James Horner's "Humanoids From The Deep" and "Battle Beyond The Stars" and throws them away. inappropriately in Cheerleader Massacre. On the back of the box and at the beginning of the credits, the score is falsely attributed to Dan Savio (an extra in "Deathstalker II" by Wynorski). You will also notice how Cheerleader Massacre jumps from movie to movie and vice versa when Wynorski raises entire scenes of "Slumber Party Massacre" and "Humanoids From the Deep". Fourteen years earlier, Wynorski had used this disappointment in his horrible version of "Not this earth". <br /> <br /> Third strike (you went out): <br /> <br /> While Massacre of cheerleaders does it have some nudity (40 year old teenagers and the biggest set of fake tits that I've ever seen in a horror movie, yuck), the murders are relatively bloodless. What is that? The film is titled Massacre of Cheerleaders, but a handful of off-screen murders, in my opinion, do not correspond to a massacre. This does not even make a bad mosquito bite. <br /> <br /> The story of the "movie" is fair enough - an invisible killer is watching a bunch of cheerleaders (teenage girls playing) until the van breaks down. 'essence and the' girls' are forced to stay in an isolated two-storey mountain house. I'm not going to ruin the end for you, but it's one of those "movies" where the person who is obviously the killer is clearly not the killer. Cheerleader Massacre would have been great if it had been shot by Joseph Zito and Tom Savini had special effects. Instead, it's a parody of Jim Wynorski's video without effect. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Please do not buy or rent this abomination. If we continue to support these clowns, more they will produce video waste without talent. Get out and rent "The Prowler", "The Last House of Dead End Street", "Delirium" or "The Burning" instead. You will be glad to have done it.
