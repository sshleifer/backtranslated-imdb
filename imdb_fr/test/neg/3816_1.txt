To say that this film is worse than suffocating its own diarrhea is a generous euphemism. The only thing more pathetic than this reprehensible piece of film is the shmuck paid by the producers to record a bunch of accounts in order to post false appreciations. <br /> <br /> If you watch a mediocre, unemotional film, snoozer of a movie about Sloth from the Goonies kills people in a way that completely ignores all the laws of physics (shoot the legs of 'an unbridled person, pulling her out of the chest) is your idea of ​​a good movie, then knock yourself out. <br /> <br /> No carbon-based life with a functioning occipital lobe would consider, in millions of years, that this film is scary or entertaining.
