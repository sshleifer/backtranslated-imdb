This film makes "Glitter" look like "Schindler's List". Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need to think more carefully before putting their name on a product. Green lighting of a P.O.S. like that, whatever friendships are involved, it's just a bad deal. Larry Bishop must be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. Screenwriter / director / producer / actor Bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for these jobs. "Hell Ride" is a vanity project launched in the south that usually allows good actors to chew the scene ... at least when the camera is not centered on Bishop's weak attempts to steal all the scenes in which it turns out that. The last three words on "Hell Ride" are STINK, STANK, STUNK.
