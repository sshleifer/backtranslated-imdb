Ni√±as Mal is not a movie, it's a bad episode of a badly designed nerdy soap opera. <br /> <br /> The action is not a little better in soap operas, I guess the writer and director has seen too many Mexican soap operas and can not conceive of anything very different. <br /> <br /> Give up, go back to your soap operas to get an audience. <br /> <br /> Stop wasting time and money and give a bad name to the once respectable Mexican film industry. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, it's a mediocre soap opera!
