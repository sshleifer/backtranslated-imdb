Well, the name in the summary should tell you everything. FRED OLEN RAY - the modern king of low-budget movies, whether for television or direct video (I doubt he produces for the big screen - with the death of the dual function of B-movie by car and all ). <Br /> <br /> Creator of such classic (?) Classics, such as Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers and Dinosaur Island .... <br /> <br /> Well, I like that kind of stuff. It's mostly entertaining (in a way that's pretty old-fashioned, camper and cheap) and if it's one thing, it's a pro - something you can not tell everyone in the movie world. <br /> <br /> This film is among the weakest of his work. A tasteless game, an uninspired storyline and lame jokes conspire to make your brain numb in minutes. If you are out for real F.O.R. goodness (or rather malice), pay attention to those mentioned above, and generally to his equipment of the 70s and 80s (I think he has lost some of his advantage lately).
