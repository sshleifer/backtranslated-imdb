Secret Service Agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) is mandated to protect the wife of the newly elected First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Killion has her hands full. She is the victim of numerous assassination attempts, all led by the Chief of Staff of the President, who wants the death of the First Lady. This film insults your intelligence with not only the screenplay, but also with the lack of realistic places. For example, in the scene depicting the Inaugural Parade, the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with Agent Killion and without the President. In addition, we know what Washington, DC, is referring to in terms of the weather in January, and not only is everyone "less flawless", you can even see palm trees at 70 degrees and in the sun! (Visibly filmed in Hollywood, not in Washington, DC). This movie is a joke. It's not worth your time.
