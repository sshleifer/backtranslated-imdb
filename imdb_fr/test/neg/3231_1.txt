I could not agree more. The book is one of Dean Koontz's best novels and this film is a travesty. I watched about half and threw the cassette in the trash with disgust! I have no idea what the foolish director was thinking of doing this shit, but I'd rather stick my eyes with a pointed stick than watch this useless movie again! Everything in this movie is just wrong. First, the main character went from a former sailor to a KID high school. WHY??? Second, the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie! I bet that Freud would have something to say about it! LOL. The dog is pretty cute and the best thing in the movie and completely excluded all others! In addition, a main character who helps them in the book betrays them in the film. There is really nothing good to say about the film except that it is relatively short (about an hour and a half). If anyone has not seen the movie yet, do yourself a favor! READ THE BOOK! It's so much better than this wasted time!
