Examine all positive comments from users of this movie, then check how often everyone posts comments. They post once. It seems that companies are probably paying for services that post unwanted comments on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This film was awful. The plot was stupid. The game was poor. The jokes were not even funny. The film included a minor nudity of what looked like porn actresses but none of the other characters. <br /> <br /> It was clear from the first 15 minutes that the movie was not funny. There was some slapstick here and there, but most of the humor was supposed to come from characters who were talking behind their backs and spreading rumors. It's not even well done. Every joke is obvious and you see it coming. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a fast advance or, better, do not look. <br /> <br /> I regret watching this movie and if I could load studio and distributor for an hour and a half, they stole me.
