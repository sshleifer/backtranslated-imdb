Stranded in Space (1972) version MST3K - a very bad TV movie pilot, for an unprecedented series in which an astronaut finds himself trapped in the evil twin of the Earth. Having a planet of identical size and mass in orbit around the same plane as the Earth, but on the other side of the sun, is a well-worn SF chestnut - the idea is over 2,000 years old, it was invented by the ancient Greeks. In this version, Counter World is run as a "perfect" Orwellian society. Where, for totally inexplicable reasons, everyone speaks English and drives last generation American cars. After escaping from his prison hospital, the ugly Earthian is pursued by television and the bad Cameroonian Cameron Mitchell who passes for Not Southern California. He wears, like his henchmen, double-breasted suits and black polo-neck sweaters, a wicked combination that I intend to adopt. if ever I become a totalitarian lord. Our hero escapes several times before ending up watching the three moons of the extraterrestrial world and wondering aloud whether he will ever come home - thus establishing one of these men alone in a hostile world making a new friend every week but leaving at the end of the month. Each episode shows such a cherished industry in the '70s and' 80s ('The Fugitive', 'The Incredible Hulk', 'The Littlest Hobo', etc.). The most curiously strange part was the sequence of titles. Somewhere between the first broadcast of "Stranded in Space" (under the title "The Stranger") in 1972 and the 1991 version of MST3K, he somehow acquired images from the movie "Prisoners of the Lost Universe" from 1983. Thus, in 1991, the opening credits of "Stranded in Space" takes place under a few shots of three people who fall into a message sender and disappear. It's a sequence that has nothing to do - even thematically - with everything that will follow. <br /> <br /> Just to add to the confusion of the old movie B, one of the actors in this film, Kay Lenz, appeared later in a 1994 film entitled 'Trapped in Space'. Knowing this fact will never save your life, but you risk gaining a lot of points and admiring the looks of film buffs - if you ever find a way to steer the conversation to the point of randomness without looking at it. a total idiot ...
