"Flood" is a great example of how doing good actors and CGIs on a movie will not make up for the storyline. The basic premise is good: if a weird storm threatened to send the sea directly over the Thames flood gates and swallow London so quickly that most people would probably never go out on time? This is essentially the New York segment of "The Day After Tomorrow", but that should not make it a movie. However, the script is just not there. It's just functional, flat and lacking in depth. Great British talents like Robert Carlysle and David Suchet to name just two, but they do their best with what they have, but their characters are two-dimensional cyphers, like an old Marvel comic book. and it would be frankly easier to go back. It's not that all the actors escape - Tom Courtenay seemed capable of a single emotion throughout the film, but he did not have a lot of challenge. <br /> <br /> I applaud any opportunity to see -The Hollywood disaster seems to be changing, and I do not expect to spend billions of dollars for rendering ultra-realistic graphics. However, there is no excuse to write in a tedious way - especially from a country that has produced one of the best science fiction ever made with almost no budget. It's the kind of half-hearted, half-hearted down duvet produced by the Sci-Fi chain, and it's not a goal to achieve. If, like me, you are such a fan of catastrophic movies that you are always tempted, do yourself a favor and watch it with friends. Even better; does not bother you.
