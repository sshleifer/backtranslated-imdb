Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says "stay away from this movie". We should all pay more attention to this little voice. It may be the worst movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching, or perhaps the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a fast forward button. Built on a budget of about $ 1.99, "The Cavern" is obviously a quick and quick way to piggyback on the current scary group of scary caves - many dark-claustrophobic caverns - unknown threats like "The Cave "and" The Descent ". A few years ago, there was a slew of similar films that used deep-sea ships instead of caves, all of which had scary boats / submarines - many dark, claustrophobic adventurers - unknown threats. .. same old old even. "The Cavern" is really "The Blair Witch Project", but this time we are lost under the earth and not above.Then throw in a flashlight with faulty batteries, a cow's skull with fangs stuck on it for a monster and one of the most stupid climax "twist" ever put on film.That being said, let me invite you to listen to me, the little voice in your head. am your friend I want you to have a happy life Stay away from this movie.
