AWiP tries to be funny, scary, tense and romantic ... and fails in all respects. The acting is at best average, but mostly stupid. Special effects are not enough to compensate stupid conspiracies, and chemistry between * ALL * character is juvenile. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to be angry with yourself, do not pay money to see it.
