A movie theater with a bad history of horrific murders of the past reopens. Of course, the bloody murders are starting again. Written, directed, filmed, scored and edited with a crass lack of finesse and finesse Rick Sloane (who then disgraced a little more celluloid with the "hobgoblins" absolutely atrocious), this horrific attempt to ham something ham rotten in every conceivable way: the insensibly lethargic rhythm, the painfully static and granular cinematography (there is a stinking surplus of meager dull images), a (no) boring and redundant dish, a redundant humn'shiver direction, a tediously talkative and storyless scenario, the sophomoric sense of lowbrow humor, bloodless murders, a pitifully indifferent killer (he's just an old man wrinkled with cursed makeup), the same uniformly obnoxious and unattractive characters, an abruptly unsatisfactory end and the lifeless performances of a remarkably uninspired cast guarantee that watching this dark scene is just as much fun and rewarding than eating rude raw eels soaked in sour vinegar. This crud is totally lacking the necessary brutal charm and the sleazy vigor necessary to be a pleasant junk. Instead, it's just a steep, winding, sinuous steep that never catches fire or even becomes distractingly amusing in some kind of nonsense. Only a small share of nudity and the charming presence of the always reliable Mary Woronov as a snarky and sardonic secretary offer some relief to the general misery of this ugly loser.
