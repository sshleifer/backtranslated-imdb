While the premise of the film seemed unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the movie, I could have stopped there and continued my life. She has interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not enough to add to the validity of the film. <br /> <br /> I also had the feeling that she had been a little crazy of things. If a guy says a foul comment, take it or make him a disgusting gesture, I'll say, go ahead, bring him, he's a pig. What bothered me though was that she would walk in revealing clothes and she would be surprised to see the guys look at her and give them hell about it. of human sexuality and much of who we all are. The guys are going to watch the beautiful women, especially when they dress provocatively, just as women will look at men when they wear a tight tank or no shirt at all. Some women may hate me for that, but I hope not. I have a lot of respect for women. I was raised by one. I also come from a Spanish family and we are very matriarchal. My grandmother was the center of my family for years, but I do not think it really helped women's rights, and from what the filmmaker even said herself, some women were offended by his project.
