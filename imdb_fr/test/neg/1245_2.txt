What could have been a great movie about professional poker player Stu "The Kid" Unger turned into disappointment. <br /> <br /> You can say that filmmakers were working on a short budget chain. Everything seems filmed on the cheap. The delays seemed a little off. <br /> <br /> Throwing Michael Imperoli of the Sopranos was also a bad casting choice. He looked too old to play the Stu in baby's face, he looked too healthy for a coke addict (if you look at footage from the main event of the 1997 WSOP, the real Stu He was so skinny and he hardly had the nose of too much cocaine so he was wearing those sunglasses to hide them), and I was still expecting Adriana to appear and shout "Chris-tu-phur !! " <br /> <br /> They also ignored the fact that he had a son from Angie's previous relationship who committed suicide in the late 1980s. <br /> <br /> Whenever I saw Vincent Van Patten appear, I kept thinking that he was going to announce "Show tunes that go out in Stu's head." as it does on the WPT. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for true Stuey footage, check out ESPN Classic because they're regular rebroadcasts of the 1997 WSOP Main Event. Or try YouTube. Avoid this movement as a bad beat.
