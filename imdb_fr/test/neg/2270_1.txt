Comparisons between the 1995 version and this one are inevitable. Unfortunately, this version is not up to par. <br /> <br /> The cast is not inspired and the game of actors in wood. It seems that the director did not read the book, so he did not understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Sir Walter Elliot is described as pompous, but his inadvertent stupidity that Redgrave brilliantly captured (in the 1995 version) is nowhere. to find. <br /> <br /> The sisters of Musgrove are so pretty, we do not understand why Wentworth or anyone else would give them a second look. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is devoid of feeling. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, Hinds and Root were able to express the depth of emotion they felt for each other with their body language and facial expressions. In this one, it is difficult to understand that Anne spent years in regret without having read the book. <br /> <br /> This production does not reflect the emotional complexity of the relationship between the main characters. <br /> <In the scene where Wentworth arrives at Anne and Mary's having breakfast, it seems to the viewer, as Mary thinks, that they are only slight acquaintances. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, when Wentworth enters the scene (the first time he sees it for years), the tension is thick. The resentment comes from Wentworth in waves, while Anne is almost defeated. <br /> <br /> In this version, while Wentworth is courting Lousia, it's as if he was really invested, the bottom currents were missing. In the 1995 version, the viewer sees Wentworth's anger against Anne. He flaunts his court in front of Anne, as if to say: "see what you have abandoned, I no longer need you or want it anymore". <br /> <br /> However, he always cares if she suffers, illustrates the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to bring Anne home. In the 1995 version, the viewer feels Anne's shock that he would worry about his fatigue, but we also feel Wentworth's discomfort. In this version, he continues to walk with Lousia as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> The pivotal scene where Anne discusses with Harville who loves the longest, man or woman, is totally sloppy. The actors only recite replicas without emotional investment. <br /> <br /> When Anne reads Wentworth's letter, it's like she's reading a shopping list. <br /> <br /> Contrast this with Version 1995, where the viewer feels Anne's joy at his second chance. We are there with her when she reads the letter. The director had the letter read to both actors and you hear their voice. Wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while Anne is incredulous at first, then moves on in joy. <br /> <br /> This production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because it was necessary to explain to the spectator this right happened. The 1995 version did not need to explain, we knew and we rejoiced for the characters. The only thing this production has in her favor is that she kept Ms. Smith's sub-parcel intact, unlike the 1995 version. <br /> <br /> The 1995 version included a part of the original end of Austen. The scene where the admiral asks Wentworth to know if Anne and Mr. Elliot will want to return home (that he and Mrs. Croft are renting) after their marriage. <br /> <br /> This is a production to avoid at all costs.
