First of all, I hate those stupid rappers, who could not play if they had a rifle leaning on their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other, pretending to be a clich√©d version of the gangsters. <br /> <br /> The film does not take more than five minutes to explain what happens before we are already at the Warehouse There is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, with the exception of homeless, who is also the only one to have half of the brain. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hill players and the Sadlers character is as bad as the gangsters. I did not like it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with unnecessary violence and the Walter Hills specialty: people falling by the window while the glass was flying everywhere. There is hardly any intrigue and it is a big problem when you are not looking for anyone. Everyone dies, with the exception of Paxton and the homeless, and everyone gets what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only two blacks who can act are the homeless and the drug addict, but they are professional actors, not boring. Ugly and dead rappers of the brain. <br /> <br /> Move away from this shit and look at 48 hours 1 and 2. At least they have characters you care about, a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the distribution.
