This film is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: do nothing, be a loser, then suddenly ... whoah! You are an odious genius and the world embraces the ground on which you walk. <br /> <br /> And surprisingly, all other smart people are losers. They know nothing and are bitter when our Wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult, but these teachers can still analyze the results in less than 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Every film contains something good, and so is Robin Williams.
