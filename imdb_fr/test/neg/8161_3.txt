I must say that I found this film very disappointing. Yes, I know that Maltin gave 3 1/2 and others appreciate it a lot. But hey, the opera sequences were terrible. I guess Jeannete MacDonald is an acquired taste. Yes, in the short sequences I saw with Nelson Eddy, it's immensely better. But only ... God, I do not like opera and despise operetta, and it's fundamentally intolerable. At one point, I had to cover my ears. Gable is fine and Tracy is thrown. The intrigue is annoying in the JM never just tells Gable that she loves him and opera and why she can not do both? Instead, she suffers in silence (or not) from the compromises she makes. The support cast is distinctly immemorial. Besides star three and Jack Holt (and his mother, I guess), they are all deep and forgettable. The equalization sequence is the only thing that records the movie. And just. Yes, it's quite spectacular and moving. But the "oh God is great" seems very artificial. I prefer immensely "In Old Chicago" to the extent that disastrous events take place. Save yourself on this one.
