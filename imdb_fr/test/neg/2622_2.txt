A few moments ago, I watched the first episodes and felt that I could not stand it anymore. The fight scenes that look like horrible scenes are the worst of my life. About a third of each episode is devoted to Flash Gordon and his "mighty" combat movements. I know that the combat choreographies of that era are not quite up to the standards, but that's ridiculous. They do not even try to make it realistic. Flash Gordon, who does not look like a fighter, uses his slow, drunken movements with his bare fist to knock out four or five men with knives, rifles and other weapons. Leave me alone! There is also a scene where he does something similar while he is in the water. Basically, each episode has similar scenes. As for the rest of the episode, there is not much else that I can remember. I basically saw it out of curiosity about what science fiction looked like 70 years ago.
