I will not comment much, what is there to do ??? Stereotypical characters, absolute ignorance of Colombian reality, dreadful staging, mediocre color choices, NOT funny (it's supposed to be a comedy and they expect you to laugh because some of them stretch music next to absurd scenes), very bad actor (if you see these people somewhere, I mean the performers, you'll know they're at least good, but seeing that as a movie, it's impossible to guess), you have some tired of music ... this "comedy" there is no rhythm, the only good rhythm is the rap sing in the final credits ... pathetic, is not it? etc ... etc ... It's been a long time since I've seen such a bad movie !!
