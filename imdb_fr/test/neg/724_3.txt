This is one of Lane Lane's four 1970s movies about sensationalistic murders in small towns. They feature friendly television personalities as police chiefs and unusual characters as regulars in the city, including clear love interests. The others are: They only kill their masters (James Garner, 1972); and The Girl in the Empty Tomb and the Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith, 1977). <br /> <br /> Alda's is near Vermont ("Mount Angel" next to "Horse Creek"); others in California, Garner at the seaside ("Eden Landing") and Griffith in the mountains ("Jasper Lake"). All are trying to capture the feeling of a small town, to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters and to tell a mystery with at least a complicated twist or turn around. At this level, they are somewhat entertaining (the fact that they are often re-executed suggests that they have a certain appeal). But they suffer from thin stories and dialogues, no tension, bland decors, flat or exaggerated characters, and offensive and forced attempts (often juvenile or brutal) of color or humor. <br /> <br /> Alda's and Garner's are the most serious in terms of history, characters, rhythm and tone. They have the best support cast, even though Alda is better used; the Griffith casts a pallor in comparison. Alda's has the best director. <br /> <br /> "Shocking" is a surprise and a tragedy. The killer method is inventive. The tone is more uniform and the dialogue more natural than in Griffith. Alda's film does not suffer, like the others, from big-city transplants in the city or from hokey, exaggerated local characters, both of whom seem to be the brainchild of a Hollywood screenwriter, not so sincere (the worst offender is the pipsqueak of the Griffith movies, whining "Whit," which we were told, tried to tie up a jeep and fly away with a trailer serving as a temporary branch at the bank, dragged the police boat dock, stole tomatoes in a farmer's truck do not get anything for them and fill $ 11 on the withdrawal slip of "Spiro T. Babylis" (only to be discovered by the cashier). , the awkward and heavy repetitive style dialogue of Griffith's films ("Are you going to have lunch?" "I'm going to take the boat." "Are you going to take the boat for lunch?" "I'm not going to lunch." 't go take the boat for lunch? ";" There is no fish in this lake Why are you fishing here? "It's illegal at Horse Mountain. "It's posted here too, you're breaking the law. "" A law. There is no fish in this lake. "So why are you fishing here? "I told you, it's illegal at Horse Mountain. "Please call me Lloyd. My name is Lloyd. "" Okay, Lloyd ... "" Call me Lloyd. It's my name. My name is Lloyd. ") <br /> <br /> But Alda is too low-key and unimpressive to be taken seriously, even for a small police chief, certainly not as a formidable lawman asked by a rival city. "Slate admits the character, when he arrives late on the scene of an obvious clue, following an accidental name recognition.Rather than detect or investigate, Barnes blindly advances in emotional denial, his secretary Lasser provides him with an important clue ("Why did not I think about it," he says!) An embarrassing funeral scene, coupled with a conspiracy, leads to another gift clue. <br /> <br /> Worse, Barnes is more interested in the ridicule of the county police's military-style helmets sent to help him (Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the military) than directing them effectively or with his own men. late by incompetently protecting a known target. Barnes lets his car hit several times by the murderer who flees a crime scene, without straightening his gun or trying to take control. Again, he is inefficient, and almost killed, in the climate scene, resulting from multiple mistakes on his part that are only partially corrected, by accident. The erratic focus of the north-east affected by Alda does not help credibility. <br /> <br /> There are holes in the plot. Why would the killer have hit after all these years? And committing the first two murders without a trace seems improbable. But they are nothing compared to the following: a couple, a shopkeeper in his shop during office hours, a fully dressed deputy sitting in his office and, incredibly, his dog! <br /> Alda's film also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate injects into all the movies. Barnes appears for the first time in the bed of a motel employee. He then treats her roughly every turn, insults and tries to avoid her children. This, and talk about the female doctor, feeling a raw and mean motive (Garner's film was described as "sordid", including a scene where he and a MP laugh at how a girl sitting in the back of a car A guy in the car bit him a part of his anatomy in the road Griffith's program is an ersatz Ropers, in which the woman tries, in an embarrassing way, to get the man into the closet. "A free locker room type exchange with a MP discussing the death of a young woman on a car accident (" Did you take her out? "" I took her once. ") a reference to the bank teller "Bernice" as "inflated in places" and to "pin it in" and "hate" and dismiss the secretary "Maude" because she was "too hairy"; description of the practice of the female doctor as "two stirrups and a flashlight"; a humiliating scene in which Fran Ryan offers Griffith, offering "a bit of us", and an insulting subplot in which a woman, pursued by an adjoining play such as a wanking jester, seems to "sleep everywhere"). <br /> <br /> Finally, Alda's film looks dark, bleached, colorless and lifeless. Only Louise Lasser adds the spark. At least the other films had wit, scenery and nice music; Griffith came out on the mountain, on the lake and even in the big city. You no longer want to watch Masters or Empty Grave again than Shocking.
