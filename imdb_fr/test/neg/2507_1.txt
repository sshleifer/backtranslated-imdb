The opening was a theft of "Eight-legged Freaks", a movie that's all that this one is not. Stilted and pedestrian are the words that apply - as well as others that can not be repeated ..! The Drifter guy returns to his hometown (?), Finds old friends, etc. Does the director not see "Close Encounters"?). Good acting? Beautiful story? Good camera angles? Good cut? Not here! Do not rent unless you share the costs and have a lot of beer on hand. Do not watch TV, drink a lot of beer instead - you'll get more!
