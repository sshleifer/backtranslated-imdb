Again, Mr. Costner dragged a movie a lot longer than necessary. Aside from the amazing rescue sequences at sea, of which there are very few, I did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character is understood very early, then forgotten until much later, when I did not care. The character we should really care about is Ashton Kutcher, very arrogant and confident. The problem is that he comes as a kid who thinks he's better than anyone around him and shows no sign of cluttered closet. His only obstacle seems to win Costner. Finally, when we have gone over half the way this jester went, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is pushed to be the best without any prior idea or prefiguration. No magic here, it was all I could do to not turn it off for an hour.
