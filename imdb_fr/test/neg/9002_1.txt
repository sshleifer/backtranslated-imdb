It's not "so bad that it's good" - it's "so bad, it violates the prohibition of the cruel and unusual punishment of the Geneva Convention"! Only by reading the Synopsis can you even understand the "storyline" of this Straight to Video disaster. It's a hodgepodge of sequences of grainy backgrounds stuck with some of the worst actions of all time you'll ever have the misfortune to see. To compare this incompetent, turbulent and humorless mess with "Dead men do not wear plaid" is to say that "Gigli" is like "Citizen Kane". The actors without talent are costumed in cheap clothes, J.C. Penney "Goin 'to Church", and there is not the slightest attempt at vintage hairstyles or make-up. If you really want to see how this kind of tribute can work, check out "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra" - It's smart, well written, and best of all, portrayed by real actors who are not so afflicted watching . In this regard, look for the work of Phoenix artist Paul Wilson, whose short science fiction film "Attack of Courtesy, 70 feet" leaves this film in the dust. The people of Terror In the Tropics seem to have been shot from the street and had to read their script during the one and only take. It's an insult to Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney and all those involved in the movies they've cannibalized to make this party! Money is not the problem - a lot can be accomplished with very little expense. A good script, honest actors and, above all, class Z costumes and sets should have been acquired before the so-called director created this stinking pile of cinematographic offal. Let's hope that the "promise" of a sequel is not realized - it was by far the most scary thing shown in the whole movie !!
