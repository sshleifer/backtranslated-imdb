For many years I have seen this film as a true ninja movie, but after studying this culture in more detail, I can only think that it is just another karate film. A black shinobi and some weapons do not make a ninja, it's much more than that. The ninja are the most dangerous warriors in Japan because they are trained in all aspects of life to survive, to kill anything that can be asked of them. This film does not speak of a ninja warrior, but of a clown trying to be something he can not even understand.
