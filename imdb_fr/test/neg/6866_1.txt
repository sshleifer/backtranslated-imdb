The concept is excellent. The execution is typical of the overall quality of the ABC network. <br /> <br /> Aside from Peter Jones, it seems the rest of the panel is made up of marketing executives. Rather than real entrepreneurs. <br /> <br /> When I realized that Peter Jones was meeting with Simon Cowell, I thought it was great to be able to take America by the balls. But it seems that ABC has arrived and destroyed the concept. <br /> <br /> I was an absolute addict of the Den Dragons in the UK and I was interested to see that Peter Jones had manipulated the concept born in Japan and developed his own show for the states. The result is neither inspiring nor informative. <br /> <br /> If drama is missing in your life, do you have a choice now? Jerry Springer or the American inventor In summary, a musician in trouble sells to a media mogul. <br /> <br /> Idea: bring me! And I will produce a show worthy of the title
