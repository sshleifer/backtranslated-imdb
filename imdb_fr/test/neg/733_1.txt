I watched "Fuckland" a long time ago. I lied if I said I remember it in detail; What I remember most vividly is the irritation that it caused me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money, not only of my time and my money invested in watching the film, but also the director. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, "Fuckland" is a critic of the Argentineans who introduces us (I, too, am an Argentinian) to small people who boast of deserving and boast small ridiculous victories, and who think we are the best thing that God (who is also an Argentinian) created. I will not discuss it. This is probably a true statement about a fairly large part of the population (the part I scorn, by the way). And even if it was not true, that's not what I mean. The worst of Fuckland's sins was to express a statement of this kind about his own director. <br /> <br /> The constant impression that I had was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for inserting a camera in the islands do not worry about making a good movie (even mediocre). Many shots with a hidden camera are useless. The director chooses to boast with a stupid edition of old war catches and his own. And there is no conspiracy at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film proudly presents a Dogma certificate before the first titles, then to disregard its principles (for example, including the director in the credits - another sign of his pride?). <br /> <br /> I found the film offensive, not as an Argentine but as an observer. I felt underrated. "Fuckland" is simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
