Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and rightly so. So I'm happy to see one of their movies. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in the hospital and, having nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit him and brings him boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy. The chaos starts with Stan curiously pulling Ollie's leg string and manages to push the Doctor (Billy Gilbert) out the window, clinging on it and having Ollie hooked to the ceiling. When the situation calms down, Stan picks up Ollie's clothes, because the Doctor wants them both to leave. He also manages to sit on a syringe accidentally left by the nurse, filled with a sleeping pill, which comes into effect while driving (what you can see is with a car in front of a big screen. slapstick friendly and not bad (although repetitive and a little predictable) the classic comedy, it's not great, but it's a black and white movie It's worth watching Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on the actor comedian.
