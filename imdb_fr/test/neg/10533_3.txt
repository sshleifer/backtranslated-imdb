Half Past Dead was different from all Steven Segal movies I've ever seen. Very little of Segal, himself in action and I agree with the latest review I've read, Nia Peeples steals the show. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything really new here, the same old stuff from other movies having changed little. The best action scenes were Nia's as she kicked her ass again. It was interesting to see her as the villain after watching her for two seasons on Walker, Texas Ranger, still kicking her buttocks, but for the good guys. <br /> <br />
