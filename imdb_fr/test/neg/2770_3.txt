My question is what was the worst part of this movie? Was it acting? direction? scenario?. Maybe it was the waste of Alan Ladd and Jack LaRue. LaRue and, in particular, Ladd are able to bring an extremely sinister role. In this film, it was hard to say who was the bad guy. Admittedly, Ladd played a good undercover guy, but even in his good guy roles, he could be very scary. The end result was therefore a potentially good movie, devoid of any sense of conflict.
