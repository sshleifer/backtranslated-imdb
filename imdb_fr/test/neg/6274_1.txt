This movie is so bad that they should burn the master. You can not ruin the plot, because this movie does not have one. The graphics are less than fake, they are horrible. You then have the chance to cross the countryside in search of stars who work in turn and who bounces between his own madness and madness of the crazy preacher. and when he finally arrives at DC, they do not even have the decency to kill him; the monster (that you did not know at the time) is already dying, but how ... who knows & of course that it has the most serious end - everyone on the planet is dead or dies except for his family and a handful of latecomers survive. Imagine that! This will be the film in which Thomas Howell will go to his grave, regretting not having starred in a star. It probably gives him nightmares.
