I like sci-fi and even poor-quality movies, designed for television, bargains, movies that I always find interesting. Well, I found this one in a business basket and I brought it as a choice at a movie night with a group of friends. <br /> <br /> I was literally * emaciated * when I brought this movie. <Br/> <br /> From the beginning, the acting is bad, the story is bland and the plot is almost non-existent. All this brings us to what the movie really was: a soft core graphic porn movie. <br /> <br /> The film started with a prison for women where the prisoners are all sexy women working in a kind of mine. First clue that this film is NOT serious: attractive women in a prison are forced to do physical work. Yes indeed! It does not matter. Once the "plot" continued, it was overshadowed by unnecessary scenes of people having sex. Halfway through the movie, my friends and I stopped watching, it was so stupid. The next day, I thought I would give the film another chance and look at the rest. I watched about 15 minutes more and I gave up again. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent movie, sci-fi or even a sci-fi monster movie, DO NOT WATCH Lethal Target! If you want to see a low-budget, light-weight soft core porn, you can go to Lethal Target.
