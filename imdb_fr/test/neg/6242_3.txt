Now, I know why this movie can be bought for so cheap in video stores. I was curious because he had three big stars but was part of the "B" movies that the video does not even seem to be able to give! The answer is that it is a film that is likely to attract a very small audience: a crowd of over 50 with a very liberal sensibility. <br /> <br /> Those who watch Robert Redford, Willem Dafoe and Helen Mirren give a basic message that "deceiving your wife is acceptable as long as you still love her". This is the beautiful "message of well-being" here, especially at the end of this strange kidnapping story. Who wrote this script ..... Bill Clinton? <br /> <br /> I say "strange" because the kidnapper is the nicest kidnapper (Dafoe) you've ever seen in the end. He frequently dislodges his hostage (Redford), which no kidnappers would take, only converses informally about family matters, and so on. It's ridiculous! Well, the L.A. Times says it's "a smart thriller". Ha ha This confirms what most people know about L.A. Times. For those of you who believe in it and have not seen it, I will not spoil it with more gigantic holes in this story, especially at the end. The fact is, it's an insult to anyone who shows intelligence. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you can not fool everyone all the time, because critics have not understood it yet. Here's another film they boasted about that was rightly bombarded at the box office and at the video store.
