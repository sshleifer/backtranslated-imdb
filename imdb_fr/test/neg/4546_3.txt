I am all about the walking dead, but my mind is still not sure of death, frozen dead. Unfortunately, THE CHILLING did not help me decide. It's really slow, nothing happens during the first 45 minutes, which made me press the "Improved Movie" button several times. By the time the well-designed zombies appear, it's too late and the director (two would have filmed this) has no idea how to film them. Haggerty, Blair and Donahue all look tired / embarrassed / healing. I will give credit to the film because it is prior to T2 and ends with the freezing of the bad by liquid nitrogen. The Shriek Show DVD features a long 8-minute promo that starts in the day and that I actually recommend watching while watching the movie in its entirety.
