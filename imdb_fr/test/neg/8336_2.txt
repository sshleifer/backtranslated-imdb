A horrible mix of predictable stories and nauseating and overwhelming PC clich√©s (races working together, the heroine being pretty and pretty, a guy who sacrifices himself to save another life, a father / daughter relationship, etc., etc.). ). The film looks like something created for network TV and probably should have stayed there. Even the talented Tommy Lee Jones can not save this BOMB. I urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin since the days when Hollywood disaster movies reigned. <br /> <br /> The two stars are attributed solely to the CGI people and the ability of the PR peoples to even get a spectator to sit there.
