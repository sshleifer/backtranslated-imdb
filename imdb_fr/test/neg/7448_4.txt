I was a big fan of the original Robocop. <br /> <br /> But to say that I was disappointed by this first sequel would be a euphemism. <br /> <br /> There are many problems. <br /> <br /> As brilliant as the film may seem, there are many bloopers on screen, son, cameramen, etc., which I find absolutely unacceptable from an Irvin pedigree Kreshner. <br /> <br /> Robocop has become a robot. There is no spark of humanity in the character here. A real disappointment when you consider that his "soul" had returned to the end of the first film. Here, his attitude shows no human side and makes it difficult to sympathize. <br /> <br /> Caine is a poor villain. OK, I know that Boddiker's first movie was better than average, largely thanks to Kurtwood Smith's performance, but Tom Noonan, generally strong, creates a character that does not care about one or the other. <br /> <br /> What happened to the old man? I appreciate the fact that he did not get to his level by being "nice", but the change in his character here is just staggering. In the first film, he despises the tactics and attitude of Dick Jone, and yet here he is no better than Jones. It does not mean anything. <br /> <br /> Dr. Faxx is a poor replacement for the charismatic genius, so uncomfortable, resident of OCP Bob Morton. <br /> <br /> The action sequences save the one where Murphy is stuck next to Caine's truck, are tough and mean and push back rather than entertain. <br /> <br /> And finally. What about the score? Do not tell me that Poledouris could not have done it just because he was working on Total Recall at the time. A serial soundtrack (TV or movie) is part of his personality. Part of his character. When you delete that, it hurts the familiarity of the characters we are watching. So, that's bad enough, but shame on Leonard Rosenman. His score here is grim, camp and downright disgusting. <br /> <br /> History has its moments to be right. There is a lot of originality here. But he's trying too much new things to do with a movie. Hob is a well-done villain and the only really nasty "villain" of the movement, congratulations to Gabriel Damon. <br /> <br /> The final confrontation between Robocop and Robocop 2 is also fun. <BR /> <br /> But for the vast majority of its long life, it is a serious disappointment.
