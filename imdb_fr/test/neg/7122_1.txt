For starters, I did not bother to see The Grudge. The glimpses of this film did not startle me, did not scare me and did not entertain me. But when a group of friends asked me to go to The Grudge 2, I accepted the invitation, a little curious to know what this movie was going to be. I went there mostly because of my friends. Not even 5 minutes after the movie started, I realized that I had thrown $ 7.50. The acting game from the start is horrible. At first, schoolgirls seem to have never acted in their life. Then the movie plot takes over. Let me tell you that I could not help but laugh at this whole movie. It's so stupid. I'm sure they tried not to scare. They do not blow anything or anything. He shows the children, then shows them "attacking". It's fine until it's not a "sudden" thing. And even in the middle of the film, the heart of the film, the acting is always horrible. There is so much time left between dialogues that someone can add their own comments. Honestly, this movie is one of the funniest horror movies I've ever seen. Bad writing, horrible acting, terrible scenario, horrible casting "unable to act" and horrible concept. The film goes out and changes situations more than you can count. Each part ends up being played then tied up at the end of the film. I would never pay to see this movie again. I would not even watch it on the cable, for free. This movie is a joke. Please, do not waste your money on this movie!
