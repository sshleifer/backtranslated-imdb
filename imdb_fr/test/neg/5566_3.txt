The actresses are cute and the decors simple, quite suitable. Apart from that, there is nothing to save from this movie. Incredibly bad dialogues, stupid and bloody, a long-awaited plot, a lot of blunders and inconsistencies (for example, a pretty girl gets banged in the head by a morning star!) ... To make short because it's not worth more, even fans of the genre can avoid it.
