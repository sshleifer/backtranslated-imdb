Volcano is located in Los Angeles where a minor earthquake has struck, the boss on vacation of the O.E.M. Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) decides to end his vacation. Once there, he finds that everything is fine. He then goes to the epicenter of the earthquake where seven illegal workers were killed by fire or intense heat of some sort. Mike does not really know what to think, so he uses geologist Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) to explain things. Unfortunately, an enormous underground river of molten lava was released after the earthquake and eruptions at the La Brea Tar wells. the lava pouring into the streets of the city engulfing everything and everything it touches in flames. Mike, his men and the emergency services have their work cut out to try to stop the lava river and save as many lives as possible ... <br /> <br /> Led by Mick Jackson, this movie is the second big budget disaster. It revolved around the idea of ​​a volcano erupting in 1997 with Dante's Peak (1997) released about two months before the arrival of Volcano and although the peak of Dante was not a masterpiece at least he was slightly better and more plausible than Volcano. The script here is totally absurd and is not at all based in reality, underground lava rivers that seem to appear and disappear just as quickly, various characters standing a few inches from a river of lava without being affected by heat (when in the train the metal seats around him start to melt but it stays perfectly fine, as far as I know, the human skin is not as heat resistant as the metal, is it? not?) & it happens constantly, the flying helicopters are ash clouds reality, it would be impossible), a simple blockade at the end of a street will stop the lava that flows (what about the other streets and other directions?), to blow into a perfect trench in a street and then in a huge building standing up to make a huge dyke and when Kelly sees the lava moving towards her car, she goes out like everyone else but for some reason stays there and watches two firefighters being burned to death and waiting for his father to save her even though by that step her leg caught fire, Although all these concrete blocks were joined together to form a barrier in less twenty minutes, they do a remarkable job. No wicks of molten lava are able to infiltrate and are more like the huge building that falls on Tommy Lee and his daughter, so the two go well after. The characters are awful too, although they are not as clichéd as usual and that Tommy Lee & Anne Heche and the officials of Minimal City do not try to silence their romantic relationships. They try to silence Tommy Lee & Anne Heche before the event by calling them scary. There are some badly written and sometimes embarrassing moral moments as Los Angeles gets closer to each other, the black guy and this semi-racist policeman who are warming up and wishing each other in the end to wish each other good luck and this little child in the end when he says: everyone looks the same 'is worthy of the name & is surely a closed-handed attempt & we try to say whatever color we are we are still humans & we we can all hear in times of crisis as it brings people together. That said, I think Volcano is one of those bad films, it's entertaining and moving at a decent pace, but do not expect anything to be based on reality or human drama. <br /> <br /> I suppose a movie like Volcano could be seen as an update of a film about the 1970s disasters such as The Poseidon Adventure (1972) or Earthquake (1974), but with a huge budget with modern effects. Speaking of the effects, they are correct, but none stands out so much and the sets are also surprisingly forgettable, although there are some impressive explosions and some OK lava rivers going through the effects of Los Angeles, but nothing else . In general, Volcano is not very exciting and, although it is occasionally funny and completely ridiculous, it does not really work out as expected. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 90,000,000, he opened a little under $ 15,000,000 at the box office, it looks good and there is a lot of fire but nothing does not stand out & Volcano is a rather forgettable movie as a whole. Filmed in Los Angeles, I think most of the places presented here were shot in their real places. The actors follow the movements with terrible dialogues and ridiculous sets to face, Tommy Lee Jones deserves better than that. <br /> <br /> A volcano is a two-way disaster, it's a thematic movie disaster that ended up a bit of a disaster itself. It's worth it for some unintentional laughs and the ridiculousness of it all but it's nothing great and I doubt I'll ever see it again.
