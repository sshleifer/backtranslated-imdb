Being a government bureaucrat may not be the most prestigious way to make a living, but it's still a way to make a living. However, after watching this film, one may come to believe that every government official is a lazy, bloated, conceited paper pusher who lives exclusively to take part in his next lunch break. It's not really a pretty picture, but it's the one the audience has to endure when they look at what is just another tedious, noisy and overworked action movie. Exactly what the doctor prescribed ... no? How many more Hollywood movies has he made? Thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these movies is so messed up that it should now be completely unrecognizable. Locations change but plots remain the same, and with the same shallow character development and shallow players acting as trained performers are asked to turn into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. . This film seemed to run endlessly. "When will this film end?" I repeated myself several times. Leonardo DiCaprio was totally incredible as a CIA agent, but what must be one of the big blunders of misinterpretation, Russell Crowe's overweight plays the role of a CIA bureaucrat. Please note that in this movie, the on-site agent is "skinny and mean" while his office supervisor is fat. This is called stereotyping. What was the casting director thinking? Why not have Jack Nicholson play an overweight office worker? Or Nicole Kidman play a frumpy department store salesperson? And the story was so fantastic that no literary license could give him credibility. An obviously non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) trying to pretend to be an Arabic ... fluent in Arabic ... concocting all sorts of brain schemes doomed to failure ... trying to think and outfox real Arabs who do not let themselves be taken aback by its derisory Arab masquerade ... trying to seduce a Palestinian woman while she is conducting a mission of espionage extremely sensitive and complex ... etc. You now understand the meaning. Next time, try to embody an Arab in the role. Even the most naive moviegoer can not believe it all. There should be an approximate balance between the protagonist and the antagonist. In this film, the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that he leaves the story in disorder. Next step for this movie - DVD Land and Oubli. And another thing. Do not let this film discourage you from working for the government. The salary may not be very good, but the marginal benefits are excellent, an essential fact that this film conveniently omits.
