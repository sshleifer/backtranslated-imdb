Oh darling, darling! What were they thinking? Terrific scenario, terrible acting game. I do not even feel sorry for the actors ... they took their checks to the bank and smiled happily. <br /> <br /> Since when did a Charing Cross air shaft appear at the Bank? Why do vehicles passing through Tower Bridge head towards the city when the thrust goes? Why is not Tower Bridge congested when the city is evacuated? How does Carlyle dive into a raging torrent ... and survive? I could go on ... and on. <br /> <br /> There is no real sense of urgency in the command room. They could just as easily wait for England eleven to return to the field after the tea break at Lords. <br /> <br /> That says something when I wait for the announcements to know more about the treatment of the diarrhea with impatience. <br /> <br /> A trash bin totally abominable!
