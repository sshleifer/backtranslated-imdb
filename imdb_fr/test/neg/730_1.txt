It's an absolutely horrible excuse for a show. People say his mind and his intelligence? I do not see how? Maybe because the characters use whimsical words? Maybe because they are snooty, use dry humor and have two-dimensional personalities. I went to a school in the Ivy league and no one acted as odiously as those characters. In fact, if I had met someone like them, I would probably have strangled them! Men act as little pre-teenagers emotional and all the characters of the minority are based on stereotypes ... The characters are not at all authentic. In simple terms, they look like a caravan family that tries to be rich and sophisticated. This show is just another cookie cut that viewers at the dead prime time eat regularly.
