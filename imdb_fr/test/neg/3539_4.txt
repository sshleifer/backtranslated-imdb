A film "Wes Craven presents" of 1995, directed by Joe Clayton and interpreted by Lance Henriksen. A group of scientists rescues a dying man he discovers near his isolated government position in the desert by injecting him with his experimental virus. Of course, one of his colleagues sinks and the virus turns man into a monster almost impossible to stop, trapped inside. Lance Henriksen plays the morally offended researcher who leaves the project before all that, but comes back after receiving a call for help to save man (mutation of the pre-unstoppable death machine). <br /> <br /> Deciding to combine two trips, he takes his family with him (they then go on vacation) and decides to give them access to the ultra-secret government facilities, placing them in the middle of the chaos that reigns inside. In case you do not know it, it will rely on the viewer to work a little on it and put aside some petty details (see: major and blatant). <br /> <br /> Overall, you can be watched gently. pieces of pleasure. Note: The outpost is generally known as 'Mind Ripper'
