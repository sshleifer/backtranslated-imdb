This first film by director Bob Clark ("Porky's", "Black Christmas", "A Christmas Story") did not really inflate my nads as I expected. In fact, it still annoyed me. This is a theater troupe that goes to a funeral island, composed of dead criminals, where it plans to reveal evil forces and resurrect corpses ... The leader of their group, enthusiastic and homosexual enthusiast , tries to summon the help of Satan for the resuscitation of a body exhumed, who fails to take the corpse to the neighbor guard and sorry and that he plays with him ... Nothing interesting happens before the last fifteen minutes, when the undead finally leave their graves and go after the profaner. The effects of makeup are acceptable, the gore is VERY minimal (PG ranking) and the extremely irritating characters are focused on many, which really pissed me off. I guess having a group of terrible actors bickering for an hour was supposed to amount to a "comic" status, but I found no sense of humor in any way. The concept as a whole is simply ridiculous: how are these children ready to dig up and toss with a corpse as long as they did. The characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just boring ... Do not waste your time with that ...
