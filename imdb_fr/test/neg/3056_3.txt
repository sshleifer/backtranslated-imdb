It's hard to decide if this movie has a shitty dialogue or if it's just made to look like crappy actors. In any case, he suffers from a mediocre writing at best. <br /> <br /> Although made in the late 80s, the first part of the film unfolds as a comedy game balls teenage 60s (except in the absence of real humor). ), especially the part of the "good girl", which is as boring as you can hope / fear for Doris Day, including the slightly moaning opposition to all that is "fun" that her friends want to make. The net effect is that after a while, you start to hope that she chews so you do not listen to her voice. <br /> <br /> A free desecration and nudity, as well as fashionable clothes from the 80s is your only clue that this film was made in the 80s. Oh, and passable music, too. <br /> <br /> History to speak, it's a good formula. A group of excited teens (apart, of course, from "miss nice girl") decide to celebrate Halloween night by hosting a party in a haunted house. Feasting and fornication ensue, accompanied by an unwise "session" that triggers the frenzy of demonic possession that is the subject of the film. After that, the only suspensive element will be trying to guess in what order the characters will expire. You are sure you do not want them to do it or not. The actors are so bad that becoming demons / zombies / dinners improves their performance, and the ridiculously cliche dialogue is so annoying that you squirm in your place. <br /> <br /> Gorewise, this movie is not crazy. special, unless you think the cheese is a little 'special'. For example, the demon's head that appears sometimes is so simulated that you wonder if it's a five-year sleight of hand. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that there is nothing nice in the film. Part of the music is not half bad, and the first of our tasteless Scooby band to be possessed performs a wonderful and really sexy dance routine at one point, before it gets nasty. <br /> <br /> I do not know why, at the very end of the film, I managed to get involved a little. The suspense that was missing in most of the film was late and I began to squirm with worry rather than annoyance. That's what a horror movie is supposed to do. <br /> <br /> It is for this reason that I can not bring myself to give this film a disproportionate note, since an unexplainable miracle (I do not exclude the possession demons) I was in fact a little scared. <br /> <br /> Do not pay money to see it, though. This is not worth your time, but only hard money. Watch it on YouTube while it's there.
