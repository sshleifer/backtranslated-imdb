"The Cave" was released more or less simultaneously with the English film "The Descent" directed by Neil Marshall. Both films share a similar principle; only "The Cave" is terribly unoriginal, unimpressive and incompetent compared to the magnificent horror adventure "The Descent". One gets the impression that Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too mediocre and instantly added ingenious ideas, depth and a personalized style, while the director of "The Cave", Bruce Hunt, was content with the most rudimentary development of the scenario that was projected on his desk. . The result is an incredibly mediocre film that presents every cliché of horror you can think of and in which most violence occurs off-screen. And we hate it all, do not we? The story presents a clique of unbearable cave divers who find themselves trapped in an underground ecosystem completely unknown to Romania. Ugly winged creatures, who are also parasites, attack them quickly and a flight seems impossible due to a landslide. The first half hour is still moderately fun if you look at all the clichés and listen to the dialogs of the cheese manuals, but the whole thing becomes too dramatic. None of the events is even slightly plausible and it seems that all the players are competing to offer the worst performance. I have already seen better special effects in anonymous B movies, shooting locations are not used to the maximum and the end is downright nil! Many not recommended!
