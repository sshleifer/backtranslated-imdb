This film may be a real failure if you do not understand the circumstances in which it was shot. Marxes were chosen to appear in the film version of a play that was not originally written for them. They are sort of integrated into the roles. Ironically, it might have been more fun to have used different actors who did not have such expectations. Instead, he was forever included in a canon he really does not deserve to belong to.
