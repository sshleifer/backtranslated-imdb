Caricature of the 1940s, forbidden today probably because of the gag 'Black Beauty', in which Daffy rides a black as if it were a horse. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place in a bookstore, where the characters of the books come alive every night. So we have, among others, the ugly duck (Daffy) and the Wallstreet wolf. They end up running after the wolf has duped Daffy with a dummy duck (hence his title). <br /> <br /> And hunting is all there is in this little cartoon that has no attraction today. Only fun if you're a real Looney Tunes fan, I guess ... <br /> <br /> 4/10.
