Some movies are so badly made that they can only be viewed for the crunch factor. The disciples made me back so much that it was uncomfortable. I watched everything incredulously, looking at what I was looking at. Did not someone know how bad it was during filming? Mix the most hammered performances of the most wooded actors, an abyssal scenario where all the comments of all the "actors" seemed to come from the same character and the most hurried editing that tried (and failed) to give the film a rhythm . All these elements together in a film that will deprive you of a few hours of your life and will not bring you anything. Avoid at all costs.
