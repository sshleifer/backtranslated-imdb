This movie is highly recommended, but I do not know why. I'm not really a fan of Adam Sandler, except in 50 First Dates where he gets away from his usual anger routine. Damon Wayans is a policeman under cover and Adam Sandler is the guy with whom he claimed to be friends for a year to break him. Naturally, Sandler is rather angry at this betrayal. Angry screaming cries and silly facials of the king of variety. They eventually run and, of course, they become friends again after a big misunderstanding (Sandler pulling Wayans to the head - he survives and he is bulletproof). Do I need to go? You will know what will happen if you look at it anyway. When our DVD player kept pausing (hey it was $ 80 from the supermarket, okay?), It was commented that the player knew that the movie was boring and refused to play it.
