I have to say that I saw some of the worst originals in the Sci Fi chain, but this Nu Image shonker by Yossi Wein was still quite difficult. The big problem is that it's just not convincing, not just by its creature, but by acting, writing, and any attempt at drama. The management lacks flair and the screenplay of Boaz Davidson and Danny Lerner never really works, predictably, often laughably, while it screams less than many of these films, it never offers anything to engage or give away. 'impulse. The actors do their best, but with such material, their efforts have little effect. Matthew Reilly Burke is a doubly observable hero, Meredith Morton similar to a doubly watchable love affair. In fact, she was a little less convincing but at least she was sweet to the eyes. The film has at least the dignity to ride at a reasonable pace, but its biggest advantage is that the octopus is not fully rendered in CGI. So, even if it does not look good, there are at least some legitimate scenes of characters struggling with rubbery tentacles in a fun way. I also laugh at the disparities between the different representations of the octopus, the plans of the creature as a whole vary during the film, they differ not only in their size but also their appearance compared to the practical plans, and scenes where the Tentacle action suggests that the manufacturers had abandoned the pretense of making a film about an octopus and had simply imagined their creature as a group of various tentacles. The scenes of the creature attacking people are getting old rather quickly, but there are some funny scenes where he takes other objects, such as a boat and a crane. Yes, these scenes are mediocre, but they made me laugh. The undisputed highlight is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes a cue in New York. The scene may not last more than a minute, but it is really inspired and deserves a visit on youtube. Apart from that, things are not thoroughly inspired (a lack of gore or badness at the PG level prevents even this one from shooting a lot in the bad weather), the film eventually turns into disaster movie territory almost catching in the end, but I can not really give it credit, because the best shots of the last scenes were taken from the movie Stallone Daylight (which, to my recollection, is pretty good). Overall, this was a rather dilapidated situation and I would not really recommend it to anyone except the creature's characteristic. Better than a glance in the eyes with a wet stick, but not much.
