I can not believe that I let myself rent this trash! The comedy was so poor that my grandmother could have done better. The punches thrown into the movies were far from the character the scarecrow was hitting on the ground. The film has become a chore to watch! <br /> <br /> So this group of baseball players decides to play the onlookers, even if they are not supposed to do it in the form of a coach. So, of course, they go there anyway. They decide to tie a loser to a post with the so-called "Scarecrow". When the best friend of the loser discovers it, he and his friend will rescue him. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the kid has diabetes and is hospitalized. The jocks then head for the beach. day. The scarecrow finds them and kills them all pretty well. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you do not care. Anyway, the scarecrow ends up having a connection with "Diabetes Boy" and the boy begins to complete the scarecrow work once the scarecrow is killed. Yes, it's really very cheesy. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was full of bulls *. Sooner or later, the only ones to live (naturally) are the boyfriend and girlfriend who are the main characters :) The evil is then transferred to the boyfriend and he kills himself to break the spell, so no one else be hurt. Touch hey? No, do not waste your hard-earned money, I give it the lowest note, otherwise it does not even deserve that much.
