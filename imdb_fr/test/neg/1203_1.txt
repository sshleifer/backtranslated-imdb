I remember seeing him for the first time in the 80s as a teenager. Dude, I read the reviews on this basket and I find myself surprised by the vote. This film does not deserve four stars !!! This film is not better than Topgun. Topgun has its own problems; do not mistake yourself. This film should be banned just for its own stupidity. So many stereotypes, so many loop holes, LOT of bad dialogue. I can not think of a redemptive quality of this vomit. It's not action / adventure. It's a bad joke on the movie. A bit like looking at Plan 9 with F-16 stock images. This film not only defies logic and common sense in the context of a military context, but sends a disturbing message. The military will not save your father from the imminent evil of the Middle East b ***** ds. So go out there and hijack a multi-million dollar weapon and extract it from the sinister claws of the backward, anti-American Arabs. Because you can not reason with these animals. It's a Bruckheimer film without a budget. Bland direction, weak game, lame music, silly plot, even ... Iron Eagle.
