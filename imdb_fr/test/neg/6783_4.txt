I watched this film with a group of friends at the Melbourne International Film Festival in 1999 and nobody really knew how to say it. <br /> <br /> I love bluegrass and country music, so it's not like I'm unfriendly to the subject. But the problem is that basically it's a very conservative movie - a little more than a filmed story of Mills and Boon. A defender of corsages of the simplest and most devious kind. <br /> <br /> It's not just the love story in her heart, between Reece and Dr. Lily Penleric is more than incredible. (Why would a man be attracted to Lily, the man devouring his nostrils, he surpasses me, and frankly, Mike Harding like Reece seems to just go through the movements). <br /> <br /> It's just that the whole movie is too tame and well-bred for its own good. There is little precious danger, dirt or drama. Of course, there's a moment of excitement involving a school run by Lily's younger sister, but this entire episode is funnier than dramatic (it's so poorly written and misunderstood). And the film betrays its conservative agenda of how this subplot is resolved. <br /> <br /> As for the good old Reece Kinkaid (what's going on with a name like Eberneezer Bumpass?), I'm asking you! Is the end of this film credible? In agreement with the character that this film had built before? I do not think so...
