I swear I did not want to! I chose it only because it looked good on the back! This movie was not scary at all and was actually very confusing. The demon wind has only been used a few times and people have been killed quite happily. Sherri Bendorf of Slaughterhouse played a leading role. Seeing what happened to her, however, I decided for this little turkey movie. A 3 out of 10. NEXT!
