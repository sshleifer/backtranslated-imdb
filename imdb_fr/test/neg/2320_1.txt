For some reason, my father-in-law gave me a copy of this tape. I think my great-uncle, Buddy Baer, ​​was the giant of this film and my father-in-law thought I would like to see him. I had, years ago, and I did not like that either. <br /> <br /> My son, then two years old, looked at him and became hooked. Every minute, in front of the television, this horrible video was broadcast. I went to work with the iniquitous songs that remained in my mind. The two "tracks" were worse than a junior stadium review. The dancers looked like a rejection of a horror movie by Ed Wood and Abbot and Costello called their roles. Fortunately, I was able to distract my son long enough to lose this videotape. Frankly, I think it's the tape of "The Ring". <br /> <br /> To correct another criticism, Buddy Baer is Jethro's UNCLE (Max Baer, ​​Jr) and not his father. 0 out of 10
