OK, I recently collected many vipco and hardgore titles on DVD and I must say that this one is one of the most disappointing. A newer movie compared to the other titles in the Hardgore catalog was a direct DVD version. I have always been interested in the myth of El Chokeberry since I saw a documentary about it when I was a teenager. However, this film is a terribly disappointing film, but the script and the acting are terrible. It took me three times to watch this film from start to finish. While the cheap horror movies of the '80s and' 90s are good because of their cheap budgets and comedy, this film is not. <br /> <br /> Check out other titles from the Hardgore series first. Boneyard, for example, is older but much better.
