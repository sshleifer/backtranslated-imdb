Scary Movie 1-4, Epic Movie, Movie Date, Meet the Spartans, Not another teen movie or another gay movie. Make "Superhero Movie" the eleventh in a series that has ruined the parody genre to perfection. Now, I'm going to admit that I have a soft spot for classics like Airplane and The Naked Gun, but you know you've stalked a franchise so badly when you can see gags for miles. In fact, the only thing that could really make you go to see this disaster is the incredible sale, Leslie Neilson. <br /> <br /> You can see that he needs this money, that he needs the money or that he intends to go down with the ship as a good captain would do. In no case does he give up that kind but he does not help it. But if I'm sorry for anyone in this movie, his decent actor, Drake Bell, is enormously embarrassed. The people who suffer the most torture from afar are however the public forced to sit for 90 minutes with a bile without laughing that is not funnier than herpes. <br /> <br /> After spoofing disaster movies in Airplane!, the police show in The Naked Gun, and the Hollywood horrors in Scary Movie 3 and 4, producer David Zucker is interested in the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy that explodes everything from Spider-Man to X-Men and Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Shortly after being bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly, Rick Riker (Drake Bell), a high school student, begins to experience a startling transformation. Now, Rick's skin is as strong as steel and he has the strength of ten men. Determined to use his new powers to fight crime, Rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of The Dragonfly - a fearless crime fighter who is dedicated to protecting the street for law-abiding citizens. <br /> <br /> But each The superhero needs some trouble. After being caught off guard by a terribly catastrophic experience, Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) develops the power to pull the life force of everyone he meets and becomes the evil Hourglass. Anxious to achieve immortality, the Hourglass tries to gather as much force as possible when the noble dragonfly strives to defeat its sworn enemy and realize its destiny as a true hero. Craig Mazin writes and performs this spoof at low altitude. <br /> <br /> featuring Tracy Morgan, Pamela Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Jeffrey Tambor and Regina Hall. <br /> <br /> Hell Superhero Movie may deserve some merit in the fact that it's much better than Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie. But with great responsibility comes one of the worst outings from 2008 to date. No laughing but a little less irritating than Meet the Spartans. And in the same sense, much more forgettable than meeting the Spartans. But that may be a good reason. Some of us are still trying to erase from our memory the spot that had been meeting the Spartans. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid unless you are one of those who like this kind of cinema. As bad as Date Movie and Scary Movie 2 but not as bad as Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie. Super evil.
