This movie was on the Lifetime Movie Network last month and I decided to check it out. I watched for the first 20 minutes, then I closed it b / c. I'm sorry, but the holes in the plot that are an integral part of a movie's plot just make the movie garbage. <br /> <br /> The film is about a woman who accidentally runs a child on a bike on the road, goes to get help, comes back only to find out that it's called a hit and run that there is a hunt for the "monster" that wounded her (at the end killed). <br /> <br /> This is a movie about a woman in a thriving neighborhood that has 2 little schoolgirls and is an active and sociable woman and yet, for this film to work, it must be credible that she does so do not own a cell phone. Sorry, but it's complete BS especially when everyone seems to have one - they used theirs to call 911 when they found the girl lying on the side of the road - when our main wife left the scene of crime to pass the 911 to another place payphone. When the leading woman comes back, the ambulance is already at the girl's side and we are talking about how horrible the person who struck and abandoned her is. <br /> <br /> Just DUMB. Sorry but I'm not ready to understand that this woman does not have a mobile phone essential to the operation of the film. Please do not insult my movie intelligence, thanks. Maybe if it happened in 1970 or 1960, I would buy it but it is clearly a film of today (1999 at the time). ..but wait, if she had a cell phone, there would be no movie. Pfft. <br /> <br /> The woman is clearly aware of the technology, because she had computers at home, games on which the children played, so the film only killed her mobile phone in the car so making his hotel another way to call the cops .. leaving a cell phone just creating a ridiculous plot.
