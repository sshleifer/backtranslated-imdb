What can I say? It was by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life (and believe me, some of my favorite movies are certainly horrible). The acting was amateur, the sets were boring, and the camera was poor and sophisticated. All this film seemed to be a final project of a college. I had to continue to convince myself that it was done by a teenager to make it look a little good. The most troubling factor of the "movie" is that it's not even a movie at all - it's filmed. It was extremely distracting. In addition to all this, the dialogue is simply disastrous and the plot is so fundamental that it hurts me. Not to mention they steal at least four other horror movies in the first 20 minutes or so. If the number of stars was zero, the film would understand it. <br /> <br /> The only thing that scares you in this film is how bad it is.
