This film is bad !! Looks like they just chose to set scenes together at random. Good gore, but little plot. Sally moans and complains about everything until she becomes a demon. I thought she had PMS. It seemed to be the case. The dubbing in this film is horrible. A scene where the woman spoke and a few seconds before we heard her. I knew at the time that my suspicions were based on the fact that it did not come from the United States. I tried to follow but I got lost at about halfway through and had a hard time believing it, even for a horror movie. Some good characters, but not many. No need to waste time.
