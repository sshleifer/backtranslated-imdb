Watching this movie today, I felt it was about 10 to 15 minutes from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides on this trading post / saloon in the middle of nowhere to meet the owner about some flights. All he sees are the signs of a massacre, corpses, signs of fighting and no one is alive. This is because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the one you find in the old mysteries of English murder. <br /> <br /> The reason you find these hidden pieces in this kind of stories is that they were once priests' holes. Catholic families attached to the old religion in the 16th century in England built these things to hide those who were on the run from the royal authorities because of their faith. It's not something we see in westerns, but a good gadget. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, because of bad editing or bad writing, we never know exactly what brought Wayne to this place. But it was a type B western and not even that good. <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes is in the loop. He is clean shaven and plays a mute part of time. An unusual circumstance for Gabby, the boy. <br /> <br /> If you want to disturb and know what is happening and see a Gabby Hayes without whiskers, watch this movie.
