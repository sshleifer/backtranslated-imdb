It's one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The problem is that he does not know if he wants to be a smart political movie, an "artist" or an erotic exercise. As a result, this fails on all levels. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious, the narrative disappointing and the supposed useless symbolism. <br /> <br /> Klaus Kinski is probably the best thing about this movie but it's not a good thing. Of course, he has an intense and "unique" look, but in the end, he can not act. Just watch how he reacts when his mistress leaves .... <br /> <br /> Do not really watch this movie, some say it is necessary to watch several times. One is enough.
