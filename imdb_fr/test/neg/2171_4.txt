Elderbush Gilch was a big disappointment for me. I had heard how important and important it was. It just did not hit me. There was a low-key story, plus some idiotic and sadistic Indian characters who are terribly offensive to today's standards. While most D.W. Griffith movies have depth and intelligence, this one looks more like a program picture fucked by a formula. <br /> <br /> I loved to see Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh in roles before Birth of a Nation, as well as some of the staging of the battle scenes were pretty good. According to Griffith's future cameraman, Karl Brown, the audience sat on his seats and applauded when the cavalry arrived at the end. I did not feel anything. And believe me, I'm looking at Griffith's early work at Biograph. This film is not what it was. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is that, despite all its faults, it has many attractions of Griffith. It manages its main actors quite well, as well as the scene where the Indians encircle the cabin, which is reminiscent of the climax of Birth of a Nation, a much higher film that would send a shock wave across America a little more than 'one year later.
