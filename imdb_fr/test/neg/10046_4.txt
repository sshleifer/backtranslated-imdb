This is one of those strange, very important and complacent films that are trying too hard to be deep. It's not. Instead, he launches clichés that try to pass for Profoundness. Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to the protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how the man starts his life breastfeeding, then breastfeeds his girlfriend's breast and finally to his wife, thus concluding that his life is zero. . So deep. We are dealing with a variety of characters who offer their point of view on life, the universe, etc. during Adam's travels on foot in the Mojave Desert. (He suddenly leaves LA on his wedding day and his family, friends, and fiancé assume that he died when his car was found in a rocket-crammed beach of military trials.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best is by far an escapee from a psychiatric hospital who speaks only through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, produces great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye and several characters from the original Star Trek. But once the interesting characters have left the screen, we are once again stuck with Adam and his quest for the deep. It is a long journey that lags in many places. In fact, it's the longest one-and-a-half-hour movie I've ever seen. And the final is hardly worth it. <br /> <br /> I discovered this movie one day on HBO by getting up too early and clicking on the television. That will teach me. Next time, I'll try harder to sleep.
