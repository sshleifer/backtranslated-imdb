This film was lacking in many areas. This is the type of Elvis type who races and is approached by these BIKERS SATANS ANGELS. One of them is called Banjo and they beat schoolboys to have fun. They want the Elvis guy to be their "driver". Sometimes I wanted people from MSTK3000 to be quiet because the movie was actually pretty good. Of course, there was violence and a lot of cheese phrases, such as "What kind of beer do you want? It was cheesy. The guy playing Banjo is an excellent boxer and I was happy to see him play some fighting scenes. In addition, the biker named FATS had a jacket NAZI SWASTIKA on his jacket! It was pretty daring if I have to say it myself.
