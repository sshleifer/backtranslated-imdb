One of the scariest movies I've ever seen was Carrie (the first!). Now, as in other movies, they've totally ruined Carrie's franchise with The Rage: Carrie 2. From the beginning, the film has been moving forward like a geriatric in a van. There is virtually no fear and this movie is bursting with all the different high school stereotypes (ie, football jock, cheerleading cheer leader, followers and of course black dressed nail polish). Another sad thing about this show is that you know what will happen when you see the opening credits. Of course, of course, the girl is humiliated and turn into a crazy psychic murderer ... yawn ... <br /> <br /> You went there. It is done. <br /> <br /> Even the actors seem to have been forced to make this film. Emily Bergl is as scary as a cabbage doll while Jack London ... Let's just say I did not pay to see wood. Apart from the actors, the flasbacks serve more to irritate than to make the link with the first film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you can send objects like Carrie, then out of love for God this theater ......
