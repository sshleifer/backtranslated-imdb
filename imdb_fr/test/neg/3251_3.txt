I usually give the suites the benefit of the doubt and go slowly. But it's very poor. The same thing that happened in the first film is repeated here. The same thing. They only wanted the younger ones to see it (this explains the repeated presence of Bugs Bunny but the reason they added a "f * ck" is beyond me). <br /> <br /> They did not even bother changing Jackie Mason's character from Dangerfield's character. Let me explain, in CADDYSHACK, Rodney Dangerfield played the role of a boorish real estate owner who enraged the stranded members of the Bushwood Country Club. In this film, Jackie Mason plays the role of a tough real estate owner who outrages troubled Bushwood Country Club members. A big effort was made to change the content of the script eh? No, I do not think so. Dan Aykroyd, a very funny character, shamefully copies Bill Murray's character. He even attacks the gopher (now more like a Gremlin) in much the same way as Murray. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to laugh about. An excerpt from the "comedy" of this film: Jackie Mason is getting ready for a date with Dyan Cannon. He is in the bathroom is his dress. He goes to the door to get dressed in his room when the door handle breaks. Sensational!?! It's the best they can do. Eight years thinking of a brand new suite and that's all we have!?! I could have made a better scenario of my ass. <br /> <br /> See it only if you're an unconditional fan of the original. This is the only way to find any type of laugh in it. All others avoid.
