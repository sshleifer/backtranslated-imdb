Why would Burt Lancaster allow himself to play a poor schnook that is finally undermined by the femme fatale Anna Dundee, played by Yvonne DeCarlo in 'Criss Cross'? The same reason why Robert Mitchum allows himself to pass for another loser who cracks for a femme fatale, Faith Domergue, in the 1950 film noir, "Where Danger Lives". Maybe they both thought it was a good way to show that they had a "reach" as actors - that playing against, the usual role of "tough guy" for which they were would improve their image as actors who can play any role. . But the problem was that roles like Steve Thompson, the tiny swagger in love with Criss Cross, did nothing to improve Lancaster's career. Not only is Lancaster completely mistaken in Thompson's unique role, but there is something fundamentally inconceivable (and I can say pathetic) about the protagonist of the film. <br /> <br /> "Criss Cross" is an endlessly slow film. Among the many useless scenes of the film is at the beginning: the flashback that tells the confrontation of Thompson with Dan Duryea's Dundee at the disco. Everything that happens in this initial flashback is explained later in the picture: the illicit relationship between Steve and Anna, the tense relationship between Steve and Martinez, the policeman, and his coolness with Dundee. If the director Siodmark felt obliged to start the film with a turn back, why not keep it less than three minutes? I think it would have been more effective. <br /> <br /> In "Criss Cross", the protagonist takes a while to get involved and get out of the "ordinary" world of Act One. This is the scene where he "meets" and "meets" Anna at the disco. And notice how Siodmak spends so much time commuting between Anna dancing and Steve watching her, too. Spends a lot of time focusing on Esy Morales and his Rhumba band rather than pushing the story forward. <br /> <br /> Until the Act Two crisis, the story continues with Thompson, who encounters various difficult moments with Anna, then in the middle of act 2, he learns that Anna has escaped and got married in Dundee. It is becoming increasingly clear that one of the main weaknesses of the movie is that Dundee is never on the screen. There are no confrontations between Thompson and Dundee during this time and we are left with rather uninviting machinations between the two lovebirds. In fact (and Anna "explains" this later to Steve), the reason she left was not only because he disappeared for eight months, but she also felt pressure from the Steve's mother, as well as direct threats from police officer Martinez, who hinted that he would ensure that she would meet at the Women's Detention Center. Anna comes back to Steve because she realizes she made a big mistake with Dundee. It turns out that he beat her and she is now afraid of him. <br /> <br /> One of the stupid refrains uttered by more than one character in Criss Cross is that you can never hijack an armored car. But everyone is so surprised when Steve points out that it can be done if it's "internal work"! You would have thought that Dundee would have heard about Steve's "job" as an armored car driver and would have offered him in advance. But of course, Steve has to make the proposal so that Dundee does not kill him after discovering his affair with Anna (if they are so afraid of being caught, why Steve and Anna meet at his apartment where Dundee can to find so easily?) I really got a kick from Finchley (played by Alan Napier), the "brain" of the operation. Dundee is so stupid that he has to hire that alcoholic guy from a former teacher who tracks the holdup on a map. Oh, buy the ingredients needed to build the gas bombs used during the flight and of course, Finchley is good at that too! <br /> <br /> The only really successful scene of all the movie is the armored car flight. The editing was pretty good as it described the nascent action of a hold-up that went wrong. As the gas bombs explode, the gang's brutality is highlighted when Dundee murders the innocent armored guard. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is as long as the rest of the film. Why did it take so long for one of Dundee's henchmen to kidnap Thompson? There's this nurse, then the moron is waiting outside, then he comes in and claims he's a friend, Steve goes to sleep and finally, after he wakes up, the moron takes him away. <br /> <br /> When Steve finally meets Anna at home, we wonder how Anna got her hands on the money. Did she steal that from Dundee after the holdup when he went out for dinner? It's never explained. Worse still, Anna suddenly becomes the diabolical femme fatale. Previously, his selfishness and his attraction to Dundee was explained by his perceived rejection at the hands of the threats of Steve and Martinez. But after returning to Steve's home because she fears Dundee, she turns inexplicably towards him when he is most vulnerable. Just as there is "instant coffee", you have an "instant femme fatale". <br /> <br /> In "Black Film" an encyclopedic reference to the American style "of Silver and Ward, the authors salute" Criss de Cross' as "one of the most tragic and convincing films of the black I do not agree: to have a tragedy, you need very deep characters and, to be convincing, a plausible story Criss Cross has neither one nor the other. is an overrated "film B" that has somehow become part of the pantheon of black art houses.Once again, the herd mentality has triumphed by evaluating the images of yesteryear.
