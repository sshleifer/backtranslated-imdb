Heart of Darkness was terrible. The novel was quite difficult to understand, but when a production company decides to release a film about this film, then everyone has fun. Not only did the officials decide to change some characters and completely eliminate others, but the acting was awful and the overall impression I got from the movie was that it was a complete failure. I watched the film in the hope of understanding the novel a little better, but it completely threw me and my classmates. I think the movie was a waste of time, and I was disappointed to see Tim Roth in such a disappointing film, especially when he has some great movies like Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs under his belt. Same thing with the very cool John Malkovich.
