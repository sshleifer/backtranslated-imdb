Watched this movie with an audience of .... 5 in total! I had the choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ... (understood when I should have left for Lakshya). A typical plot ... India v Pakistan ... but it's not cricket, you have Kashmir in the center. An Indian superhero leaves on a mission to rescue the Indian president of Pakistani rebels involved in mass drug trafficking. I left the movie halfway because it was just boring and the plot was confusing and ubiquitous. The songs were so horrible, the movie tries to hide the flaws with its special effects but unfortunately, they are also obsolete. <br /> <br /> Overall ... avoid it if you can, it must be the worst movie I've seen this year.
