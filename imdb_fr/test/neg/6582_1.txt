I know most critics say this movie was great, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a good book! It was actually one of my favorites when I was little. But it's just not meant for theaters. Maybe for a little half an hour, but I do not see how they could turn a little children's book into a feature film. <br /> <br /> It's a cute movie, but I would not recommend it for really little kids. Older children will not be interested. Adults may have a little more interest if they watch it with their youngest ones. But anyone 7 years and older will have a snoring festival. <br /> <br /> Sorry if you disagree with me, but that's my opinion. :)
