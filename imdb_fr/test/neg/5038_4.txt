Not only is The Great Rock N Roll Swindle completely inaccurate, but when it is necessary, there is not much interesting about it that is interesting or even entertaining. Malcolm McLaren reportedly wasted most of the Sex Pistols' earnings on this waste of film, making it even more heinous. The intention, from the beginning, was to create a monument to the "genius" of McLaren, who to this day prides itself on creating punk music, creating the Sex Pistols and even sometimes writing all the songs. Viewers follow McLaren in different contexts, where he tells his story to his sidekick, a dwarf, and simply takes credit from one thing to another. In a particularly irritating scene, McLaren is in an abandoned aircraft hangar, waiting for a plane, being tracked by reporters and telling them their "big story". The most fun elements of the film are the animated shorts. However, even these feel the paramount importance of McLaren. <br /> <br /> Even as a joke, this movie does not work. Not much is entertaining except for Steve Jones, who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo-detective type person. Twenty years later, Julien Temple, who wrote and directed this film, also directed the documentary Sex Pistols "The Filth and the Fury". Although this film is much better and more interesting than "Swindle", it is still full of Temple's "artistic flourishes" that simply do not work, like interviewing members of the group in the shadows, as if they were some kind of crime witness trying to hide their identity. An interesting detail: the film critic Roger Ebert was one of the writers of the movie "Who Killed Bambi?", Which eventually became "Swindle".
