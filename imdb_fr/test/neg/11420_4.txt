There are rumors that a fourth underground world is going to happen. If this is the case, the third part, which is also a precedent, would be at the center of the franchise. With the prequels that follow the original movies, you always wonder in which order to watch the movies, so that it makes sense ... <br /> <br /> In this case, I guess it does not matter . The third film Underworld is not up to the other two. They also had their obvious flaws, but this one lacks a few elements and it gives the impression of making money. It looks like it's not going at all, which is a shame, because the actors could have used better work equipment. <br /> <br /> The story is acceptable but it is nothing special. A good movie, but Rhona Mitra could not fill Beckinsale's shoes (yes she plays another character, I mean the empty, that Kate B. left) ...
