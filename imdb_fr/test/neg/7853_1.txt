I do not see how those who read the mysteries of Mr. Didius Falco could make fun of them. An Australian does not have business in ancient Rome. In this film, there is nothing in the books, apart from the set and characters, and they are wasted in a pretty thin plot to read the silly storyline. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have a lot of fun showing their names in the credits.
