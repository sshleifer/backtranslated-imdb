When I decided to try to watch a movie about cryogenic zombies ("cryonoids"), I was not expecting much. That's exactly what I have, let alone. In addition to a shortage of special effects (squibs?) And a cruel lack of talent as a comedian, "The Chilling" also presents the worst scenario I have ever seen and turned into a movie. I had to stop the tape several times in the first 45 minutes to repair the damage to my intelligence from witnessing a dialogue as atrocious as the one found here. <br /> <br /> In addition, the collection of characters is so a formula and one-dimensional is ridiculous: the corrupted doctor; his assistant, interpreted by Linda Blair (we know that she is his "assistant" because he refers to it several times under this title); the recently widowed businessman with a heart of gold who develops a romantic interest with the character of Blair; his criminal son; the alcoholic, abusive and unemployed boyfriend of Blair's character, to whom we are presented with the most artificial use of flashback; and, of course, the tough, tough and bearded security guard who becomes the hero. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the preservation fluid used by some cryogenics labs on his body is highly conductive, which naturally causes a disaster when the lab's containers are found outside in a sequence of events remarkable during a storm (Halloween night, nothing less). As for the zombies themselves, if you like to watch people wearing a green latex mask in aluminum suit, then "The Chilling" is for you. The zombie action is very weak at its best; The main method of killing zombies seems to be grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them to death. The businessman and security guard engage in most zombie fighting, including a highly suspensive scene of refreezing the undead with liquid nitrogen. Let me tell you that the steelworks scene in "T2" has nothing to do with "The Chilling" in describing an enemy frozen in its tracks like that. <br /> <br /> How Linda Blair got stuck in the middle of this dreck is indeed a mystery. Certainly, his career did not explode (unfortunately) in the 80s, but this film embarrasses him. The script does not even have the decency to put it to good use. His character is at most called to shout things like "Here they are", "Do something", "Hurry!". The only thing I can understand is that poor Linda was rewarded for her work on this movie with food rations. The hero is played by Grizzly Adams himself, Dan Haggerty. In this picture, he faces fierce competition between his beard and the security dog, and does his best to outdo both of them. <br /> <br /> The only scary aspect of "The Chilling" is the resulting introduction. the factual elements of cryogenics and suggests that "the film you are about to see could happen in your own community". While I counted the number of times a few names are repeated in the closing credits, I found myself unable to see Lucasfilm suddenly being credited. Fortunately, it was only for the sound production of the film. 1/10.
