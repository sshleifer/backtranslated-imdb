The first thing you need to know about "Zipperface" is that the film was shot, which gives it a particular "home-video-ish" look that distracts terribly and makes it hard to take it seriously as a "real" movie . And "Zipperface" seems indeed as if a group of amateurs gathered to try a "real" serial killer thriller. It's not quite that, but it's not as bad as it looks. Having a woman among the two detectives in the case highlights the type of exploitation. Dona Adams gives an attractive amateur performance in the role - her obvious inexperience in front of the camera works one way or another for her. Plus, she puts a big fight against the killer in the end. The red herrings seem ridiculous at first, but eventually they work - I guessed the killer wrongly. And you have to wonder if Tarantino might have seen the guy from Zipperface when he had the idea of ​​"The Gimp" for "Pulp Fiction". (* 1/2)
