You know, as you get older, you sort of think that movies you did not like when you were younger may have been caused by your youth and lack of experience. As an example, when I saw the godfather at the age of 14, I found it boring. 20 years later, it's an incredible movie for me. In other words, I grew up and started enjoying big movies. <br /> <br /> So I rented Dirty Dancing with my girlfriend last night at her request, because she loved the movie at 14 and hated it the same way. age. But I was hoping, being young and stupid at 14, that might be a new experience for me. So I sat with her to watch, hoping to be enlightened. <br /> <br /> Well, the night after seeing Dirty Dancing, I feel a violation. I feel like someone who has penetrated my soul and deprived me of 2 hours of my life watching this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> First, Patrick Swayze plays a young man of 20, but he looks 35 years old. the premise of the film is that it seduces a minor teenager, courting her with her dance steps. Really scary. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is a clich√© plot where the guy "on the wrong side of the tracks" and the "rich smart girl" accidentally fall in love with each other. Of course, their romance is fueled by the fact that the "rich girl" can not dance a lick, so the "poor hero" teaches her in a week to become a dance expert for the end-of-holiday show, or something like that. . <br /> <br /> But you have guessed it well: the disapproving father enters soon and forbids the two to see each other, and the film is transformed into secret meetings of dance and love classes. All this leads to the final scene where the whole station gathers around the two young lovers while the father, once antagonist, accepts the 35-year-old dancer as the new man of her teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> Even my girlfriend moans at the end. from the movie as she admitted that it was not something like she remembered. I did not press her, but I smirked and put the godfather II in the DVD player.
