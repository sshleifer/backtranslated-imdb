It's 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure trouble! <br /> <br /> In this movie "Action", even the pistol used by Baldwin (HK G3A3) is zero. It was sent to recycling by armed forces around the world in the mid-1980s and is now used only by terrorists, bank robbers and military museums. <br /> <br /> If I had known that this movie was so terrible, I would rather watch 10 episodes of MacGyver saving the planet. <br /> <br /> No groove, no player and no sensation. Watch the Tupperware chain ?? it's more exciting than this sorry excuse for a movie. This film does not deserve a "0" on the scale. Better luck next time, Baldwin. Until then, I'll stay there watching my nails push ... it's a lot more exciting than "target" ??.
