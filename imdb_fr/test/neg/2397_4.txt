Your time and your brain will be much better spent reading or listening to Charlie Wilson's War. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, plays the most pleasant character of the film, Gust, the Greek, and plays it like a eunuch. Gust, in the book, is a hard core and totally free to say what he thinks. In the film, he is not even shown to be as important as Charlie. And it is never shown that poor Charlie gives blood (which he did every time he visited the camps in Pakistan). In short, the film is too bland and the story is too old for our modern day. We do not really care about the end of the Cold War and the defeat of the Soviet Union (which occurred despite Reagan, not because of) by a group of well-funded people who were extremely willing to fight . That's not the lesson we need to hear and see how well the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are going. (As I read the book, I still felt this sense of déjà vu, except it was today).
