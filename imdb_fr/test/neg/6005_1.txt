OKAY. First of all, I just wanted to check if this movie has an average rating less than or equal to -1. But 5.9. It's sicker than any killer procedure -, -. It made me curious to see what people wrote here ... which finally led me to create an account to give my 2cents of truth in this "well of illusion" that I find here. <br /> <br /> How dare you, even the guys MENTION this movie in the same sentences as for example Seven? The only thing they have in common is that they show various crime scenes. That's it. And "Best thriller of 1999!" ? Did you even watch another form of film that year? Or any other movie in your life? RESURRECTION does not remind people the year 1999 ... what about FILMS such as 8mm, Eyes Wide Closure, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? (They are actually more of a "thriller" than this one could ever be ..). Resurrection does not even deserve to be devoted to one second of 1999. <br /> <br /> Really, you can not be serious. I watched this movie yesterday with my girlfriend, highly recommended by one of her friends. A "super movie with Christopher Lambert"! ... that I had not seen yet? Hmm .. <br /> <br /> Well, take a look at the covers: OK, nothing special. At second sight, you do not need supernatural powers to know that they just reflected Lambert's head, ruffled his nose, then created a fancy negative pattern on it to get the image of the killer on the blanket. You might even think they asked an apprentice to eat a gallon of marshmallows just to cap that scary mouth (wow! -.-) ... whatever. He turned around and the plot begins with .. "it's raining in Chicago ... blabber blabber". Come on, a six-year-old could have made this sound more exciting. Now, with this huge enthusiasm from the excellent presentation of the films, you must start watching it. Because it can not be so bad, it's always Christopher Lambert. This hypothesis has proved false. With "proven wrong", I mean he was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable acts ever known to mankind (each actor, but the summits are the "I can do 1-Liners!" police, Prudhommes Wife better detective than Prudhomme when she recombines several incidents into an ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN index in the case !!!! -.- __ and .. yes .. Prudhomme himself) with a squadron of fake inhuman feelings, Logic errors in a minute - wacky cycle-light conclusions that, in my opinion, represent an insult to any thinking human being and finally and most importantly a cameraman who was clearly a hyperventilating kangaroo. Oh well, and if you do not close your brain completely (they are not locals to look at it), you should know who is who and what after what. 30 minutes, simply because you know ANY scene after the first. It's exciting. Exciting because this film almost makes you think that you can tell the future. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: This is FAR the worst movie I can remember. Believe me, I've seen a lot of horrible movies that were somehow bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. The resurrection, however, is the best example of possible failure. It was so bad that after being shocked by the unimaginable quality of his film quality, I laughed more than in any recent comedy, simply because I was fascinated by the courage of the team to publish such a movie. Fortunately for Lambert, he was in Highlander: Endgame a year later, so he can be forgiven. ; ^ O <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend you watch this movie to ALL. In the end, we had a lot of fun watching it: ^ D. I guarantee you that after completely watching Resurrection (be brave, you can do it!), You will venerate the actor level of a given daily soap . <br /> <br /> Or just go watch the mountaineers once again ... that's what I'm going to do.
