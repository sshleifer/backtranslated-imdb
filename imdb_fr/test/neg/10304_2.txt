Fox is lame enough. They cancel the bad shows. It's odd that they cancel a well-written program like "Arrested Development" and yet they keep this show and "War at Home". I think Fox loved breaking the barriers with "Married with Children", so angry, but now it's getting ridiculous. "The Loop" is a useless and boring watch, and their edgy jokes fall flat. For edgy comedy to work, jokes must come. "Family Guy" and "The Simpons" work because there is a constant stream of jokes. Fox must pull his head out of the rectal cavity and stop letting his loved ones write this mediocre tripe. I mean, if you're going to invest money to make something fun, make it fun. In addition, stop using "unnamed" actors. It's great to have newcomers, but you have to anchor a show with a celebrity. Duh, Fox.
