It is a film that should have been a mini-series because it tries to get too much information in a space too small. The whole story is constantly bombarded with subplots, the introduction of characters and meaningless information that go nowhere. There is an underlying plot in which a boy meets a girl, she has doubts but gets married anyway, then her doubts surface and she will see if they are real. They turn out not to be, but her husband will not believe that she was not unfaithful and his almost boyfriend does not want her because she did not unfaithful her husband. That said, there are no less than 1,000 secondary intrigues and character introductions that make this plot almost incomprehensible. During the first 15 minutes, you are inundated with so many things and situations that you stop taking care of yourself. You make fun of all the confused and messed up actors who slip into the story like vultures feeding on a corpse. Everyone enters and takes some interest away from the viewer. After half an hour and completely disinterested, I remained and watched the remaining two-and-a-half hours out of pure morbid curiosity. I could not imagine where it was happening but, like watching a fire, I just could not get up and turn it off. The production values ​​are superb but the resulting film is a waste of time; wash your socks instead.
