A perennial element in the IMDb Bottom 100, it's not hard to see exactly why it fails miserably in almost every bloody department! <br /> <br /> Take the editing to start; to call it jerky would be too free! Indeed, if the authors of this story were drunk one evening and had diced and diced dandruff with scissors and glue for children, the resulting mess could not have been worse than what we actually have here. On top of that, the inept story lurks mercilessly for what seems to be a tortuous infinite before we finally reach the decidedly dull paroxysm. <br /> <br /> Aside from the always-on Michael Sopkiw game, the bad performances of most other actors do not really help things, and the real beast that causes all the problems is a little less convincing. Let's put it gently. Yes, in truth, this is a complete pile of shit, if I've ever seen one. <br /> <br /> My dear, my dear ... and to think that Lamberto Bava directed that towards ... tut, did indeed. <br /> <br /> Note: This album was released in the UK under the alternative title of Devouring Waves, though lacking most of its gore scenes, which are, ironically, the only reason this would have been could be worth watching.
