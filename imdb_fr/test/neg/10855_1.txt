It's probably the worst and most disappointing movie I've ever seen. I spent four years in two universities and I know there must be a good movie about the experience. That's not it The "game" is horrible and the plot does not exist. <br /> <br /> Here are some incidents of my first year in a university residence. <br /> <br /> 1) A classy boy who unconsciously had with a transvestite. 2) The best friend of two girls - one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname "brick". 3) A couple who fucks too hard. 4) The boy who receives all the girls 5) The boy from Northern Ireland who is very difficult to understand. 6) McDonalds in bed 7) Curry every night for a week 8) Student, two of my companions ended up in the hospital 9) The discarded joint that triggered a fire. 10) Flood 11) The boy who wakes up on his floor realizes that all the furniture has been removed from his room. <br /> <br /> And if I can make this list in 5 minutes and from In real life, I'm sure two writers can do better, much better. <br /> <br /> And for a movie named after a song of Sleeper, where is the Britpop soundtrack?
