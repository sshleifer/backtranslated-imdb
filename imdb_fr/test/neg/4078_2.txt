This film certainly lives up to the worst movies I've ever seen, probably in my top 5 worst movies. I laughed once and it was then: <br /> <br /> EVAN: "I'm building something" Evan's secretary: "I hope it's a hairdresser "<br /> <br /> It was literally the only time I laughed in this" comedy ", dreadful compared to almighty Bruce who as a big fan of Jim Carrey ... was not even not so great! <br /> <br /> This film lacked the humor of God's powers and focused more on family ties. I would classify it only as a family film, certainly not a family comedy. <br /> <br /> Seeing a bird poop on someone's shirt is not hilarious, or a beard that instantly repels! <br /> <br /> I did not even think that the special effects were great, the animals really looked stuck, it was like watching a movie that was not "stuck" properly <br /> <br /> 2/10 movie - to avoid!
