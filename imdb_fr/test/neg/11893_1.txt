Can you please stop believing everything this man says. Get your <br /> <br /> information before you start renting this liar. He's not even <br /> <br /> from Flint. He simply says that to keep his "blue collar". It is <br /> <br /> of a rich suburb next to Flint. I mean, he went to a private school. <br /> <br /> His parents paid for him to go to school. Wow, that seems like <br /> <br /> as if they had suffered a lot from Flint going to the dump. He was also born in Canada. Oh, wait, that makes him a Canadian citizen. I would like him to just move there. Instead, he lives here in his New York apartment of a million dollars. It's the working class right there. I'm really looking forward to seeing his DVD coming out. I want him to talk here about the fact that big companies are bad. Where will I get these DVDs? Oh yes, at Target and Wal-Mart. The two largest US companies, which were also the only two stores allowed to sell them.
