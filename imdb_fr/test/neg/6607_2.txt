The film presents three main problems. Or rather, there are three reasons why it is not even a candidate deserving of more serious consideration. <br /> <br /> First, and this has always been true, it's not as good as books. However, at least we could have expected to reflect some of Sapkowski's spirit or depth. <br /> <br /> Second, we have production. Fantastic films are, in my opinion, the most difficult to produce. Everything related to accessories, including costumes, sets, cascades and (in particular) computer graphics is of inferior quality. <br /> <br /> Finally, and this is very subjective, I just can not take the acting game seriously. I did not grow up in Poland, so I can not really judge - this could well explain my lack of familiarity with Polish films. Nevertheless, the sequences seem very well interpreted ... The casting could also be better. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only possible redemptive element of this film is the rest of the plot that shines through: nothing like a diamond ring on a rotting corpse. <br /> <br /> On a separate note, I heard that the books appeared in English. I have not seen them yet, but I do not see how we could start translating them ... I would ask the English-speaking reader to keep that in mind when they judge the book.
