The Devil's Men represents what turned out to be one of the last hiccups of the obsessive occult horror scene of the '70s shortly before the coming of Halloween, tore up the rule book, set it on fire and kicked, shouting through a glass pane. <To sum up, some enterprising Greek filmmakers believe in their chances of creating a new film franchise featuring the disturbing double act of feminization and wisdom of the American investigator Milo and a curious but generous priest, Father Roche. An exiled nobleman is mixed up in a satanic jokery - offering tourists as a sacrifice to an extremely scary effigy of the minotaur and only Milo and Roche can stop him! <br /> <br /> Or something like that. <br /> <br /> The reality is, however, horribly dull, frustrating and full of ruined opportunities. I strongly suspect that first-time filmmakers have used most of the budget to engage Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing, and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) and hope this would be enough to convince English-speaking audiences. <br /> <br /> It's not. The Devil's Men is beautiful with safe and fantastic filming locations. Eno's score, though basically a single-agreement drone that he probably created in the afternoon, is appropriately atmospheric and the movie is laden with crunches in the '70s, including the Austrailian genre of Fawlty Towers and ultra hottie Jane Lyle from Island of Death infamy. But here ends the positives. Cushing waits through him, giving the impression that he has an ear of corn on the backside and Pleasance is afraid to do his best, but never really succeeds. To make matters worse, Milo's character is appallingly fragile and implausible. <br /> <br /> Okay, so that does not look good. But from there, the film simply refuses to go anywhere. There is an innuendo that local villagers are possessed, but to be fair to them, they never do anything but fight for their glassy eyes. Maybe they were just tired? Just when you're sure that things will come to a head, Milo and Roche interrupt the baron's satanic feast with laughable ease, then sending it to meet its creator. The statue of the Minotaur is silent and presto! Satan is defeated. <br /> <br /> Yeah, yes. <br /> <br /> The foolish optimism about the possibility that The Devil's Men is the first in a series of films is hammered by the last line of Father Roche's ridiculously hasty end. <br /> <br /> "Who knows Milo? Maybe someday I could call on you again to help defeat the Antichrist." <br /> <br /> I'm sure you'll make this call every day, Donald.
