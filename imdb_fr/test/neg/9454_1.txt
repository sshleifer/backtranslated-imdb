How poor is this film? Well, I had it less than two months ago and I hardly remember what it was ... <br /> <br /> I also paid Â£ 1 for this DVD, the old story of 'put-a-new' hide-and-seek-on-the-box-and-the-fool-buyer-buy 'syndrome. All I really remember is that the actors ran a lot, that the number of cars used was over budget and that a vampire was involved. Again, suppose you can find out from the title of the movie. <br /> <br /> Right to video waste or directly to cheap DVD as it is now. This stuff will be in the bins of bargains in rental shops, supermarkets and charity shops until the sun's death. Only cockroaches will rule the earth, but this garbage will still be there. God bless the dawn of the DVD age ....
