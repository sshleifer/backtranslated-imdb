Despite my best efforts, I just could not get into this one. Perhaps it was the faded tones; it may be the approach that lags - I'm not really sure, but even if it was not a "bad" movie, I did not find it very effective (words which I understand is much more arbitrary than their usual uses). <br /> <br /> The bottom line here is that a whole series of teenage boy deaths trigger an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town, triggering a witch hunt. What does the death of boys have to do with the mysterious sexy woman who appeared in town? Is the crazy hermit involved? Is it voodoo? The story is a mixture of crime drama and horror because the various inhabitants of the city are all suspects and the corpses continue to appear while the bloody violence ensues. <br /> <br /> Pretty good, but for me, most fell a little flat. Oh, there were times ... the only boy who entered a beautiful naked seductress was pretty good, and the scene where the fathers beat the hermit was a bitter comment (even though the effects failed, saw that her skin seemed to be peeling off) as if they were whipping her with hot irons). <br /> <br /> My biggest problem was the end. I have already put spoiler labels on this review, but BE WARNING, THIS IS THE BIG SPOILER: I do not believe it. I do not believe that a priest can convince himself of killing young boys to have become aware of their sexuality without any trace of this psychosis appeared earlier, with other boys, with a story or another personal affect. The film did not really come to an end. END SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Fulci is a big name and I am sure there is an audience for that. I absolutely have to check more than he did, because that may have been a bad introduction. In any case, most Italian giallo are random. So I'm waiting to see what this guy can do before putting him away. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
