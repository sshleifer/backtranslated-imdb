The peace and beauty of Koyaanisqatsi was a powerful affirmation of the natural world. In Naqoyqatsi, we are beset by images of synthetic, competitive, violent and digital - the destructive constructions of our culture. <br /> <br /> Some freedoms are taken with the images, with posterization, distressing and a lot of slow motion. The links between the sequences are impenetrable, if they exist. Naqoyqatsi is defined at the end of the film, a missed opportunity to put the images in context. <br /> <br /> The film is hard to watch, the quality of archival footage is uneven, and this is the theme that most matters Philip Glass's hypnotic score.
