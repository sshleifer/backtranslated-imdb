On the positive side, this contains interesting information on a wide range of topics, especially on Himmler, the SS and their research arm. There is also good piano music, interesting pictures and great camera work. <br /> <br /> However, this is a very bad historical work. It does not have a specific objective and we could summarize the whole question. <br /> <br /> Himmler created a department in the SS for research on the origins of the German race. They have gone all over the world. They did things and launched expeditions to all kinds of places ... (none of these avenues were explored, the results were not shown and the arguments were barely refuted). They wanted to establish that the Aryan race and the German people were one and the same thanks to historical evidence. They found none. The members of this research group were prominent professors, members of the SS and thus related to the Holocaust. They were considered acceptable after the war and then ran German institutes. <br /> <br /> These facts are in themselves fascinating but they are never explored in depth and no coherent argument is presented in the program that condemns or exonerates these people. This does not seem to be the objective of the program, it is not clear, it varies from one subject to another. Witnesses, although presented as credible, are few and unsupported. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this program does not know where it's going, why it's happening, or how impressive it is. The topics are fascinating, but this program tries to house a vast area of ​​research and therefore seems not to know what is happening. I would avoid that. <br /> <br /> The "Holy Grail" is also the German lineage, nothing to do with the Holy Grail of Christian mythology except in passing. The mentions of the expeditions in search of the Holy Grail are made but are never followed. The title is misleading and the content of this documentary is unconvincing and incomplete.
