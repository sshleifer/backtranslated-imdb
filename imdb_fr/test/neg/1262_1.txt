Have you ever wondered what is the worst movie of all time? Stop asking yourself. I tell you, Michael, that's it! <br /> <br /> It's not "comforting", "entertaining" or "Travolta at its best". It just sucks. If I had kids, I'd let them watch Deep Throat before Michael! <br /> <br /> John Travolta sold out, a depressed and bald William Hurt, and one about to die at any moment, culminating Jean Stapleton this movie shit. <br /> <br /> But wait ... you'll hear Andie McDowell sing! Yeah. Hollywood has really been on us with this one!
