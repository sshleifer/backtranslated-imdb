Whoa, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The packaging of the film is better than the film itself. My girlfriend and I watched it last weekend, and we only watched it in the hope that it would improve ... it's not ... <br /> <br /> The quality of the image is mediocre; it looks like it was shot in video and transferred to the movie. The lighting is not great, which makes it difficult to read the facial expressions of the actors. The game itself was cheesy, but I guess it's acceptable for "still" a horror movie for teens. The sound posed a huge problem: sometimes it was necessary to rewind the video because the sound was not clear and / or smothered. <br /> <br /> It has no merit in itself; trying to ride on the colors of "Sleepy Hollow". Do not bother with this one.
