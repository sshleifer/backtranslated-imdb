This film made me want to bang my head against the wall. It's hard to compare such nonsense to anything, but some say that watching this movie is like bleeding from your nails. And this comment comes from the cousin of the writer. The film was so bad that it made "Hulk" (the second worst film of all time) look like "The Departed" (one of the greatest movies in cinematographic history). If you like boring familiar movies with predictable intrigues, then you'll love this movie. If you have a brain, you certainly will not do it. When I rented this movie, I fell asleep watching him. The next day, I finished where I stopped, and it was the worst decision of my life.
