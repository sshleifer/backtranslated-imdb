There must be a 0/10 option for the hold like this. <br /> <br /> It was painful to watch, but strangely convincing anyway. Impressive because it seemed incredible that a movie could actually suck so much. I kept thinking "it must be better". It got worse. And worse. <br /> <br /> How on earth have people been driven to produce such a categorical bazaar that I'll never know? The most surprising thing of all, however, is all these criticisms that I see of people who actually love the movie. Yes, the acting was good, but the movie was really very bad. The worst movie of all time!
