I had read the reviews of this film in the newspapers and I must say that my expectations were very low before watching Ocean's 12. I really enjoyed the first film, but this successor is one of the worst of all time . I would say it's the top 5 of the worst film I've ever seen. Why am I saying that? First, there is a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. Fragments to which the term "history" might be attributed are sometimes linked, but most of the time, the film goes on without purpose or motivation. The whole story seems forced and the scenario that surrounds it is even more restrictive than it sometimes becomes a joke. <br /> <br /> Actors introduce themselves but do nothing to deserve credit or appreciation. The most embarrassing are the main women (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) who play too much or are extremely simple. Damon, Clooney and Pitt are not brilliant either. To be honest, I really do not understand how they would like to be associated with something as serious as this movie. <br /> <br /> === May contain spoilers ==== Camera and editing, sigh where should I start. There are many unnecessary camera movements that make the experience painful. Combine this with an extremely impractical edition and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart. Especially the scene where the whole gang is out of the prison to be transported by car. The zoom of the camera on each person gets boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you get the following message: wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects - NOT. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny, but it becomes extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the disorder. Bruce Willis. Why? Please, explain to me! WHY ??? <br /> <br /> To summarize ... if you have to choose between working the root canal and watching the ocean 12, I recommend the old one. Make sure they make all the teeth while you're there ...
