This hand-crafted horror film tells the story of a guy who kills people using Edgar Allan Poe's storytelling. The local police gagged the file for a few years and the FBI took over. They know exactly who the guy is, but apparently no one has planned to pass by his house, because that's where he hangs out, dressed in his vintage clothes and torturing the random premises. The FBI chick is kidnapped, which involves his father, the former chief investigator of the local police. To top it off, a group of zany students decided to camp at home and smoke a lot of weeds. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, the FBI agent ends up shouting and running like a little girl, and not one of the sturdy college kids thinks about stopping for a jump to the Poe-boy. Mostly oversized and sometimes underused, Dead End Road is the product of a low-budget production with a group of friends who have idiots too numerous to cover.
