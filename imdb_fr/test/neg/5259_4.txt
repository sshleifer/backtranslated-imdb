Bulletproof is very clearly a disposable film. The kind where bullies and bad guys are splashed everywhere, so much so that you really are not supposed to see them as humans. The yawns between Wayans and Sandler are considerable. They do their best, but alas and alas, the personality itself does not make a good movie. Jimmy Caan plays a mean villain, but he always had that red edge in his hand. The scene of my favorite is the television sequence repeated in a television commercial in which Caan reveals the virtues of America and can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in each garage. Apart from that, it's a buddy movie with firearms for the brains. Pass on this one.
