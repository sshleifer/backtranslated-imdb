Do people really like this movie because it's a foreign war movie ??? <br /> <br /> For me, it's nothing more than a bad Hollywood war movie in German. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad on so many levels. To talk about it with Peloton or Full Metal Jacket is absurd. The fight sequences are pathetic, the dialogue and behavior atrocious. <br /> <br /> This group called "the assault troops" is a regular at the Wermacht. Not SS troops. There are so many problems with this movie that it's sad. Bad editing, bad acting. He has everything. <br /> <br /> The film continues, as if the public should suffer as much as the soldiers. <br /> <br /> I read in a review that the film had a budget of 20 million dollars. <br /> <br /> For real? Where was it spent? In the fake car sequences? In the pathetic "special effects"? Ugh. <br /> <br /> As a history buff of World War II and a fan of World War II films, I found this film very disappointing. <br /> <br /> For an excellent alternative war movie, check out "The Beast". (Not a WWII film, but still exceptional) <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this one.
