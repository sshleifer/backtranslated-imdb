You know, this is one of those movies "New Emperor's Clothes". It's as if, so strange and strange that you're supposed to like it if you're really in the movie. Well, I think it's a bologna band. Films like this that are hidden under the cloak of Dada or surrealism drive me crazy. Someone has this bad dream, perhaps caused by eating the aforementioned bologne just before going to bed, remembers most (unfortunately) then filmed it and we are all supposed to marvel at their creative genius. I also have strange dreams, sometimes, that make absolutely no sense, but I do not feel the need to film them, to expose them to everyone and to call that art. Strangeness does not in itself mean that something is interesting. The true dada or surrealist expression has an intention and an intellectual thought behind it. If other people do not get it, it does not make it deep, it just makes it incomprehensible. The oddness for the sake of weird, for me, is not good, much less great, art. And comparing "Tuvalu" to "Delicatesen" is like comparing "Godfather I & II" to "Godfather III" - same genre, not in the same league.
