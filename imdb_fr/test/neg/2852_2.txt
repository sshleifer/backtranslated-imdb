It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it 2 out of 10 stars is the appearance of the beautiful Lydie Denier in some scenes. Despite her 42 years is an incredible woman in all aspects, his naked scene in the bathroom with Armand Assante is burning. <br /> <br /> Anyway, nothing in the film, nothing interesting to say, a neo-Nazi and Turkish gang fight for Berlin in scenes including people shooting in the street in broad daylight and in a club where 30 to 40 people shoot each other with machine guns in a place not bigger than my home and, surprisingly, after three hours of shooting, three people die and ten are wounded LOL. <br /> <br /> While the gangs are fighting in Berlin, a serial killer kills young children, then tosses them blank in various parts of the city. <br /> <br /> Armand Assante appears as the Turkish detective who, although now working for the police, was a former Turkish gang leader and is in place to solve serial killer crimes. <br /> <br /> The film is obviously a very bad scam of the classic movie M. The murder of children, the involvement of the underworld, the character of the serial killer and the final scene with the "trial" of the killer in series is more than influenced by this classic movie. <br /> <br /> The acting game is terrible, the scenario is just stupid, the production of the lowest standards possible and in general it was a great waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Do not even worry about renting this one.
