My main criticism with the film is animation. I totally agree with everyone that it was very poor. Some characters seemed to have darker skin tones than in the first movie, which is much better. In addition, the background colors seemed hasty and somewhat static. It's also unfortunate that Michael J. Fox did not call Milo, he did such a good job and James Arnold Taylor was not sure if he should look like Milo or Aladdin. I also took into account the lack of a good script. the third story was confused and clumsily told, and the second story suffered from script problems. To make matters worse, the first one I do not even remember, aside from a haunted fishing village or something like that. However, there was good music and vocal talent from John Mahoney, Cree Summer, Clancy Brown and Tom Wilson, who saved the film from total disaster. In the end, a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good movie. 4/10 Bethany Cox.
