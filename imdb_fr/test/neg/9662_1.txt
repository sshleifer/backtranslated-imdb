The Calu-what now? Yes, I thought it was also a stupid name. Chris Carter remains completely ignorant of the scum of his writing team. Starting with the usual merry teaser of X-Files (a baby being run over by a train), this episode ... well, I can not really say that it's falling down because to be honest, it never went up . <br /> <br /> Wrong writing, and feeling no pathos for any of the characters (except perhaps this baby at first), the writer makes us hate the characters before killing them brutally, it's the worst technical of all times. Are we supposed to feel sorry for the characters to hate? Do not ask me. <br /> <br /> Not only is it boring and scary, but it's like watching a very bad Omen sequence with disgusting and disgusting death sequences and rotten special effects (though to be honest, it's the least of my worries). <br /> <br /> Sara B. Charno began her career at X-Files with a groan and finally happily finished it. <br /> <br /> Verdict: <br /> <br /> words from my math teacher, Mr. Laverack: "Horrible, Awful ..."
