It is amazing to think that this film was released only a year before Star Wars but seems to be a million years behind sophistication and special effects. In fact, the art direction and scenography (beautiful Victorian spacecraft) are not bad; it is the monster costumes that are the most derisory, resembling the monster "guy in rubber suit" of the TV show LOST IN SPACE. The caveman's demonic makeup reminded me of some of the extraterrestrials from TWILIGHT ZONE's old reruns. <br /> <br /> The scenario is scalded and, aside from Peter Cushing's comical relief, the acting is also pretty miserable. This movie is only recommended if you really appreciate the bad kitsch SF. And the music ... yuck! A horrible 70s experience with synthesizers that do not match the movie's period and that resembles a person who hangs out with a Minimoog and a two-track tape recorder.
