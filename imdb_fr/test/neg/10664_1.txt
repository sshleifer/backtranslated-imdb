In Bollywood, it is not uncommon for worthless movies to become hits, flopped movies and good actors not doing big things. <br /> <br /> AKS is a movie of this genre <br /> <br /> Himesh after a musical director and The singer tried to play the role of the infernal man, just because his songs became a success that means he will become an actor <br /> <br /> The producers were certain that the film would work maybe, the songs were also a hit and of course Himesh did his advertising as cheap as habit <br /> <br /> The film tells a story so poor, a direction so bad, a game of actor so mediocre that it makes you cringe <br /> <br /> Indian rickshaw in Germany, Himesh waterfalls and a lot of stupidity Himesh's cap is intact even when he's in the car, which makes a dangerous jump <br /> <br /> The direction is bad Music is a grace that saves well that most of the songs sound the same way <br /> Himesh tries hard but unfortunately its emotional are a joke, lack of expressions, he is more suited to his musical director and some songs He cuts a sorry picture Hansika is awful Malika goes well Sachin Khedekar is fine, Dars ham jhariwala han
