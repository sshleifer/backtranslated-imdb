I can not think of anything, I repeat, all that is positive about this "film"! The entire 1 hour 45 minute movie could be reduced to a short 5 minute movie! In most scenes, nothing happens and it seems that the camera was left in recording for the sole purpose of increasing the duration of the film! All you see is someone in the background who walks around or watches television without a specific subject or who does not even speak! I just feel that I lost 105 minutes of my weekend with my family and my friends for nothing! If a film is badly made or if the scenario is not great, it's a different story. At least, that leaves you a topic of discussion, but about DISTANT, I just have to call it a "movie" because it's moving pictures recorded by a camera. . <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, imagine a long 105-minute film based on two or three lines of history! With what will you find yourself? 5% content and 95% loads! That's exactly how "Distant" was at least for us! The actors did a great job playing roles that were nothing special in them, they barely spoke or showed special emotions! I took this film in the comedy section of a store based on what I read on the back of his cover. I still wonder what was funny besides our face after watching the movie.
