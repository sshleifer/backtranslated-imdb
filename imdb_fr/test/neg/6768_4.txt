I was very impressed by this movie as a child of eight or nine years old. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could understand why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing him as an adult, it seemed almost comical, because of the exaggerated narration and discordant details like gangsters of the 30s driving cars that seemed to be 50s. The way the criminals are described describes some sneaky reality and not very glorious, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and unintentionally amusing part I have left is the scene where Ma Barker and his sons are shooting with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "Maybe at that moment, for the only time in his life, Ma Barker became a real mother". This is supposed to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes that she has destroyed her family by her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very strange film that is rarely shown nowadays. Gangster movie buffs may appreciate this, but more out of curiosity than a real movie.
