Every movie should have an idea. Simple or more complex, it takes one ... The problem with Fragata, .. it's once again that, when he decides to make a film, he is so eager to do "anything" that he forgets this main detail, and make the characters do anything without any justification, behave without justified reasons ... they are simple puppets that follow the film in the flavor of the wind. It's boring and sad to see them appear and disappear like discarded cards in a game. Fragata always seems to have some talent in advertising, it's his own work ... and that brings you to see what he has done ... but in the end, there is always a big disappointment. It's not enough to have a movie filled with "Portuguese Pink Magazine stars" ... especially when half of them can not play ... they pretend to be funny. Here, my only positive point goes to the actor Helder Mendes ... one of the few non-stars ": he strives to establish some credibility, and in such a messy film without any direction (of any so), I give him the credit. for having tried But it is worth seeing this film as a manual on "how not to make a film" ... and if the previous works of Fragata were bad ... this one is a "masterpiece "in achieving the AWFUL title. In a few words, .. Just check! It will do you good ... and if you realize your family movies ... and you always feel bad with your work ... spend 30 minutes looking at this work said "professional" ... your house made that will look like powerful Hollywood Flicks compared to Sort Nula.
