Although I think the critics who hated this movie summed up what it's doing wrong (all!), I had to add my two cents. If you would like to have a long version of the terrible situation of this film, please read the coinlightning review. <br /> <br /> Here is the short version: shameless use of actors' NAMES to propel the plot rather than using their talent (no one has brought their "game" to that), a flagrant commercialism ( I guess Pepsi can afford to stick an advertisement - or 40 - in a movie now), and a plot (???) that was so complicated "rock star" clich√©s on the fact that it was totally ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that way. . . I was thinking about Wayne's World all the time I was watching this movie, but I was not laughing! Whenever you try to add Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) to your movie, you have serious problems. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, warn your friends and family - this movie is nil.
