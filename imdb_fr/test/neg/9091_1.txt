I was rather disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me a Tsukamoto SNAPSHOT fan, among the first 5 minutes of the movie. It was fresh, innovative and just ... different. I like to have a movie in your face and press all these buttons "get wiggled". Tetsuo did exactly what few movies can do for me. <br /> <br /> For those of us who like to take a breath of fresh air, those who appreciate the offbeat styles used that make independent movies so interestingly likely a dissension. If you are looking for the visceral "HYPER-KINETIC" sensation of the first film, ignore this one because it has been completely emptied. Tetsuo II is for some strange reason, just a typical action movie of Hollywood style. I was rather confused. However, in my opinion, it's still worth it for any hardcore fan of Tsukamoto.
