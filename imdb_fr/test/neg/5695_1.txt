I managed to go through half of that, but I was not masochistic enough to see everything. The first half of the film had almost no dialogue! Almost everything was commented in voice-over to bring the story. The screenwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millennia of detailed story in voiceover. At the same time, he forgot to develop the characters. Most science fiction fans do not require a lot of character development, but it would be good to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the space fleet ended up fighting. <br /> <br /> There are good things in the movie. The soundtrack was well done. Some of the computer-generated graphics are very good, but others were just mediocre.
