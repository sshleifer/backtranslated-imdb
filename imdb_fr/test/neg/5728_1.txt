I watched this movie, or part of it, in the hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that it was just silly. For one, you have the worst acting of all time! The lead actress, Birgitte Nielsen, is terrible, uninspired and barely attractive. And she certainly does not look like the warrior who could easily kick the buttocks of veteran warriors, but she does. And with the feminist attitude, it's obvious hypocrisy. For a time, her family was killed by a woman, then she joined a warrior school or something like that to learn to fight men. She then joins a big servant and his child king, whose city was destroyed by Gedren. These two characters are simply stupid and destroy the lack of atmosphere that the film has managed to create. After that, I could not stand Nielsen's painful game, stupid clich√©s, and lack of real action. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger as Kalidor was the only part of this film that really made it visible. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie Conan, but it's pure shit!
