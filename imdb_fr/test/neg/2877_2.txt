The basic plot of 'Marigold' boasts of a romantic comedy in which the film industry is kept in the background. An American actress, Marigold, played by Ali Carter, remains stuck in India. Even worse, she has no money left. She then decides to play a small role in a Bollywood musical to earn enough money to return to her country. There she meets the Indian choreographer Prem, played by Salman Khan. Basically, the movie fails at the script level. Just calling a movie a Hollywood project does not guarantee quality cinema. Marigold stands out as the best example. Artistic direction is weak and obsolete. Musically, Marigold turns out to be a failure. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is far from being recognized as a daring. Acting, Salman delivers his hottest performances to date. Ali Larter is good and has a huge presence on the screen. As for performance, she is good. <br /> <br /> You can also find good reviews on this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310
