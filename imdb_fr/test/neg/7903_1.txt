Well, to begin with, I'm just as black as black, and I can tell you that it's very sad when black people think a "black film" is nil. I can not say that I have ever seen a film so badly shot or in a worse story. <br /> <br /> Snoop is my buddy and everything, but he did not feel this movie at all, I did not know at all how much they paid him to be in that bucket of shit called a movie, but I hope it's enough to eliminate the smell. <br /> <br /> I'm totally in favor of a disturbing film, but this one was bad, really bad. He blew the chucks in all aspects, no real plot, fucking story, the cast could not act and the best of them was the white guy! <br /> <br /> I almost demanded a refund by leaving the door of the theater, half of the crowd got up and left before the end, I still wish to have some. Save the pain and go see something else, anything else ...
