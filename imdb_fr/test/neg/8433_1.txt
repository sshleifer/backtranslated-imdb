I saw a lot of movies in my day and this one is really the worst film in the history of cinema. It took me 3 efforts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes of boredom, maybe because I was already tired because it was late at night. The second time, I managed to cross 35 minutes, but I fell asleep again. I can go on like this, but I think you understand ... nothing ever happens in this movie. A waste of time and money complete. This film is really bad. Look at it and you'll know what I'm talking about. If you can go into this movie for 40 minutes without shaking your head and asking what it's all about, then you're really masochistic. The only reason I gave this movie a 1 in 10 is because 0 was not provided as an option. I just thought the world had to be warned before hiring or worse ... to buy that trash. LATER!
