Once I heard that the largest and oldest preserved Germanic heroic poem had been turned into a film, it was almost my obsession to see it. The first glimmers of her appearance that I caught never disappointed me. A futuristic rendition With Lambert, our favorite mountaineer, and Mitra, the main roles, seem attractive, even if doubts have emerged (an important female character in Beowulf?) ... Two hours ago, I saw the film. After reading the director's name, my world collapsed. As I said - from that point on, there were not many surprises. First and foremost, the film has nothing to do with the original Beowulf if we do not take into account some stolen names in a violent and useless way. If they had not stolen the names and declared that it was a new story, it could have been a stupid action class F with beautiful costumes and a beautiful scenography. In this way, it's just a crime! An attack on a legend and its ideology, as well as against common sense. Ok, let me be positive for a second ... aside from the general electro-gothic atmosphere that is nice, there is also good music. That was all for the positive part and this comment.
