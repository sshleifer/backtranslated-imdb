Corey Haim plays a kid who teams up with a dog to bring out a giant troll and a hit OSA (Michael Ironside) with a 30/30 and homemade bombs (which seems plausible considering Haim) Oh and he also protects his mother and his girlfriend as well in this visible but disappointing adaptation of a decent story. Corey Haim is terrible, of course, but the huge momentum of the film and the imposing presence of Ironside make it at least a moderately effective film. Still, the plot is ridiculous and it would have been nicer to have seen a monster or at least more gore. At least it's something different. In addition, it is likely that this film will be the last teen movie for a while to show a teenager making homemade bombs. <br /> <br /> Matt Bronson 2/5
