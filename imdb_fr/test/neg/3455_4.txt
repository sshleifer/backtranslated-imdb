(Warning: several spoilers) <br /> <br /> Someday, somewhere, there will be a post-apocalyptic movie that does not stink. Unfortunately, THE POSTMAN is not this film, even if I have to recognize the merit of having tried it. <br /> <br /> Kevin Costner plays a character credited only as "Postman". In reality, he is not a factor, but a tramp with a mule in the incendiary lands of a Western America devastated by an unspecified disaster. He negotiates with isolated villages performing Shakespeare. Suddenly, a band of bandits called the Holnists, the self-declared warlords of the West, sink into a village visited by Costner, and their devilish leader, General Bethlehem (Will Patton), named Costner. After a lot of misery and many efforts to break the spirit of Costner, he escapes, ending a long section of the film that could have been better told in a flashback of three minutes. <br /> <br /> We finally arrive at the main principle: the escapee Costner finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest city, hoping to find food under the pretext of to be a factor. A number of villagers led by the young Ford (Larenz Tate) want to participate in this act of factors, which does not agree with Bethlehem and his bandits, and Costner finds himself at the head of a group of factors in war. with the Holnists. <br /> <br /> The Postmen versus The Bad Guys idea is not as ridiculous as it sounds. Holists derive their livelihood from the fact that the villages they feed on are isolated from each other; Holists can destroy any village, but can not resist all their victims together. To unite, the villages must communicate with each other, and an operational mail system would be a big step forward to put Holnists out of business. It is therefore logical that Bethlehem becomes medieval thanks to our heroic couriers. Unfortunately, the final defeat of Bethlehem is not the result of the union of the villages against him, but of your old clich√© of reserve, the two-man fight between him and Costner. Nor is there any real attempt by communities to use the mail to work together to solve their problems; all the mail seems to be the standard content of "Hello, Aunt Debbie" played for maximum sentimental value. <br /> <br /> THE POSTMAN is one of the most predictable movies shot for filming that I have ever seen. Now, I'm not deliberately trying to ruin movies by trying to figure out what's going to happen next. But here we are talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort; I just knew what would happen if I wanted to know or not. After a lion has been presented eating people, a Holnist bandit in search of the fleeing Costner ventures into the bushes after a noise, and we are then "shocked" when the lion eats it. A group of uninjured villagers are arrested and fired by firing squad. One of the villagers sings some famous words just before being shot, to my great lack of surprise. A covered statue is unveiled to show exactly what everyone knew about it: Costner leaning over to pick up a letter from a cute kid we saw earlier in the movie. A man says in Bethlehem that no sir, you can not just take my wife; Bethlehem runs the course without suspicion, although he is the only person in the theater not to suspect anything. <br /> <br /> But it's the rank sentimentality, disgusting that really defeats The Postman. Olivia Williams, who plays Costner's lover, Abby, is the least served. She pours her heart into the material and does her best to make it natural and sincere. She tries so hard that it's heartbreaking. But no one could ever have said, "I have a present for you, Postman ... you give hope as if there were candies in your pocket", do not feel like it's is not the syrupy cup they are. Another example is the scene where a mounted Costner thundering a little boy, ignoring his proffered letter, merely turns around, looks at him for about five minutes, then thunders back to pick up the letter. Why did not Costner pick it up the first time? No real reason it is simply an artifice that tries and fails to give us a feeling of exaltation by annihilating the hopes of the child and then restoring them. <br /> <br /> Schmaltz and predictability unite at the end when the postman's statue is revealed. I sat down and said, "Please do not tell me that they are going to show the statue, then come back to the scene with the kid Cutesy, it's probably too saccharine, too obvious even for this movie . " Then, alas, the music got bigger and we did reduce our eyes to the dreaded little boy smiling while his letter to his aunt was removed, and I held my head in my hands and thought: "Someone one shot me. " I felt like I had thirty pounds of apple pie in my throat. <br /> <br /> Bethlehem is a villain more humanized than normal. Your standard post-apocalyptic villain is the meanest, toughest S.O.B. in the valley. Bethlehem is a bit of a man inside, trying to make himself feel important by hitting others. Although some threats are being sacrificed, Bethlehem is credible, as are most villains. Unfortunately, Will Patton exaggerates. And although we are told that Bethlehem completely destroyed his last opponent in five seconds of hand-to-hand combat, the fighting skills of Bethlehem presented at the end of the film are absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The actors' game is otherwise very good. Costner did better, but his Razzie was an overreaction. As mentioned, Olivia Williams is very impressive. Larenz Tate as Ford does a sincere and credible job. The score of James Newton Howard is competent, but below the epic standards of the film. But it's not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 on ****.
