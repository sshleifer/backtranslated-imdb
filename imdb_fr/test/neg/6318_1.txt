I was 19 in 1970 when he came out and after hearing how funny it was when he came out reading the reviews here, I finally rented and watched. I did not laugh once - a very funny movie - and I usually like Reiner. I can not for life to understand why this is considered funny. I did not have a laugh. And I love comedies! Oh well, at least now I know what all those shouts were. Not my idea of ​​a comedy. Go and rent The Navigator or The Love Nest from Buster Keaton - now THESE are comedy classics! If you rent this one - have a reserve rental so that your party is not a loss. Score 3 out of 10
