What a terrible movie! In this film, the role is the quality of a play in high school or a pornographic film based on a story. This is not pornography in this movie, but there is a lot of free nudity! This is one of the only redeeming qualities of the film, one of the only things that prevented it from being rated for a star. There are also a million cops dying in this movie. Barely shocking, because the violence is so unrealistic, we can only laugh. But the breasts gush out and become exposed in the most surprising and hilarious moments, if you really like bad movies, look at this one. This is a Bonnie and Clyde story in which a mother and her two daughters seek revenge. This film also presents a sex scene with two of the oldest people I've ever seen rolling naked!
