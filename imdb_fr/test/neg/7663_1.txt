I just saw this movie on TNT and let me tell you that this movie was downright cheesy and packed. But after a certain point, I started laughing and laughing and telling you the truth, they should classify this movie as a comedy rather than an action / adventure. The most hilarious scene occurs when Delon and Kennedy loop 360 to avoid the French missiles that Wagner ordered to destroy the Concorde. Our intrepid leader, Kennedy, decides to shoot flares through the window to stop missiles seeking heat ???? Dumb or funny --- the kicker comes here --- after a shot, the flare gun works badly and Kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well ... if you want to know what's going on, download this film. The dumb parts of this film include the total lack of intrigue - yeah, we have action for 25 minutes then we land in Paris and we spend ONE HOUR with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. Now let's move on to the saboteur for ten minutes, then a leftover film and a visually disintegrating plane. PASSENGERS NEVER "SEE THIS RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES !!!! - --- final note of this move --- (1/10) on 4 stars if it was an action 2 out of 4 stars if it was a comedy
