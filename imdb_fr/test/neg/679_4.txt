Tamara Anderson and her family move again, her itinerant painter father pursuing her next landscape. Fifteen, she is in her rebel phase. Already angry at his father for frequent relocations, his anger is exacerbated when his mother is suddenly confined to a tuberculosis sanatorium. Because of her mother's absence, Tamara attacks her father and comforts her religion, the boy next door, Rusty, and the spirit of the deceased teenager who lived in her rented house. <br /> <br /> The story is modest to a fault. It is strangely rhythmic, and even during his emotional scenes, there is no tension. The actors representing the parents are doing well. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as a sick mother, and Maria Ricossa is particularly effective as the mother of the deceased teenager torn apart by guilt. But Katie Boland, as Tamara, is too amateur to wear the movie. The dialogue is very natural and Boland can not manage. She has her moments and when she hits them, she can be good but there are too many times she has fallen awkward. One can see her thinking "ok, that's what my line is and that's the face I'm supposed to do" rather than reacting to other actors. She is not the only one, Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park in the role of her sister Brenda, who also suffers from a raised delivery, but at least they are in fewer scenes. <br /> <br /> If it was done well, the scenario could have created it. an affecting movie. And there are moments, but a lot of it is bogged down in an amateur performance and flattening direction.
