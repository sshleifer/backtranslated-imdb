Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both beautiful films, but this last part of the trilogy is a major disappointment. They got too excited about archival footage and photographs, so little content. The executive producer puts his own image in the film ... It's just pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $ 3 million to spend, it might have been something. In fact, I thought Steven Soderbergh had directed it because it was so bad, but Godfrey Reggio, the director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, realized it. I'll have to assume they just do not have the budget to make a decent movie. One would think that Francis Ford Coppola would have wanted to be part of this film and help to earn more money together.
