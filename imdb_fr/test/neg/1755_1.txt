What gives Anthony Minghella the right to destroy two extraordinary works of fiction? First of all, he destroyed The English Patient, which was bad enough, but now I find out that he was killed on Cold Mountain. My son and I went to see him the first weekend, and I was very disappointed, but I told my son that I felt the need to read the book. I went directly to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read it, and tried to understand what the critics were talking about in the world when they said Minghella had trusted the public's intelligence enough to give them a great movie. . That's what he surely did not do. <br /> <br /> Normally, I do not read much fiction, but Cold Mountain was so much recommended by friends that I felt compelled to read it. I did not see Cold Mountain, the movie, when it was shown in theaters, and that's because of what Minghella did to The English Patient. But as a fool, I praised it today, and I'm so upset that I had to express my frustration and especially my sadness that someone could have taken this beautiful story and turn it into such a beautiful screen thing, and now they will never be. <br /> <br /> READ THE BOOK AND LEAVE THE FILM ON THE TRAY. I will never be supported by a Minghella project. I think he's perhaps one of the worst directors to work today, and I'm tired of the praise that Hollywood is giving him. It must be that no one in Hollywood is reading anymore. This movie is nothing like the book, except for the names of the characters. The ego of Minghella must know no limits, and if he did not like the book, why did not he write an original script and leave the book alone. Even if I had not read the book, I would still consider this film one of the worst I've seen in 2003; and I saw almost everything that was published in the United States. <br /> <br /> Elaine, you will not love this one either.
