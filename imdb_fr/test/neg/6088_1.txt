First of all, I just watched a movie about SHOWTIME titled Survival Island. It says it was a 2006 movie with Billy Zane and as I like it and I do not sleep, I thought I'd take a look. Seemed interesting. Looked, and decided to look on the IMDb who was this new face Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG I could not believe it, this movie was renamed THREE and will be a new movie ?? Playback resumes in 1 hour and 30 minutes on the Showtime channel and this date is May 28, Florida or Summer time. You can check your mailing list by title and see it. I will not go into detail so you can see the movie, but at some point, there is a lady in a white bikini who goes into the water and takes it all, you see her naked body ... when she comes out of the water you see her on the backside. It's funny, there are many other problems. I can not believe that by chance, I decided to watch this movie ... Go understand! I wonder if the people who have renamed him sold him to a movie studio, but he's already playing on Showtime, ah ah. Good laugh I give him 1-1 / 2 stars. C-, D + film.
