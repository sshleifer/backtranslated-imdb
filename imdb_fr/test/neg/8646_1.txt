I saw this film on the Blockbuster shelf and thought it looked cool. The DVD box boasted so many great actors and I wondered, "Why did not I hear about this movie?" Then I returned the case and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, and the answer began to explain itself. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to refute the idea that a big distribution is synonymous with big film, but I think that I should explain why this movie is so terrible. Ok, the script is awful and full of one-dimensional characters. This is the worst role I've ever seen in Chazz Palminteri and I'm surprised he's doing something so ridiculous. However, underrated but talented actors must make a living. Palminteri plays the role of a one-dimensional detective of the police, as stupid as a C-series henchman. He, with the main detective (the evil-headed Nolte), the big but simple Michael Madsen and the late Chris Penn (whose role with Madsen has been completely abandoned) form an elite brigade of Los Angeles detectives to rid the city. gangsters in the late '30s or' 40s. The film portrays this team as cops who will break all laws to ensure that those who think they are above the law do not operate in their city . At the beginning of the film, the police mistreated a local restaurant, seized an alleged gangster (William Peterson) and took him to a place they call Mulholland Falls. They throw it over one of Mullholland Drive's cliffs, which is supposed to show how serious these guys are in ridding the city of crime. It does not matter. It was nothing more than an inexpensive excuse to use a crappy title designed to make you think of LA and its famous sites. Somewhere later, they find Jennifer Connelly's body and the plot begins. <br /> <br /> On the direction that was nothing amateurish and LOW! Apart from the fact that the characters were B-movie, the exaggerated gestures of Treat Williams, the one who plays the role of police chief, and the appalling Daniel Baldwin are just a few highlights that have made the movie to Lee. The first Tamhori film. There is not a single performance in the film except perhaps Melanie Griffith, who could claim to be the worst of the film (she won a Razzie for this film). In the end, it was her character who was not so great and she really did not have much to work on. <br /> <br /> Like any bad movie, it all starts with writing and this script was not a jewel. The plot is simply formulated based on the creation of the next scene and never takes into account the motivations of the characters. The way the characters behaved was amazing. The police who make the law in their own hands are credible in the right circumstances (see CONFIDENTIAL), but in this case, it seemed that these guys could get by, including the murder, without ever wanting anything clean. I suppose that as an audience, we are supposed to assume that no one has seen anything and that people do not ask questions. Everything in the story is predictable and so well spoon-fed that we understand everything that will happen well before the characters. However, this does not make us intelligent, but makes us angry at the hero's stupidity, despite the fact that there are no heroes in this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the best component of the film was David Grusin's beautiful score. From the beginning, he has been summoning one since CHINATOWN, which quickly faded when I realized how incredible the whole movie was. I was not surprised to learn that the box office had generated eleven million dollars. What I'm going to say is that this movie is worth watching for some laughter. Nick Nolte's game is like a domesticated Junkyard dog without success and I laugh every time he tries to be serious. I also nearly fell to the ground at each of the slow motion shots used in the movie (I think there are three with one during a key battle scene). When you have to use slow motion in the heat of a dramatic moment, you clearly have problems. So, even with my negative reviews, I will only recommend this movie for the purpose of provoking laughter, that is, if you like good movies like LA CONFIDENTIAL.
