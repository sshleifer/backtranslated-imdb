I can not understand how this picture could be made. It's usually, if not completely, so inaccurate that the main character does not even look like the physical appearance of the story. This film made me go on the Internet and browse my books to make sure I remember Nero's personality. For God's sake, I have a book that lists Nero as one of the most evil people in the world and the movie made me feel bad. I must say that the character of Aggrapina seemed close to my physical and psychological understanding. Although all the actors did a good job, the movie was terrible and I'm sure I will not watch any other film from this sorry team.
