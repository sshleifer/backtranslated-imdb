I watched this movie without any idea what it was before. I was intrigued during the first hour. It was about to become a big thriller. A very talented cast and a good dialogue. Then everything collapses for me at the sight of the first vampire. I could not believe my eyes. A big thriller was thrown in the toilet. The rest of the movie from that moment was totally horrible. <br /> <br /> I gave it 4 stars for the brilliant start. I think it's a little generous, but I've been entertained for a while. I'm not at all a fan of vampire or zombie movies. If you are, you may not agree with my opinion.
