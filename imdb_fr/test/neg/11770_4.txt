I guess my biggest mistake was watching this remake of "Piranha" from 1995 in parallel with Joe Dante's 1978 original. I did the same thing last week with "The Omen". Curiously, watching the remake just after the original of '76 really made me appreciate the 2006 version a bit for a variety of reasons. <br /> <br /> But this approach has somehow turned against the Piranha version of '95. This reinforced the fact that it was an image of lower quality. Basically, version 95 corresponds more or less exactly to the same film, because it tells the same story and follows it virtually scene by scene (only the character of Barabara Steele and the military intervention were written). But cinematography was not so good. The game was worse too. Especially Alexandra Paul (playing the character of Heather Menzies) showed me how horrible actress she was. Bradford Dillman (version 78) had his way of acting Charlton Heston, which was fun, while in version 95, William Katt is very successful in being William Katt. So, it did not really bother me. But the entire distribution is rather inferior and the only event worthwhile was to see James Karen ("The Return of the Living Dead", parts 1 and 2) in a cameo. The makeup effects of John Carl Buechler are not as clear as those of Rob Bottin. The musical score resonated somewhat, but that of Pino Donaggio was much more memorable in the original. All these weaknesses have therefore really transpired after having looked at the original again in the framework of this double bill. <br /> <br /> Since Scott P. Levy's remake follows Dante's original, I guess it's pretty entertaining to sit there. , although it lacks the spirit of Dante's original. But what really made me not like Levy's version is the fact that a lot of footage from the first movie was reused during the piranha attack scenes. I never like when filmmakers do this (and I'm not talking about using images for flashbacks or other valid reasons). I mean, if you do not have the budget (or imagination) to produce freshly shot material, then, for Pete's sake, do not do frickin 'remake. But Roger Corman produced this remake (cheaper), so I guess I should not be so surprised at the reuse of images. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch "Piranha", make sure it's been a long time since you've seen the original. You might appreciate this remake a bit more then. And oh yes, this cool little stop-motion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this film, as expected. But whats worse, there is no female nudity in this one either (the original had really titty-shots drawn for her, and this blonde girl from the opening scene even accidentally shot her -clothes a little too far when removing his jeans!). Numbers, like this '95 version was made for television.
