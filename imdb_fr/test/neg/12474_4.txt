One of the first things that made this crop stand out among the others was Sole's wake. An aerial view is used to show that Sole is blooming with kisses by a sea of ​​women. I thought it was a comment about the closeness that women had with each other about this culture: people who have stuck together over generations, separations and misunderstandings, while remaining able to unite and count on others. In addition, the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals. What I mean by impeccable is that they did not suffer the consequences of their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections. An example of this is shortly after the accidental death of his father by Paula. Her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while Paula seems to have almost no remorse for what she did. Again, another example is where each girl (or granddaughter) had the opportunity to meet with her supposed "dead" mother (grandmother). Knowing the stress that this has probably caused in their family, each one of them still kisses the mother regardless of what she did - that is, kill her husband and lover. From this perspective, women are portrayed as people who not only love each other's acts of character, but also do not seem at all bothered by the actions of their friends / family members. <br /> <br /> Another idea that I thought intriguing about this culture was related to their idea of ​​the supernatural. With the death of Raimunda and Sole's mother and his inexplicable return, the director feeds the public's emotions into thinking that this film will embody the supernatural. The people represented in this culture seem very supernatural, that is, very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave. Their aunt Augustina, their long-time friend, the prostitute, and other residents of La Mancha city all believe rumors say that the dead would return to their family members to complete their "unfinished business". I thought it reflected both the religious faith of (predominantly Catholic) culture and the need to repair the fate of those who had no chance of being forgiven during their mortality. The belief they had with regard to the "death" of the dead was also to give hope to the destitute circumstances they had suffered in mortal condition. When the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film is not at all supernatural, it is interesting to observe the role that the mother continues to play. She is treated as if she were still a ghost (ie hidden in small crevices (under the bed or in the trunk of a car)). I believe that the director portrayed the mother in this way to reinforce the existing supernatural beliefs that the city had adopted. The character of the mother seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long belief in life after death.
