I had never heard of Dead Man's Bounty when I saw it at the DVD store a few weeks ago and I thought I had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem because it had Val Kilmer in a truly unique role. Unfortunately, it was not more than 10 or 15 minutes that I realized it was a disaster of epic proportions. The first clue you'll see about the real horror of this film is coming up early, when you have a bunch of bags in an old saloon laughing like a hyena in a scene that lasts about five times too long. It's amazing how bad it is. And unfortunately, that is not better. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmer appears prominently on the cover of the film, perhaps to make you believe he has a role in the film, but unfortunately, his strange role a dead man is neglected instead to focus on a group of half-witted crooks and the most inept conceptualization of a single city sheriff I've ever seen in a movie. It is interpreted by Boguslaw Linda, who is unable or indifferent to cover his Polish accent, making it immediately impossible for the film to take place in the old American West. <br /> <br /> Does Poland have this type of past? I do not know. My knowledge of the history of Poland is not my forte, but I can tell you that the sheriff, as he is called in the movie, is the worst representation of the police that I can remember to see in a movie. He is presented in a really ridiculous scene where he wears a kind of blindfold and where a room full of men hits him in turn. Before they start hitting him, he explains that they can hit him once, then after the first turn, they will hit him again. If he manages to identify the perpetrator, they lose. What is this bullshit? I do not understand why a scene like this could be part of a movie. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten, bruised and drunk and beaten, until he eventually only shows himself from time to time, stumbling on screen and mumbling "no? without ... the law ??" You see, there are a lot of discussions and preparations for a hanging, the details of which are as futile as the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> By the way, it takes place in a city that consists only of two dilapidated wooden buildings facing each other and crossing a flat dirt that looks more like a road than a road. I understand that this part of Poland is supposed to look quite acceptable in the American Southwest, where none of the characters, with the possible exception of the dead type, could have come. <br /> <br /> I did not hear that Val Kilmer had accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role, as well as by the minimal use of the dialogue by the director Uklanski in favor of recourse to judiciously timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages. <br /> <br /> Yeah, whatever. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that Kilimer has not been able to overcome what must have been the really satisfying feeling he felt when he was offered the role. Personally, I would really feel that I had achieved some success if someone approached me and probably offered me a few hundred thousand dollars to stay still for a moment. I like to think that he did not even read the script of this bazaar, because if he did, I did not know why he had accepted the role. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie opens. with a man bringing the corpse of a man, played by Kilmer, seeking the reward. Soon, he finds himself involved in a ridiculous love affair involving the city's prostitute, the alcoholic sheriff, and a lot of chaos involving a series of stupid and stupid characters. <br /> <br /> There is also a lack of widespread and absurd understanding of American rituals. In one scene, a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and crushes the halves in Kilmer's eyes (for what reason, I can not imagine), then a man makes a short speech about Kilmer's corpse, in which he explains he was "one of the most talented men we have ever had," and then crumpled up with a shovel. What is going on?? <br /> <br /> Not convinced yet? Here are other reasons not to look at it. In a scene, the sheriff seems covered with ashes, except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only be described as bright red lipstick. A man has a head wound that soaks blood in his head and body. In a vertigo, he cauterizes with gunpowder. Clever. Towards the end, the sheriff seems to have a broken arm. Sitting at the bar, he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm. He uses his right arm to pull the rope, lifting his shaking beer glass between his arm and mouth, rather than using his arm. to drink. Also smart. <br /> <br /> Why does not he use his good arm? I have no idea. This, like all the rest of the movie, makes no sense, like the title. Summer Love? I hope you are joking? Avoid this mess at all costs. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, here is something about the IMDb Goofs page ?? <br /> <br /> Errors committed by characters (possibly deliberate errors of the filmmakers): This film was made. HA!
