This must be considered one of the biggest debacles of cinema. At the time, I was walking in Europe and I had the misfortune to fall on the film crew of this film in what was yet one of the idyllic and preserved places of the world. I was enlisted as extra, and what followed was an exhibition on modern debauchery. Forget all the accusations you've ever heard about Peter Mayall's intrusions into this rare piece of French life. Geoff Reeve and his cohorts have embarked on a kind of rejoicing at the restaurant des Beaux which has left the master tenfold. They were simply awful, uneducated and did not deserve French hospitality.
