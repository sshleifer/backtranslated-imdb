I saw this movie because it had a giant person and was labeled as a monster movie. I do not understand why we call it a movie of monsters. The film is a drama. I was expecting a lot of destruction, but what did I get? The majority of the film was about relationship problems and people who thought a woman was crazy because she had seen a spaceship crash with a giant inside for an unexplained reason. The action started a few minutes towards the end. Since the woman was killed, is not it a murder? Could they not have done something other than murder? If you look at this because you expect it to have some action because it is labeled as a monster movie, do not look at it. This is not a monster movie. It's a drama.
