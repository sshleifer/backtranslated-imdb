I do not know why they even kept the name. How could they call the series 'The Scarlet Pimpernel' after they have moved so far away from novels, I would not have a clue. The names of the characters are the only things they've kept, and even then, they've changed some of them, mixed them, and changed Percy's relationship with them. Admittedly, I only watched for a maximum of two hours, but it was enough to realize that the series was nothing like Baroness Orzcy who had portrayed her characters and who would probably have rolled into her grave when she was shooting. and aeration. Poor lady I hope that when the next person wants to make a film or a series of the book, it will not spoil it as completely as this series.
