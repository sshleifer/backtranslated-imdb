This film makes me seriously doubt again if Armando de Ossorio was a good filmmaker or not ... His films BLIND DEAD are praised by many fans. That I can understand. But I want to be an ordinary gothic vampire as MALENKA does not show any sign of a talented filmmaker. And this also applies to SERPIENTE DE MAR. It contains horrible scenes, a stupid plot, stupid events, and many other things that can be expected from a bad movie about monsters as well as veteran actor Ray Milland, who does his best to mumble at through this film without too much clue about what it does in it. Apparently, Milland was already very sick while shooting with SERPIENTE DE MAR (his last theatrical feature film) and going out with a ridiculous smell like this makes the situation even sadder. A last appearance alongside Peter Cushing in a television movie directed by Roy Ward Baker (also in 1984) does not change much about it. <br /> <br /> But the sock puppet / sea serpent is a joke to see. Watch him swirl a lighthouse and crush it. See him destroy a harbor with miniature boats. Watch him tear down the decks and nibble on charming miniature trains. <br /> <br /> Good Badness? Yes. 3/10 and 7/10
