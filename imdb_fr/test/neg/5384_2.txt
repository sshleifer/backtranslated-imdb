From an artistic point of view, the film fails to entertain or provide a moral resolution. The plot is hard to follow, if there is one. The acting is hard to bear. The dialogue is clich√© and clearly written by someone who does not know English. Only cinematography was worth watching in this movie, although you can still see flaws in the image. <br /> <br /> As an Asian-American woman, the film irritated me because it showed how narrow-minded people can be. On the political front, putting Asian women in such shameful roles should be outlawed. The perpetuation of stereotypes about Asian prostitutes is detrimental not only to the self-esteem of Asian women, but also to the country as a whole. I feel for the main actress who played Maya and the exploitation she had to face playing such a role. <br /> <br /> As Americans, avoid this movie. Art must be used to develop our tolerance and respect for each other, not to hold it back.
