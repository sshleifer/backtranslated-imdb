A killer (John Karlen) with a penchant for very bad disguises (afro wig on a white guy?) Walks in his truck looking for victims. Inspector DeCarlo (James Luisi) is present and finds the killer quite easily by wandering around the local pool and looking for anyone who looks weird (again, the afro wig comes into play). DeCarlo decides to follow the killer to his home and decides to set up a risky attack involving a woman psychologist police. <br /> <br /> Inspired by Ted Bundy's crimes before being arrested, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a fairly predictable and inexpensive killer movie series. The director Jeremy Hoenack has no idea how to give a rhythm to a film, nor even to make it suspensive. He can show many close-ups of the killer who is wringing his hands! The only thing it really deserves is the captured atmosphere of the 70's (watch out for the bathroom wallpaper). Well, this and a decent end. The Media Blasters / Shriek Show DVD contains many interesting things, including an audio commentary by Hoenack and Karlen, video interviews, trailers and another opening.
