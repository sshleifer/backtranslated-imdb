I did not know anything about this DVD when I hired it. I took a look at the comments, but decided to stay open. It's an independent, low-budget film, but it does not worry me. I will look at anything with Derick Jacobi and, as always, he has played his role well. What a pity nobody else did. I had watched 'Atonement' a few weeks ago with Vanessa Redgrave and she was sublime. In that, she just seemed to come forward to read the lines. In my opinion, the main mistake was to call on Vinnie Jones. To be honest, I saw his picture on the DVD jacket but I did not notice he had the best rating A sticker was strategically placed on his name! It was visible and I liked the Dickens story alongside the present. Perhaps with a more capable actor playing the lead role, it might have worked better. It was still weak.
