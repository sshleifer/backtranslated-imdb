An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut bag (note: I'd like to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in the blink of an eye, talk about the cheekbones that are raging!). The soundtrack was not great either. <br /> <br /> But the acting - even that of professionals like Drago and Debbie Rochon - was terrible, the staging worse (perhaps contributive to the old), the chimpanzee dialogue, and the camera works, barely tolerable. However, it is the SETS who got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale. I do not know where it was shot, but if I had to guess, it would be either an open-air museum or one of those re-enactment villages, where everything is too well maintained to do more. than to suggest the "real old west". Ok, so that was pulled on a student's budget. That said, I could have forgiven one or two of the above-mentioned faults. But, taken together, and being generous, I could not give it more than three stars.
