I have more than 10 years of computer games with better special effects! The plot is unstable and very predictable. Most actors seem to be extras without experience! Everyone has Scottish accents. It's like watching a Star Trek "Scotties" crew without personality or charm. Useless scenes of people setting up tents! Tents with all the so-called high-tech equipment! The actors seem not to be sure that the camera is on them. Nothing worries you if these people survive or not! It looks like it was made in the yard and garage of someone with low-end equipment! Nothing seems original or even slightly entertaining. Do not waste your time!
