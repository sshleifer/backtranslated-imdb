This movie sucked so many levels! Have you ever seen the dentist? This film made The Dentist a masterpiece. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, unless of course you're really really bored, so maybe. It was so cheesy. The killer reminds you of the monsters' grandfather, except that he wears goggles. When Jessica said, "I want you to meet someone, my inner bitch, I thought she was going to kick her butt, but all she did was throw a trash. And when the ranger had his wife's crying scene, I felt so much pain behind his tears ......... NOT !!!!! So before watching this movie, take a blanket and a pillow, make yourself comfortable because it's very relaxing.
