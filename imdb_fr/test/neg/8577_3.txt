It's a stereotypical plot. A young fighter tries to participate in a competition when he is not ready and he is not selected to represent his combat school. This leads to the separation from the combat school and he naturally finds a strange new teacher to teach him how to fight. The fights are not of a high level. They are far too "simple" in the sense that 1 + 1 is simple for all adults. The fighter trained and entered the ring, but did not do what he trained and kicked his ass. The coach screams this and does it without success. And after a little more of this ridiculous beat, he suddenly does what he is told and once hits his opponent. This translates into a turning point in the fight, although our hero has been beaten in his life to this point. Think of Rocky movies and you'll have a good point of reference on how many shots it really takes. The fights are also badly filmed. <br /> <br /> The last thing that fucks this movie is the stupid romance. The old music and the hard times are not what I call entertainment. <br /> <br /> These guys really could have created quality entertainment, but the director was not up to it. Or the other crew in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget, I do not know, but what matters is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10.
