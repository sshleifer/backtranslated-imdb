Roomies is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend, and a corn dog idea he plans to patent and sell. Immediately, his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car. He's bringing roommates to help pay the rent and find a job. Then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats on him, so he'll write a book about roommates and become famous. <br /> <br /> 88 minutes. None of these details of the plot is explored in detail, what you read above is more or less interesting than the movie. When his uncle dies, some breasts are on the screen. One of the potential roommates he interviews is pretty funny for about 40 seconds. The end is literally the worst I've ever seen. I want to recover the other 87 minutes of my life! <br /> <br /> I had not thought that no one could make a film with so little merit: there are surely rules against this kind of thing that is for the public? The screenplay should not exceed 20 pages and the budget should be tiny because the film contains about 3 places and a car. In my opinion, the only possible use for Roomies is to hold someone hostage and want to frustrate him beyond human thought. If so, have it repeated and you will have a wreck of gibberish ready for use in the day. <br /> <br /> one and a half year out of 10
