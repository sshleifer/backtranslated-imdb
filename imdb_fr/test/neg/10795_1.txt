I saw both the MST3K version and the uncut version. I rather enjoyed it. Anyway, it was not that bad. Of course, it has sometimes been a bit slow. I liked it. <br /> <br /> As for MST3K, they only made the films for which they could get the rights. All the films they tore up were not bad movies, it was so easy to make fun of them. Take SoulTaker, for example. <br /> <br /> The characters of Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar were so inanimate and so stupid that I could not help but laugh. I could not take them seriously. It created a unique feeling, however. <br /> <br /> Vivian Schilling did a great job with the screenplay. A world better than 95% of the waste in movie theaters today. His role was well played. Not too loud not masculine but just right. The camera really likes it in this movie. I would have put it in this role after having ready the script. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this film deserves a little more credit than it deserves. Please watch the uncut version if you see the MST3K. This deserves a lot.
