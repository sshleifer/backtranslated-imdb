Thomas Vinterbergs "De St√∏rste Helte" is another road movie without the most important element of a film: a good story. The characters are not very original and not particularly interesting. Thomas Bo Larsen has a particularly bad neck, playing the same role he played in recent years and he repeated in "Festen" - it looks like he thinks that playing = being angry and screaming after others! The film does not make much sense and is not very funny either - although it strives to be "weird" and "weird". If you want to make a road movie, why not add something original to the genre ?!
