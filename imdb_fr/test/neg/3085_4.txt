I saw this film in the middle of a breakup. It was around 3 am and I was fighting insomnia with a quick snack. It was not that bad at the time, but every time I tried to watch it, I can not enter it like I did that night. <br /> <br /> At the time, I thought it was cute and I liked the variety of characters, although they could have done better than Goran V, in my opinion. But the only thing that made me look was Heather's character and her sad "commitment" to her unwilling husband, which made me feel sorry for her and rooted for her at the same time. (Considering that I was in a similar situation at the time, maybe that's why I loved him so much.) It's not a bad movie, but you have to be close enough to the character so romantic to appreciate it, and hope you'll never do it. are.
