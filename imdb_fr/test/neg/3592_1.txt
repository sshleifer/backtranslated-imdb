Ok, I'm going to make this criticism short and to the point for people whose mental capacity is perfect to watch this movie. Everyone knows the ratings of the Motion Picture Association of America: G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17. For the purpose of this film, I think the MPA should create a new grading standard: IQ-20.
