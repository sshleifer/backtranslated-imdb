Who is responsible for these "backstage"? who are these actors? did they crawl under the rocks? 'yuks, a lot of yuks!' no. no yuk for me. only the disgust and shame that I am a human being. I have to look away from the scenery, it's so embarrassing. In fact, I changed channels. <br /> <br /> I always had a problem with robin williams "non-stop", I forgot my talk about lithium today, but at least it's funny once in a blue moon. To see someone who is not funny at all and who masquerades as robin williams, it's as if every tooth of your head was pulled slowly and sadistically, without novocaine, for all eternity. <br /> <br /> Stop making these TV movies absolutely horrible. Please.
