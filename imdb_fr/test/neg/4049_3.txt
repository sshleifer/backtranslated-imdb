Despite his ambitious ambitions, Zurlini's film must be considered a failure. It is one thing to create a world that brings the viewer to feel the boredom and anguish felt by the protagonist (which I think is what Zurlini was trying to do). Making a film that is itself tedious and episodic is something else. Despite the beautiful cinematography in a haunting place - and a beautiful score - the film never attracts the audience. Too many things are unintentionally amusing (the drunk sound of the rain flowing into Draco's quarters, for example, actors) or just puzzling (why exactly does Draco want to leave the fort the first time?) For the film to succeed in as a coherent work.
