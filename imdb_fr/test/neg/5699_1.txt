I rented this film because I love Kristanna Loken and have watched her on many television shows. Since she has 15 minutes of celebrity with her new movie T3, I wanted to check what other films she produced. <BR /> <br /> She's just OK in terms of acting. Not good and not bad either. She compensates while being extremely beautiful. YUMMMMM <br /> <br /> Rodney Rowland was a real surprise as a hero. He provided the only solid actor in the film. He is a very good actor and should probably be an action star. <br /> <br /> In addition to Kristanna to be OK and Rodney to be really good, all the rest of this movie is bullshit in its purest form. <br /> <br /> A hacker hacks the aircraft's system from the ground and, using a joystick, he attempts to smash the plane into a nuclear power plant ... or something like that And of course, there are the heroes who oppose him and ruin his game. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst scripts I've ever seen and it's no wonder whether it's a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> What is shocking is that this film was shot in 2001 and that it has too many similarities with the tragedies of September 11th. <br /> <br /> Why do they make movies like this? <br /> <br /> Panic * - a star (wasting too good actors) (also a waste of time) (also called Air Panic)
