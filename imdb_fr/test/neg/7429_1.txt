This will be my first review on IMDb and I'm happy that the standard score is 1 in 10 because I do not have to change anything ... <br /> <br /> First, there is has awful movies. Laughing movies like Island City, Battlefield Earth or Conan The Destroyer. It's totally acceptable. They make a great party activator. Then there is the worst movie of all time. I can not believe how much this pile of smoking dog poop was crappy. <br /> <br /> I found it in a secondhand store on VHS and I bought it quickly because I like science fiction, Terminator, the post-apocalypse, etc. like that. Everything about the box was very promising. Then I quickly inserted into the tape when I came home and the first thing I noticed was ... WHAT? There may have been 10 minutes (or more) of switching between the present clips and the flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect, with sounds that make you vomit. And it goes on and on. Then, some "actors" come into play and you wonder why you are never born in a world where this abomination of humanity really exists ... And then I realized, THERE ARE STILL TWO PREQUELS. I had not thought about it first, but the title says "3" in it ... and I was horrified. But while I suffered a lot of pain and agony until the end, I thought nothing could ever make me feel worse for myself and this universe ... But then a little text appeared saying ... " Next ... "and ... NEMESIS 4?!?!?! NO PLEASE NO !!!!!!!!
