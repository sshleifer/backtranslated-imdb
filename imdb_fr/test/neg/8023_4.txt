Half of a mystical thriller and half of the broken fantasies of a fragile mind, "Guardian of the Frontier" is an exciting journey that quickly derailed. Strong imagery and a convincing premise are soon submerged by incoherent intrigues, worn dialogues, amateur acting and the strangest and most inordinate phallic imagery of recent memory (here, a fish is certainly not 'a fish!). Clearly, this is the first Slovenian feature film directed by a woman - Ms. Weiss must have been determined to prove that she could be as sneaky and self-explanatory as any man.
