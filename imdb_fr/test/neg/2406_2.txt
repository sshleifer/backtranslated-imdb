This film is worse than Cat People, which I saw the same week. It has all the style of the 80s. MTV punk rockers, the real anti-social, not the commercial type of PC, the frat boys, and a villain called Splater. I like Splater a lot, and the film looks like it's in blue 80s lighting, but the rest looks like a low-budget Canadian schlop. I saw that so much as I lived in this great country and I realized that this type of film was made through tax breaks. Avoid at all costs.
