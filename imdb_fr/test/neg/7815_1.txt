This is by far the most horrible movie I have ever seen. I have never rated a movie 1 in 10. My advice is not to watch it. It does not even match a movie. <br /> <br /> It's better to sit on the couch than watch this movie. Playing was terrible but the worst was by far the scenario. Very unlikely sequence of events that are not even funny. They are actually very lame and stupid. Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid made a very stupid choice to play in this movie. Maybe their career might be a little upset. <br /> <br /> When I first entered Blockbuster, the main goal was to watch this movie. So I decided to rent it. I regret it sincerely. <br /> <br /> Once the film started in 10 or 20 minutes, you could basically predict what was going to happen. I was hoping it would be better, but on the contrary, it got worse. <br /> <br /> I'm not exaggerating. The movie is terrible. Do not look at him. I hope it helps you.
