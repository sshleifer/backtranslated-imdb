It was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. And it's compared to Alexander, Fortress 2 and The new world. <br /> <br /> I should go back to the blockbuster and ask to get my money back with an allowance, because it was a really traumatic experience. During the first ten minutes, I changed the zoom of my widescreen TV because the actors seemed not to be on the screen anymore. I did not think it was possible to make such a bad movie these days, I was wrong. By typing this message, I found a good reason to buy this movie. A joke presents at Christmas. I blame the Mrs. for this one when she chose it, thank you baby. <br /> <br /> Be warned ....... A real state of shock all around !!!!!!
