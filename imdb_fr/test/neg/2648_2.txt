I went to see Random Hearts with 3 friends and at first I thought maybe it was just me who did not like the movie. After all, I did not like As Good Gets and this movie won all kinds of awards. Well, it was not just me ... none of my friends liked it either. It was incredibly slow, kind of like pulling my teeth. The only action in the film is what is in the previews. We did not leave the theater because we all thought that something more would happen. We were not as smart as the 7 or 8 people who went out. I have never left a movie of my life, but I certainly should have. All of this is difficult for me, considering that I am relatively easy to satisfy when it comes to movies. I need a lot to think that a movie is great, but not much for me to like it. This film did not even approach the same category. Not only did the film last 2 hours too much, but it was like two commonplace stories in one, but they were not perfectly sewn together. Plus, the "soundtrack" if you could even call it was so boring. As Seinfeld has the same riff that is played over and over again (the difference being that I like Seinfeld) ... this movie had this jazz riff that he kept playing, which sometimes seemed very inappropriate, especially when people were dealing with the death of the plane crash. Hard to explain what I mean, but believe me it was awful. I can not say enough that people do not waste their money. After leaving the theater, I honestly wanted to write to the movie company and claim 7 US dollars back ... darling, I could have bowled or something for that money.
