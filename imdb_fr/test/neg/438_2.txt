It was a long time since I wanted to see an American werewolf in Paris because I loved his predecessor, but this film did not impress me as much as an American werewolf in London. In fact, to be perfectly honest, it did not impress me at all. <br /> <br /> Tom Everett-Scott and his friends are walking in Paris and, during a crazy sling adventure over the Eiffel Tower, saving baby-boy Julie Delpy from death. Before you have time to determine whether constant drama and lumpy dialogue are supposed to be comedy, a full moon hit and the kids are chased by terrible CGI werewolves into the Parisian sewers. <br /> <br /> The scenario is disgusting, the actors were made to make this film, their performances are up to the status of the film. From beginning to end, this film is never entertaining, engaging or even slightly viewable. To be perfectly honest, I had a hard time watching this movie without throwing up my dinner. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are not exciting, the jokes are not funny and the werewolves are not scary. In short: miss or be haunted forever. <br /> <br /> I notice an American werewolf in Paris 2 out of 10.
