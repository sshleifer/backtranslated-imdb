This film was nil. The problem was not with the cast. I think the cast was great, a lot of good talent, a lot of great actor. But the script was horrible! It seemed to be mainly a setting in which Steve Carrell could do his improvisation. And that's what it does best, but it did not work here. The script was difficult to follow, the story was not sensual and the scenes were random and lacked direction. In addition, much of the action was extremely artificial and poorly designed. It was a good effort, but as Max said, they missed it! I am shocked to see how many critical reviews there are for this stinker here on the IMDb. Obviously, movie producers are leading people to write a lot of positive reviews about their films and to fill in the entries on the IMDb. If you read positive reviews and compare them to negative reviews, you will clearly see what are the genuine reviews from normal users. <br /> <br /> This movie was full of problems and jokes that simply did not work. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchor Man and I love his comedy and his style. But I will tell you that I never laughed while watching this movie. Yes, I had some light moments, some bursts of laughter, but no real laughs. Nothing that struck me at all. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! A ridiculous scene occurred when Max had his hands tied on the plane and went to the bathroom to try to escape. He uses his special Swiss army knife ... but instead of just using THE KNIFE BLADE, he tries to pull the binding with his miniature crossbow. And while the crossbow is shooting and shooting small arrows in him again and again (almost extinguishing his eye), Max is not giving up and not trying the blade instead ... no, he's still shooting himself ball in the crossbow. What was he really expecting from this crossbow? It seemed like the worst option on the knife to try to remove bindings. It made absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of the typical circumstances of the scenes that make up this film. They were ridiculous, ill-conceived, badly motivated and made of pure nonsense. And it was really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie was very disappointing and I recommend you avoid it. A note to the IMDb: You should do something about these bogus critics that people leave. This degrades the authenticity of the site.
