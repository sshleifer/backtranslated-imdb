For years, I hesitated to watch this movie. Now, I know why. It was even worse than I expected. Ashton Kutcher commits the worst movie error of his career, since "Dude, where is my car?" Tara Reid shares the role of Ashton's dream girl, who asks her to keep the kids with her father's (and her boss's) owl over the weekend. The rules: 1. No shoes at home. 2. No people in the house. 3. The boss's son stays outside the house. 4. Do not touch the furniture. <br /> <br /> You can already guess, at the end of the first twenty minutes, how the rest of the film will go. <br /> <You know, there are movies like "Meet The Parents", where bad things happen to someone, but it's fun to watch, and it's delivered in a way, that you can not wait to see what happens next. This is not one of those movies. You know from the beginning that bad things are going to happen and that it's mostly stupid things that would never happen. It's an extremely frustrating movie to watch, and it's been about three times that I've almost turned it off, because it was so bad. But, I paid the rental fee, and I thought I should look at it now. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid was good and I would like to see her in more movies. Although I'm not surprised if this could have hurt his career. <br /> <br /> The end result is a happy ending ... but of course, with the kind of movie it is, you would not expect anything short of that. <br /> <br /> Do not look at him. You will regret it sincerely!
