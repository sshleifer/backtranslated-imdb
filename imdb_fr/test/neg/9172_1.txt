This film is without a doubt one of the worst I've seen. It was so boring that I just could not wait for it to end. I persuaded my girlfriend to watch it after this site received good reviews and, even after 30 minutes, she looked at me like saying "your nuts". The scenery was as boring as the movie with nothing but driving in the car looking at the wind blowing pieces of bush around. The acting game was not inspiring and the movie was simply a mess of what was a good idea to lose a dvdr. <br /> <br /> Guy Pierce should have remained stuck to the neighbors while at least he was washing his hair. He only talked on the phone, but nothing sold as a salesman. He would have been fired weeks ago. His girlfriend (once at Coyote Ugly) should have stayed dancing at the bar because at least she looked hot. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Vincent (those who watched him) was so annoying with his phone calls that any normal person would have driven home and hit him with a bit of 4 by 2. <br /> <br /> I do not know what someone liked about it. In fact, I want people to watch it suffer the torture I suffered.
