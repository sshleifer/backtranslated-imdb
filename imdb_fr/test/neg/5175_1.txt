I'm a big fan of British movies in general, but mostly gangster movies. Unfortunately, this movie was terribly bad. I find it quite depressing that this film receives good reviews from customers. The idea that this film is realistic and realistic is laughable. I have read a lot and heard a lot about the events in this film and they have almost all been glorified by violence and so on. The only realistic event in the film was that of the Range Rover killings where over-excited bouncers rubbed themselves for playing with people they could not handle. This film is a shame for British cinema! He has no plot, no decent actor and simply relies on being violent (realistic and realistic as some people like to say). The kind of people who made this film should not be allowed near a budget or a camera, just as the kind of person this movie is about to not have the opportunity to tell this pathetic story and violent without consequence.
