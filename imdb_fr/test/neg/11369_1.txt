If you think NBC version 10.5 is stupid, you'll be happy to hear that FX has plunged into the bowels of a TV-made hell and crushed his fingers in this pseudo-disintegration after 9/11. Not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete scam of 24 and a bad scam for that. The style of filming was the "docu-action" look now over used, complemented by cuts of "rawcore" B & W granular sequences. I do not really know what that means, but it certainly sounds like something the DP told the director before filming. I do not know what they were looking for here, but it reminded me of the guy in the office who thinks Powerpoint presentations with "fly-in" and "animations" are "cool". <br /> <br /> Does the story of six "terrorists" seize a nuclear power plant in southern Central America? That's right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where ying-yang has safety precautions. For the sake of reality, they put 2 CHiPpies off the mix. Because they could arrest 6 people, right? Six. I mean, even Bruce Willis had to face more terrorists in this stupid building of Nakatomi. <br /> <br /> Leslie Hope (TV Teri Bauer) plays a CHP officer who has trouble talking on the phone after being shot with a bulletproof vest. Her voice is like a TV advertisement by Sally Struther, moaning and monotonous. Her character is a conspiracy, and after she does her little job, she is quickly eliminated. Yes, Teri Bauer is dead! <br /> <br /> Bruce Greenwood plays the FBI S.A.C. Tom Shea, who constantly points out how he strikes foreign diplomats in the face. His boss being absent, no one in the Department of Homeland Security believes his prognosis for the situation. He is the wisest among a group of paranoid public officials who fear being held responsible for any type of disaster. He is calm, he is strong, he is BORING. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing that redeems or entertained about Meltdown - OK, maybe Teri Bauer who died was rather useless and funny, other than that, nothing that redeems.
