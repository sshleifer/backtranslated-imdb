This film is nothing more than Christian propaganda. It started as a good sci-fi movie, and then a sweet and syrupy Christian theme was incorporated into the story, which is unrelated. I had to turn it off at halfway because I felt fooled to rent it. The Catholic Church officially announced that aliens would NOT contradict belief in God. <br /> <br /> The movie is a little fun despite this, but the dialogue is amazing, the writing and the action are mostly void, and this movie is mostly a stink to avoid . <br /> <br /> It is obvious that filmmakers have researched the phenomenon, but you quickly realize that the only goal is to demystify and inject their own paranoid religious views. an interesting topic worthwhile. If you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels, you will love this movie.
