Parrots? Parrots? I have been around this old land for a longer time than most and have seen almost all westerns produced. The story of the old west is my passion. Comanche Moon is one of the most misunderstood, directed and interpreted stories I have ever seen. There was very little historical precision, but it was obvious that you were using a tight budget that played a distinct role in this insult to intelligence. I am happy to have attended this show. It was hard enough watching the movie and supporting the ads without interest. Once again, no actor seemed convincing. I hoped it would improve over the next three days. FALSE! I am ashamed to say that I have lost four and a half hours of that precious little bit of time left.
