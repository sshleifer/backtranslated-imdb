It's useless, hideous characters and boring movie. Saved by brief sex scenes, a crazy witch, a beautiful desert island and Brooks' body. The plot is tenuous, the characters are shallow and improbable. That said, I managed to watch everything, mainly because I was completely upset by the fuss and the kind of hope that his character would end well. The film was well shot, well done but maybe the cast let it down. Disappointing. Really summed up the criticism on the front line, but this website requires you to write at least 10 lines. It would be better to spend time watching another movie.
