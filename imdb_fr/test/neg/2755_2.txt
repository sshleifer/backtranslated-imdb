This film reminded me a lot of the Dead Kennedys song called "Straight A's". However, unlike this movie, the hero of DK's song turns to suicide. You want this bozo to have used death instead of committing the crime he committed. Everything was complicated and at first, you sympathize with the hero of the film, then he quickly betrays your sympathies. The long sequences of just showing the hero's face as he utters a monologue drag the movie a bit. Avoid this if possible.
