This film was disturbing, not because of the subject but because of the way it was treated. The extremely overweight mother (Angela) did not even appear on the cover of the video box, unlike the rest of the cast. It's not fair but is a statement in itself. I also notice that his picture is missing at IMDb (maybe his own choice) and it seems to be his only movie? The language in this film was believed beyond necessity. Looked with my 10 year old son because he was PG in Canada and the language that came out of their mouth was shameful and disgusting. Shirley Maclain has never appreciated, as many others seem. <br /> LOVE Kathy Bates and will always love her. Sinese's share was annoying. <br /> <br /> The little boy Alex is an excellent little actor. I'll have to see what else he's done lately ..
