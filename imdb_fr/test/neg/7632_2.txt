Sorry, I could not be more expressive in my summary, but these two words seemed to perfectly describe the film. This is not only a bad movie, but a bad movie with bad acting and a plot that will be of no importance to most viewers. <br /> <br /> See only for a naked Rebecca De Mornay tied to a wire fence and moaning ecstasy; so-called 'erotic', but really hilarious. <br /> <br />
