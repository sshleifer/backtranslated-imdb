Why was this film made? Are producers so easily fooled by sadists that they will give them money to create torture methods like the so-called "film"? I like a bad movie as much as the next masochist, but "Cave Dwellers" pushes it. It is very painful physically to watch. The intrigue talks about a guy named Ator - a corrected number that I'll call Private Snowball for the rest of this article - who has to fight invisible warriors and save a princess to defeat the bad guy who needs to find a better hairdresser. I may have misunderstood the plot, because it's been a long time since I've looked at this droppings, but really, you do not care? Oh yes, Private Snowball also has a silent Asian sidekick (who does not?). Who is not funny. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Private Snowball fights invisible people, visits caves, in the name of a good king so devoid of personality that he makes Al Gore look like Jim Carrey. Then, Snowball soldier builds a glider (yes, I'm serious) and gets the girl back. Yippie-kee-yay. It's cheap, involuntarily stupid and boring. Why am I not surprised that the director ended up making porn? <br /> <br /> Result: AVOID. Ator will steal part of your life and you will not have fun slogans "too bad for themselves" to take with this experience. Bad Ator! WRONG! Aak! * gags *
