and I saw a lot of movies. I saw him at the theater in 1989 and I still remember the nauseating urge to go out. If you like John Belushi, respect his talent, or even the sacredness of cinema, this film has nothing to offer you. It is especially a pathetic showcase for the author of Belushi's biography, Bob Woodward. When we see the progression of Belushi's life on the screen, Woodward appears in the film as a ghostly character. The most shocking scene occurs when Belushi dies, looks up from his deathbed to see the author standing above him and faintly pronounces "Breathe for me, Woodward". There are too many terrible things to mention, the least of them is the opening in which Belushi jumps from his mortuary bag to the morgue and rides in a taxi driven by a guy named "Angel". I will leave it there.
