Seagal plays a DEA detective named John Hatcher who lost his partner in a drug case investigation, surprise surprise in Colombia! Not wanting to boast or anything, but my dad was born and raised in Colombia (hence my last name), and now he's a doctor in California, so no matter what the movies make you believe, he There are other things than drug traffickers and cocaine coming out of Colombia! <br /> <br /> Anyway, Hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked Colombian prostitute, forcing him to confess, somewhere that I've never seen him in any of his films , before or since. It was actually quite interesting. Seagal tends to be almost asexual, the way he's not interested in women other than as intriguing and the occasional seduction attempt, whether by a stripper or a lover, never arouses the slightest interest. him. It's all the time for the bad guys. <br /> <br /> But in the confession room, he admits to having lied, sold drugs, falsified evidence and even slept with informants to get the information he needed to put the criminals behind the bars (I hope I'm not going to have trouble with God by telling you that?). The priest tells him to go to his family and decides that it is time to retire. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film is a very fine characterization exercise of the Seagal films. Marked For Death tells the story of Seagal against a group of Jamaican mystical drug dealers. These guys have no discretion about promoting their products in broad daylight. <br /> <br /> Hatcher visits his former high school coach, Max (a minimal effort by Keith David) and in the middle of the practice, some of these anxious crackheads sit in the middle of the stands and peddle crack to high school girls like a bookworm. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just had a protected high school experience, but I did not know crack merchants and crackheads were hanging out at school in the middle of the day. Be that as it may, Hatcher will soon learn how evil these guys are. They do not just sell drugs to high school students, but their coach routinely loses football players because of their drugs, they are being watched by Max Smartass and, as this is not enough, his niece, 13, is deceased at their crackhouse. <br /> <br /> Oh, okay. We have the image. I'm sure they're also torturing puppies and defeating old women, and maybe stealing sweets from kids just for good measure. Is it really so difficult to establish who the bad guys are? The 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse. Wow. <br /> <br /> Anyway. Not only does the film not know how to develop villains without resorting to what amounts to a film name, where perverse acts are attributable to them through dialogue, but they also do not know how they should act. <br /> <br /> The chief drug trafficker is called Screwface, and I guess that alone should tell you something about the genre of film in question. Screwface is a caricatural Jamaican with bright, strangely green eyes, which I suppose must be an integral part of his character, as he spends most of his time on the screen with his eyes half-flared. His favorite means of intimidation is to shout loudly in his overly coarse Jamaican accent, with his face literally less than an inch away from the one he's screaming at. This guy likes the guy's face so much that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses do not touch each other. All I could think of was how the poor guys would take care of his breath. <br /> <br /> Man, they do not want you to forget that these guys are Jamaican, by the way. Their accents are so exaggerated and exaggerated that it is almost impossible to understand them for most of the film. Not that matters. No matter what they say, all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is some kind of evil drug thing, they're just thugs who peddle drugs and kill people. The film had to be a huge success in Jamaica! <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the movie is that theatricality, especially that of the bad guys, as I described it, is spectacularly awkward, even for a Seagal. movie. They are so caricatural and weird that it's impossible to think of them as anything other than a fanciful creation of fictional films, something that slams all together to provide fodder to which Seagal can distribute his characteristic brand of revenge. <br /> <br /> But there is also in the film a kind of bizarre mysticism that makes all this weird. For example, a mystic, you might call him, takes a look at Screwface by spitting bites of Bacardi on a living rooster hanging upside down before he beheaded him and poured his blood on a picture of Screwface. Hmm. Interesting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is this same woman who warns Hatcher that her family has been "designated for death" by these people, which means they have a voodoo curse on them. Do not belittle anyone, but if they told me that my family was cursed by people like that, I just laugh. Hatcher does not seem to be the kind of guy to make a lot of gains in the evil curses of voodoo! <br /> <br /> But as you can see, the editing is pretty standard for a Seagal movie. One could say that single villains, although not very impressive. The strangest film of the early days of Seagal's career?
