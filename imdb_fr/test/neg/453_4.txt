I'm a big fan of the Doctor Who series and I still am, but I was very disappointed when I started watching this new series. <br /> <br /> Children under 15 or better under the age of 10 will probably enjoy the best, and perhaps new fans who have not seen the original series, but for fans from the original series, this series will lack the charm of the original series so well, it took David Tennant to make me understand how much Christoper Eccellestion was better as a doctor the first season. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend this series for those who have never seen a lot of things. original series, people who are under 15 years old and EXTREMELY DIE HARD, who fans, everyone will just have a laugh and mumble curse words on Russel T. Davies messed up one of our favorite shows
