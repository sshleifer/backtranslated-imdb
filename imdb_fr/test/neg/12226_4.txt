In 2002, when Matthew Lawrence did The Hot Chick, I also saw Drumline that day. Drumline wins by default! If The Comebcaks was released in March (as planned) when TMNT was released, TMNT would have won by default! <br /> <br /> Certainly, Matthew Lawrence did a good job in describing a quarter. He did not have to resort to dirty words, which is an advantage. But when he started playing with his private parts as well as with another football player and touching a girl's ass, it was the inconvenience. <br /> <br /> But the biggest inconvenience I feel is that all football players have to participate. in the music video model, with the exception of Matthew Lawrence (insert The Price Is Right Horn)! Another musical opportunity for him, just because he's shy for music. <br /> <br /> In the past, Matt often disappointed me (Super Human Samurai Syber squad) where he was so close to experiencing a musical moment. but ended up failing. <br /> <br /> Of course, Joey had a career in singing with two albums at his belt and Andrew started his own musical career. But it's very rare to find a musical moment Matt. The two artists who stand out are on Brotherly Love, where he plays the guitar and sings "Pigeon On Your Car" (Art Atrack), which he wrote in passing, and this romantic moment of Boy Meets World where he sang "This Lady" (Over time). <br /> <br /> Matt, you played too long at the jocks. Why not make a musical comeback. You have a good voice and I miss your musical side.
