Okay, I guess I'm pretty fan of Stephen King's stories (when they hit the screen), crushed, mutilated and destroyed, like any of us sad masochists here. I know very well that most of them are badly done. I'm waiting for him. I plan on it. I humbly allow it ... <br /> <br /> But this time ... GEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ ... Okay, so I think I saw this thing a few years ago ... very well. I thought I remembered it was pretty good ... FALSE ... As I say (OK, off-the-wall, annoying and annoying): I was not really trying to be snobby or to expect much, but what was it, a mini-series? I have only one thing to say: D ...... R ..... A ..... W ...... NO ..... U ..... T How can you POSSIBILY justify dragging the thing minute by minute, scene by scene, in a frivgin 'ENDLESS dialog box, completely WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE and incredibly slow? I mean EVERY bl ** dy scene is two people 'arguing' how they feel and back and D ... R ... A ... G ... T BL ** dy well O ... U ... T After about an hour and a half, which I think is about half the time (I did not check, sorry :) I finally got fed up! After an hour and a half, what had happened OTHER than the first accident ...? They were running away while the shop guy was killing ophthalmologists, press photographers and a lot of sneaky dialogues. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I promise you that this is not the case to have an unthinking action without stop; I like LOTS of movies where not much happens, but at least when they talk, such SIGNIFICANT things are said and the characters deepened, thoughts are conveyed ... SOMETHING !!! ??? Okay, I admit that the actors themselves were not that bad (except Stephen King, of course :) I loved the guy from Shop, I thought the two "older" people were fine. I liked the general and the main woman. It's just that if they could eliminate all the filling hours, that's all I'm saying. I mean, it's supposed to be a sci-fi thriller, sort of ... is not it? you know what really attracted the price when the seller has spent unnecessarily one of his many phone calls, this time he talks to God knows who gets moved (for him anyway) and acts as if he could not stand it. .. WTF !!! ??? It has been clearly shown that the guy was an effective killer, cold-blooded. What was hell? So, just multiply that number by about 500, and that's basically why I finally left my position if I was halfway there; that was it or hang myself, I swear! I mean there are other adaptations of King that are lame, but at least they move ...! Oh well, I guess if you can be in "the story" itself and you do not mind crawling, and you have SUPREME & DIVINE patience to wait until the end, it might be worth it. <br /> <br /> But, I sincerely and humbly doubt it ... <br /> <br /> I do not write these things very often, but THIS TIME, I just did not to be able to sleep at night (as I did during the show! :)
