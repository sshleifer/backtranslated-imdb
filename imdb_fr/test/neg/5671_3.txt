I will not say that the series is completely bad, because there are funny roles, like Spencer, and some random incidents. But, aside from that, let's face it, this is just another dry sitcom in which the kids get started. <br /> <br /> Miranda Cosgrove was cute and funny like Megan on Drake and Josh. Honestly, she is mediocre in ICarly and is not as funny as she tries to be. The actress who plays Sam seems to be half asleep most of the time, and her antics are so clich√©d that I would think of them. They are not funny, just annoying. And Freddie is fine, but it's not interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, the situations are not realistic, but it's not entirely bad. Some are annoying, though. Here are a few: <br /> <br /> 1. The girls are 14 years old and have a web show that gives too much personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000 people (WTF), with little or no advertising, and they can still go on with their lives without being attacked by lunatics. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2.Their Web show receives too much praise ($ 100,000 a year for advertising sneakers, a free trip in Japan, performances of Plain White Ts, etc.). Honestly, people over 6 years old would not find their "comedy" entertaining. <br /> <br /> 3. How come they are so "average", while they have a three-story loft, Spencer does almost nothing and can still afford a lot of luxury, and they have all the equipment for a web show? 4. All adults are idiots. ALL OF THESE. <br /> <br /> 5. No girl 5 feet tall, however obnoxious and tenacious, can defeat trained cops unless she is muscular. Sam is skinny and small. <br /> <br /> 6. Nobody can fall into a 9-story elevator and live. <br /> <br /> 7. Children can know criminals better than cops. <br /> <br /> The show is stupid. Really, it sounds harmless, but to make children think they can be hateful to their elders, to live alone in Seattle when they are only 14 years old with an irresponsible moron, and to give out personal information is just wrong. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed to say that my cousin, who is 3 years old, loves the show. What happened to caricatures when I was his age?
