My parents rented a lot of horror movies when I was a kid. We loved watching them even when they were bad they did it for fun. It was one of those movies, quite difficult to read again because I had only seen it once, but it's not something I want to find to be able to do a more in-depth review. The story tells the story of the death of an old horror actor legend. It seems to me that I remember that he acted a bit like a Vincent Price, without being sympathetic and elegant. He commits murder and dies, but what is it? The film is already finished? No, because some children, for some reason, catch the body and are ready to spend a fun night being killed by the ham from beyond the grave. I remember that the murders were not so special after the first couple and I remember that this film was rather disappointing. It seemed like a good premise, but he just could not deliver the goods, because he needed even more cool killings and this super horror actor had to add some of his repertoire.
