The scariest thing about Carter Smith's freshman horror film, "The Ruins", is the closing credits that have put comedian Ben Stiller on the list of executive producers. What was Stiller thinking when he poured his money into this cursed carnivorous undergrowth cooler that invaded his victims and devoured them. Oscar-nominated screenwriter Scott B. Smith of "A Simple Plan," adapting his hit novel, stays true to the usual clichés and conventions of all the twenties' sagas, where rash young people do everything they can want, but do not ask anything in the world. . If idiots are not numerous enough in this nihilistic nonsense, we are entitled to another film in which American tourists find themselves in danger simply because they are Americans. Plus, unlike the really good horror movies that explain why monsters need to feed themselves, "The Ruins" provides no explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of its ugly vines. <br /> <br /> The facilities of "The Ruins" resemble the 2006 horror movie "Turistas", where sluggish South Americans trapped brazen American backpackers and took them for their internal organs. Indeed, "Turistas" has generated legitimate shivers. "The Ruins" does not generate anything new or thrills or thrills. A mischievous mastiff who suddenly flares up in front of the camera to ping our heroes is on the brink of excitement. <br /> <br /> The rest of "The Ruins" is borrowed from another film: "The Descent", a cool 2006 cooler on a group of girls immersed in a nightmare experience when they get lost in the maze of caverns inhabited by albino mutants with a thirst for murder. Two other films that have been used either intentionally or not also come to mind. This is the classic horror of The Hammer 1968, The Lost Continent of 1968, evoking a deadly vegetation that threatens innocent bystanders in a sea of ​​abandoned ships and Roger's cult class. Corman "The Little Shop of Horrors" (1961), about a florist A man-eating plant in his shop. <br /> <br /> "The ruins" unfold in the picturesque and sunny Mexico where four American student frolics, Eric (Shawn Ashmore of the movie "X-Men"), Stacy (Laura Ramsey of "The Covenant"), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of "Sleepers") and Amy (Jena Malone of "Pride & Prejudice") finish their spring vacation soaked in tequila. Stacy loses a precious earring in a motel pool, but Mathias (Joe Anderson of "Copying Beethoven"), a helpful Teutonic tourist in her twenties, recovers her, and the band removes her as her new best friend. These people live to party and have already befriended a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his lost brother who accompanied a beautiful archaeologist in an isolated Mayan pyramid, which is not included in any guide. He proposes to take them with him and they accept. <br /> <br /> First rule of horror movies: If no one knows about where you're going, you'd better avoid it. Since they have only one day and they did not do anything, our two couples and their Spanish-speaking Greek friend Dimtri (the newcomer Dimitri Baveas) decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid. They take a bus to get to Mexico's interior and look for a taxi for the next leg of their trip. A taxi driver takes a look at their map and warns them to stay away. Second rule of horror movies: when the natives advise you to move away, you move aside. A twenty-dollar bill allows him to change his mind. He then takes them to their destination and then surfs at top speed. <br /> <br /> No sooner have our heroes found the mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth that strangely resembles a variant of the Mississippi kudzu in the jungle that superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is haunted and they kill Dimtri without hesitation when he tries to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists jostle for safety at the top of the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Finally, the vines hide to welcome our heroes and eat them. At this point, "The Ruins" is transformed into "Bug", the recent and ridiculous Schizoid film by Ashley Judd about the insects that penetrate under your skin. Before long, our heroes have separated each other in a useless effort to extract the vine from under their skin. A particularly horrible scene shows Americans cutting their legs to save his life. In comparison, the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition are tamed. <br /> <br /> "The Ruins" is another jumble of vineyards with nothing to redeem it.
