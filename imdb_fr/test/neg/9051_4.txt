I love Umberto Lenzi's cops - ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite - and his DESERT COMMANDOS has rather legitimized the phenomenon of the Italian Euro War by being a very good film. Give him guns, machines, guys to run and talk hard and he'll have a hard time missing him. <br /> <br /> What a pity to meet his EATEN ALIVE and his CANNIBAL FEROX. They could have been from anyone, really, and we look at them with the impression that he was under contract, we told them what kind of films to do, they were awarded a casting and a crew and they were gave a budget, a deadline and a scenario. Lenzi then went out and did his films in the same way that a guy from McDonald's fixed a lot of French fries. Of the two, EATEN ALIVE is the most original - which is quite surprising given the fact that it contains many sequences extracted from three other cannibalistic films - and is easier to obtain than CANNIBAL FEROX, but not much . <br /> <br /> I will let others describe the plot: What fascinates me in this film is its staged appearance, and yet what a little infamous reputation he has as such d assault on good taste. This is not the case, although the film is an exercise in bad taste, complemented by a winning title scene where two of the pretty ladies support are literally sliced ​​and devoured alive by cannibals, which is the highlight of the movie. The problem is that Lenzi allows us to have a complete overview of the cannibal feast scene and that it sounds convincingly like an episode of STAR TREK of the 3rd season, with a fake jungle game for very close-ups. bloody. And I do not know anyone else, but if someone cut out pieces of my person and ate them, I would not stay there and stay distressed. <br /> <br /> My problem with the film might be that I have a lot of respect for Lenzi as a filmmaker, and again, it could have been done by anyone. All your cannibalistic cinematographic conventions are discussed, but we never feel that they are filmed with real conviction, except to try to intimidate Ruggero Deodato out of the sandbox. The two directors must have known each other and either have a kind of juvenile rivalry, a real aversion to the work of the other, and a conscious need to surpass them. Lenzi invented the cannibal genre with MAN FROM DEEP RIVER, Deodato won with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, Lenzi fought back with EATEN ALIVE, Deodato expelled him (and all others) with superior CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and Lenzi shot one last part to save CANNAL FEROX, which is about as realistic as this commercial of Krazy Glu where the guy superglues his helmet to a beam and hangs in the air. <br /> <br /> This film is less desperate and a little more hesitant to push the audience into the abyss with all that is sacred that FEROX, which remains a kind of misguided attempt to snatch the scene from CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST . This one is more of a hodgepodge, with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with a suicide cult like Jim Jones - the cannibals seem to have been added afterwards, rather than as the reason the film was shot. I think fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fans of Lenzi's films looking for something new from the great director. It's not as entertaining as SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD, as adventurous as his own DEEP RIVER MAN and certainly does not have the weight of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Combine these considerations with recycled images, scenes of animal stomach violence, scenes of misogynist sexual violence and wood filming methodology, and what you get becomes an OK thriller in the jungle with two or three exceptional scenes , and Umberto Lenzi was capable of much more. <br /> <br /> 4/10; Monsters will go crazy though.
