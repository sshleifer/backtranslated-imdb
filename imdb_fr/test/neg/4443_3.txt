Watching QUINTET is not unlike watching a group of people play a game of letters in Portuguese or another language that you do not understand. You have the idea that they are playing a game, and if you look closely enough, you can start to understand the rules. But why not disturb, since it is clear that you can not participate and you would not want if you had the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Director Robert Altman is not one to beg an audience to love his films, let alone understand them. Sometimes it lets you slip into the picture to be part of the crowd, like in M ​​* A * S * H, NASHVILLE and A WEDDING, movies so full of orchestral chaos and chaos that one or two other bodies in the scene would not be. Do not make a lot of difference. And other times, it seems to echo the fact that someone could even watch his movie; as in IMAGES or THREE WOMEN, where the stories are almost personal monologues intended for an audience, Altman. With QUINTET, Altman seems deliberately daring anyone to get involved in the story. <br /> <br /> You can not rely on Altman to do what is logical or expected, which sometimes makes his films so remarkably iconoclastic. But sometimes, the unexpected is not daring, but stupid. For example, in QUINTET we meet a young woman who is apparently the last person on the earth who can get pregnant, and she does have a child. This last ray of hope in a decaying society is extinguished almost immediately; Altman does not even wait for the end to play his last depressing card in this nihilistic and pessimistic tale. He lets us know how empty and meaningless life is a reality. Courageous? May be. Stupid? Absolutely. Without purpose, he tries to build a story on an iceberg melting quickly, while reminding us how much this effort is useless. <br /> <br /> For the record, QUINTET can at least pretend to be prophetic. The story is centered on a treacherous game played by different bored characters. This is a form of TAG (assassination game): a handful of people are targeted to be eliminated, each as a potential assassin and each as a potential victim. Two or more people can form alliances to kill a third. As they die, new targets are assigned. Whoever lives wins. All this happens in an exotic and inhospitable wasteland. It's, to a large extent, an extreme, sci-fi version of "Survivor" - without the commercial plugs and the "false reality". <br /> <br /> This is not a bad concept for an epic science fiction. A post-apocalyptic setting, a microcosm of the world (distribution is resolutely multinational), a game where no one can trust or at least not long, and where no one really wins. Literally a cold war. A steel-eyed director, with a taste for black humor and violent invention, could have a busy day. The mystery of QUINTET is not in the game nor in the way it is played, but in the reason that it exists everything. If the game "Quintet" is a metaphor for life, Altman seems to see in the material that the possibility of showing that life is an empty game and meaningless - a conclusion as obvious as it is illusory. Given the vivid yet cynical nature of the rest of his various films, I do not believe that Altman believes in QUINTET either. And if Altman has no confidence in his documents, why should we?
