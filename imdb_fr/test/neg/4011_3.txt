I watched it last night at Sundance. Altman must be the most popular director of all time. This show, despite its "power star", is absolutely unconvincing, and its political ideas - with which I am a proud liberal are in no way in disagreement - are superficial and clumsy, and seem uprooted from the headlines of USA Today , despite the fact that it comes out of the mouth of someone as esteemed as Mario Cuomo. The drama, as such, is not very dramatic and the comedy is not funny. The only points of interest, in reality, are to see how New Yorkers live their lives and the loyalty of the actors and the editing team to reconstruct a show that has been stirring up a certain cult since 1988. sometimes the impression that Altman's unique contribution to cinema has been the art of making all your actors speak at the same time, which gives the impression of being depressed as if they were strangers to a marriage.
