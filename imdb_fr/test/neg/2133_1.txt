"Jaws" is stupid, pathetic, boring, badly doubled and stupid. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a shark / octopus creature that appears off Florida and kills some people (including a boring and stupid couple with a whiny woman and a silent husband who stabs himself with a fork for some reason). His rise to the surface is always represented by a vague cliche of something bumpy again and again. It does not make sense, it's horribly boring, and it's a conspiracy that sucks. <br /> <br /> Some moments of the camp can not be ignored: the same shot of the boat of the couple of the opening sequence THREE TIMES; the doctor slammed the chest of a patient dying twenty times with a difibulator without stopping, even if he is obviously dead; the porn-esque soundtrack; the picture of the couple making love on the beach, with three different themes ("Let's go ahead!") doing that; the old computer that looks like Kermit the frog; a scientist who drinks beer shouting "I know!" to Dr. Smith; the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Oh, and everyone drinks at least thirty bears during the movie (very much noticed by Mike and the "Bots"). . . <br /> <br /> The MST3K version is their best episode, but it is certainly better than the movie itself. "That's how I like to go fishing, guys ... with a flashlight and a flamethrower ..." - Raven <br /> <br /> A star for "Devil's Fish" ; seven for the MST3K version <br /> <br />
