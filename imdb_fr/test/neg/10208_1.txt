I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Fortunately for me, nobody knows because I did not make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in theaters, I was happy! My agents were made crazy by the filmmakers (apparently for the first time), rewriting the script every day and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. Later, they told me that once in California (we shot in Atlanta), these "professionals" had 4 Â½ hours of recording! Even edited in 90 minutes, it is at least twice as long as necessary. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise - what a movie mess!
