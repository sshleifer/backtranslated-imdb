Imagine the worst thing that can be imagined by the human intellect. Now imagine something infinitely darker - I mean, worse than that. Then multiply that by the amount of force wind possessed by the Star Wars Holiday Special. This movie is far worse than that. <br /> <br /> "Dracula 3000: Infinite Darkness", featuring actors as famous and famous as Coolio and Langley Kirkwood (as "the terrifying antagonist" of the movie, Count ORLOCK) assimilated to eating his own feces exclusively throughout his life, condensed in about an hour and twenty minutes. To be honest, there is no way to address the criticism of this film tragedy - torn apart by communist propaganda, the promotion of drug use, futuristic anachronisms and perhaps even the worst special effects since ( original) "War of the worlds". The hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union are proudly visible through the dubious scenery that they dare to call a spaceship. Lenin can be observed on several posters throughout the "film". And of course, religion has been abolished for two centuries. Thus, they do not know who this "God" is, even if they do not fear to use His name in vain. But of course, in the Socialist Republic of Space (chaired by Interstellar President Baker), the deadly stick as a drug is legalized and quite commonplace. Yet the mobility of people with disabilities seems even worse than it is today (they do not even have a wheelchair ramp). <br /> <br /> Racial tension has dissipated throughout the galaxy, quite familiar and predictable. We receive excellent comments on ethnic division through lines such as "Is Dracula a brother?", "We must stay together", and "once you are black, you do not go back". Speaking of symbolic black characters, Coolio plays one. By playing with a stereotypical stoner, Coolio becomes perhaps the most boring and ridiculous vampire of all time. Oh, wait, the second most ridiculous vampire of all time. This valuable title goes to our friend COUNT ORLOCK, PLANET TRANSYLVANIA, CARPATHIAN system. These two are a beautiful couple, between Coolio's attempts to paralyze a paraplegic, the strange attempts to make sharp animal sounds, a 1004-year-old hairstyle and the expanses of worthless dialogue of GIGANTIC. and Count Orlock's Halloween-style generic Halloween vampire costume, with a burst of coffins or a puzzling, story-less story. <br /> <br /> One wonders if they have not just given Coolio the opportunity to reach "a kite in space without gravity", let him interact with other "actors "and he left there. <br /> <br /> Count Orlock's motives are also a bit of a problem. Does he want "infinite darkness" as the subtitle of the film would like? Does he want to eat the crew? Or does he want * Coolio * to kill them all? Or does he want to give a chance to people with disabilities in such an inhospitable future? It does not matter, because none of the intrigues of this film makes sense. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is probably its end. Better for the fact that it means that the film is finished only by the merit of the brutal sinking of a climax they called before the credits. Instead of facing Count Orlock in a sort of duel (the closest to us is a gunshot Orlock waving at a dizzying speed in front of our protagonist, who dies shortly after), our heroes beat him by cutting him off. arm in an ordinary way. door. Orlock then collapses, collapsing in pain in a totally banal but naturally painful wound. This is by far the most fun of this movie. Watching the crooked face of a vampire as he cries in pain will put you on the edge of your seat - with bursts of laughter. Almost worth the four dollars for that alone. Of course, right after, we are treated to one of the worst one-liners of the film, the mandatory allusion to sex and perhaps the most aberrant excuse for an end * never *. They are heading towards the sun and their ship literally explodes before they even get close to impact. I think they just passed the Wachowski brothers. for the worst final of all time. <br /> <br /> I can only sleep because we know that a sequel is impossible. Safely, we can say with certainty that this is the worst film ever created, and that it will never be exceeded by poor quality, a reduced budget and a lower talent.
