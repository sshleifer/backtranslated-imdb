After a secret mission to Bucharest to reveal the presence of an international gang of arms dealers, Constable Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is responsible for protecting the Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), widow of the mafia accountant Romanian. However, the criminals have broken into the safe place of the CIA and Sonni realizes that the information has been leaked from within the agency. Alone, trusting only his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Sonni struggles to survive and protect Nadia. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes' career is sloping. I just saw this movie, and this is another disappointing film from this actor, whose career is currently very similar to that of Steven Segal. The film has a lot of explosions, shots and car chases associated with a terrible story and horrible acting. First, the African-American Wesley Snipes is pursued by the Bucharest police, but they never find a black American. I have never been to Romania, but I do not think there are many African Americans in this country. His character does not like to bathe, wearing the same clothes for several days. There is no chemistry between Sonni and the sexy Silvia Colloca, but she freely has sex, falls in love with him and shares his fortune with him. The boy who plays Nadia's son is horrible. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Detonador" ("The detonator")
