In most areas, Naach talks about this dancer / choreographer (Antara Mali) who sees herself as a kind of author, going beyond the small trade compromises that her entourage, including her actor Beau (Abhishek Bachchan), built his career on. Nice idea, but it turns out that she has the most terribly bad concepts in terms of costumes and dance moves, rotten enough for even the forces at the base of these ultra-cheap pottery boilers of the South India wriggle in a serious embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The story follows a predictable pattern inducing a yawn ... a dancer and a beautiful meet and have an adventure (yes, sex included) ... a beautiful wins the success, but she pushes back her attempts to help her ... a beautiful attitude and they walk on each other ... a dancer meets a very unlikely director who asks her to "do what she wants" ... incongruous efforts, a popularity even more incongruous ... handsome attempts to reach out are pushed back to a climax where he explodes how he can not live without her ... D-uh end. <br /> <br /> In fact, I did not really expect this movie to be really good. So why did I watch it? Because I have a fetish Antara Mali. She is an actress with sufficient talent to reach great heights at the IMO, provided she has the opportunity. Alas, his role in the film seems much better on paper than in its real execution, ironic for a film supposed to be a character without compromise. To give him credit, she makes an effort to play and shines well in the few scenes that really ask her to be an actress. I just wish the movie was more worthy of her. Abhishek Bachchan also throws some good shots, the last scene saved a bit by a slow turn that pleasantly reminds his father. <br /> <br /> Only recommended if you can sit through huge piles of dog traps for the return of a few grains of good times thanks to the main actors.
