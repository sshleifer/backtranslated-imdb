This film is the final straw. As two regular fans of the romantic comedy, this film has finally made us understand that nothing good has come out of this genre since Love Actually. The film was not good. It was an affront to love, death and everything else. Including horses and beaches. There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. This film took the spark of Nicholas Sparks. Diane Lane can not act to save her life. She was unconvincing in her laughter, her crying, and her dancing. And she needs a better haircut. There is no reason to watch this movie. Save yourself. The romantic comedy is officially dead.
