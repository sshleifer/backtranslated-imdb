Joe Rogan's whole act is a blasphemy full of bile. He's a potty smoker who went into Fear Factor, thinking it was a joke. He said he would encourage people because he did not know how stupid people would be. The producers of the series he explained had the principle of joking with unsuspecting candidates to see how far they would go. The level of evil involved is a little twisted. Mr. Rogan's special only contains the speeches of someone who is too good for ordinary human beings. I found him offensive and his subjects can be heard by more talented comedians such as Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock. Rogan even makes five minutes on the word N. Overall, skip this special.
