This is a film based on Rob Halford's release of Judas Priest, British Metal Gods, and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who previously led a tribute band at Priest. Originally titled Metal God, this movie could have been great. Instead, someone in an office somewhere who knows almost nothing about metal music has decided to dilute it. From Metal God's title change to the "safe" middle of the road, "Rock Star" to the lame soundtrack, this movie is badly played. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band, I was eager to see this, I was very disappointed by several points of the film. The soundtrack is not very metallic for one, and the end of the movie is also lame. The film has some positives in writing and playing but as a whole, it fails in the end because ... 1) A movie based on a metal band should have a soundtrack. 2) There is NOTHING of metal on Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of ​​"heavy metal", check out this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio & Black Sabbath are your idea of ​​metal, watch this movie for laughs.
