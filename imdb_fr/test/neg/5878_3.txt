Technically speaking, this film is void ... lol. However, it's also hilarious. If it's intentionally funny, I do not know. Horrible in all its aspects, it is also the only movie I know that presents 1) a big boy played by a thin actor in a costume (very obvious), 2) a pretty actress in her 30s playing a character who is supposed to be in his late 60s, and 3) the most compliments for the evergreen garden daisies ever. Do not take this film seriously, but watch it for a laugh .... a good party movie.
