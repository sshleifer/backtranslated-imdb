I will only write more because it is necessary. However, the summary I put on top is far too explicit for what this movie was. You know pretty much who knows about it from the beginning. Despite his attempts at intrigue and flipping - acting "talent" striving to sound shock and dismay when a twist occurs - you never really need to ask yourself what is the "polar" in this "mystery". The more I write, the more I feel bad that I have to write as much to have a comment, but the rules are the rules. I really feel bad about saying that, but it's the lowest I've ever seen in a movie ... I think. I wonder why I keep the votes of 1 and 2. However, I thought this film deserved a 3, because I think there was talent in the film. Johanna Watts (or Watson) did a very good job. She was crying and upset in a game and I thought she was transmitting that emotion. The man who played the character who was "the drummer" also played well. <br /> <br /> Many actors have done a job "ok". But the main actor, David - forgets his last name (terrible with the names) - was rather bad. I think he must have thought he was doing dramatic demonstrations for "The Young and the Restless" or "The Days of Our Life." If you try, you can just imagine it in a white coat, playing the role of a doctor with multiple personalities at the General Hospital. It does not help that the film is even shot as a daytime soap opera. Although I'm sure I can shoot that same movie with a camcorder; but without obvious and tasty sound editing. <br /> <br /> The first time I thought the money to rent this movie was wasted. However, I will not look at it unless I receive a large sum of money.
