Oh my God! Book II is more of a bad remake of the original than a sequel. It's not so funny, its plot plays too much like a failed comedy pilot, and the use of the slogan "Think God" is a different variant of the idea that worked so much better in the original. John Denver did not come back for this movie and it made a BIG difference. George Burns, as wonderful as God, does not have the same chemistry with the little girl as John Denver. <br /> <br /> I would give this film a rating of 3 out of 10, but only for <br /> <George Burns; the rest of the cast is not special. <br /> <br /> If you liked first, do not worry about seeing this one.
