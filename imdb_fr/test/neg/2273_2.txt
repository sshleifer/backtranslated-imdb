Oh yes, I agree with others who describe it as a horror. Playing in this four-hour feature film is consistently bad, to the point that I find it impossible to believe that none of the actors in this production could possibly make a living as an actor. I still wonder who did the casting. Each delivers his lines without seeming to have any type of commitment or emotional investment with another character. None seems to have a real relationship, family or otherwise, with another. The direction is also appalling and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing. Did the film editors sleep? <br /> <br /> The costumes look authentic at the time of the Regency, but the fabrics look like the twentieth century and the colors (especially the blue colors!) Are discordant and I do not think they were available at early nineteenth century fabric except perhaps silk. <br /> <br /> Hair too: men have an obvious haircut from the 1970s, and women have "big hair" --- especially the woman playing Anne Elliot. <br /> <br /> All female characters, young and old, are quite charming but that does not compensate for the lack of acting skills. The actress who plays "Anne" seems to be in her forties, while Anne Elliot is supposed to be 27 years old. I mean, where was the makeup and lighting team if we found the woman playing Anne believable? She spends much of her time looking thoughtfully at the level of the horizon, whether inside or out. I still wonder what it was supposed to convey. Regret maybe? Yes, this production is regrettable! <br /> <br /> The actress playing Louisa was really terrible. She screams, screams, laughs and jumps like a poorly-bred twelve-year-old girl (I apologize to anyone who has read this) that I found myself impatiently waiting for the moment when she was knocked out. How this behavior is supposed to attract an adult man exceeds me. Most would retreat when she opens her mouth for the first time, to laugh and scream. <br /> <br /> The actor playing Captain Wentworth portrays someone who is so bland and so colorless that one wonders why a woman can sting him for eight years. <Br /> <br /> The pairing of the pair at the end is neither done nor explained convincingly. How did they find each other? Not because Louisa was in a coma; for sure. No, there must be more than that and it is not explained in the movie. <br /> <br /> I notice this production as two stars: one because it is the work of Austens and the other because some outdoor scenes were charming. The only reason I could watch all the production was because I had the flu and had it in the library. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, check out the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this movie even if you have not read the book.
