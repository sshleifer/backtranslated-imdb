It's not fair that the film is nil. It's more than that. This movie is just useless. Do we need another Westerner? How about a western with African Americans in title roles? Sounds stupid, implausible and a lame attempt to modernize the genre? It is. Incredibly lame and simple-minded. It's like that bad Baz Luhrman movie "Romeo and Juliet" where he settled in modern times to attract young people and create a hype with the revamping of a classic tale. Well, Baz Luhrman has failed miserably, just like this mess. The story is not really bad, but the very idea of ​​suppressing racism of a racist genre by making an entirely African-American cast is racist in itself. It's also childish and simple-minded (like Baz Luhrman-man, he's a bad director). Hey (I hear you say) this was done by Mario Van Peebles! He is also in the movie! How can he be racist? It's not. I said that the idea of ​​melt all African Americans instead of Caucasians was. The film is not racist, it's just useless, stupid and very, very boring.
