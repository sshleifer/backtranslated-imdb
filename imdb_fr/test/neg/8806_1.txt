I can not believe that Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The plot (and I use that term very vaguely) is centered on an army of rats terrorizing an urban apartment complex - at least I think that's what it was. The script did not make sense, I would not have to worry about the characters and the camera consisted of repeatedly showing shadows of rats standing on their hind legs or running. Running is what I should have done. As an African American, I often read calls from my brothers and sisters to "support African-American films". I try to help, but it's too much. No one should look at garbage like this for any reason. Please, brothers and sisters, do not produce videos directly like these. Please!
