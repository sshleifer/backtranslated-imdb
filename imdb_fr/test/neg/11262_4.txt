I have read and enjoyed many mysteries of Robicheaux by James Lee Burke. When I read "In the Electric Mist with Confederate Deaths" was filmed and Tommy Lee Jones was the main character, I was delighted. After watching her last night, I finally extinguish her at about twenty minutes, not wanting to see people being shot or beaten. Do not get me wrong, I do not care about blood and blood-I love "The Untouchables" and the "Godfather Trilogy". Maybe it was just that I had already seen "Birth" and "What happened" before looking at this. I know that Burke's books are violent, lyrical, and especially in "In The Electric Mist," may look like the Cajun swamps he writes on, full of things that are never fully explained. In a book, it's good. In a movie, it's confusing. Many previous critics are also avid fans of Dave Robicheaux, making it more understandable that they really liked the movie. Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all the actors (and especially Vince), I had the feeling that it was such a waste of their talents: they gave good performances in a film that does not fit. Now I say that, having only seen the American DVD and hoping that Tavernier's editing will make a huge difference. On the plus side: the soundtrack was beautiful. The scenes at Robicheaux were perfect - exactly as I imagined the bait shop. Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie, as was Walter Breaux as a batiste. If you read the books, you will understand why Robicheaux is a person with equal temperament at the beginning of the film and then begins to hit people with various instruments. Overall, I wish they had filmed more "Electric Mist and Confederate Deaths" and omitted much of Robicheaux's interrogation methods, explaining Elrod's gifts and his connection to Dave, as well as Dave's with the general. So I would not feel like I did last night when I turned it off, "What just happened?"
