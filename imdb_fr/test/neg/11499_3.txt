Frederick Forsyth's books are always complicated in such a complex way, with twists and a surprising end. This adaptation had none of that. <br /> <br /> Much of what was great in the book (the story of Monk and the betrayed agents, the plot to influence the outcome of the elections in Russia) was completely missing. adaptation. Instead, there is this completely new conspiracy on biological weapons that was a stick. <br /> <br /> The protagonists of Forsyth have always operated in the shadows, forever just a little out of the reach of the antagonists. The joys of his books have always been the machinations to carry out their mission. This film was resigned very early to shootings and car chases. <br /> <br /> The Swayze monk could just as easily hang a sign around his neck saying, "I AM A SECRET AGENT" for the attention he has attracted on his own. the film. And with all this attention, the time taken by the bad guys to catch up with him was surprising. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film had energy, so I give it a "3" instead of a "1". It was also great to see underused professionals such as Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York and Barry Morse. <br /> <br /> I hope someday someone will do justice to an adaptation of the Forsyth movie such as "Jackal Day".
