Outside Poland, few people have had the opportunity to become acquainted with the brilliant writings of Andrzej Sapkowski. He is very popular in Poland for his fantastic news (I think none of them have ever been translated into English, alas!). In short, Wiedzmin - the protagonist of Sapkowski's books - is a traveling monster-killer, a man of extraordinary strength and skill: he's pretty much your favorite cool guy to the Tolkien. Unfortunately, nobody will realize after watching the movie. 'wiedzmin' the film is just a set of random scenes, featuring wiedzmin and other characters from Sapkowski's writings, but looks nothing like intrigue to the plot and the dramatic rhythm of the original. The fact that some of the film's pictures show pretty naked women does not add any quality. the film gets worse and worse every minute, and does not even meet the requirements of the category "too bad, it's really good". if you are really fantasized and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read the books instead.
