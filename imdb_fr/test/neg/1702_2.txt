I had high hopes for this production, being one of my favorite works. <br /> <br /> In fact, many things are reasonable: Helen Baxendale is not a bad Lady Macbeth, but does not have the devil of which is the original character infused with. Many minor characters are doing well, and the Scottish settings are great. <br /> <br /> The big disappointment for me is Jason Connery in the lead role: he seems to read his lines from a fake card. glasses - surely for the first time, too. He can do so much better. Any production compared to the sublime Ian McKellen (Macbeth 1979) which, in my opinion, gave the performance of reference, will have a hard time to be appreciated, but I fell asleep and I had to go back before being able to pass through - to hardly a good sign. <br /> <br /> Honestly, avoid it.
