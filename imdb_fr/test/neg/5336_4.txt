Before "Miracle on 34th Street", Maureen O'Hara and John Payne directed this film. I was going to describe it, but I can not find words to say how bad this movie was. The adoption of a child and Maureen's disease are both very serious and delicate subjects, but that said, it could have been done much better. His portrait was so extreme that he did not seem at all real. His problem probably started with a weak script. <br /> <br /> Another example of a writer taking a novel and writing a weak movie. (See my review of "A stranger in my arms.") The beautiful O'Hara was often struggling with snippets like this, another being Forbidden Street (Britannica Mews), which I might eventually consider. <br /> <br /> If you have emotional ties to this since your childhood, you will be more friendly with this film rather lifeless, colorless and without brilliance. But for something in the same vein, maybe you can find his TV movie remake. It must be better. It must be.
