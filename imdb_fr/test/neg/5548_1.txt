Well, it irritated my nerves, they understood. I rented this film for the first time in the 80s, when my friend opened a video store offering all the rare films he could find. He also directed all the shock, horror and exploitation films he could draw, and I spent almost every film. Previously, I had seen Blood Feast and 2000 Maniacs, as well as Gore's magician. They were awful (especially for the period), and Gore's wizard was pretty mean. The Gore-Gore Girls, however, is the one I remember as the most horrible of sobs. <br /> <br /> I rented it on DVD some time ago because I wanted to hear the comment and I thought he might have some cool dance and clothes. I had forgotten that it was made in the early 70s. The fashion was therefore deteriorating. I also realized it was a movie that I did not really need to see more than once. There were fun parties, but damn it! It was much more disgusting than in my memories. I am very jaded by the film but sometimes I am too depressed and I have to look away. It was not a good choice of film to put on DVD perfectly clean and cleaned with a better quality of sound and image. The comment is fun in places and interesting (I think HG said the budget was $ 6100.00). Maybe HG Lewis did not feel well that day, but he looked tired and had the guts to take offense from the interviewer of Something Wild in relation to him at Ed Wood Jr. Sorry, but you are not exactly Martin Scorsese yourself. <br /> <br /> The extremely thin plot speaks of a series of murders of go-go topless dancers in strip-tease clubs. A cute journalist and a really unattractive private investigator team up (he does not seem to be able to stand it) to try to solve the crimes. Henny Youngman owns a strip club. A series of really ugly murders take place. <br /> <br /> I will apologize in advance because I do not want to seem to have to lighten my words, but this movie was so misogynistic that p *** left me more than "Company of men". Mainly because the main character and the director hate extreme dislike for women - and the audience - overflows with each image. It's not just murder. The unattractive detective does his best to treat the reporter as a dog filth on every occasion, for no apparent reason (he's not really a threat to George Clooney, as I said) and she always follows him like a puppy. She faints at the sight of a horribly mutilated body and looks at her with disgust, then pours cold soda from a can to her face to wake her up. Later, he calls the police to report the crime - "No ... not in a hurry ... she just seems to have ... lost face." This guy is the hero. You can imagine what other characters think of women. I could go on and on, but you have the idea. Please note that I make this movie look much more politically correct (and much more fun) than it really is. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are not too easy for the eyes, so do not look at the movie just to see the nudity unless you are too picky. The "go-go" dancers all seem desperate to finish the stage in order to get their $ 10 or the current rate that HG paid them and get their dose of drugs. Okay, it's not that bad, there was a dancer who seemed to have been a pro and also another cool dancer with a huge afro who did not look as miserable as the rest, but who was still not too amazed. Some slightly amusing moments were a few brief moments of unintentional humor, such as when a policeman in charge of a murder scene yells angrily: "Get out of here before I stop you all!" not to a group of journalists but to another policeman who is calmly going to work (they mumble and leave, however). However, as Lewis says, Henny Youngman is quite funny, he said his lines were so fast that they almost needed subtitles (I'm sure he was trying to spend all day in a hurry to be able to get paid and get out of there, even though he does not seem to care about watching naked girls). <br /> <br /> Maybe it's worth seeing because of morbid curiosity - at the time the film was shot, it was probably the most macabre movie on the moment - or if you're a big fan of HG Lewis and you find him or you make fascinating low-budget movies. Otherwise, if you've seen it once, you've already seen it and can move on to other low-budget, disgusting but much more entertaining movies from the early '70s ... this movie is not even close to, say "Pink Flamingos" when it comes to the skip-pop-corn factor. If you've never seen a movie from HG Lewis, I recommend you try "Blood Feast" first, you'll have a better time. <br /> <br />
