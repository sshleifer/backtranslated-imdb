He is supposed to be the life of Paul the apostle. He begins with him involved in a pagne fight match with a priest. The Pharisees were so called because they "separated" from the Hellenism imposed on the Jews by their pagan rulers. The fact is that Saul would never have been involved in a Greco-Roman struggle. PERIOD. <br /> <br /> Then we see the two men (Saul and the priest, Reuben - a fictional character totally extra-biblical) who were ridden with water in a Roman bath. Once again, the Torah, to which Saul adhered religiously, was condemned with the utmost firmness, looking at the nakedness of another man. <br /> <br /> Reuben is shown to be the one pushing Saul to destroy the church. Again, the text of the scriptures does not matter, because it is PAUL who says that he devastated the church and uttered threats and slaughtered the church. <br /> <br /> The film shows Barnabas "sprinkling" Paul - not baptizing him (immersing him), when the text of Scripture says it was Ananias who did it. <br /> <br /> There is no mention of Mark or his return, so the writers of the screenplay are obliged to do so Paul and Barnabas fight over Paul's desire to preach in Rome as a basis for their separation. <br /> <br /> No Silas during Paul's second and third missions; No Timothy ... NEVER. No Titus; No Apollos ... No, NO, NOOOO !!! It is said that James "has known Jesus for a long time" rather than saying, as does the text of Scripture, that he is the brother of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Why not just call the movie "Frank, the fictitious apostle?!?!" At least, that would be closer to the text of Scripture.
