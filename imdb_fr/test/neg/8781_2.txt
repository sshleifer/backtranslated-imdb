This film contains the worst acting performance of all time. Spilsbury lacks energy for the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us. I never once felt in this movie that Spilsbury was worried about anything. Revenge, love, justice? Not in the representation of this guy. <br /> <br /> There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot did not force them to be friends, you do not feel like they want to spend time together. In addition, the friend has the most interesting personality. Ewww. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> The narration is incredibly bad and if you know the dukes of Hazzard, you can imagine what it looks like. I can not believe the director would agree with that. This insulted me as a spectator by explaining each plot I have just witnessed. <br /> <br /> Hey, at least the horses and locations looked good, maybe that's what happens when you hire a director of photography as director. You may be able to watch this one for fun or to show an alien what a bad movie is.
