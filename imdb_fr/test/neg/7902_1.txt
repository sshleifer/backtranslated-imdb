Wow it's really stereotypical, terrible trash. I'm sorry for all those who may have wasted their money watching it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure I did not laugh once during this movie. I just can not believe they would make such a terrible movie. <I will now be more suspicious when watching late-night movies. <br /> <br /> It's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm not saying it's the worst movie ever (though it may be), but I do not think I've seen anything so stupid and evil in my life. this makes the Scary Movie series intelligent. <br /> <br /> 1/10 I would give him a 0 if they let me.
