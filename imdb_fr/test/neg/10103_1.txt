Act with the worst special f / x I've ever witnessed. It's bad enough that I've lost $ 3 to look at this shitty pile of shit, but it's the last hour and a half that I could have done other than getting a root canal or wearing myself volunteer to be part of a jury. Getting drunk could not even help this video. <br /> <br /> Frankly speaking, I honestly think I lost some IQ points during the visualization of this crazy "work" that numbs the mind! Maybe I should have followed my own advice this time. Never expect a movie worthy of the name if it's written, directed and produced by the same person and you NEVER expect anything of value to Jeff Fahey.
