Every year, the company called Nu produces some "action-packed", "suspenseful" movies. This little nugget, called Shadowcaster III (before I visited this site, it was a complete trilogy), is a great example of the good work that society does. Frank Zagarino is as mean as ever and does an excellent job almost indestructible (?), Schizophrenic (??) android. I will not lose words anymore because I do not want to reveal the plot and spoil you a few laughs. <br /> <br /> Note 2/10 (Revard for these hard-working technicians Man, the implementation of this kind of waste must be a real headache.)
