"Three" is a wrecked movie. Posing as a psychological thriller, his closest relative is "Dead Calm", monumentally superior (also starring Billy Zane). "Dead Calm" provides well-designed characters to look for, including the grieving parents of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman who are trying to redefine their relationship on a deep-sea cruise. They end up being terrorized by the psycho-killer at the time. derives from Zane. He offered a sharp suspense and more and more hooked, a frightening feeling of claustrophobia in open sea while the game of cat and mouse staged life and death. <br /> <br /> "Three" suffers from a poorly drawn characterization (the audience does not care what happens to them), a stupid and useless voodoo intrigue device, a total lack of suspense or of excitement and some dull noises, martial performances of the main actors. Zane in particular goes above in an irritating way. In "Dead Calm", he was threatening, trendy and bubbling with barely controlled sexual violence. He is here overflowing, petulant and scruffy. And where does he find his seemingly inexhaustible stock of dry cigarettes and cigars? And how is it that his lighter remains full of juice for over a year? Mrs. Brook is very picturesque, incredibly pretty, but her chest and back seem to have been over inflated by some sort of life raft pump. However, they manage to act with more skill and conviction than the rest of her. Dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the word, she is not. The guy who plays the voodoo manual, the third component of this sad triangle, could have been replaced by a piece of driftwood - no one would notice. In fact, judging by its total inability to dialogue in a meaningful and dynamic way, driftwood represents a potential improvement in distribution issues (excuse pun.). <br /> <br /> In addition, the landscape is beautiful and pleasant. cinematography (above and below water) is credible. <br /> <br /> I guess his theatrical release was very limited (if any) or went directly to the rental and retail DVD. The reason is that it is not very good. If you want something decent in this way, get yourself "Dead Calm". It was made by people who knew a little cinema.
