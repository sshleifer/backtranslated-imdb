While the film was beautifully shot and reasonably well played, the screenplay was monotonous. stomp and nothing we have ever seen before. Not once in this film did I feel that these people were really in danger. No notable highlight and a very standard resolution. I think these types of movies have been exaggerated and should be put to rest. After all, has not everyone on the planet seen "Schindler's List"?
