I thought maybe I laughed a few laughs of this long film, but unfortunately I was disappointed. This film talks about the losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing grade without even trying to open a book or do anything. The film also described the teachers and the director, Mary Tyler Moore (Mrs. Stark), "Labor Pains", 2000 as complete idiots. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but it never made me laugh and I thought the whole movie was a total waste of time! However, all the actors did excellent performances and had the difficult task of making this film a pleasant and entertaining film! Just studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to go!
