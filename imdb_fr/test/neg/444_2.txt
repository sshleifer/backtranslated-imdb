God, that was fearing. You can not end a horror movie in a happy family setting. Yeash. I was a little ambivalent in going to the last act. But my god. He did not have to kill the girl, she is not dead, the ghost father appears with a cure (which makes no sense, because his spirit would have been released after the young man shot down killed all wicked werewolves). What a piece of junk. It's the worst horror film I've seen in a long time, and I've watched a lot of horror movies. It's a slap for Landis and all those involved in the American werewolf in London. Blegh. I hope this has ruined the career of all of them except Julie Delphy. And CGI: A new and chic genre in 1997, but today it seems rather dull compared to the artful work of prosthesis / makeup in London. Anyway, I'm done, I hope I've scared a few people. Get the original instead, if not the Howling. Or, failing that, look at American Idol again. Do not look at this mess.
