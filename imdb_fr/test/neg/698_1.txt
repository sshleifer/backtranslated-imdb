I really like that but The Cell was one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. While about 25% of my audience came in and out of the theater during the screening, I was stupid enough to hold on. The main problem of this story (there were too many to list everything) is that with this type of movie, you have to do two things ... first, fear the killer (since they catch him twenty minutes in the film gone) and you have to give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you really want her to reach it in time or not. Not only did I lose track of the girl, but I was given such a glimpse that she was just a blurry face. When I remembered it was part of the story and I did not care what had happened to her. Although visuals are interesting in a sort of LSD flashback, they often have no meaning and this should be a lesson: the visuals can not compensate for the lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example) . to know or worry about what was happening with the women kneeling in this field and looking at the sky? Ridiculous.
