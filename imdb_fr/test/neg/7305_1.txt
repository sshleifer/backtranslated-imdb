Okay, let's get straight to the point - I can not give anything other than 1 in 10; and yet you have to see it! The acting is bad, but nothing is as serious as the scenario, which pales before production values. Cardboard axes? yes, we have then. Car floor mats painted silver and used as armor? here it is! <br /> <br /> The film itself claims to be artistic, but is not expensive; the same shots are used repeatedly - especially in stretched combat scenes; there is (thankfully!) very little dialogue, and there is a lot of 'artistic' music to convey the horror at home! can say that you have seen it. I have not even touched on bare sets, intrigue or ludicrous special effects; it's really the film school "how not to do it". This must be taken into account - spread the word and let the whole world come together to understand what is happening at the end of the planet. <br /> <br /> The best thing, though, is that they did a sequel.
