This brief review does not contain any spoilers since the film is spoiling. It is wooden and pedantic. He has no saving grace. If someone invites you to his home to watch "Mr. Imperium", do not go there. Even the title of the film is appalling and suggests hogwash. The plot is so bad that it could lead Mother Theresa to despair !!! It was not a stroke that led to the rapid disappearance of poor Ezio, it was because he had to act in this clunker that brought him in. He must have haunted him for the rest of his life. Maybe he was a foreign enemy and wanted to take revenge on the Americans for his imprisonment? He found an ideal vehicle for his anger in this parody.
