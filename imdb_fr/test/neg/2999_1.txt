Usually, it is me who criticizes Neanderthals in their twenties for not being able to enjoy a film if they do not have plastic films, shootings and car chases. However, in this case, the movie might have been improved with some of these additions. At least I was not bored after an hour and I had not changed channels. <br /> <br /> It does not bother me to be surreal, and I certainly do not mind having to pay attention to the search for subtlety or hidden meaning, but there should be a point to it . I did not get the impression that even the writer or director really had a broad vision of anything, but was rather so engrossed in his own pretentious vision that he deliberately dispersed. Or maybe they just got confused. Anyway, I do not care. It bothered me for a little over an hour without any hello. <br /> <br /> While many other viewers have filled this site with enthusiastic delirium about the so-called symbolism and mastery of cinematography, I respectfully disagree. Maybe I have not practiced enough in cinema classes to appreciate inspired techniques not visible to mere mortals ... <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie was just shit. <br /> <br /> I give him a "1" and class him next to "Ishtar".
