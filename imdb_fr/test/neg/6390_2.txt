This film just arrived in Mexico and as I read very good reviews about it, I decided to go watch it with my friends and my girlfriend, but I was very disappointed. I do not understand how people can rate 10/10. I'm talking about scenario. and the staging was beautiful, but a good movie generally needs a good story, which was totally lacking in this movie. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed several Asian and European drama movies, but they had a good story, watch this movie as you please. At your own risk unless you are from Eastern or Orthodox Europe, I do not think you will like it. <br /> <br /> Half of the people left on the theater left, including my 4 friends who waited outside because they were really bored. I'm still waiting until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film, the pace was extremely slow, with lots of time-wasting scenes, the whole story could have been shown in less than 40 minutes, but they extended the session by having scenes of the monk taking coal, about 15 minutes of the total movie plus panoramic views and so on, until they make a really boring feature film. <br /> <br /> I recommend you listen to me if you watch it come back and that comment is useful after all. help people avoid this waste of money.
