ROAD HOUSE 1948 of 20th Century Fox is not only a stupid black, but also an immensely improbable movie. Filled with unconvincing cardboard characters, it is written furtively by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco, who would be much more expected. Miscast is Ida Lupino in the lead role! Lupino, a woman who can do as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is here under the illusion that she is Rita Hayworth, playing the role of a sexy torchbearer in a bar. The beautiful Cornel Wilde because his lover is as wooden as usual and totally ruined by the talented Celeste Holm whose role is a little more than a part. Then we have Richard Widmark who has the most ridiculously written part of the photo! When we see him for the first time, he is a handsome O.K. guy who runs a burgeoning Road House. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not explicit enough - he becomes wildly jealous of his manager (Wilde) when he tells him he is about to marry Lupino. You see, Widmark wanted to marry him himself but - 1) he never offered him - 2) they never had a relationship (they did not even have anything that looks like a love scene together) and - 3) without telling anyone (including Lupino) he got a marriage license. Wow! So how did Widmark get something like marital bliss with Lupino after such a "courtship"? Huh? Well, I'm sorry to announce that Widmark collapses over the whole affair. From there, the character of Widmark becomes involuntarily comical! His loss of balls so early in the procedure is totally implausible and unconvincing. He finally gets past the edge, becomes completely deranged and, with some sneers from Tommy Udo, he will ridiculously shoot at poor Cornel Wilde before biting the dust himself. <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough of a film for you - the image is also ruined by constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. There is not a single shot in the open air throughout the movie! In addition, 95% of the film takes place at night. <br /> <br /> In addition to an interactive press kit and a photo gallery, the extras also include a featurette "Widmark & ​​Lupino At Fox". All that motivated such a documentary is beyond me! As far as I know, they had never been together before in a movie at Fox or anywhere else! However, this star is organized by weight experts such as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and a few others who praise astonishing praises on this tedious and provoking affair. All I can say then it must be me, I guess. But "Road House" was until now a black forgotten and buried and, in my opinion, it should have remained so. <br /> <br /> Fox would do better to publish Widmark DVDs of superior quality and so elusive so far. films like "Down To The Sea In Ships" (1949) and the colorful "Red Skies Of Montana" (1952).
