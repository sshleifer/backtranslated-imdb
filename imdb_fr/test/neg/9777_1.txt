When I saw the poster at the theater, I thought it was a "new line" of a horror story without a famous cast that deserves to be tried. But after my entry, I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. There were many nonsense and logical faults. For me, it's a movie that is not worthy of being theatrical. It's not even worth seeing.
