All right, let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes in a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the trilogy Between the Cheeks), featuring a wrestler named Kane, and waits a little slice of art on a gold platter. If this is the case, you will probably have to find something other than watching movies to fill your time. <br /> <br /> So what exactly do we expect from a film like this? Well, here's what I could not wait to see: <br /> <br /> 1) Bad acting. 2) A rather inexistent and clich√© story. 3) Kane strolling with a pinched, sour face that indicates that his nostrils have just found the potato salad he lost a month ago. 4) Tons and tons of gore. <br /> <br /> Well, if you crave entertainment "so bad that it's funny" then it could satisfy your appetite because it offers you all the benefits. <br /> <br /> Of course, movies like this are the best ones for free, but if you choose to sacrifice dollars at the box office, have fun and make a game. Filmmakers have the kindness to introduce each of the troublesome offenders to us by displaying their names and their infractions to the law. This allows you to write more easily which ones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see which predictions are the most accurate. <br /> <br /> I also suggest to you and your friends to write every moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Count them at the end and see who has the most. I think my grand total was 107; can you beat that? Personally, I want to know how, after a fire and a fire of 35 years, this abandoned hotel still has electricity, running water and a lift in working order? <br /> <br /> I know, I know, filmmakers assume that if you pay to see this, it's obvious that you do not give much importance to what you are spending and therefore it is little likely that the movie is ridiculous, but that does not mean we can not report it or laugh. <br /> <br /> I also love the way the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any wise inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh. <br /> <br /> I think you know pretty much what to expect, but I feel the need to warn you of some warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction, regardless of the movie, you may want to stay away. People in the audience acted as if they were at a real show of struggle. Shouts of "Kill him, Kane!" and "I hope you die first!" and "Chokeslam!" echoed throughout the theater, showcasing what I hope is not the best of what America has to offer. Usually, I do not appreciate such interaction with the audience, but for a cheese festival like this, I thought the comment added to the value of entertainment. However, I can see how others might be embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Second, and this should not even justify an explanation, the movie does not fear the gore. If watching a big, ugly guy tearing eyeballs just from their sockets does not scream "fun night at the movies!" for you then you know very well how to save your dough. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on the part of Kane. I did not expect him to work in a theater clinic, but I was hoping he would have a nice little slogan like "Say goodnight" (his character's name is "Goodnight") just before killing a victim. Instead, he uttered four words throughout the movie - "Nooooooo!" and "I see it." But hey, he delivered them without fault! <br /> <br /> If I were a villain in a movie, my slogan would be something like "Place your BETTS!" or "All bets are off!" <br /> <br /> He would reign and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror movies like See No Evil, which gives rise to so many unintentional laughs that you almost have to call them comic. Do not hesitate to send me your suggestions. For the moment, we will call them HOR-Larious!
