This film has good performances, as others have pointed out, but suffers (as others have pointed out, with the exception of people who are apparently friends of the filmmaker or casting to explain otherwise why they consider this a "10") from some conscious and egocentric film school paddling and excess This is the kind of plot that Sex In The City could handle in a half-hour episode, so there was no reason for it to be even an 88-minute movie. Fast-forward editing in the first third of the movie is a perfect example of a lost movie. Part of the story is deserved, but for example, we spent too much time on the character of Daria with the boyfriend anal sex and on the previous story of Paulie, who was not a realistic character, well that the actor did a decent job with the lines he was given. <br /> <br /> The worst aspect of the film was the level of amateur roles: typing errors in typed text with bad jumps and changes, poor camera positions, angles, lighting problems and script written with a poorly developed concept. If the writer (and also the director and director) had collaborated with someone, he might not have gotten 100% Rotten Tomatoes, which again confirms anyone's ability to sincerely believe who granted him a 10. grading system here.
