This film is in a dead tie with the original for the worst film ever made. I think this one can be slightly worse, if anything. ALERT SPOIL !!! Here are these survivors on a ship that has been capsized for a long time. Unlikely? Not impossible. The principle is so laughable not to be funny. There are some really big names in the movie, and even they could not save this sorry thing. I think it's really a waste of good celluloid. After seeing this, I also unfortunately decided it was a waste of time. Do not bother with this one. Or the original elsewhere! I gave him a 2, mainly because they cast 1 votes.
