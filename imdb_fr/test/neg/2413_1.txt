So, I give him a star for real quality, but I would give him eight and a half hours for the greatest pleasure. "Young Warriors," an incredibly strange hybrid of sexual comedy and vigilante thriller, is exactly the kind of bad movie you hope to find when you search the video fringe, but do it so rarely. It starts with about half an hour of crazy jokes, sexual jokes and juicy shenanigans (including an olive in the martini joke that you have to see to not believe it). Then, the younger sister of the main character is raped by a group of swarthy bikers (an unpleasant scene that prevents me from giving a score of 10 for entertainment - rape is not entertainment!), And the main character get the rest of her sex crazy. brothers to help clean up the city, find the bikers responsible and kill all the criminals they meet along the way. <br /> <br /> It's a hilarious and nonstop entertainment, apart from the unpleasant rape scene, and is essential for any serious bad movie fan. Believe me, I've spent a lot of time on these things and it's one of the best. Highlights include a wonderful visit to the library, a big slow-motion shootout in a shady bar (with the picture of a guy blowing his foot, it's quite impressive), a couple of casual actors whistling (Richard Roundtree, Ernest Borgnine), a couple of semi-famous recognizable faces (Lynda Day George, Cree Queen Linnea Quigley), and a couple of parents of famous people (the brother of Chuck Norris, Mike, the Van Clan member Patten, James). He even has one of those great "What have we become?" type in morality lesson purposes, although the turning point comes when the fratboys of the guns shoot down two kids who rob a shop with a toy gun. I always wondered why it was the catalyst that brought the hero to think. after all, whether they were children and not hardened criminals, whether they have a real gun or not, they always stole a store, so as far as I know, it was just another job well done for our activist monitoring the boys, no? Wonderful stuff. Highly recommended, do not blame me when you enjoy it despite yourself.
