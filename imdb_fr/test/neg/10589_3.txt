This one is a bad attempt to spin the old thread "counter-turning well", which we have seen so many times before. It actually reminded me of the American series "The Players", although far from so good. Omar Epps is absolutely not convincing because the tough man of the group, just like Ribisi, who tries to become the funny guy gets lost along the way. The performance of the Danes, however, was decent, and you can see on this performance why it was retained in Terminator 4. <br /> <br /> The MOD Squad is a film that is in a kind of gray area between serious thriller and comedy. Sometimes it's taken seriously, but at other times he tries to be funny, but fails miserably. The film has an impression of half-finish: you were stretched to 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> You will be disappointed.
