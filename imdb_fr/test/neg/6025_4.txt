Since characters begin with "unknown" identities, they are not identified by name. So you start with the handsome James Caviezel waking up in a warehouse. He discovers that the place is locked. Do not ask, the windows are safety glass and it is impossible to get out. Four other waking men make a quintet - Mr. Caviezel in his "Jean Jacket", Barry Pepper in a "Ranger Shirt", Greg Kinnear with a "Broken nose", Joe Pantoliano as president "Bound Man" and Jeremy Sisto shot and "handcuffed man". Oh, man ?? <br /> <br /> These five men have collective amnesia. They think that three of them are kidnappers and two of the victims - but they do not know who is who or who is who. Forgetting is due to a pipe leak. Do not ask - it happens.

Peter Stormare, the criminal element's gang leader, in "Snakeskin Boots", is also on the way to the stage. <br /> <br /> As stated in the DVD synopsis, "Secrets are revealed and clues revealed" (the five men) must struggle with time to know who is good and who is wrong to stay This story reads much better than a film, unfortunately, when the secrets are finally revealed and the memories become clear, there is not much interest in what happened. , director Simon Brand has a great idea of ​​Matthew Waynee's idea, but clutter up investments in characters who hold the short end of the stick. <br /> <br /> **** Unknown (11/1 / 06) Simon Brand ~ James Caviezel, Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, David Selby
