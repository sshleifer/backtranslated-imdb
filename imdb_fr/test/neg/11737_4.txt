The 1998 version of "Psycho" was to be replaced in the 1960s rather than today. The headliners would have done a good job with the setting. There were two scenes that went off like a sore thumb. The first was at the beginning of the film when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. His boss took his client to his office because "it was air conditioning". I imagine most of Arizona's businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) and Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Lila sporting the Walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie. The film scared a number of spectators in the theater.
