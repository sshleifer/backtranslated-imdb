I loved the first 15 minutes and some of the court's dialogues - which turned out to be the best showcase of the gameplay technique of the director's vanguard - but this film is ultimately disappointing. Even viewed only as a metaphor for the oppressive / oppressed dynamics that prevailed and prevails in the relationship between the US government and its more "disobedient" citizens, it still lacks punch and credibility, and finally let me look my watch in hope an obvious end would already happen. <br /> <br /> And for the record: despite rumors to the contrary, this film has never been banned in the United States (I can not comment on rumors of British censorship, but am suspicious). Hollywood refused to distribute it after its first screening at the festival, and I am more than willing to believe that the Nixon government has influenced this decision. However, the fact that he never appeared on American television only reflects the rather cautious and advertising-oriented mode of operation of this medium. For now, you can have your own copy of the DVD delivered to you via Amazon in a few days.
