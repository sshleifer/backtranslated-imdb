While crossing the canal, I arrived at a channel 124. It is an urban channel. I saw this movie and decided to try it. I almost became a mass murderer because of this movie. I made movies at home and they are Oscar-worthy compared to this huge Dookie mass. The lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely relentless. I would rather look at Star Crystal ....... Sacred cow, this may not be a good example. The main question I have about this movie is ... Was it a movie about morality? The reason I ask this question is because there was a phrase where this lady in a wheelchair was saying "I would have been another gang statistic" Oh, my head is starting to hurt. After hearing this sentence, I went into the kitchen and took out a knife, ready to stab anyone who dared watch this movie. But some sense has started and I just changed channels to look at the man with afro painting. That's all I have to say about this movie. If you want to bear this pain, go ahead but do not recommend it for those who have short fuses or a bad case of turtles
