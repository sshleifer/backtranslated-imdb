It's an entertaining film. I suggest you rent it, buy a few gallons of rum and invite the whole crew for this one. My favorite parts were.1. the fights that were so well choreographed that John Woo himself was jealous, .2. Wonderful special effects .3. acting and .4. The fact that every gangsta in the movie seemed to make a bad identity theft "Scarface". I mean, Master P as a Cuban godfather! It is a revolutionary territory. And with well-written dialogues including lines such as "the only difference between you and me, Rico is that I'm alive and you're dead," this film is truly a masterpiece. Yes indeed.
