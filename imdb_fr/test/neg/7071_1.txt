This movie was such a mess that I actually repaid my friends I was hanging around to see him. The only reason I went to see this was because my friend was an apprentice editor on the set. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie was supposed to be campy, but the approach was too heavy and self-reflexive, it turned out to be really flat. Judd Nelson plays the role of an obsequious scavenger who is a hack comedian on the side. His life is infernal and aggravated by his hateful and domineering companion, Bill Paxton (for whom I feel embarrassed - it was a really tasteless role for a talented actor). An abnormal accident changes Nelson's course and causes chaos. <br /> <br /> The attempts at humor were ridiculous, predictable and often vile and tasteless. Wayne Newton in distribution as a talent agent is a novelty, but he adds nothing - comically or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a very weak and unconventional attempt at camp humor that passes like a lead ball. At least you could laugh at Plan 9 from outer space. This one makes you wonder who thought it was a pretty good idea to finance and film. One of the worst bombs of all time you'll ever see.
