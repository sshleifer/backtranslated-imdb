Veteran television producer Ted Post tells a painful, confusing and ultimately useless story from column B of Harold Robbins' Big Book Of Plots. Jaclyn Smith, post-Charlies Angles, plays the role of "the woman whose eyes are always mysteriously obscured", while JFK's imitator, James Franciscus, walks around the edges. <br /> <br /> Mannix goes to the west, the monkeys are mistreated, the models lean against classic cars, and Smith is consistently outclassed by Sybil Danning until the giallo style puts an end to the mess. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and Bob Mitchum is here too. Somewhere.
