This is another of those fundamentalist Christian movies that hit you in the head with religion as a sledgehammer. You know that you are in trouble when the configuration of the story is completely ridiculous. Three men fly to Mexico to deliver Bibles. This makes no sense since the church is Protestant and most Mexicans are Catholic. The Protestant and Catholic Bibles are not the same. The Catholic Bible contains books that do not appear in the Protestant Bible. I also find it hard to believe that churches in Mexico do not give them Bibles. I can understand if they went to a place where Christianity is a minority. But Mexico is far-fetched. If you can not believe the configuration of a story, you will not do the rest of the story either. A film about religion can be entertaining, but not this movie.
