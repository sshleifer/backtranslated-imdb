From now on, all fans of Blaxploiation will recognize the ingredients: big Afros, topless babies, thoughtless fashions and jovial comments. In this case, add a track that can not act, a conspiracy that makes no sense, editing by a person with no blindfolded hands and the most terrible fighting scenes and you have "TNT Jackson" . Not bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad, it's a wonderful mess from start to finish. I particularly liked the endless errors of continuity and the white doubling of the mine. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that the Far East martial arts are experiencing the black power that hurts, but hey, it hurts so much! I am ashamed to admit that I almost loved that.
