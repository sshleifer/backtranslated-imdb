The French make either pro-Marxist films or anti-Marxist films - with a few in between. "Thanks for the chocolate" is the last of its kind. From the opening credits telling the viewer what music will be played and who composes who composed, you know you'll be wrapped up in middle class pretensions. It's an old man's movie with over 40 years old. It is also performed by an old man with an old crew who has nothing to say about life. The plot is not only banal but absurd. How many movies reveal the plot through dialogues only to repeat the same message by flashback five minutes later? Maybe the director and the actors had a low retention capacity? In truth, their plot is not tenable. It's an enigma with holes like a good piece of French cheese. <br /> <br /> Whether intentional or not, it's a film about the bourgeoisie. At least a third of the film is devoted to the piano and the pretentious ruckus adopted in each scene. I admit that certain shots are well framed, even if they could not have used a stable camera in this film; that would have them all awake! Apart from the fact that this is an absurd story, the film allows the upper middle class to assert its values ​​and its vanity in a very comfortable Swiss place. Rodolphe Pauly tells Anna Mouglalis that she does not need to lock her car in the station! Oh my God. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, Miss Huppert comments on how to shed a false tear for a scene. Smiling, she said, "Like in the studio of the American actor!" I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the cast could learn from the actor's studio. <br /> <br /> If there's a statement in my head, it's when Huppert says, "We have friends for the weekend, and all the servants are gone." They had no doubt all escaped this numbness, for fear of being associated with such a dreadful movie. <br /> <br /> Note on medical safety.In the film, they show a burning with hot water covered with ointment and bandage.This should never be done.Only cold water should be used. <br /> <br /> Less 10 points.
