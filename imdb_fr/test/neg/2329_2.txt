A co-worker told me to watch this film because he considered it one of the best movies of all time. So I watched it. First of all, I have to admit that I do not like mainstream movies and that I prefer to watch movies with real meaning. <br /> <br /> And that's why I do not like this movie. It does not mean anything. It's just a combination of funny, stupid, boring, entertaining, absurd and thrilling pieces. <br /> <br /> At first, I imagined that this film could be a true mystery thriller (as read the German packaging), but the film It was too mysterious for me. <br /> <br /> David Lynch can perhaps combine the most different images, but the composition seems to me as delicious as a combination of milk and beer. The two for themselves are very good, but together?
