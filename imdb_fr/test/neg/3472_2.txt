To get an idea of ​​the Roman Empire, watch the BBC's excellent TV series "I, Claudius". It's just bad. The acting was pathetic and you could almost see the actors watching the camera. Hans Matheson was irritating. The cheese factor was so high that it favored constipation during repeated visits. Even Caligula was tamed. I think this film was silently supported by "religious" groups that will remain nameless;). The obvious tones of Christian favoritism and persecution were blatant if it suggests something. Stay away from everything you do - the run time is so long that I was able to read Harry Potter's first book faster than the time it took to see this tripe. <br /> <br /> Italy did better - do not let Hans pretty face fool you. He's not a great actor ... it's a big problem.
