Have you heard of the clone redundancy theory that a copy is poorer than the original? Caddyshack 2 is a perfect example. They try to duplicate everything since the first movie. Now, in a few cases, it works. Robert Stack is actually a bit better than Ted Knight, when they play essentially the same character. In fact, I like Randy Quaid, who is neither more nor less offensive than Bill Murray in the original. But Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield, and worse yet, C2 has shown once and for all that Dan Ackroyd is one of the worst actors in comedy ever. There are very few things I like, and C2 has put a stop to his "comic" career as far as I'm concerned. He seems to be feeling the same, sticking more to Tuffy as Driving Miss Daisy and hosting Psi-Factor. Apart from that, it's mostly "That's it, it's done" for Caddyshack 2. Look at the original two times rather than each version once and you'll get more for your rental money.
