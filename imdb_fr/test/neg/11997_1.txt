This film started very tense when a poor young boy was caught by a pack of wild dogs. After a running race, he is saved by the said grandfather with a magic whip. <br /> <br /> We are then presented with a group of boring housemates, including a pie that is still half-dressed. During this phase, the film accentuates the tension with strange "plinky plinky" background noises that left me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> I stopped paying attention for a while, but when I looked at the screen, there were strange things like creatures that grunt and kill. A tip if you're stuck in your house by a nut: get some cardboard and a tray. <br /> <br /> Although we skipped half of the film, it was totally uninteresting and unforgettable. are now at the amazing conclusion, the last thing of the surviving creature is fighting a "Whip Duel" with the grandfather and his magic whip. I will not say what's going on here, but I can say that the whip battle is full of tension, with aerial combat, multi-level battles and all sorts of tragedies. <br /> <br /> I will now push this film through the door of a neighbor I do not like.
