I think this program is a waste load. They just argue and slap in the face and they call it play ?! These people receive a lot of money for this and most of them can not even act to save their lives. In addition, the stories are awful and after watching for a few minutes, I'm fed up. I like the way Harry Hill takes the mickey out of him on his TV show 'TV Burp' for example. The weak joke "The Princess with the Pea is not exactly Shakespeare, is it?" who had Sonia and Naomi in the stitches. I do not see how funny it is. I think this is a waste of everyone's money for his television license, which allows to display it 4/5 days a week. Is there nothing better than that?
