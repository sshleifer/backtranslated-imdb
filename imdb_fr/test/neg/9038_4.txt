Although it's not really terrible, this film is largely a waste of time and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of Beach Boys history. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie would have you believe that Mike Love was the brain behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psychopath. In fact, none of the characters are developed beyond a one-dimensional parody, but it's a TV movie so what are you waiting for? The stinky stink of Mike Love is ubiquitous in this turkey as he tries to rewrite the story with himself in the role of group figurehead and resident genius. Yes, as if ... <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the music is excellent. Unlike the previous Beach Boys bio-photo "Summer Dreams", this movie actually contains real Beach Boys music, rather than anemic versions of recovery ... In addition, it presents a surprising number of rarities related to Beach Boys and Tracks Listened to - The sun rays "I live for the sun" being just one example. <br /> <br /> This film was originally broadcast in two parts on an American television channel. The first part is the superior of the two and documents the beginnings of Boys and his ascent. In the second part, the character of Brian Wilson has become a simple cartoon and the actor seems to play for a laugh - but how could anyone take this shit seriously? If you're not a fan of Beach Boys, you probably will not get much from this film, except for an extremely distorted and one-sided view of the band's story. But again, why would you look at this if you were not a fan?
