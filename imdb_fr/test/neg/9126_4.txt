The latest frames of the original "American Graffiti" provide one-line summaries of the fate of the four central characters of the film. Although somewhat sexist in omitting the female characters, the end of the original film provided all the information about these people that even the most ardent fans of the film would like to have. However, someone felt that mega dollars could be created by detailing the sad life of these characters after the end of the original movie. Bad movement. Making an insurance salesman and his wife, a nerdy soldier in Vietnam, a drag driver and a hippie invaded by interesting characters in interesting situations far surpassed the talent of those who wrote this almost unassailable film. While most of the original cast are back, with only Richard Dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away, "More American Graffiti" is a mess of silly situations that involve protests, car races, singers country and the Vietnam War. The use of separate screens, once considered innovative and daring, is too much used to distract and add to the confusion that already reigns. This is a sequel that shows almost everything that can go wrong with a sequel. Perhaps it should be seen in film schools. Even the use of period music, which was a pleasure in the original, is poorly made here. If you want more "American graffiti", see the original twice.
