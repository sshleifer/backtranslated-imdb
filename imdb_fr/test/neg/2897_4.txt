I have never seen the other two movies "Ninja" and all I know is known, but for some reason, I watched this one. It starts fast enough as this ninja launches into a great slaughter. It is almost impossible to stop because it takes a lot of bullets to defeat him. However, he is not absent for the account when he ends up owning a woman and he then pursues his deadly methods by using it as a tool. Another ninja enters the fray and apparently, the only way to kill a ninja is to do it with another. This leads to a great battle in the end when the dead ninja enters his body and comes out in an all-out war. It sounds better than in reality, but at least it was not boring.
