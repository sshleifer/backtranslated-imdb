It's hard to imagine two actors of a class and experience such as Michael Caine and Michael Gambon getting involved in such a clumsy and embarrassing film. The responsibility for this misguided production lies with writer Neil Jordan and director Conor McPherson. I doubt I have seen such a bad movie with such good credits for a long time. The actor, Dylan Moran, who made his mark as an irritating and incompetent bookstore owner in the TV series Blackbooks, follows a bit of the same routine here, except with an excess and a lack of comic control that would leave him feeling bad. 'easy. It's easy to see how the story could have worked, because the situation is interesting and full of comic potential. A classic actor (Cain) tries to remove the crowd (Gambon et al.) With the help of a fool colleague (Moran), with predictable results. It could have and should have been good. Unfortunately, this was not the case.
