It is an extremely boring and slow film. We can feel sympathy for Tomek, who is socially and sexually inexperienced and clumsy, but Magda's motives are pretty hard to see and the end, at least for me, was impenetrable. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's why we all need love, but I'd better make a good Busby Berkeley. <br /> <br /> I am told that comments must be at least ten. I will add to the background some interesting pictures of the relationship between Polish citizens, government employees and institutions. I wonder if it's supposed to portray that before or after the collapse of the communist government. <br /> <br /> Finally, watch for the clever way the men in the gas company are investigating whether or not there is a gas leak in Magda's pan.
