Can not liberals like Alec Baldwin realize that they lost the 2000 and 2004 elections? Ridicule. Draws at WalMart, non-union workers, George W Bush and the stock market, not to mention GWB's intentional focus that Balwin's character uses in the film makes him seem ridiculous and bitter on the screen. As credits progress, bitter grapes continue as "special thanks" are directed to Ken Lay, as well as other CEOs of Enron, Tyco, WorldCom and IMClone. Let me explain something - if you put all your money into the stock of a company, you're an idiot. We do not need this excuse to tell us a movie. What a waste of Jim Carrey's talent - from the trailer, I was expecting a completely different movie - I got a 90-minute ad on DNC on how to scare people not to invest for their own future, to keep them stupid and to keep them dependent on the government. No wonder Hollywood has problems and can no longer make a movie worthy of the name. Maybe you could have an original idea and show it on the screen for once ... although I should not be surprised since Jane Fonda was chosen for the original.
