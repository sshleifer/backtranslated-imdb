I saw House Party 1-3 and I liked them, but this one was not funny at all. First, it can not be a House Party movie without Kid n'Play, right? This is nil, and it looked more like a black version of Ferris Bueller's day off than a House Party movie. Second, who is this devil, John-John? It has a horrible music, a weak plot, actors without talent and no hilarious joke.My advice, watch this movie at night only if you can not fall asleep.They should have ended the series after House Party 3 since Kid'n'Play broke up after that one. I hate this one; I'm glad my local video store does not have this movie and never wants to buy it or see it on Comedy Central either. Chris Strokes has the talent to lead a growing R & B group does not mean he has talent to lead and produce movies. Am I right or what? Finally, the female characters were all dressed as inexpensive prostitutes during most of the film. IMX separated a year after the publication of this film, probably because of the failure of this film, and is virtually forgotten nowadays. In simpler terms, this movie is just old, it's so bad !!
