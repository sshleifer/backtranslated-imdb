The hot female numbers on this show are breathtaking. They can also speak as if there is no tomorrow. Otherwise, this show would go to the bathroom quickly. How much do they make on everyone who sends a text message, with the hope of being called back to win, $ 100,000, or whatever. Boy, now it's a scam !!! Can I buy stock in this money maker ??? Let's face it: with today's technology, thousands of people could call every minute. And, with ten thousand channels and nothing that is worth it, thousands of people watch this show. "Oh, I know that answer!", Is probably a great common line among listeners. With these super-hotties constantly saying that the 'lounge' needs calls, I think it's a group of B.S. Frequently, someone who succeeds, seems surprised to talk to the host. Many of them seem depressed and exhausted by probably waiting so long and having tried so many times to change their pockets. Wow, the producers must be getting all that stuff. No wonder there are so few commercials. Advertisements are only there to give more people (mainly losers) the time to send a text message and wait, hope, dream and fantasize about - what? --- earn enough money for a gas tank and a dinner at the master's degree, something? I only watch now and then on my brother's television because he likes to watch it when he is on the computer. I'll sit there for 15 to 20 minutes watching Mel (one of the tastiest women on TV) and laugh at the scam going on in front of me. Then I have to leave; even if I do not do it! People who have an active life can only take this show with extreme moderation. Mel, go to the movies, on TV, or something. Many of us are in love with you! Even with super ties, I am amazed to see that this show is still there!
