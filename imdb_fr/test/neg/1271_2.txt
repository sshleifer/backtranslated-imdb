Opulent decorations and sumptuous costumes well photographed by Theodor Sparkuhl, and a good (not excellent) performance of Jannings, because Henry can not defeat the bad writings and the static work of the camera. Henny Porten describes the landscape as Anne. <br /> <br /> It's very beautiful; but everything is surface and no depth. The melodramatic tale of an injured woman made it a hit in America where the expressionist "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" collapsed the same year (1920), proving that what is popular is not what lasts. One would remember Lubitsch for his animated comedies and not for sterile glasses like this one.
