I have been looking forward to this movie since the release of Lost World. It did not bother me that Lost World was not as intellectual as the original, and here I was just hoping for a good monster movie. It was about "Dinosaurs eat people". However, it was disappointing even at this level. <br /> <br /> For starters, there were not enough people to eat and, even if I kept the secret about the number of people being eaten, it was not enough. Moreover, while the dinosaur community was full of variety, there were not enough "dinosaurs". And many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-a-club-on-tail-osaurus, just make cameos and do not do much considering their freshness. <br /> <br /> (START OF THE SPOILERS) Then there were the pterodactyls. The numbers I read weighed about 15 kilos, while the film gave them an appearance closer to 300. Worse, they could not eat anyone, or even splash them on the rocks by dropping them from above. There was no end to the film either, it was just, all of a sudden, generic. (FIN SPOILERS) I wonder if the edition I saw missed 40 minutes of film. <br /> <br /> My only conclusion is that they taught pterodactyls to stealthily sneak into their pockets and your $ 7. Go and rent the Carnosaur series; at least you will not be disappointed.
