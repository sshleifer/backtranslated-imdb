Typical story of an evil kid chasing people. I suspect that Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear in "Starsky and Hutch") and Vincent Schiavelli did not want to insist that their curriculum vitae be included in their resume (in fact, Schiavelli left this life with a rather good resume). Sometimes I want the killers of these movies to just blame the idiots who decide that we need a new one every two months (note: this comment should not be taken seriously, I just think that the slashers have lost the hand). <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a movie you'll do better to avoid. It's 90 minutes to two hours that I'll never come back.
