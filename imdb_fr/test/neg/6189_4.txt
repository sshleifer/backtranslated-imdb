The atmospheric and funny dialogue does not buy this overestimated classic. Boyer is a French thief who is hiding in the Kasbah of Algiers while the police are trying to find a way to get him out. Meanwhile, he falls in love with Lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. The film is slow to start and is never really anywhere. Reminiscent of Casablanca in some respects, he is completely missing a larger theme than the wanted man who seduces a good woman. These are only discussions, discussions, discussions, with endless scenes of Boyer fanfaron among his cohorts of idiots and Boyer courting Lamarr in the shadows. Personally, I did not care about Boyer's character for a minute. The tension was totally non-existent. <br /> <br /> The actors of the characters of the 1930s fall into the incredible plot as Boyer's henchmen - types that clearly do not belong to Algiers. Sigrid Gurie is Boyer's jealous girlfriend. Her brazen attitude before her does not bode well for the future he might have with Lamarr. <br /> <br /> The long sequence in which a sub-boy comes to tell Boyer how another henchman was captured is particularly deplorable. It sounds exciting ... pity we did not see it ourselves. The end is completely anti-climatic and seems to be remarkable only because it's not a happy ending in Hollywood; that does not stop him from being sappy.
