A root canal without anesthesia is more fun. This film is disturbing and useless. There is absolutely nothing credible about these characters or the line of intrigue. In the name of God, did these people think when they agreed to play in this film? Playing in this movie is incredibly bad - even from actors who are generally very good. "The In-Laws" is a funny movie. "The Birdcage" is a hilarious film. "The Big Lebowski" is a humorous film. This movie is just stupid. I can not even begin to understand the kind of sick mind it takes to write the "novel" on which this movie is based. Honestly, I can not even think of a good thing about this movie. It does not mean anything. People please - I beg you - do not see this movie. You will regret it for the rest of your life. This film is not the worst movie ever, but it's really at the top of the list.
