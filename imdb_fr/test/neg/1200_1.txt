<br /> <br /> I still can not believe that Louis Gossett Jr. has agreed to appear in this film. Everything in this process seems artificial, forced and artificial. The aerial sequences are flat. The enemy characters look like puppets. This is just a bad excuse for a movie. At least, Top Gun had aerial footage that looked good (the outside shots anyway). Queen's songs are cool, though. Rent Midway instead.
