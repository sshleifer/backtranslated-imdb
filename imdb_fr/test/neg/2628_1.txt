Milo is a complete rip off of Mikey's slasher movie of 1992, if you check the facts, both movies have the same slogan! But if you want to see an incredibly funny movie without any plot, then this is the movie for you. The acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are extremely confusing. The story behind this atrocity is simple. Milo Jeeder is a child with serious family problems. His father is an abortion doctor who keeps the unborn fools in a jar (NICE!) And who was desperate for a child. He found a way to bring one of those aborted kids back to life and he called him ............. MILO !!!!! <br /> <br /> Apart from all the bad actors, the terrible, boring direction The sound of Milo's voice and the ringing of the bell on his bike: if you remove all this evil, it's always a bad but funny movie attempt. <br /> <br /> I'm gonna give it a hangover 1 of 10
