It did not look like a movie and luckily was short (less than 90 minutes), it was more like an advertisement for computer graphics possibilities: most of the special effects are excellent, of course. But it's certainly not a good movie, or even a good movie. Do not say that looking is absolutely useless, since it is possible to see what are the possibilities in CGI or GCI, or whatever its name. <br /> <br /> As I read somewhere, "You can not solve the problem by cutting room", a bad story and undirected actors, can not be repaired in the editing room or even with the most magnificent special effects! Things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work on. <br /> <br /> However, they thought that it could be sold in the United States is an idea, because the United States are the crooks. <BR /> <br /> And it's not really typical of low-budget stories, they have to create an imaginative country in southern Mexico ?? <br /> <br /> Just because of the special effects, the rest is an absolute trash!
