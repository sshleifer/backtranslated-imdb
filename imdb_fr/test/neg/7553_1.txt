No wonder so many young people are suffering from attention deficit disorder. It seems that today's theatrical (dance) productions concern only the number of cameras and camera angles that a director / editor can insert into a one-hour show. Is there a special Emmy category for this feat? Try to count them sometimes for something different to do with that, otherwise, completely unassailable show. <br /> <br /> I tried to distinguish at least some faces from some of the other dancers in the production. It was impossible. They did not seem to have any faces, they were just blurry: it was just the face of Michael Flatley, the naked chest of Michael Flatley (beautiful shine!), The feet of Michael Flatley, and this patented Flatley, the repeated infinity squared. Since he was executive producer of this cut-and-paste job, I guess that was to be expected. One must not wonder who his target audience is. <br /> <br /> Riverdance was a much better production, as it tried to portray the show pretty much as it could be seen from the public, not the prospect of walkways, side wings or floor nails. If I'm not mistaken, I think Sir Michael has retired. Thank God for the little blessings.
