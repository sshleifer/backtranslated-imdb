I rarely laughed so loud about a movie. Note that I laughed at Iron Eagle, not WITH, because it's probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen (with the obvious exception of CyberTracker, sci-fi monstrosity). Do not forget that this movie is not a comedy! <br /> <br /> Even ignoring the absurd plot (the idea that a 16-year-old can enter a US Air Force base, fly an F-16, fly to the Middle East East and kill about a thousand people without anyone noticing, it's amazing), the movie is full of ridiculous action scenes that have little or no meaning. For example, at different locations, Doug Masters uses a machine gun on his plane to pull a steel beam, a control tower, and a tent. All these things explode in a massive fireball. Why? The enemy plane also explodes in a strange way reminiscent of a paper plane exploded by fireworks. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I really enjoyed this movie. Certainly not in the way the manufacturers probably wanted it to be appreciated, but I still laughed at that and later bought the DVD. It is also enhanced by the impressive presence of David Suchet as a perverse terrorist leader (you may remember him as a moustached Poirot Belgian detective?). Overall, the film is a fun laugh and a light alternative to hunter-plane more serious. movies like Top Gun. Even if it's just as subtle homo-erotic (take a look at the hug between Doug and Chappy, there's something going on between them!)
