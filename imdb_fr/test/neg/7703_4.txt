Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Abbie Hoffman and that I read Fly this book and steal this urine test. I am also an even bigger fan of Jerry Rubin. But his movie was a pile of garbage that made a very PG version of Abbie Hoffman. The director did not try to make Abbie Hoffman interesting in this film. They described Stew Albert as a fictitious cartoon character devoid of intelligence, this man was a proffesor at Berkley for Christmas. Ok, they did a horrible casting job for Anita Hoffman, a horrible job for Jerry Rubin's character. I imagine that the film does not correspond to the news I have seen of Abbie or the books he has written. The film did not suit me and upset me. Oh yes, and it's the most serious voice I've ever heard from Richard Nixon. It's one of the few films I've rented that I've never been able to rent because I have a passion for Abbie Hoffman and her discreet Yippie band and this movie was just plain wrong. And it hurts me now that when people see a film about yippies, they will see a terrible adaptation and will not get a real sense of reality. Instead, they get a Hollywoodized palanthra from shit. <br /> <br />
