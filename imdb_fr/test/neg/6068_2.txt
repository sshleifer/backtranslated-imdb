For a movie that I was really looking forward to, I was very disappointed. I did not expect it to be another Amadeus, but I was expecting a more meaningful representation of Beethovens in recent years. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris's performance was superb, but the story was so weak that the film simply moved. from one dismal scene to another without continuity. <br /> <br /> The only pleasant part of the film was for me the performance of the 9th. From that moment, I could very well have gone out without finishing. <br /> <br /> I left, very dissatisfied and I always feel that something important has been forgotten.
