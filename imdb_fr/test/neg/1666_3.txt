It's probably my least favorite episode. I lived in Cape Girardeau for a while. I can tell you there is no ocean or shrimp, fresh crab or scallops near Missouri. Cape Girardeau is the only inland Cape on the Mississippi River. It seemed that license plates came from Mississippi, which may explain why there was so much racial tension. Missouri and Mississippi are two completely different states that do not touch each other. There are many roads in and out of the city and none of them are Route 6 or Route 666. All this inaccuracy was very entertaining. In addition, Cassie did not seem to be someone who would want to stay with Dean if she was well educated. I did not buy them as a couple and I did not appreciate the long love scene. Jo was more like Dean.
