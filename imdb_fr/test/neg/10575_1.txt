It was the most stupid movie I have ever seen in my life. It is a complete waste of money and time. I went to see this film with my friends and when the film ended, not a single person in the movie theater - not that there was a lot of people to see this terrible movie - said "wow what a good movie ". Someone is really out! It was absolutely terrible! It was disgusting and I hated every minute. My friend put her head in my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with Rick on the pissed ceiling, she had enough. It was not funny at all. Believe me, I went with 11 other girls and none of my friends liked it. It was ridiculous! I saw a lot of movies but it was absolutely the worst! I mean a scene in the movie is with an old man arguing with a dead person in a coffin. I just can not invent these things.
