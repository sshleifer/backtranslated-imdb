I really liked the Millenium series, played by Lance Henriksen, so I bought the movie. Obviously, on one level, it was a mistake. The mutant / monster movies are usually very bad and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> The basic idea in itself is not totally doomed to failure (well, this film would never have been a success, even with a good director and actors), but it turns out that it's only a class B movie. The supposedly scary scenes seem to me more fun and the creature is not credible at all. <br /> <br /> However, watching this film with a group of friends in a hectic atmosphere makes this film shine as it is. involuntarily hilarious.
