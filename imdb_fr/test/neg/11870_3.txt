I come from Romania ... and for that, I apologize if my English is not very good. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie and I must say that I am extremely disappointed. I have always liked Wesley Snipes movies but this one is terrible. I regret having spent more than 3 hours downloading this movie. There are a lot of mistakes in the movie. For example, the stage of the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the football team is Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli. The stadium dashboard is not capable of displaying graphic images: video rehearsals, live images, etc. It's a simple dashboard that can only display letters and numbers. The opponents of the Uli team (Seaua) appear on the scoreboard in the form of a Din (probably Dinamo Bucuresti - who is the main rival of Steaua in the Romanian football championship). The images of the football match come from a match between Steaua Bucuresti and Poli Timisoara (my favorite team and my only love - watch it on the internet and you'll see why). The police cars in the movie are not well done. There is not a single dark blue police car in Romania! They are all white! The "list of errors" can continue again and again ... but I will stop here! In short, this movie is horrible. It's not worth renting, it's not worth buying a movie ticket for that, it's not worth it to download! Honestly, I'm sorry that Wesley Snipes played in this movie. One of his previous films ... 7 seconds ... also shot in Romania ... was OK but it's terrible!
