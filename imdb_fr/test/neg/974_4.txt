With all the hype surrounding the stars of the film, this film left me want. I was expecting a much better movie considering the inclusion of the talents of Murphy, De Niro and Russo, but I discovered that the film had fallen flat on his face. The comedy sequences were exaggerated and the superior performances of the stars, especially De Niro and Russo, could not save this one! <br /> <br /> ** on *****
