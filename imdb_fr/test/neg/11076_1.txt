Horror movies are a curious thing, sometimes they manage to find a formula that works very well, sometimes they try valiantly to tell a worthy story despite problems of budget and time, sometimes they are so bad that they are rather fun ... and sometimes they are "The Cavern". <br /> <br /> A good horror / suspense movie should contain some guesswork, they should allow you to get interested in the characters and their motives for you to actually have some kind of reaction when they die . However, The Cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that initially work, but are canceled by its own nonsense narrative. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely forgettable and any past history that could make them even Remote, a monologue of 30 seconds lets escape a monumental interest, thus preventing laughter, because the characters are chosen almost randomly and on more than one occasion in the least scary way possible. <br /> <br /> (To spoil the scene a little, a victim is taken during a power outage that could have been a bit scary if the sound effect used to indicate his assassination was not reminiscent of stirring a pot Macaroni cheese too thick Add to this formula the camera that works makes me think that the director has seen too many videos of Nine Inch Nails and an end that, in order to be shocking, is almost used to nothing to annoy but to disturb and confuse the viewer, which gives an almost unassailable horror film that fails on all levels. <br /> <br /> I will be honest with you, if you want a movie of claustrophobic horror on caving, look at "The Descent", and I feel weird to say it because I did not particularly enjoy this movie either.
