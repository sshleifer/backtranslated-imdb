Not as bad as "Billy Bathgate" but close. Despite all his efforts, Warren Beatty just could not be considered Bugsy. Whenever he turned away, instead of being shocked by the violence, I found it rather embarrassing because it was so phony. Other actors are not doing as well. Annette Bening simply does not have what it takes to play attractive women, she is better with sure characters. As many have noted, Joe Mantegna would have done better if the scenario took him for George Raft, more credible. Only Harvey Keitel came out unscathed, but again, this guy can make these movies in his sleep. And Robert Beltran, with one line, steals one of the big Beatty scenes, Bening. With these films, I'm never sure that the director intends to make the perpetrators look like ordinary businessmen or come out like that. Anyway, I do not like it. These guys were killers and no matter how much Las Vegas owes Buggy Siegel, I do not think a film should be made to glorify him, especially if he's accompanied by a big studio.
