OK, yes, I know that I am a philistine and that I have neither knowledge nor love for opera. I readily admit that I could have a different opinion about this film if I did it. But then, for those of you like me, skip this one unless you want to watch the pretty girls (sometimes nude). For what it's worth, I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (which I did not recognize) was the best of the lot.
