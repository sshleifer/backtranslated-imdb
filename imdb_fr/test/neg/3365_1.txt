This is the worst movie I have ever seen, without exception. From lean, ill-lit scenes to ludicrous games, childish intrigue and shoddy action sequences, this movie is so awesome that it's hilarious. For about ten minutes. After that, you will look for the remote control or power outlet to end this movie without experience. Although this was done with the collective language of all the production staff and the cast of actors (I beg you, God), I found Jack Frost 2 so formidable that it was impossible to watch for more than a quarter of an hour. If you have not had enough after this period, you must indulge in addiction.
