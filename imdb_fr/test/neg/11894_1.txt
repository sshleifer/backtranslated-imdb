It must be the most boring movie I have ever seen. The only good thing I can say is that, fortunately, I did not pay to see it. We got a free screening at school and all the audience was embarrassed to wonder when the fun would start. This piece of scrap is a film too long, poorly filmed. The presentation of the film took about 10 seconds. The only ones who may be interested in this movie are those who have lost their jobs and want to know why. They could find some interesting interviews. A different editing could have made an interesting documentary on this subject, but I doubt it, the interviews presented are in no way engaging. As things stand, it's just a tragedy, both to see and to be part of it. AVOID THIS FILM AT ANY COST!
