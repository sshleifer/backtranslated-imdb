A couple of men are wrecked on an isolated island. They are then captured by a foolish count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the dungeon of the castle lives the unfortunate leprous wife of the count. <br /> <br /> The Harrow dungeon is in a way the work of a movie. Amateur actors all walk through the film, while an annoying and insistent score continually plays in the background. The different action scenes are all shot incredibly non-energetically; In fact, the film in general is completely lethargic. He just seems to be hanging around again and again. And although the end is not too serious, you will have a hard time dealing with it at that time. As an example of the Gothic horror of the 60's, this is just an example. I unfortunately can not recommend this one really.
