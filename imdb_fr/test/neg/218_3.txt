Incredibly disappointed. The pace was slow. The characters are amazing and throughout the movie just leaves me bored and dissatisfied. There was no real plot that could make you turn around the movie and keep you interested. The robbery itself never offered any excitement and did not seem very successful. <br /> <br /> There was not enough depth or depth for a character and Laurance Fishbourne's character was the one I was looking forward to. Unfortunately, Laurance has no idea how to play the raw and rogue is very much preferred as a friendly character. Columbus, one of my favorite actors (in the yard) dropped me with his performance, his character was dark and we could barely see what motivated him. <br /> <br /> The only character to whom I think offers something the film was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroes). Although his character is rather small and insignificant, I think his touch has been added to a dull movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, buy the DVD if you want to find a new way to waste your time.
