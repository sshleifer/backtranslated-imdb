Another member of the long line of Conan contenders who are tired of taking advantage of the success of this film, this Italian monstrosity is about as bad as it arrived. You know that your heroes are fighting invisible enemies is a bad sign, because the film was shot at such a low cost that there was no money to buy adequate special effects or to hire real people. I will not even get into the plot because I challenge anyone to follow him and make sense of the story. It may be the television that I watched, but I can not imagine a better version. All this seems so random to me. Bad wizards, cavemen, giant snakes, medieval castles, grenades and hang gliding ?? none of this goes together. It's as if director Joe D'Amato had an epileptic fit by making Cave Dwellers (or one of the other half-dozen names in the film) and projecting everything he could think of on screen , regardless of the relationship between him and him fit into the already intriguing plot of the film. The acting is bad enough. Miles O'Keeffe never managed to get out of a wet paper bag and he proves it once again in this film. The rest of the cast is also atrocious. Then there is the. . . Well, you have the idea. It's late, I'm tired and I've already lost more time writing on this trash. Believe me? avoid cave dwellers (or whatever you want to call) at all costs.
