Clossius says that "Baltic Storm" is banned in Sweden. It's not correct! Instead, you can buy the movie almost everywhere, such as at gas stations, shopping malls, the internet (of course), and so on. Often at a very low price because this movie is really BAD and nobody wants to see it, despite all the stuff to keep the interest. The film is only for conspiracy theorists, psychos and other people living on the land and those who "know the truth". <br /> <br /> Working on a museum with the theme of the disaster in Estonia, I met them all! I have heard about all existing theories: cocaine smuggling, weapons smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, extraterrestrials, Russian, American, Estonian, Swedish and Finnish secret intelligence. <br /> <br /> Some normal people have asked why we do not show the movie? A question only asked by those who have not seen this absurd film. <br /> <br /> Once again, "Baltic Storm" is not banned in Sweden. It has fun qualities but what the hell is Donald Sutherland doing in this movie?
