I was so excited to see the cast in this movie that I was completely surprised to see how bad the movie was. I like John Voight but I have no idea what took him to be part of this tragedy. Biblical accuracy was totally non-existent and honestly, I could not stand watching the movie with my kids. My children were amazed because they even knew that Lot had not even thought of Noah building the ark. I think NBC should be ashamed for allowing producers to make fun of the Word and create even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is ... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM! !! I planned to burn my copy but I intend to write to the producers and send them the scriptural references they SHOULD have read before making this film!
