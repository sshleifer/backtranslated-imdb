It's one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. This is also my first criticism. So you must say that I must hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like my serious movies. I do not like Hollywood too much, I tend to like French, Italian, offbeat US or anything that tries to communicate something sensible. <br /> <br /> But it was horrible. Why? 1. The plot (as it was) was quite incredible, even if the director seems to put everything on realism. <br /> <br /> 2. The main character has nothing to recommend. Does he smoke to be cold or to show us his anxiety? For God's sake, this guy is supposed to be a former mafia lawyer cursed. Are we supposed to be more careful because he is also one of the meanest people you can meet? And he's a smoker ... so he has to have deep personal problems. Pop psychology at its best. In the last moments, I almost applauded when he is buried in the cement. Best place for him. And I thought it was pretty much the only good scene. Or maybe it was due to the fact that the final credits were so close. <br /> <br /> 3. The completely tired and incredible interest for the main character of the beautiful girl. She was there simply because beautiful girls always have strange sex with older, deep and significant men (as evidenced by smoking). Arrive all the time. This is really the case in bad movies. <br /> <br /> 4. The rhythm was so sealed. I like slow, I like to pay attention. But it was deadly. <br /> <br /> 5-50 a lot of other things that I really can not be bothered to write. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
