I thought this series was going to be a new series of fun actions, with dynamic intrigue and great performances. I was wrong. Although I like Jamie Denton, this show is not worth watching. Unless you like to watch brutalized people and actions of agents allegedly justified under the theme "national security". The show is an excellent propaganda for the current government and spreads jingoism as if we were talking about it every day. After a couple of episodes, it bothered me a lot and I started watching House Invaders reruns on BBCAmerica. Look rather CSI and No Trace, no doubt.
