Too many archive footage (almost a third of this 53-minute movie) really slows this one down. The plot is that John Weston (John Wayne) is sent by Marshal George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (for example, "Ro-DAY-oh"), but the development and interaction of the character are sacrificed. The relationship between the Bad Girl (usually a Latina - even in the big "Duck Soup" [1933]) and "the heroine" Polly Ann Young, a Loretta Young look-alike (hey it's his sister!) Could have enjoy more screen time. The happy ending is too abrupt - although this time, John Wayne kissed the girl. <br /> <br /> The most interesting short film was the long parade of rodeos of real Indians, squaws and papooses. But when the best part of the film is the Mighty Yak's stunt work, Yakima Canutt, who lets us jump from one horse to another and run several times on a horse, you know we have problems. As other people have noted, the last fight with the villain is very badly done. <br /> <br /> My copy of "Platinum Disc Corporation" included an extra stereo music track, sparse and ill-fitting (pseudo-classical). it ruins the authenticity of the original movie (the DVD Box contains an improved version of 5.1 audio). If you want to modernize and color it, you must add a score to the sound "western" with acoustic guitars "klip-klopping hooves, harmonicas and an accordion. <br /> <br /> Finally, we must say that this is one of the weakest efforts of Lone Star.
