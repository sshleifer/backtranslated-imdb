Let me start by saying that I like Japanese cinema, literature and culture in general. I saw a lot of Japanese movies and liked them, but "Portrait of Hell" (aka Jigokuhen) is ridiculous. The two characters who dominate the action - the "evil lord" in his privileged bubble and "the stubborn and crazy artist" are pure characters, without any subtlety or nuance, and all their actions emanate from extreme comics. The film wants to show horrible scenes of violence and vivid emotions, but many of these scenes are so exciting that they become really laughable and the general feeling is that of a movie designed for television that derailed. If this rarely screened movie falls into your hands or comes into your city, save yourself and give it a pass.
