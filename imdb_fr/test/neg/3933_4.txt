The plot in Petites Coupures certainly left this spectator stunned. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler *** <br /> <br /> In about 48 hours, the character of Auteuil has an adventure with a teenager, loses the feelings of his wife , tries to seduce Scott Thomas, is rejected by her, gropes yet another female character in the back of a car and is finally shot for her problem. <br /> <br /> *** end of spoiler *** <br /> <br /> wha ??? <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is Kristin Scott Thomas. Similar to Charlotte Rampling, she seems a * natural * to play in French cinema. My hope is that one day, Fran√ßois Ozon throws her into a place where she can show her true talent. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful French films like the remarkable Le Colonel Chabert who asks for a DVD, but it is the tripe that is chosen. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. <br /> <br /> zzzz ..
