1st movie commentary! I'll start by saying, "Come on, was not it so bad ... was it?" ... No, it was not so bad in reality. I laughed and laughed quite often in the movie, so I can not say with my hand on my heart that it was bad. <br /> <br /> It's completely different, and Epic Movie (Epic Movie is bad, it's serious ... doh!). "How?" people would ask. I'll tell you how. This film is not so useless, not to say that the stupid (and I say stupid because it is, but being stupid makes it funny) what's going on around and with the characters is really nice in this movie. Not the best, but ... what to expect - look at the poster! Some people said it was stupid, I find that by writing a comment, you have to be more objective (my own opinion) but yes, of course it was stupid, it's a movie about "stupid"! Look, I'm not telling you to go see the movie now, otherwise you missed the event of the century. What I'm saying is, if you see the movie somewhere, do not fix your eyes on the opening credits. See what it is - who knows, you might like it a little bit. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 to not be so mean and make me laugh and make some good sex jokes.
