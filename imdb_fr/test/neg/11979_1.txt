Being a fan of the game and watching this movie made me vomit physically !! <br /> <br /> It was an awful film, even though the story was like the plot of games. the whole thing of superhuman soldiers. Other than that, Jack Carver, an American in the game, is played by a germen, unless it's a kind of twisted irony, that's what pushed me to pull the middle finger on the screen. my TV from the beginning. The fact that you can see him filmed in a forest in the middle of what seemed to be in the middle of summer is unexpected, because the game takes place in the rainforest, while the director seems to look out the window . In the morning, I thought, "It's a good forest". <br /> <br /> THIS IS A NOTE TO ALL REALIZERS: If you plan to make a movie based on a game / book, play it, understand it and ask the fans about it ... do not play not just for an hour and guess you know it !!!
