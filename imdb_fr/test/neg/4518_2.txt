Why does this film have so many rave reviews? <br /> <br /> It's amateur, not funny and boring. <br /> <br /> The only thing memorable here is the cheesy title song. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are weak and the ideas "comic" (if you want to call them that) are weak, they look like leftovers of SNL they would not dare dare to put screen. <br /> <br /> I'm starting to be wary of IMDb ratings. <br /> <br /> It's light-years away from the Kentucky Fried Movie - not even in the same Galaxy. <br /> <br /> It is not even possible to write 10 lines on this subject. <br /> <br /> OK, another good thing: street scenes and ugly people - something that we do not see much TV and movies today.
