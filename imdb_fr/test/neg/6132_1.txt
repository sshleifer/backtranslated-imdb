Here's a fantastic concept for a movie: a series of meteors crashed into a small town and the resulting extraterrestrial infection is detected on the camera to a single camera from a member's dashboard while the city was settling slowly. Let Albert Pyun spoil everything! Do not get within 100 feet of this movie! Fuck shit, what a bomb ... it could be the worst of Pyun! What is crazy is that there is the seed of a creative idea - the whole of an epidemic told by the POV of a camera on board. When I heard that a while ago, I imagined that the car was breaking, that people were being knocked over and that infected guys were breaking the windshield and circling the car in chaos. That would be cool, no? Instead, we have our head circling all the time in a wooded area, sometimes meeting the three infected types just standing there. The last bit is literally a 15-minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera, just noises are heard off-screen. Stay away!!! On a somewhat comforting note, I think I'm officially calling at the end of my Pyun sighting ... it only took me 20 shabby movies to realize I had better things to do .
