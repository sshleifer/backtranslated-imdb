Sometimes I wonder if today's horror movies are based on human torture to frighten people. If so, horror movies have a dark future. Dee Snyder tries to scare you and scare you. This film does just that, but not in a good way. There are now moments in the movie where there is a chance that Snyder saves this movie from falling into a hole but let's be honest, this film did not fall into a hole, it was already in a hole and Synder does not no attempt anything to get by. When you finish watching this movie, you are sick, depressed, dirty and crazy. I have the impression that it was the intention of this film. What is inferior to dirt?
