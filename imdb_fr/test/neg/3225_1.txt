what happened to Mathew Modine's career ??? I still remember when he was considered an actor on the A list ... <br /> <br /> Was it the fierce island the last nail in the coffin of a once promising career ??? wow, this guy really must hate the guts of Renny Harlin ... <br /> <br /> This movie wants to be a comedy but does not succeed to make laugh, the characters are caricatures, and those who are badly drawn. But what distresses me the most is that to see Mr. Modine take on this kind of role, alongside actors so far from his caliber, I mean that when he was shooting movies like BIRDIE he could never have imagined in his worst nightmares that in the future, he would play in movies with a big dick in a cow whose anus was stapled, and maybe even worse: next to Elizabeth Berkley! !!
