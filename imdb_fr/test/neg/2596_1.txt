It's such a shame that so many people "love" Family Guy, because this is one of the worst shows on television, there are a lot of points to cover here. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks: now, in season 1 and season 2, which I find exceptional, flashbacks were quite common, and in fact somewhat related to the content of the plot and were even funny. Now season 4 and up, flashbacks are even more common and have nothing to do with the plot, they are not funny, and really long, boring and meaningless. Family Guy thinks that this long dredge scene that is not going anywhere is funny, while she writes badly. <br /> <br /> Stewie: Wow, a baby that looks British. How funny is that? It's not. His character is so unstable that it's amazing. Remember at the beginning of the season when Stewie was talking about world domination and killing of Lois. Well now, he just has a scene that is awkwardly cheerful with Brian. To want the domination of the world to be homosexual = bad writing. <br /> <br /> References: How can they continue to make bad references to television series or events of the 80s? Well, they just reuse the same old trash. You know, in 20 years, if everything goes well, Family Guy will be canceled at that time. If they continue to joke about the series of the 80s, it will be even less relevant than before. Because will have forgotten. It always makes me wonder why they can not just write good episodes with quality jokes. <br /> <br /> Voice Interpretation: My God, the voices on this show are so bad. Seth McFarlene should just focus on writing his rotten episode and stop making the voice. All the extras of the bad episodes of Family Guy all sound the same way. The Simpsons have 6 or 7 people to do ALL the voices. Some of them express about 15 to 20 characters ... all very different. But why can not Family Guy do that? Oh that's right, it's a shitty show. <br /> <br /> Stuttering: usually done by Peter, Stewie, Brian and all the extras, whenever they talk or are offended by something, they have to stammer their sentence just to try Get a cheap laugh . I can not believe that Family Guy can not even speak normally to get people to laugh at their "jokes". <br /> <br /> Offensiveness: OK, short and simple, Family Guy tries to break the barrier and be sharp, but really they fall flat every time. Go watch South Park ... <br /> <br /> Terrible Plots: Intrigues and stories are a junk. The Simpsons started their 20th season and still have better fields than Family Guy. About 8 or 9 minutes are flashbacks and drag scenes that have no relevance. <br /> <br /> Popularity Many young children wear Stewie shirts and are so funny that they are not even funny sex jokes. They just say, "oh, ah ah, stewie!" when they do not even get it. Family Guy has been canceled twice and brought back by DVD sales, how sad is that. They were canceled the first time after the 2nd or 3rd season and I honestly believe that should have been that. These episodes were then superb, they should stay on a high note. <br /> <br /> Slide scenes and fall There are scenes that last far too long. It was released last Sunday and was used in an executive bathroom, in which about two minutes were spent to imitate the intro of Jurassic Park. The plot of this episode was also stolen in an episode of Seinfeld. Also a scene where Chris works in a store and talks with the employee for about 5 minutes about a movie that also includes stuttering. THE CHICKEN FIGHTERS ARE SO STUPID, 3 of them, each longer than the last one. writing useless, insignificant, thinking that people enjoy long scenes of repeated fights, between a CHICKEN and a chicken. now, every time someone falls, and by the way, NO FAMILY FAN CAN DENYER THAT, every time he falls, it's in a split second, and they ALWAYS land with their arms on their backs for Funny Looks like it's been used at least 30 times. <br /> <br /> Herman Oh jeez, everyone thinks that the old pedophile is so funny when it's a joke. they even tried to give him singing scenes (which are very poor) and to create ENSEMBLES episodes around him, they did the same thing with other characters, like the doctor, who, I know, had an episode around him. . <br /> <br /> The Simpsons Well, there is no need for a lot of explanations here. There is so much evidence that Family Guy stole Simpson's jokes. How is a family member only a poor Simpsons of man. <br /> <br /> So I'm sure I've forgotten some key points somewhere, but I'm sure that's enough to prove that this family member is really a horribly horribly horrific television show everyone seems to to love, when in reality they should go to see Simpson, Seinfeld and Frasier.
