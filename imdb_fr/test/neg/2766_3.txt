The film begins with a little girl (Rita) who sees her father being killed. Apparently, he was a criminal who squealed on his comrades. Later, and that makes little sense, the girl has reached adulthood and STILL her father's past haunts her! A little later, Rita meets a rascal and goes out with him. During one of their appointments, he is a little intoxicated AND leads like a fool. The cops chase after him and he moves away quickly, killing a pedestrian in the meantime. Here is the really stupid part. He convinces her to admit the crime, assuring her that her lawyers can release her. Why, oh why, would she accept that ?! Yet she does and spends the next two years in prison !! And shortly after his conviction, this boyfriend disappears, showing that he is a total heel. What an idiot !!! Later, after his release, his friend (Jack La Rue) informs him of the truth about his boyfriend. Then, he explains, the boyfriend's family is busy and she should shake her up to get a lot of money for all the trouble he has put her into taking rap. Frankly, that makes sense - as they certainly must - especially since they knew she would go to jail and that she intended to use it and throw it away. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​bleeding money from the rich chumps is a good idea of ​​conspiracy. However, it is impossible that this happened in the first place, because it is hard to believe that anyone can be as stupid as taking things in hand for a hit! In an interesting twist, the mute lady decides a life of crime - threading a wig and picking up a rich man - taking her to the desert and driving under her fist! Wow ... how she has changed! Apparently, she loves the idea of ​​stealing "phonies" - that is, rich hypocrites. However, and that made no sense, she soon stopped doing so and began to shake the old friend's father - why she bothered to make a few small flights in the meantime made no sense. And, what was also a little hard to believe, is that instead of wanting to get money from the old fool, she was interested in convincing him to entrust his influence to a mayor controlled by a crowd. Odd ... very very very strange. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, another plot is developing involving a young Alan Ladd. He's an undercover agent who has infiltrated the crowd. He was chosen because he turns out to be a deadly ringer for a real crook - what a cliché! But what makes no sense is that this real crook is not in jail and commits crimes while the fake is infiltrating the crowd in another city. <br /> <br /> Finally, the proof that Ladd is able to discover is enough to issue warrants to mafia team leaders, including Rita. This is a case of very bad timing, because in the meantime, she made the decision to become a decent and legitimate woman because she met a really nice guy with whom she wants to get married! Wow, ... what are the chances ?! All in all, it's an awkward and rather silly movie that suffers from the "kitchen sink syndrome" - in other words, there are too many plot elements and weird twists to make the movie a little less believable. Moreover, as the film only lasts a little over an hour, everything seems very forced and artificial. This is a relatively bad B movie from Crap-studio PRC that deserves mention for Alan Ladd's performance just before his big celebrity the following year in Paramount. <br /> <br /> By the way, this DVD was released by Alpha Video - a company that sometimes publishes wonderfully obscure titles (mostly public domain) but NEVER cleans up copies or adds subtitles . In other words, the DVD production values ​​are strictly at 3rd rate ... at best.
