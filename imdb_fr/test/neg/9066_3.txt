This film is not as good as I thought. There is no story, no character and a dialogue would have been nice. The effects of gore are good and sometimes very bloody, but nothing excellent. It starts with an autopsy on a man and then the scene with the girl begins. The music is a classical score and is very suitable for the film. They should have created a 90-minute version in which they could have had some time for character development so that we could feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table. And some more information about the practitioners of death would have made this movie far more frightening than it is. Do not expect a scary movie, but a nice gore of special effects.
