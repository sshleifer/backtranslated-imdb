I'm sure there is a documentary among the ruins of this yawning party somewhere, as long as the producers have time to find it. I do not connect with any characters. This is a problem for a documentary. This disconnect quickly turns into a total animosity bordering on hostility. Although, because of the bad story, I do not really know what is happening to them and what are the consequences of everything they try to do. The story and the faces are jumping so fast that it's very difficult to fully understand what's going on. Khaleil and Tom must be cajoling (unsuccessfully) to explain: "Oh yeah, this guy has also created the idea." And just when I thought I had a slight idea of ​​who all the third-degree characters were, a crazy woman who wanted to make a puppy? What's up with that? Also, did Tom really have to make all those awkward speeches to the staff? I can only imagine the boredom they felt when it really happened. In fact, I think I feel for them.
