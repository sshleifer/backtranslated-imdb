Several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this movie. First, the landscapes and special effects are incredible - the best, and if all else worked well, its austere presence would have made an excellent film. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie. The story itself is full of clich√© and melodrama, and the dialogue is one of the worst I have ever seen. And as if that were not enough, they ridiculed the protagonist and, in my experience, you would not want to do it unless the film is a comedy. <br /> <br /> I had trouble getting in and I would not recommend it.
