This film should be called Blame it on the Script. Directed by Stanley Donen, from the fame of Singin 'in the Rain, this celluloid crisis in mid-life is not so bad. There are lush scenes in Rio de Janeiro and various lightly dressed extras frolicking around the samba-stuffed beach, but there's just something about watching fifty-one Michael Caine get along with each other. Michelle Johnson that makes you feel ... good, shabby. This plot is also a complete stretch. Only the old and the perverted Hollywood Hollywood studios could not have clarified this embarrassment. Maybe they are so used to having young bimbos as arm candies that they forget that it's their big wallet that holds the key to their appeal, not their huge Larry King glasses and their yellow teeth stained with cigars. It's one thing for a young nubile sexpot to have a crush on an older man, but for the father of his best friend who happens to be married? And then throw himself to him shamelessly? Ugh! There is nothing fun about it. It's rather pathetic and grotesque. Take note of the nascent * cough * talent of a young Demi Moore.
