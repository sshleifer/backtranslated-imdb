My ratings: Acting - 3/10 Suspense - 2/10 Character Attachment - 1/10 of the field - 2/10 Character Development - 2/10 in total - 2/10 <br /> <br /> This show is really rubbish. For me, CSI Miami is the best, CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100th. I do not know, in the other CSI, you enter the episode you are watching. But in this one, you can not enter the episode no matter how much you try, so in my opinion, this show is not worth watching. I know that people have different opinions and I respect it, but for me, this expert is not enough. So, if you like suspense, acting / performance, good plot, direction, character development / attachment and a good show, I suggest you watch CSI Miami.
