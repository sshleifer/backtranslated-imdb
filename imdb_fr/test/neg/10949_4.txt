The concept: show 4 diverse ethnic families from Fairfax District, Australia preparing for the family reunion at Thanksgiving. I loved Soul Food and How to make an American quilt (I think Alfre Woodard must be in a law in all these films) that offers a similar pastiche of family traditions and is preparing for the party. Instead, I felt cheated. They trot about more than 40 characters, and all but two are clich√©s of a note without any finesse. Screenwriters and the director should spend a few more years learning life and understanding relationships between loving people of different generations. Instead, you have a group of ** holes meeting on the day of Turkey to act as an ** extra-odious holes. To some extent, this is what Thanksgiving is all about. But not wrong. And why bother to have Julianne Marguiles, then give her nothing to do. It was a chore to accomplish and Mercedes Ruehl is remarkable, but I give it a 4/10.
