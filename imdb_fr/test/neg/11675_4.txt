My wife and I met a professional production of "The Merry Widow" in 1982 - in English, but in simple translation. <br /> <br /> Only the basic skeleton of the original parcel is visible in this "adaptation". Most characters have been removed, as well as the entire B path, and all remaining characters except one have been renamed. Most characters in the movie are not in the operetta either. The action was moved from Paris to, first, Washington, DC, then to the fictional country of Pontevedro, which the film renamed "Marshovia", and only later to Paris. The end result is that we do not reach the beginning of the original piece until about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the main source of tension in the plot is also removed. In the original, Count Danilo and the heroine were very much in love with years ago, but her family refused to allow them to marry because she was poor; it's his broken heart that made him a careless playboy. Now, as a widow, she's the richest woman in the world, she still loves him, and he still loves her, but his pride does not let him confess to anyone, not even himself, and she must spend three acts playing games to break it. The trope of the aristocrat with money problems who does not want to admit that he is in love with a rich woman, for fear of seeing what we think, has provided the main basis for a substantial fraction of Vienna operettas for decades after the "Widow" of 1906. In this film, they never met before, which tears apart not only the heart of the thing, but almost all the comedy. <br /> <br /> Lamas does a pretty decent job, though. <br /> <br /> An interesting point of the music is that many times we hear an excerpt from "Tr√©s Parisien", an extra song written (in English, despite the title) for the London premiere, which was not , to my knowledge, generally present in American productions until around the 1980s.
