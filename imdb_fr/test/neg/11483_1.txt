I do not know why all previous comments are an endorsement of this movie. IT'S, well not far but ..., THE MOST SUCCUTED FILM THAT I HAVE SEEN JUST, full of clich√©s, bad actor, actually no ... very bad actor and has a stupid plot ... If I would have seen him in a movie theater, I would be out after the first 20 minutes. If you hate someone, have them watch this movie ... it's so bad. A girl who has an imaginary boy / friend who abandons a relationship with a real one because his imagination is jealous ... but I think that counts ... it attacks his parents who also have mental problems ... plus the character who is supposed to be, i think, the laughing stock of the thing, the thing that should make you laugh, the roommate of cal is a serious nut case and just makes me feel sorry for him ... and the whole movie
