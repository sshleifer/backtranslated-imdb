Both bad and good - not only is the scenario obvious, but the acting is not only poor, but pathetic. The worst of all is the definition of characters: unrealistic ingenuity, affected reactions, camera compelling to look at superficial aspects, which are introduced as keys to the plot. <br /> <br /> Can not stop laughing Finally, the main character says to support something like "your daughter does not play football and can not cook". Such an offense to female intelligence defines the level of this film. <br /> <br /> Does the film deal with the psychological behavior of the second character ?, its impact on the main character ?, or simply a sequence of events to heat for the obvious end? <br /> <br /> Pls, do more of these - I had a good time guessing what would go wrong next ...
