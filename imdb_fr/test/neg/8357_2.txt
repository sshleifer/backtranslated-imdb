I write this review simply because I am a big fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and the film appalled me. <br /> <br /> I think that if you had not read the book, you would have been lost watching the movie because it did not provide any real story to the Wurtzel Depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences at the summer camp, her first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that she has never taken any therapy to date). 'to Dr. Sterling) ...). That said, if you had read the book, you would have been confused by the amount of changes made. <br /> <br /> I found the book very eloquent about depression, highlighting Wurtzel's weaknesses, and the experiences she experienced along the way. However, the movie started at Harvard and literally threw the viewer out without any real explanation of what was going on. <br /> <br /> The important events in the book (like Wurtzel's miscarriage, her summer working in Dallas, her suicide attempt at Prozac) was omitted from the movie. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it's pedantic, but Wurtzel did not lose her virginity in favor of Noah. The suicide attempt shown in Sterling's office was completely different from the book. For starters, she actually made an overdose of Mellaril, as opposed to the para-suicidal gesture shown in the film. <br /> <br /> In summary, I would say that if you read the book and enjoyed it with it, then do not watch the movie. Read more "More, now, again" (by the same author). Or look at Girl, Interrupted. <br /> <br /> The only thing that has escaped criticism is the performance of Anne Heche, who, I believe, describes Dr. Sterling very well. Christina Ricci was also good, although her performance seemed a little ... scalded. Jessica Lange made the viewing enjoyable, but viewed the opposite of Wurtzel's description of the mother in the book. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Do not bother yourself.
