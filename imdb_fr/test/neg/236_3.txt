Like a lot of movies featuring young children, it starts out as "really cute" and friendly ... and after about half an hour or so, the opposite happens. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the case here in this story of time travel (which I love in general) where an adult meets a child who really looks like eight years! A great place and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis, but ..... <br /> <br /> The kid "Rusty" is a smart and whiny kid. with his constant howling. It's entertainment? No thanks. <br /> <br /> The young Breslin has become a very good actor of children, participating in several films, including "The Cat In The Hat", alongside a more famous actor: Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a disappointing film, especially with all the good press this film had when it was released.
