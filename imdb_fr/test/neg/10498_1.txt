I could not last ten minutes on this terrible film. At the time of DV cameras, it seems to have been shot in VHS without color correction or microphone. <br /> <br /> As a filmmaker, I know the constraints of making independent films and even the things in mind, I'm amazed that movies can be badly made. <br /> <br /> The only praise I can offer is that this film has been distributed because I have seen dramatically better films that are always looking for modest national or international Lib√©ration films. I guess the box is what sold it ... it has good illustrations, but everything goes down from there. <br /> <br /> Side note: It seems that the director has 11 friends because no one has this planet would give this movie a "10".
