Heh ... I'm surprised this film still exists in any form, let alone it's available for rent! <br /> <br /> This movie is one of many slasher movies that only exist for T & A and cheap laughs. The scenario crosses a little the "chainsaw massacre" with a back story centered on a mother reminiscent of that of "Psycho", and a little of the good old woman chained to a white background. For good measure - in other words, a non-originality wrapped in half-naked and spicy women with a hint of idiocy! The director is trying to get the Quebec marsh south of the south bayou of the United States is sad, I tell you! <br /> <br /> What's funny is that I was at the premiere of this film, because I was a boyfriend at the time with Ratchford, the "star" of the movie. It was painful to see Jeremy sinking into his seat as the film unfolded its mutilated wings. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see that Ratchford, after this sham of a first film, has become a hell of an actor. He can be seen regularly in the Canadian detective series "Blue Murder", "CSI", and his role in Clint Eastwood's film "Unforgiven". We forgive you, Jeremy! It was a difficult start, but you did well, man! <br /> <br /> ~ T.Paul
