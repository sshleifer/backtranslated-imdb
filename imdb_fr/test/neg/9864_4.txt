As long as you keep in mind that the production of this film was a copyright ploy and not a serious outing, it is actually surprising how horrible it is. I even liked the theme of music. <br /> <br /> And if ever a film requires treatment from Joel (or Mike) and MST3K Bots, that's it! Look at that with a smart-ass band wise-crackers, and you're up for a good while. Make a beer, butter big pretzels and enjoy them. <br /> <br /> Obtaining a copy of course requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as shareware, but if you're on IMDb, then you're probably pretty savvy for it. make. Good luck. <br /> <br /> And look for my favorite part .... where Dr. Doom informs the FF that he has 12 hours to fulfill his wishes ... and that he actually indicates the number "12" with his finger at the same time .... it's like "Evil Sesame Street" ... hoo boy. <br /> <br /> ... and of course Mrs. Storm said, "Just look at you .. ..the Fanstastic Four" is so comforting .... you'll laugh, you'll cry .... . <br /> <br /> So, if you like schlocky science fiction, this one is fantastic for you!
