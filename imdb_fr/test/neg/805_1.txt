Drab, dreary and a total loss of my time. The plot is incomprehensible (so do not think too much about it). The acting is strange and wooden - I would have sworn they were all professional bodybuilders trying to try their luck, but that could be an insult to bodybuilders. There are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster, but many fires, explosions, free sex scenes, etc. The only thing that caught my attention is that it happens after a war between the United States and Iraq that becomes nuclear. ..hmmm. Is Roger Corman psychic? Let's hope that "Iraq" was only a happy choice for Corman and that the rest of his scenario is not realized. <br /> <br />
