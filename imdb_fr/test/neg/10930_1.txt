This film is by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life. A woman "The EX" claims to be a number of people to gain access to her ex-husband. Killing people for no reason in the baths to achieve his goal. I think women never went to college. She spends the entire movie making stupid expressions, and it looks like she's doing her best not to look in the camera. Failing this in most cases. She befriends the wife and son of her ex-husband, she does it to use against her husband. At first, when you watch this movie, you think that "the Ex" wants to kill his ex-husband, perhaps because he treated him badly. But in reality, the woman is obsessed with the man and wants to recover it. Both of them used to enjoy rough entertainment (with whips of course). My advice to the general public is not to buy this film, not to rent it and not to watch it as I did (at 1:15 on FOX)
