Given the subject, I thought that this film would be at least pleasant, if it was a bit worthy of a masterpiece. I was wrong. I was still waiting for something to happen and it's over - I thought the finale was the moment that happened before it became exciting. The only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the effects deserve some recognition.
