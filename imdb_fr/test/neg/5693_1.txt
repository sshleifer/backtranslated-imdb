Today, I had a real need for a sci-fi movie and so I decided to go see Battlespace. Unfortunately, this is one of my biggest mistakes this year. <br /> <br /> I see that the director, Neil Johnson, has made more than 500 music videos and I suggest he come back to that. Music videos are an excellent form of entertainment, and not everyone can make movies. <br /> <br /> The worst of this movie is probably the voiceover. And that says a lot, because the special effects are sometimes appalling. The voiceover did not work in Blade Runner, and it does not work here. The first hour or so is spent watching the main character wander through the desert while her daughter tells the story. I think the story could have made a good movie, but not like that. <br /> <br /> The second negative point is the effect. They are just bad and do not blend into the picture at all. You do not believe in them. And absolutely all the images in the film have been filtered, and not in a good way. The filtering used as effect is good. 90 minutes, bad. <br /> <br /> And what do all the gadgets talk all the time and do not close!?!? If I had used such technology, I would have gone crazy. I was just waiting for the guns to go off with: "I'm terribly sorry, but it seems to me I'm out of ammo." No, stay away. This movie is just not worth the time.
