Sensational. Just wow. Never before had I seen a horror movie in which he appeared to be a bad fanfic self-fan that someone wrote one day in 20 minutes. And then I came across "Lady Frankenstein". This film takes everything you know about Frankenstein and puts it completely upside down ... and not in a good way. If you have seen this film, you met it by chance on Italian television or you have the dubbed version on the 50 Chilling Classics Box series, like at number 24. And let's just say that there is a reason why these movies are here. Because they are not very good. enough of that though, in the movie. <br /> <br /> It starts with Dr. Frankenstein trying to create the monster with his assistant who is .... obviously not great for any reason. Her daughter graduated from college (?) Introduces herself and explains how she just graduated from medicine, because yes. there were so many women doctors at the time. So she declares how she wants to help her father in his work and he says no. And then he makes the monster and that kills him. Then she cries for exactly 7 seconds and then invents with the assistant a story of burglar. The monster escapes and is unleashed. <br /> <br /> OK, I really can not believe they killed Dr. Frankenstein so early in the film. he dies 20 minutes later, then his daughter takes over. who .... does not make much sense, but of course. <br /> <br /> Lady Frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster that is going wild ... is to make another monster! oh yes how I like his logic. so his new monster has the body by killing someone and putting the wizard's brain on it ... I know. simply nod and continue. So the monsters meet and fight. I love the way the assistant asks, "Why do not you let the crowds kill him?" and she answers with "They would not know how to kill him!" and in the end he kills him with an ax in his head. haha. oh yeah, no one else could have imagined that. In the end, the brain is replaced by a new monster that kills Lady Frankenstein. The end. <br /> <br /> This movie was just ... weird. it was seriously as if someone was writing a self insert fanfic. There is no other way to describe this film. there were also strange nude scenes. like, this girl had naked sex in the park with her boyfriend, the monster takes her and the guy goes away. haha. good guy. She struggles a bit and dies of ..... to be quite honest, I really do not know what she's dead. But whatever. It's Lady Frankenstein. That does not make sense. <br /> <br /> This movie had a lot of these "Why?" moments to the point that I just gave up. The movies should not do that, but for whatever reason, I see it more than I should probably. <br /> <br /> So, last word, this is not the worst film I've seen on this pack, but it's a tad boring and full of many holes and many random things. <br /> <br /> Lady Frankenstein has 3 Frankenstein porn scenes out of 10
