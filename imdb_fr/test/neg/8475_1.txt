This "film", and I use this term vaguely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote at the age of eighteen months: "P., stinking shit!" <br /> <br /> Like this joke, this film can only interest the very young, the very immature or the very stupid. <br /> <br /> That said, there are some positives. <br /> <br /> The effects, where the majority of the $ 100 million dollars went, are kinetic and convincing - I mean, as compelling as these CGI kinetic effects may be. CGI baby effects are not great, but I guess it's very hard to do well ... even if for a hundred million dollars, they could have been better! <br /> <br /> Moose, the dog of "Frasier," telephoned in his usual exemplary performance. Steven Wright did well with a small part. Alan Cummings was, well, Alan Cummings as a bad guy, we've seen before, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable, but nice. <br /> <br /> The actress playing Mrs. Avery was cute as the button, as one would expect, and Jamie Kennedy stinks, as one might expect. His best role so far has been in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings trilogy) and in Three Kings. Maybe he should stick to more subtle forms of comedy. Jim Carrey, he will not be. <br /> <br /> The writing and the direction were, on the contrary, worse than the performance of Kennedy. I remember half a smart line (though seven years old) that I would like someone to quote precisely for the "Memorable Quotes" section. Something about Avery's proposed costume being "Crater's craziest shit" was a second-year joke, but a bit funny in context. <br /> <br /> Overall, since there is nothing less than a "one". I give a "one" to this film.
