Of all the films in the history of cinema, I can not imagine anyone sitting there and saying: I want to spend X dollars (or pounds sterling) to redo this imperfect classic film called "Breeders". Many stories have been turned into films on meteors coming to Earth with something sinister on the inside. Why not invest your money in a spectacular 3D remake of "It Came from Outer Space" instead? Why look for a filthy nudity movie that only existed for the purpose of showing a rubbery set of monsters and naked female students? Was the script of the 1986 version of "Breeders" so inspiring that these producers felt it was necessary to do it again and this time it was done correctly? In the end, the only reason this film exists is to show the Britcom pie, Samantha Janus. But if you want to use Sam Janus to play skin, you'd better have it nude than that and bare more than that if you want to succeed. <br /> <br /> Meteors. .. the monster escapes ... the students duff their clothes ... the monster eats people ... and another "and if?" the end follows. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I would never have thought of recommending the original "Breeders" to any other film, but it would be the one that would rank in 2nd place.
