Imagine yourself trapped in a dark Middle Ages museum and a resurrected vampire and his manic sidekick pursue you. Where is the last absolute place you want to hide? I would say inside the strange torture apparatus of the Virgin of Nuremberg, because there is a real risk that you would be brutally wounded to death. And yet, the old lady of this film runs stupidly in her spiked coffin. "The Vampire's Coffin" is a rather disappointing sequel, as director Fernando Méndez does not recreate the gothic atmosphere of the 1957 original, but focuses on situations and comic dialogues. No more threatening castles with strange cobwebs and dark vaults, but confused doctors and clumsy assistants who provoke laughter instead of fright. The story opens inside the last resting place of Count Lavud, where a prominent doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin to examine the corpse in a private clinic. Naturally, the wooden stake is removed from his heart and the vampire count returns to live, immediately enslaving the little thief to do his dirty work. The vampire has his eyes on a beautiful patient of the clinic and Dr. Enrique Saldívar has the duty to save his soul and destroy the sweat of blood. "The coffin of the vampire" uses a limited number of places and there is very little action. The whole movie would actually be pretty boring if there were not a handful of memorable footage and decent actor performances. The photography is amazing with the sublime use of shadows and darkness. This is particularly the case of the scene in which Count de Lavud is pursuing a young woman one night in the deserted streets of the small town. This is the only scene really worthy of this film, the rest is quite mediocre and already seen.
