I saw kung-fu cheese fighting movies. Living in Taiwan, they are replacing sitcoms in America. I've seen movies make fun of themselves, but this film belongs to the sad category of fight movies that strive too much with awful actors, props and awful music to be taken seriously. I really felt sorry for the person who composed the music for this movie. How sad must he be to be a composer who must produce bullshit like what I thought should have been called "Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op. 1" or "Variations on a smart guy pointing a gun on a head of girl locked in a corner "or the audacious" Flight of the helicopter ". Then the fight scenes were finished and the credits obtained. These had really made me laugh to tears. If the "special effects" were not sufficient proof that it was a reduced budget, the fact that only two or three of the crew, probably locals, had certainly benefited the economy much needed of the Philippine economy, but only for the purpose of saving money, never done anything since this series of films. They rented equipment, despite the consequences of this film. It was pretty funny too. The thing that really made me go though, though, was not the music (which let me half expect to see a GI Joe's animated Sargeant Slaughter), but the end ... I guess it would be a spoiler if there really was a plot to spoil, but when the American Ninja threw the girl into Jackson's arms and then his mask, I wanted to see him jump from the roof and Jackson drop the girl to catch him. <br /> <br /> I think that would have been the perfect punchline for this movie joke.
