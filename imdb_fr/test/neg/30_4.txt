Rita Hayworth is just breathtaking at times and, for me, the only reason to watch this silly movie. Despite the excessive lipstick of the 1940s, Rita was one of the glamorous women of all time in Hollywood. In fact, in recent years, I can not imagine anyone looking better, with the possible exception of Elizabeth Taylor. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the co-star of the show, Gene Kelly, is not playing her usual friendly, at least the kind of guy we all know in "Singin 'In The Rain ". Here, Kelly's "Danny McGuire" moves a lot of time. Phil Silvers, whom I liked on TV at "Sgt Bilko", is so stupid here that "Genius" you'll get tired of listening to his stupid jokes ... and they're stupid. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are good with the superb Technicolor, which is almost superb. You see a lot of pretty women here, not just Hayworth. Unfortunately, history is not everything. It is centered on Hayworth who decides on a career choice. Along the way, we get mediocre treatment of marriage and an insult-and-mute ending. In short, an immemorial film, except as a showcase of Hayworth's beauty.
