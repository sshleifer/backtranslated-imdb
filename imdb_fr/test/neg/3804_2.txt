... but apart from that, there is almost no redeeming social value for this sequel to the original Poseidon adventure. Where the hell are all the people of the original, including the rescue team? Michael Caine has had his most humiliating performance to date (although he later prevails with Jaws 4 on the road). Slim Pickens is just embarrassing as a Texas stereotype and, in general, just ask yourself: "Why did they bother?" The last helping hand of Irwin Allen to take advantage of the craze for disaster, I suppose.
