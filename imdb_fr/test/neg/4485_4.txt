I was convinced that my girlfriend had seen that. John was a good guy, adorable, sensitive and very beautiful without shirt !! I thought it was a love story about them, but it was mostly because of his reaction to his letters. Savannah was a nice character at the beginning of the movie, but once she abandoned him, I lost all respect for her. She said it tore her away from him and it was hard - he was the one who was millions of miles away, he was killing people and the only contact he had was by his letters !!! She did not die hard, she had family and money and he had a tour of duty !! I was so frustrated with the end when he forgave him - he was too much in love. I would have waited for 3 years and welcomed him home with open arms.
