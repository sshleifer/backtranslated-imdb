Oops. I hired this because I thought it was Bitter Harvest (1981), which was recommended. After the appearance of the dreadful Patsy Kensit, I checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake. OK, it's visible, because the main characters are very sexy, but the acting is awful. Stephen Baldwin looks moody all the time, which is understandable, considering his co-star. Is Patsy competing with Liz Hurley for the title of the most obviously useless actor on screen?
