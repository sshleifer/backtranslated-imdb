A British teenager film that revolves around a girl (Justine) accidentally creating her dream man (Jake) using a virtual reality machine, there is only one problem (well? ) where she is trapped inside her body with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person she can trust. It looks a lot worse than that, I found it easier to watch because Laura Fraser played a bigger role than the movie's content. WOW !!, If only I had a virtual reality machine ??????
