This owes much to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEUS. Although he is quite mature, it is partly the story of a rich young man who is shanghaied as a member of the crew aboard a freighter and thus becomes a man. Moran of the title is a young woman also raised on a boat belonging to her father. When the cargo burns, she and the crew members are evacuated to our boy's ship. However, the captain is underground and his intentions are not honorable with respect to Moran. The inevitable ensues - our boy falls in love with the man and Moran. In the end, the evil is under control and the lovers are united. An interesting dialogue indicates that Moran does not belong to any man - "and no woman". (A nod to Sappho here). Dorothy Dalton is sexed like Moran and not too attractive either. Valentino does well in a romantic action role. His figure and his sexy physique are highlighted and the role is rather masculine. He is very attractive. It's not a big movie but it's time. What is really highlighted is the beauty and sex appeal of Valentino.
