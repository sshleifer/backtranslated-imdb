I could not wait to see this movie. I like road thrillers. I like sex, drugs, youth, action and a good soundtrack. And I was particularly interested in traveling to the cinema across Europe to see if I recognized one of my places of travel. <br /> <br /> Since the first scene, this film was unassailable. What was Guy doing on the wrong side of the road? What could have blown up the van that drove gracefully on a shallow grassy slope? If they are such bad drivers, why would they accept a delivery job? And this is only the first scene! Not even bad enough to be campy or silly. Just horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Waste of time. Let's move on!
