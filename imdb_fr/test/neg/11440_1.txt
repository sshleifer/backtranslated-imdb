WOW, I hate to sound like an opinion, but anyone who has rated this movie higher than I just have to have must have an I.Q. it reaches incredibly low depths that extend beyond time and space and connect to the planet "Hopper is a self-timer for the making of this film". WOW this movie STANK. Fred Ward's haircut looks like SSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPIIIDD! In fact, I planned to send Fred Ward money to compensate for his miserable haircut he had in this horrible film. Jodie Foster, of course, did not have much to work on but still managed to do a terrible performance. Joe Pesci, oh my god ... Joe Pesci (who is not mysteriously not an actor) plays THE ULTIMATE, the stereotypical character of the movie Joe Pesci, complete with massacre and constant use of the word F. You will not believe your eyes . Dean Stockwell, looking at him in this mess made me feel bad because I actually thought he was intoxicated or temporarily delayed throughout the movie. Jon Turturro must have been intoxicated when he agreed to do so, with Vincent Price, Bob Dylan and Charlie Sheen. I know what you think, BIG CAST! I know, and it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Dennis Hopper directs and stars and does just as well in both fields. How could the man have managed EASY RIDER and it is beyond my excellent imagination. His excessively bad focus on the hit-man character is beyond the realms of horrible, and only matched the hilarious end. Hopper and Foster are the most uninteresting couple I know in the film world, and you will encourage them to lose and then to deeply annoy you. What exactly are they doing with this conclusion? I do not know, but I know that if I meet Dennis Hopper one day, I will laugh at him immensely for being responsible for this waste of celluloid. Meet me! IAN
