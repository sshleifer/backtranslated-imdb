Seriously, if you want to see a cliche horror movie, you have to see it, I guess. It contains all the "scary parts where nothing happens", "the type of nerd who is not killed," a boy and a girl who meet and survive "," face a scared old child "etc. .. I can go on I wanted to watch this movie because I thought the mix of a video game and a movie would work ... I guess I was wrong What makes the movie more bearable? It's only 1h17min so if you're bored it might be a good idea although I'm still pretty bored.Why absolutely not see it? Frankie Munitz aka Malcolm is just irritating as a nerd guy.I could hit the guy and he is so sad that he did not die earlier and that he even ends up coming back.
