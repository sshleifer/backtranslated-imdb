Heftig og Begeistret (Intense and Enthusiastic) tells the story of a men's choir in Berlevåg in northern Norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark during the winter and the cities face the young people are moving to the most populated areas of southern Norway, where the climate is warmer and opportunities are increasing. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this film is made up of humans themselves. The members of the choir, aged 30 to 95, all have a unique and colorful life and are very pleasant beings. They are characterized by the harsh climate and recession of the North and have adapted to the desired lifestyle. Throughout the film, we learn a little more about the many members of the choir and we follow them through songs, events in a church and on the port, then a trip to Murmansk. <br /> <br /> outdoor environment filmed in the film is very beautiful and characterized by the Norwegian nature. The scenography is also natural and comes directly from the choir and the life of the peoples we meet. The living rooms, the bathroom, the kettle on the oven; This film is not artificial, neither people, nor the environment, nor their music, nor their feelings. Everything is as real as possible. <br /> <br /> Everything is lost when it comes to telling a story. It's very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? Is it because of the songs? Is it because of nature? Or is it just to see a story about Berlevåg Mens-Choir, about their life and some of their travels? The message, if there is one, is that this small society is doing well through social events such as the choir. The choir has kept people together for many years. <br /> <br /> All this is nice, but being as popular as it was, seen by nearly 200,000 people in Norway, there is something wrong. There is no beginning or end. No one wins or loses anything, no one reveals a message or tries to convince the public that it is good or that the life up there is beautiful. Why was this film shot? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. It's a good movie about good people, but compared to average European, Scandinavian or Norwegian film - it does not deserve a 9 out of 10. It's closer to 4 out of 10, and that's what I'm going to give you . If you see this film in the cinema, you have to expect that the average age of the audience is around 55-60 years old. He reported being always high in all theaters. Perhaps this is also the reason why he has received such high praise in the news and good ratings also on the BDIM: it is a film about seniors, for seniors. It's a film of "I do not regret anything in my life", and a story that living in a small town like Berlevåg could be a good life too.
