I am a strong supporter of these Ghost Hunter shows. Ridiculous memories such as "The Haunting" from Discovery Channel to Scooby Doo Reality shows such as "Ghost Hunters". When I saw A & E's "Paranormal State" promos, I knew I was going to watch. Especially when "Paranormal State" was juxtaposed to a low Monday night football game. <br /> <br /> At the end of the "Paranormal State" pilot project, the main "character" of this macabre reality dance gives a Creepy Kid a bottle of Max Von Sydow Holy Water and reassures him by telling this boy that he also had a bad indeterminate experience while he was a child with things that "came out of the closet" and that the (Catholic) Church gave him a holy water fend off the obstacles that come out of the closet I knew I should have given Monday Night Football another shot. <br /> <br /> The shtick behind "Paranormal State" is a group of Penn State students who have all come together and launched their own Ghost Hunting Club. Or society. Or Super Adventure Club. And they scour the Pennsylvania in search of the most terrible hauntings and the lost plot of a film by Mr. Night Shymalan. <br /> <br /> The "They" is a kind of illusion. Really Paranormal State revolves around a Nittany Lion, Ryan Buell, who would likely host Penn State's annual Anime convention if it did not take place. He is often accompanied in his "investigations" by very hot students and other people in the credits but rarely filmed. Hey, are they also ghosts? <br /> <br /> This is Ryan Buell's show. Paranormal State is his "vehicle", as we like to say in the Biz. And, oh, what a boring ride in a vehicle, it can be. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that Ryan was telling the whole episode of Paranormal State with a voice over "director's diary" without date? It becomes almost immediately boring because the obvious intention is to give his ghost a hunt for gravity, but its monotonous filtered only causes grunts and bursts of laughter. Seriously, each serious intonation resembles the radio conversation of a Call of Duty video game. <br /> <br /> The "investigations" - the plot around which each episode turns - are interesting on the surface. There are no hostels or haunted restaurants in "the paranormal state". It's a show about the fear of the unknown as a good Catholic boy and, by God, they give you things to fear. <br /> <br /> Little children are harassed, the situation is dark, voices incite the living to kill, and Aleister Crowely rubs my hands. On the two episodes I watched, everyone revolved around violent and nasty hauntings related to violent and nasty deaths. <br /> <br /> Maybe. <br /> <br /> Maybe not. <br /> <br /> Everything in "Paranormal State" is cut short in half an hour, "Dog the Bounty - uh, Ghost Hunter". Whenever there is an interesting and verifiable piece of evidence - the killing of a family on a farm in the nineteenth century - the evidence is presented to the viewer as a scammer trying to convince you of a pile of papers now under your responsibility. Nose is proof that these ten million dollars come from Nigeria and are then withdrawn before you can have a good look. <br /> <br /> At least, with "Ghost Hunters" from the Sci-Fi channel, there is a somewhat excessive need to collect all the possible evidence and present it to the viewer. EVP could be a rat wax, cold spots in a do-it-yourself home, and "orbs" that even ghost hunters consider to be dust. It's a kind of Scooby Doo approach that makes "ghost hunters" ... almost credible. <br /> <br /> While "Paranormal State" claims to have EVPs but gives the viewer a video clip of a ten-second wave file in Garage Band without audio. Yes, you see, an Executive Vice President, is not it? People claim to see dark characters in the basement ... Well, let's just go see about it ... while leaving the night vision camera on a captivating fixed shot of the living room. Ryan, the intrepid leader of this group of Penn State graduates, claims to have "visions" of the name of a demon he knows who could be involved in a paranormal obsession ... But he can not tell us , the public or his team of graduate students, because ... He can not. You never say the name of a demon aloud, Ryan informs the co-ed. Eyes wide-eyed who dares to inquire. <br /> <br /> Well, it's really handy for you. Especially since it is a TV show where the public can not read your mind. <br /> <br /> "The Paranormal State" is completely in its turn and without prestige. The public is informed of what is supposed to happen, but you never see any evidence that the scary kid sees Dead People. Not even the grainy video of a moving chair, or a black drop between prison cells. Nothing. Ryan just tells you what happened by another mechanical voice. <br /> <br /> If you are going to try to scare me, I dress it up a bit. If you try to convince me, show me an orb or a drop and ask the fat girl who works day by day at Hot Topic to tell me why this black orb is really the spirit of a murderer with an ax. And if you want me to watch a ghost hunting show, give me something else to tell Lorraine Warren in the second episode. <br /> <br /> "The paranormal state" is a weak sauce. You do not have to watch if you're not on TV or if you only have a small collection of DVDs. Or unless you want to know what really happened in this closet with holy water.
