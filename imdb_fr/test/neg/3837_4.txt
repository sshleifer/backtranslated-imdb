Hopper has never been worse than if he felt as if this film deserved a grade B performance and produced a pretty good one. Apart from Madsen and Hopper, the acting is horrible; you have seen better at your local high school. The sound and sometimes editing and shooting are low images of B-movies. The scene with the voyeur is one of the biggest free nudity scenes I have ever seen in the cinema (she is not even close to appearing in the movie). The scenario was probably a great 10-page shot, but when it comes to a feature film, there are more holes than the corpses left by Madsen. I must say that Hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the Hummer made me laugh out loud, but I do not think that was the intention. Yes, there is a little style and Hopper can always attract my interest. However, the interesting concept of the plot never pays and you wonder why you have wasted your time watching this.
