THE QUICKIE (1 of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> A rather poor film ... a story as old as a mountain dweller telling the story of a high-ranking gangster who wants to quit yielding his empire to his incompetent son. Of course, it will not be easy for someone in this line or in this job to quit ... so a contract is signed for his life. After organizing a big party, an exterminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I suppose will never act in movies other than TV movies or direct low budget video waste) is called to the scene. Our "hero" passes by ... giving her a lot of money for a "quick shot" ... she refuses her offer, even if she needs money ... but ends up staying all night. .. even after being brutally harassed by the overzealous son who thinks he was sent to kill his father. Ugh. The story continues over and over again ... you can see every "twist" and "bend" coming a mile away. The soundtrack of a band called "The Tiger Lillies" will drive most people crazy ... but I thought there was some sort of cool song towards the end. Or maybe I was just excited because I could tell that the movie was almost done? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ... what the heck has happened to you?
