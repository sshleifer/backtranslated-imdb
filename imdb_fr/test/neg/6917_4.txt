Dr. Markoff is a mad scientist who is experimenting and trying to find a cure for a viral cause of acromegaly. When he attends a piano concert, he is struck by the beautiful girl of the pianist and begins to court her. But when she does not want to have anything to do with him, he infects his father with the acromegaly virus in order to extort money and his daughter in exchange for treatment. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise of this low-budget B-grade thriller. I must say that this movie disappointed me. Not that it was horrible, it was not, but there was nothing particularly remarkable about it either. It was quite entertaining for a viewing, but it's not the one that will stay in my memory. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is sometimes a bit cheesy and the acting is mediocre. The story is quite predictable and brings us nothing new. Of course, I can not complain too much about a movie in which a man wearing a gorilla costume is useless, and a stern-looking doctor who looks like Svengali fails to fascinate his victims. <br /> <br /> It may be worth watching if you like this kind of film, but do not go into this film with too many expectations.
