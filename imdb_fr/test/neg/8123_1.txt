I do not care if this show is supposed to convey deep messages about human existence. <br /> <br /> The show is shit .... how can you enjoy watching it? Yet he was so well received. This reflects the sad situation for Joe Moron. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch this program when it came out for the first time while friends were talking about it. The insane laughter between the two main characters and the pitiful dialogue made me want to cry. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that people can watch this show. Still, I guess the creators had the last laugh .... getting rich by eliminating the audience of people watching a show like this. <br /> <br /> I would bet they are laughing all the way to the bank.
