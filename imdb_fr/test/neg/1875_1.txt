Stripes, an army training camp comedy starring Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is one of my favorites. Meatballs, a summer camp show starring Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is a total waste of time. It takes a considerable effort for four screenwriters to produce a film (the word "comedy" suggests a whimsical work) as witty, anemic and boring as this one. <br /> <br /> Murray has apparently reached the same conclusion during filming, but his usually reliable improvisational powers are eluding him and his unbridled attempts to breathe life into the proceedings only add to the embarrassment: the singing scene "It really does not matter" is atrocious. It does not help that secondary actors are devoid of talent - the funniest thing about them is their hair, but then Meatballs was created in 1979. ("And introducing Chris Makepeace as Rudy" announces the credits of No, not THE Chris Makepeace?!). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Reitman rectified his mistake two years later for Stripes. Murray's shtick is so much fun when he makes fun of John Candy, Warren Oates and John Larroquette. Dump it and look at it.
