Horrible! One of my friends (who obviously thought I had an abyssal sense of humor) recommended it. <br /> <br /> These are reels. I almost turned it off. It's only a British attempt to make a movie with a group of TV actors also using a lame script from their mate. in the business. I can not think of anything that can get close to the poverty of this film. Less funny than global warming. <br /> <br /> I'm not so vehement as usual, but I watched it well over a decade ago and I thought losing an hour or two of my life was destructive. /> <br /> Puerile, less conspiracy, useless tosh. <br /> <br /> I prefer to eat my feet than watch again.
