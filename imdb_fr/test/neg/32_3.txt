This film seems well done and additional efforts must be made to promote the films made by women. Apart from that, this film is also deeply troubling as it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a deeply disturbed character. If you've seen promotional material, you might think it's a poignant film about a relationship that has ended, but none of this indicates how troubling the central premise is: /> <br /> A woman threatens to commit suicide unless her future ex-wife agrees to relive the most precious memory of their relationship here. When told to what extent such a threat is unfair (to say the least), Tessa (the so-called protagonist) suggests that "life is not fair". <br /> <br /> Huh? This character also uses tears to manipulate his former lover and persuade him to engage in sexual behavior (which she initially denies the motive) while assuring him "that it is not sex". <br /> <br /> Invert the genres, play the lead roles by Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green, which could be shown in Lifetime's feature film with a title like "Hostage to Obsession". There is no medically accepted definition of healthy mental and emotional stability that would encompass Tessa's behavior in this film. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Kristen Thomson for playing a manipulative and psychotic role to the limit, perhaps all too well because there is no well-adjusted person, man or woman, who could watch this and do not have chills along the spine.
