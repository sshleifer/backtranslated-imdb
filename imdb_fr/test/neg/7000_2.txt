1st watched 21/06/2001 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Emmanuel Itier): Thriller supposed without much value who spends more time to train us in sexual encounters with and without the star "Amber Smith". We try to wrap a story around the scenes of sex but, as usual with these types of films, it is not very well done. I was so bored by this movie that I made a quick lead to the end to finish. The video version I watched was called 'Tell Me No Lies'.
