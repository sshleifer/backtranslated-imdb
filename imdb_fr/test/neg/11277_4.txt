A previous IMDb critic stated that "Rafter Romance" was a "scam" (the term used by the other reviewer) of a German musical called "Me By Day, You By Night". Apparently, this critic is aware that * these two * films borrowed their premises from "Box and Cox", an English play written by John Maddison Morton in 1847. This play deals with two traders who rent the same room in an unscrupulous landlord, each man believing himself the only tenant. As the working hours of the two men are different, the trick is not discovered right away. This room was once so popular in Britain that "Box and Cox" became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly sharing a home were destined for one person. <br /> <br /> The innovation of "Rafter Romance" (and its predecessor) is that both tenants are now a man and a woman, who inevitably develop a novel.As usual in these cornball movies, the guy and the girl hate each other until they fall into each other's arms Hoo boy <br /> <br /> The owner of this movie is played by George Sidney, an actor specialized in reproducing sympathetic Jewish stereotypes, George Sidney has never been as annoying as the hateful Harry Green (the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit), but Sidney's depictions of Jewish characters are always exaggerated and embarrassing to to watch. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable thing about 'Rafter Romance To my knowledge, this is the first Hollywood movie to refer to Hitler and the rise of Nazism.' 'At some point in this movie, the owner Eckbaum (Sidney) discovers that his son Teenager, Julius, was burning swastikas on his walls. Eckbaum and his son are clearly supposed to be Jewish. Admittedly, no one in Hollywood in 1933 had any idea what Hitler was preparing for Jews in Europe ... yet it is surprising to see a movie about a Jewish teenager who thinks swastikas are a joke. His father is, quite rightly, irritated by this display of the Nazi symbol. <br /> <br /> A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the fact that all major Hollywood studios have continued to do business with the Third Reich. until 1939. The main Hollywood ladies were medically documented as "Aryan" so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, Hollywood's leading men have been documented as "Aryan and uncircumcised." With the exception of Darryl Zanuck at Twentieth Century-Fox, all the Hollywood studio directors who collaborated on this policy were Jewish ... but clearly had no objection to doing business with Hitler. I am surprised that 'Rafter Romance' contains a scene of unfavorable swastikas, as this footage would have made the film Verboten in Germany and Austria. (Maybe the scene was made for the release in Germany: it's not crucial for the plot of the film.) Apart from that, the film contains nothing remarkable. Robert Benchley makes his characterization banal and confused: I never understood the attraction of this man. I rate 'Rafter Romance' 4 out of 10.
