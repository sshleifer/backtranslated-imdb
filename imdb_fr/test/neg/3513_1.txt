A silent and meaningless film should appeal to Southern Rednecks, teenagers whose IQ is on the edge of the retarded and the average supporter of Bush. Noble Willingham plays the lead role in this sober scenario and uses a generous dose of MFers, eff this and that, and SOB. The end I planned to "save" this hollow story was the biggest disappointment, leaving me suspended and asking, "Why?" <br /> <br /> It's a story of cat and mouse or more like Bully vs. victim. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time unless you like to hear the phone ring every two minutes and swear continually to swear and scream throughout this 123-minute pudding.
