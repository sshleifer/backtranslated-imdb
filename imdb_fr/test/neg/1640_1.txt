BOOOOOOOORRRRRINNGGGGGGGGG and STOOOOOOOPIDDDDD. I fell asleep. If you want to see Miles O'Keefe rushing into a hairy Speedo, rent this movie. If this is not the case, do not bother ... Rifle with anachronisms. Was it supposed to be in the Ice Age, the Iron Age, the Age of Steel, or the age of reason? What was the reason for the black nylon wig on the guy disguised as Genghis Khan? Was it really supposed to be Genghis Khan? If Ator had access to so many advanced technologies and science, why wait another 1000 years for Leonardo? We never know where Ator comes from or if he is supposed to be a superior being. You wonder if everything was explained in the first movie, but after seeing this one, you know you'll never do it.
