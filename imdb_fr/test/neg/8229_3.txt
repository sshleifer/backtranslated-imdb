It's not a very good movie, but it's definitely the best Troma Studios movie I've ever seen. Lloyd Kaufman - the "brain" behind Troma - does not care about a good screenplay or even a moderately entertaining movie. His main concern is to do something weird. And his definition of the weird often reflects my definition of terrible cinema. <br /> <br /> In this film, we have the character called Luther - whose favorite pastime is not baseball but bites the chickens' heads - he gets his release from the block. The jury found him rehabilitated despite the fact that he does not speak - he just complains like a chicken - and has a set of razor blade prostheses. Of course, once Luther is released, he gets involved, first in a grocery store, then on a farm. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Lots of violence in this often tasteless place.) Luther shoves his razor blades into an old lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest film to terrorize his mother and daughter on the farm). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$$ (Stacy Haiduk has remarkable skin in her painting, while former Lois Lane (I can not remember the Superman edition she came from) gives us a shower scene followed by a madness in bed with her boyfriend - a guy who does not know it Haiduk has no chemistry The shower sequences in the DVD supplements give a little more to the viewer She is really something). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $ (Forgettaboutit !!! The scenario of Whitey Styles may be the worst ever written.The way Luther is released from the asylum throws credibility through the window. is a message that a preschooler could write and that the actions he writes for his characters are close to the absurd It's as if Styles had spent ten years without human contact and had completely forgotten the reaction people in certain situations.) <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (The film belongs to Edward Terry who does a decent job as a Geek Joan Roth as a mother does a great job of supporting but Haiduk and the lack of chemistry of his boyfriend made their roles inconvenient at best).
