I must start by saying that this is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen in my life! Boring number one factor: never see the face of the "son" (for the whole film). And the infinitely more annoying factor: this phone that rings all the time ... nothing but ringing the ringing ring again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again ... you get my point. The old man was harassed, but so was the viewer! At first, the film was interesting for me, but it deteriorated very quickly. The film may have been good as a short film, but it certainly was not enough to maintain a close feature film. What I'm trying to say is that the message about racism (which finally made its appearance in the last two scenes of the film) is secondary to the fact that this old man was harassed. Who cares to sit and watch what is really nothing more than an old man gushing out of obscenities at a joke calling him ?? If you have never seen a film that puts you under the skin and drives you crazy ... look at this one!
