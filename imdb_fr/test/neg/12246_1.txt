I blame The Comebacks for all those who liked Date Movie and Epic Movie. You've encouraged Fox Studio to continue to produce desperate parody movies, and we're now facing what is perhaps the most lazy and hopeless of all. The Comebacks is hardly qualified as a parody. Heck, he hardly qualifies as a movie. It's a comedy in theory, but not in execution. Nobody, not even the people involved in this mess, could have fooled themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie. Director Tom Brady (The Hot Chick) did something really miserable here. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can even call it that, is centered on a man named Lambeau Fields (David Koechner). Just when I heard her name in the first two seconds of the movie, I knew I was in a long movie. Funny names are rarely funny and become less and less funny as you hear them. Lambeau is one of the worst coaches in the world, but his best friend, Freddie Wiseman (Carl Weathers), gave him another chance to coach a high school football team called The Comebacks. Lambeau must not only lead the team to victory, but also teach them the secrets of inspiring sports film clich√©s. He expects his children to have bad grades and alcohol problems, and ridicule them when they do not. When it looks like the team has a chance to play at the big Toilet Bowl Championship (10-year-old children have written this scenario?), Lambeau is shocked to discover that Freddie is the coach of the big rival team that his team play against. It turns out that Freddie only encouraged Lambeau to take the coaching post because he wanted to lose The Comebacks. <br /> <br /> The Comebacks is a film so forced and pathetic that I almost had a hard time believing what I was watching. Parodic films have recently become a "film reference" game, and this perpetuates the tradition. He tries to include as many references as possible to other sports movies, but he does absolutely nothing with them, expecting us to just point to the screen and laugh at familiarity, or he tries to be funny and fall flat. face. Some of the referenced films include Field of Dreams, Bend It Like Beckham, Rocky Balboa, Friday Night Lights, Stick It, Radio, Miracle, Remember the Titans, Gridiron Gang, Invincible and Dodgeball: a real kid story. But wait, was not Dodgeball already a parody of inspiring sports movies? In other words, we are looking at a parody of a parody of inspiring sports films. If that sounds logical, you're just the audience this movie is looking for. Some of these movies are referenced in the plot, and some (like Rocky's) are screened for nothing, because the filmmakers wanted to try to reference as many movies as possible. There are some that the film even feels the need to explain in its dialogue, just in case we missed the obvious reference. You know that a movie is in trouble when it has to tell us its own jokes. <br /> <br /> The worst is that the screenplay of TV veterans and new screenwriters, Ed Yeager and Joey Gutierrez, do not even know the first and most important rule of parody - You must play right. The actors must pretend that they are not in the joke. The reason Zucker Brothers' classic films like Airplane, Top Secret and The Naked Gun got so much attention is because they chose serious actors like Leslie Nielsen (yes, he was a serious actor before to turn to comedy) and Robert Stack. then threw them into ridiculous situations. What makes it funny is that they acted as if they were not in a comedy and kept their faces impassive against the strange strangeness that surrounded them. These films would not have worked if they had played their roles in a broad way. The Comebacks proves it, because all the actors are obliged to play their roles, then, they are like shouting that we laugh. David Koechner continues to waving his arms, bulging his eyes and screaming so much that he looks like someone who knows he is trapped in a dead comedy and tries too hard to pretend he's going through a good time. . The film also does not include the art of celebrity cameos (also an important factor when it comes to parody movies). What kind of cameos do we have in The Comebacks? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman. <br /> <br /> At the moment the film throws an extremely useless and useless musical number in the casting of "Do not Stop Believing" of Journey, for some reason absolutely, I was ready to go out by the door of the theater. I was the only person in my projection, and the idea that this film goes pathetically in a completely empty house pleased me a bit. I sat during the rest of the Comebacks and I was not rewarded for my efforts. What's sad is that Fox has not finished killing the parody genre yet. They have a parody of 300 to appear next year called Meet the Spartans. I would say it can not be worse than that, but I saw the trailer and I do not want your hopes to come true.
