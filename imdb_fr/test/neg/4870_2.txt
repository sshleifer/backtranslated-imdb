This film is filled with so many idiotic moments, you wonder how it was done. For example, they enter the sewers of the Capitol and while they are in the sewers, you can see signs indicating various government buildings, then they go up in the middle of the street! I doubt that government buildings will provide public access through the city's sewage system. Anyway, I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 just because of its comic value. I laughed all along the idiocy of all the people involved in this movie.
