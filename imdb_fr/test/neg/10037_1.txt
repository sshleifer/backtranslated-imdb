In addition to the fact that it is only an abyssal film (imagine giving a camcorder to the middle school high school club), those who think there is something "real" in this legend must grow. It's the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts do not exist. Most people learn this from their mothers around the age of five. You seriously need to grow. <br /> <br /> The fact that a fraud was committed nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it less fraudulent. The fact that a large number of Tennessee inbred hillbillies believe this does not do it either. Go to the University. Or at least finish high school.
