My age: 13 <br /> <br /> Keats, played by Damon Wayans, and Archie Moses, played by Adam Sandler, are the best friends in the world for a year. What Moses does not know is that Keats is actually Jack Carter, an undercover policeman, waiting for the right moment to overthrow Moses and Frank Colton, a great criminal with whom Moses is involved. When Colton and Moses discover that Keats is a cop, Colton wants to kill Moses, but he gets away from it after shooting Carter in the head, which does not kill Carter. Moses is found by the cops and is taken as evidence of Colton's wrongdoing. But when the cops, including Carter, are about to escort him across the country by plane, all the other cops are killed and Moses and Carter are alone in the desert. Carter must stay alive and take Moses. <br /> <br /> A pretty average action comedy, Bulletproof has a fair scenario, but a big part of the movie is just stupid. For a comedy, I found most jokes totally insane. But as an action movie, it contains some pretty good action scenes. Not being a good fan of Adam Sandler or Damon Wayans, I found the acting and, therefore, the characters, well below par. The climax is not really great and the movie is so unrealistic. It's not quite bad, but not too good, and it's way too short. Below 85 minutes, I still had 15 minutes left, but that was not the case, and the movie was too short. Overall, it's not a complete waste of time, but I would still not recommend Bulletproof. <br /> <br /> Australian classification: MA 15+: medium level violence, sexual references, average coarse language <br /> <br /> Rating: 56 out of 100
