Disappointing film with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler. When he is discovered, he is forced to sign a document stating that he acted on the orders of England. His refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Pidgeon is pursued in England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but remains as always, the incarnation of personified wickedness. <br /> <br /> Throughout her career, Pidgeon meets Joan Bennett, the latter wearing a wonderful cockney accent. <br /> <br /> The story gets bogged down. a little as love develops between the two, but again at the approach of the Second World War, realism becomes the object of the day. <br /> <br /> The scene ending in the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is well done, but know where this arrow is. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting to note that even though Pidgeon is fleeing Nazi Germany, he finds a young Roddy McDowall, one of the many co-stars of Pidgeon the same year in the memorable "How Green Was my valley. " How green was "Man Hunt?"
