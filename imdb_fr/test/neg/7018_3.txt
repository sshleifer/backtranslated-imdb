Lucille Ball can not sing, play or dance. This makes the quality of his performance in MAME all the more terrible. She does not have the right to make the slapstick bas-front that has made her a success on television, so she must rely on the construction of a character. Unfortunately, Ms. Ball never learned this skill because none of the tender moments has heat. What does she really think about Patrick or Beau? We never really believe the words she says. Ms. Ball's vacant gaze is supposed to convince us that she is broadcasting, but there is no chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or Bea Arthur. For this reason, every scene in which she is is flat. <br /> <br /> In addition, when Ms. Ball opens her mouth to sing, we are immediately informed of the reason why the studios have doubled her voice for all the other musicals in which she plays earlier in her career . It has been said that she asked for her voice to be used, so it is a mistake of ego and leadership. The situation gets worse when she sings voice over and she has to "act the moment" without words. Those who thought it would work forgot who played Mame. <br /> <br /> I understand that Rosalind Russell played the role on stage and in the movie AUNTIE MAME. In addition, I am aware that Angela Lansbury won a Tony for her performance in the original Broadway musical in 1966. None of these women were known for their singing voices, but both could have done better than Lucille Ball . Why did they go with her is the worst in terms of flagrant wrong decision. <br /> <br /> The only person who is unscathed is Bea Arthur. She is tall and wonderful, catty and common in all the right quantities. Unfortunately, you are still waiting for the film to come out and invite you to have fun. But the movie never does and you can not. No one but Bea Arthur seems to be having fun. <br /> <br /> A bad additional criticism goes to the director Gene Saks. Saks is known as an award-winning director of musicals for stage and screen, including the Broadway musical on which this film is based. None of these skills and expertise are useful here. The mediocre quality of editing and narration in this film is under the guidance of a director of his caliber. This flagrant mistake in the execution of the film is not Ms. Ball's fault.
