I watched this movie recently, mainly because I'm a huge fan of Jodie Foster. I saw that this film was shot between his two Academy Award winning performances, so my expectations were pretty big. Unfortunately, I found the film horrible and I still wonder how she was able to persuade her to make this movie. The script is really weak. The story itself could have been somewhat believable if someone like Mel Gibson had played the role of hit-man. Jodie's idea with Dennis Hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me. I thought Jodie looked great all the way through the movie, which was probably the only reason I watched it all. Scrolling Jodie with as little clothing as possible was the only reason the film was shot. I saw a televised biography of Jodie where practically all his films were commented in chronological order, and this film was the only one ever mentioned. After seeing it, I can now see why.
