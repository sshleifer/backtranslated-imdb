Is not it odd that crappy movies always tend to be a bit better when you start looking at them with an attitude like this: "boy, it'll suck harder than few things have ever been sucked before "? It's almost impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high ?? or even remotely, positive expectations, because "House of the Dead 2" is a sequel to something that is generally considered one of the worst disasters of the genre ever seen. The abominable reputation of the original proved to be a significant advantage for director Michael Hurst, as it was very easy to surpass the quality level of his predecessor. And how bad should it be for Uwe Boll, huh? Having to recognize that a simple video suite without star star or promotional campaigns is MUCH better than its own pretentious video gaming interpretation? In case someone still doubts: NO, "House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" is not at all a good horror movie, but, YES: it is definitely better than the first one and deserves even be rented in case you are looking for a low-demanding job. splashing movie with loads of gore butchering, sleaze and silly humor. There is no real connection to the events of the first film (another advantage) and this second part opens as a typically rancid sex comedy taking place on a university campus. The Men's Fraternity Club plans to attack a sorority house, populated exclusively by blonde students with huge breasts, but the party is interrupted when a senseless teacher (Sid Haig!) Directs his car on a girl and brings her back to his laboratory to turn around. she in a zombie. This is the beginning of a deadly epidemic that is spreading quickly but without fear, the government is ready and sends its best scientists and soldiers on campus to search for survivors and bring blood samples as an antidote. The zombie hunt seems to be the most common thing in the world for this squadron, they have even named them Hyper Sapiens, but their ever increasing numbers endanger the lives of the most hardened soldiers. The director Hurst has happily found his inspiration in the most eminent classics of the genre, like "Aliens" by James Cameron and ?? of course - George A. Romero's dead trilogy, especially the "Day of the Dead". Fortunately, he did not make the same mistakes as Uwe Boll, who inserted video game sequences into his movie (why?!?) And * slightly * exaggerated with the use of CGI techniques. HotD 2 contains heavy images of violence, like chopped female corpses and detailed amputations, but it never really gets nauseating or shocking. Of course, there is not the slightest suspense to appreciate and every horrible cliche of horror is here too. The film is very enjoyable as long as screenwriter Mark Altman does not try to explain the origins of zombie outbreaks. They walk corpses, head out of their skulls, so we do not need to know what caused them to die. Especially not when explanations are given by a blonde slut to sorority who clearly has no idea what all the medical terms mean. Just avoid getting stung, darling.
