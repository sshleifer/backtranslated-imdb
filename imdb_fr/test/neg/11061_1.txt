If you are a little masochist and like to waste time, you should try this one. I have lost enough time watching him and will not waste time explaining why it's so horrible. Be warned!!! Oh, I see that I have to fill 10 lines or more. We go there: every year, some people find it fun to shoot a low-budget movie about the frightening monsters of the underground, which, hopefully, will prove to be a success. The cave is one of those. I did not expect much from that, but the acting is so bad and the production so bad that I seriously think about asking for a refund. Phewww ... one last line about a useless movie ... Oh, I'm done.
