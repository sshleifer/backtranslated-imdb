"Frightmare" from 1983 is a strange little movie. The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of the classic horror movies of the 30s / 40s with the shock factor of the slasher genre of the 80s exploding. This is not a total success (mainly because of very obvious budget constraints and the unprofessional caliber of its young actors), but it still has its good moments, mainly because of the classical performance (more class than the film does not Deserves that). the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays the role of "Conrad Ratzoff", a former aging horror film star (ala Vincent Price). At the beginning of the film, we meet a famous horror star as he makes an advertisement for dentures and we soon learn that Conrad is a bit of a hite-toity, prima donna jerk-off. Just when you thought he could not be more out of order, the commercial director was berating Conrad for blowing a lot and the old goat drove him to death. Nice, huh? Conrad then visits fans at a horror movie club on a university campus. Unfortunately, he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech and eventually returns to his mansion waiting to die. Still fiery, even at death's door, he managed to get rid of a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before finally hitting the bucket himself. Conrad then rests in the authentic Hollywood style in a hi-tech neon grave with video screens over the coffin, which will broadcast Conrad's own personal video messages for visitors who come in to pay their respect. <br /> <br /> It's at this point that the children of the Horror Movie Society decide to visit Conrad's grave after hours, to sink into the grave and bring his body back to the house for a night party. (That's not really my idea of ​​fun, but hey, they're characters from a 1980s horror movie. Logic has no place here.) College kids spend the evening eating dinner with the body Conrad sat in a place of honor, posing for photos with and even dancing in the room with her, before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to bring him back to his crypt in the morning. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ratzoff, upset by the theft of her husband's body, appealed to a psychic friend to try to "join" Conrad during a session. You can pretty much understand the rest of here. As Conrad was not very kind in life, it is not an exaggeration to assume that he will not be friendlier in death. Psychic Lady gets in touch with Conrad who wakes up predictably, then spends the rest of the movie strolling down the halls of the ridiculously gigantic student house, removing the tomb robbers one by one. This is where the film falls apart. Endless scenes of teens wandering the empty hallways saying "Hello? Is there anyone?" are interspersed with occasional bursts of violence (we get a rather thorny decapitation scene, which is the highlight of the film) before the last two survivors finally discover (much later than any semi-intelligent people would have understood the same thing ... but again, we are in a horror movie of the 80s!) that the only way to stop the chaos is to bring Conrad's body back into its crypt, to which it belongs. The slow pace is complemented by many strange light effects and dry ice mist, supported by a soundtrack composed almost entirely of sound effects rather than music (thunder, moans and screams, etc.) that becomes very painful after a while. . <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend "Frightmare" to anyone who has not grown up watching cheap movies like this on a late-night cable in the 80s. fans of "Modern Horror" will undoubtedly find "Frightmare" incredibly slow and awkward. However, if you have reached the age of maturity during this magical decade, you could receive a burst of nostalgia for "Frightmare". Fans of Jeffrey ("Re-Animator") Combs may also want to take a look, as the future Dr. West appears very early in the role of one of the unlucky movie students. <br /> <br /> I will advise you. the reader should avoid the version of this EastWestDVD label film (paired with Roy Ward's "Vault of Horror" and sold in dollar stores) because the print quality is poor. I am told that the movie got a luxury outing via Troma people, which seems appropriate. If you're like Troma, then "Frightmare" will suit you perfectly.
