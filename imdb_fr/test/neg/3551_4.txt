Not even original in the plot. Ho hum. There were some angles that could have been quite interesting, but the film follows the path traveled by 90% of Hollywood movies. I do not really understand how Samuel Jackson plays most of the time in his other films, but he was pretty good at it. He rarely screamed and went much further in his character rather than returning to an "anger of your face". I liked Eva Mendes - as usual - and although she is a real treat for the eyes, she turns out to be much more than an actress Luis Guzman was really good too, except that I did not like the change of his character towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the film. How can a character turn around an aversion to an ex-cop and turn into lollipop in a split second? Is there no more original thought in Hollywood?
