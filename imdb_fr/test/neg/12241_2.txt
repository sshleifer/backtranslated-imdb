When I first saw footage of this film on television, I thought it might be a fun movie. I was wrong. Although I'm not totally against movies that make fun of others. Some are really funny like the first horror movie. This is one of many recent achievements that have not been. The humor in this movie was anything but funny and rather dull. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems is that they made fun of many movies like Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick it And if you're a bit like me, you try to choose each movie instead of paying attention to what's going on in this one. Even the humor of the adults in this movie was dry. Do yourself a favor and save time, money and rent rent do not rent this movie
