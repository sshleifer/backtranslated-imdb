Produced by Nott Entertainment, this movie is "not" very good at all. I sat for the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad, the casting is bad and the work of the camera is bad. When I hear that there is a download of this floating movie on the Internet, it is not even worth the bandwidth. <br /> <br /> Until the writing of this review, the average vote for this film was 8.5, which made me see it and there was a large average of 10 for that , obviously voted by liars and shills. This movie is "not" for everyone. Or, parents, if you want to punish your kids with this awful movie, have them go through this one for Halloween.
