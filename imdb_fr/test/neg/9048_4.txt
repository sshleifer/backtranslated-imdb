"Eaten Alive" is much easier than Ruggero Deodato's "Cannibal Holocaust", but it's also a much dumber film. I mean, sometimes it can be unintentionally hilarious, but the plot is so stupid that it's impossible not to lose all patience in the end. The tough guy Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) teams up with Janet Agren (The Gates of Hell, here with an intolerable accent) to search the jungle of New Guinea for the sister of Agren, who has brainwashed by the head of a religious cult (Ivan Rassimov). Along the way, they witness the (sometimes real) torture of animals and poorly rendered cannibalism. Directed by Umberto Lenzi, the film is so exciting that it's hard to take seriously, but if you like trashy movies with more than a few involuntary laughter, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
