Certainly not your typical Polizia, Redneck has never worked for me. The film tells the story of a gem robbery gone wrong and a boy who was inadvertently kidnapped during the process. In their attempt to escape, thieves leave behind a bloody trail of death as they devise a plan to redeem the boy. The plan is never abandoned because thieves are more likely to go to France and the boy intends to stay with them. Although I can mention a number of problems that I encountered with the film, I will focus on the most obvious ?? the Memphis character played by Telly Savalas. From his work in The Dirty Dozen and Kelley's Heroes to other Italian films such as Crime Boss, to his most memorable role in Kojak, Savalas was a winner. I have always considered him an extremely cool client. Unfortunately, Savalas is almost unassailable in Redneck. Did the director turn on the camera and ask him to act as psychotic as possible? It might not have been worse if his actions had been committed in the context of a plot that was close to my heart, but here he seems to act oddly to be weird. It seems like a random madness. And what is this accent? Savalas may have done a lot of things, but Southern is not. He looks completely ridiculous even trying the accent. Beyond that, I found little interest in the rest of the film. As I said, the plot has never attracted me. I did not care what was happening. And the idea that the boy is so quickly drawn to the criminal lifestyle does not ring true. As for the other actors, Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savalas and the very reliable Franco Nero is not much better. Three "named" actors and not a good performance between them. To make matters worse, I think the director has filmed a lot of night scenes with nothing more than the glow of his watch to illuminate the plans. I could not say what was happening. Characters I hate, a plot that does not bother me and production values ​​that have failed? no wonder I gave Redneck a 3/10.
