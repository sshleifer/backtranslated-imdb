This film is probably one of the 3 worst films in history. I rented it by chance, without reading the reviews, and wow, do I regret it? Does not really have any plot, does not really follow the kind of vampire. Simply awful god. Watching this movie will taint your enthusiasm for vampire movies. I felt as if the writer / director / producer had been a victim of this drug, had hallucinations and tried to reproduce it on film. All the time I wanted the film to end .. but the end was even more striking. <br /> <br /> If this opinion prevents a person only to look at this shit, I feel that my time spent recording and writing this opinion was worth it.
