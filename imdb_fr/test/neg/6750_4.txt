It was obviously a low budget movie. This is seen in every scene. What is nice to see is where it was done. Much of the film was shot in Columbia, California, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Sonora, California. Part of the film was also shot in Jamestown, California, near Columbia. There is a railway museum in Jamestown and they used some of the old trains in the photo. "High Noon" was also shot in Jamestown, as well as "Back to the Future III".
