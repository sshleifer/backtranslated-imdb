I think most people would agree with me if I said that the movie Alien is sort of the bar of the atmosphere. I've seen quite a few movies matching this bar, but none have ever gone beyond Alien's strange tunnels and dark rooms. The Cave is a movie that tries to reset the bar. I think the trailer even mentioned the fact that she's as scary as Alien. Yet, not once in the film, I never felt scared, or even amazed. <br /> <br /> That's why now that we have the balloon I should also explain why the main hook of the cave (the atmosphere in case you're not paying attention) would collapse into a loss of time. I will say immediately that most of the sets were beautiful and beautifully lit, but what we hear and what we know there tends to ruin what we see. The music for one is terrible. We have either nerdy rock music or exaggerated haunted house music. Ok maybe it grows a little but I could not stand it. The many underwater scenes were already quite painful (it is a well known fact that underwater scenes are still as boring as ever). I did not need the rock music that resonated in my ears as they swam in a cave. In fact, it caused a lot of unintentional laughter, which was then amplified by the following scene of PWC accidents. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as I already mentioned, it's not just music that has killed the atmosphere, no, no. Creatures hiding in darkness are supposed to invoke horror. I'm supposed to worry about their appearance and a simple glimpse of them is supposed to make my temper cool. The cave wisely takes a page out of the alien manual by not showing the creature very long and leading to unveiling in the blink of an eye, but it just does not work because the creatures are so lame. I guess it would be rude to spoil the details, but they are essentially aliens with wings. <br /> <br /> I guess you understand the point now. Ambiance in ruins. Still, I know many people who will still see a movie if it's exciting. I would like to say that about the cave but I would lie. This film is slow to get to the action and once we get there, we sort of wonder when the thing is finally going to be called one day. We have seen all this happen better and better, with the exception of some amazing scenes (the guy impaled on stalactites, eels and rapids), so you do not feel any emotion watching people running away. extraterrestrial imitations without inspiration in endless tunnels. . <br /> <br /> Oh no, the pain does not stop there. We must also take into account the characters and act. Well, I do not remember a single line of dialogue other than "run!" and the only character name I remember is Jack, but it's only because he's placed in almost every other line near the end of the movie. Maybe the actors were capable, but the script did not allow them to do anything but run and argue. They had almost no substance and whenever someone died, they simply suppressed it. It is quite sad to see that the CGI eel makes the best performance of the film. <br /> <br /> About CGI; there are many, most of which are terrible. I congratulate them for using costumes (at least, I think, it was costumes), but nothing really sticks to the environment and, as a result, most effects end up looking pretty hokey. <br /> <br /> So, I guess I would wrap the cave is bad and has very little success. If the film had been a SciFi premiere or a low budget movie straight out of video, I might have liked it a bit more, but it was a theatrical release. With more wit and talent, it could have been a terribly funny movie, but in its current version, this movie is as scary as entering the basement and it's not very good. <br /> <br /> My comment of Frider Waves: http: //friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave
