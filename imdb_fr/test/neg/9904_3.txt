What is it!! it's so bad. The animation looks so awful that it looks like a ps1 game. The actors are awful, they simply can not act to save their lives. I sat through this whole movie and at the end I was pissed off when I realized that I had lost 3 hours of my life. I did not hear about this movie, did it ever go out to the movies or did it go straight to the DVD? A girl was shot ?! What's going on with that, it was just a stupid movie. They totally copied "The day after tomorrow". It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would certainly recommend people not to waste their time with this. You could spend your time watching "The Day After Tomorrow", it's much better. That's what I think of the movie. In fact, why did I waste my time writing about it, dam ah !! It really annoys me, it loses 3 hours and 10 minutes now.
