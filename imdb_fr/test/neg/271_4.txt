People who criticize this film look as cool and smooth as the first, which is not the case. This film was supposed to be the complete opposite of Ocean 11. This was said by many members of the cast and also by the director, Steven Soderbergh. Ocean's 12, although it lacks any striking plot, is criticized because it was different from what people wanted. If it were published before Ocean's 11, it would be taken very differently and not as a sequel. The problem with the suites is that people go with a predefined idea of ​​what this should be and have a lot of expectations. They should enter this film with an open mind and not expect it to be "Ocean's 11, again".
