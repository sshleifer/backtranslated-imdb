An important step backwards for the puppets during this trip, which is mainly dull and tedious. Guy Rolfe, as fantastic as Andre Toulon in the third part is hardly presented this time and the fantastic song of Richard Band appears with the puppets a few minutes of the film. For the beginning of the film, we meet the Bodega Bay Inn keeper (Gordon Currie) and some of his friends friends (a lot of the cast is Canadian and is very good in roles unfortunately quite simple - Teresa Hill is really delicious ). Totems, the henchmen of the Egyptian god Sutek want to find the secret of the life of the animation and the puppets (when they surface) act with a hitherto unknown skill to try to destroy the villainous and very computer Totems. Totems only complicate the series and divert attention from the elements that made it so unique before - they do not share the strange beauty of the puppets and therefore do not really fit. The top scene is Pinhead's one that uses a cleaning cloth to clean the blood Tunnelers drill bit, classic and on the most goriest this movie goes. The fifth film was shot at the same time as this one, so expect similar sections of mediocre and a performance of Toulon that seems to have been filmed in another era (or even in another galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserved better and fans of the series certainly have it. Grrrrrrr.
