I came across this film on the Internet and was horrified by its content of violent violence and scenes of torture. It was a relief to know that it was not real after reading the comments. what dangerously sick animals of a person make something like this and for what purpose go beyond belief. I was even more shocked to see people rate the movie in the comments section of this site. It's an extremely disturbing film that could change your life forever. the people who are responsible should be tried as soon as possible today, they showed a girl being raped and slaughtered on the screen tomorrow, it could be a child. even his fake or not his very mortally disturbing, nauseating indeed.
