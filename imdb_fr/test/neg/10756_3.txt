"Opposing Force [1986]" was not as good as "Dr. Strangelove" and it was not as good as "The Bridge on the Kwai River". Heck, it was not even as good as "GI Jane", which is pretty sad. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a fundamental ethical problem: in a simulated prisoner of war situation, until you go there before you start breaking the law? What is the law in such a situation? How can you simulate the torture of a person without torturing her? Can you intentionally inflict pain? How about breaking bones? Mock executions? Sexual abuse? Severe blood loss? Real bullet guns? Death? Somewhere between them is a very vague line separating "acceptable" from "atrocious". <br /> <br /> Now, what could you do if you ended up in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality begin to disappear? What can you do? This film tries to portray this dilemma. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in "resistance training". I have a brother who has followed the US Air Force Prisoner of War Training Program. According to him, technically, the result was quite close to the mark. <br /> <br /> The film has a pretty good premise, but its story is not particularly good. I was wondering if this could be based on a real event, but it became pretty obvious that it was not when the explosions started. They must have changed the writers to three quarters of the film, because it takes an extreme turn and turns into a rather useless shoot-up with many annoying explosions. <br /> <br /> I found that his end was rather unsatisfactory; again, a little useless. I still wonder what was the purpose of all this - I'm starting to think there was just not one. It could have been much better with just a little more history to accompany the fireworks.
