I saw this DVD for sale and I bought it without thinking, although I did not even know it was out, because it's one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I got home, I rushed to look at him, but found myself completely disappointed. While it is true that this film is a bit based on the book, the similarities stop there. The characters are changed (Finny seems to be more of a pompous fool than anything else, while Gene seems to be like a hill), scenes are misplaced or completely changed (ie, Lepper), many characters are missing and lines / famous thoughts are missing. The film tries to give the impression that the precedent was missing, but it is done in a dull manner, which makes it a flat and boring film. It is the depth of character and feeling that makes the book such a classic and this film takes these things and destroys them completely in its rewriting.
