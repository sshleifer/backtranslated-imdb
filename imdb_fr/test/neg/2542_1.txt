I just finished watching this movie, and for me .... it takes time, because it's so boring ... and the scenario is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> now ... where should I start ... O .... the movie is called "shipwreck of Japan" ... yeah yeah ... it shows that Japan is in run but the action part is very bad. Compare to the film "the day after tomorrow", I would have at least 8/10. <br /> <br /> The "shipwreck of Japan" does not show much of the disaster that is happening right in front of our eyes. there is not much excitement at all ... boring ... all I can say ... <br /> <br /> one last point ... I would recommend this movie to have a better title ... maybe something like "the romance of the shipwreck of Japan" because this film has a lot of talk (waste of time ... talk about nonsense) and that the love story is extremely boring and drags for too long ... honestly .. I almost finished frustrated. <br /> <br /> Overall ... this film does not show enough details about disasters, for example many people run like crazy to avoid death..The story of love was extremely insufficient for me. <br /> <br /> but hey ... there's one thing we should appreciate about this movie .... & it's got good songs!
