This film is slow. This film is cheap. This film gives Friday 13 the appearance of the nominee in the Best Film category. The acting game is shit. The special effects are shit. Nobody dies before 40 minutes and everyone is doing badly. The only thing that saves her is her ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity that's going on. The funny part is to watch the heroine "repel" the attacker. She had to be trained but she fights like a 70 year old teenager. They spend useless scenes on people who are not dying and not scenes of people dying to the point of not knowing why they are dying. I love slashers but it's just shit.
