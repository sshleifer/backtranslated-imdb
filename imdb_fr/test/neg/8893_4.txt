This film was almost a good movie. The direction must be a little softer to progress from one room to another to make it more plausible. In particular: The need of the main character to escape is not explicit enough. Is he trying to kill himself? Is he trying to escape? His life does not seem to be so bad, so it's harder to swallow that he wants so much to leave his life. In addition, it is not very clear how much he is "in love" with Jennifer Jason L. If the film had been reworked with more attention, it would have been great. By cons, for an independent film, it's pretty good! Maybe if you drink a few drinks, to calm the logical thought, it would be more fun ... <br /> <br />
