I went in this film with low expectations, knowing the legacy of Uwe Boll as a director and screenwriter, and I was always disappointed. Uwe Boll finds the way to make worse and worse each film in which he is involved. The overall concept was not bad, a man who misses his life as a broker becomes a serial killer. But the problem with the film is that there is no intermediary, it goes directly from the stockbroker to the serial killer. The film has nameless actors and I understand why, after watching the film, I do not see why an actor with a career would even want to be involved in this film. Anyone who refused it has done a service to his career. And if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and do not do it. <br /> <br /> I give Sanctimony a 3 out of 10
