Deriving from bootlegs, sometimes considered an urban legend of comics, the first FF movie is about as bad as everyone fears it. I guess Marvel Comics now claims it does not exist, as evidenced by the release of the 2005 version in theaters earlier this year. But it's there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad adaptations of low-budget Marvel superheroes (Captain America, Punisher, most TV movies). "Small budget" is a description too easy for this photo FF. Due to lack of funds, showing the powers of the super quartet was limited to very fast fire (Mr.Fantastic), near-animation (Torch) and fainting (Invisible Girl - the easiest to do). The costume was not bad and probably half the budget; the part of the face was mostly almost convincing. The game? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is very good; the other 3 are fine, but Jay and Johnny sometimes act like spaz to show his "fiery" mood. The dialogue is comic style, and it is the actors who eventually collapse trying to make it work. Dr.Doom is much more melodramatic than comic, and his two main henchmen are a case study of how not to play or write dialogue. <br /> <br /> The plot? Not too good. He was quite loyal to the original story of the FF (more than the latest big-budget version), and even though the non-budget, again, restricted by showing, for example, the actual forced landing, he has kept the essential ingredients of the they discovered their powers in an isolated area - this is the most interesting part of the photo, even if you have to wait half an hour to have it. I also found strange music in places; when the four are bathed in these cosmic rays, we hear a kind of church choir, as if it were a religious experience. The rest, however, is hopeless. Even without a budget, the story could have been without the jeweler's character (resembling the nasty Mole Man of books); he spends much too much time with him and his underground gang, as well as with the blind Alicia. These sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring. The fight with Doom & his men begins well, but degenerates into a terrible mess when the flame runs a laser beam (nice animation but belonging to a cartoon). Fans can make fun of the bad FF FX scenario and a fearless scenario, if they are not depressed and indignant beforehand.
