In my opinion, Quentin has written and directed only one good film: Pulp Fiction, several times awarded. However, most movies, especially recent movies, are real turkeys. People are still rating it today, and I really do not see why. There are many other directors and writers who produce much better entertainment in every aspect of their films. From that moment, I will not believe the hype that is a Tarantino movie. <br /> <br /> Inglorious was too long and worse, you felt it. The humor was minimal and not so humorous. The violence was not new (without the end scene) The dialogue was sometimes very VERY long. <br /> <br /> Some will love this movie; and for others, they will hate him. <br /> <br /> ... and I thought that the subject of the Nazis had finally been put to bed with the impressive 2004 German film, Untergang.
