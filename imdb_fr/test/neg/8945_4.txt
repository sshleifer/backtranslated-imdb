A few years ago, this film was scheduled to air on TCM UK as part of a Tod Browning retrospective ?? but what they really showed was the 1937 remake! my brother had looked at him (and, with hindsight, he followed almost the original, scene by scene, even in the sets) ?? Although no classic, he said it was a much more satisfying visual experience than the incredibly squeaky previous version ?? <br /> <br /> This being the first collaboration between Browning and Bela Lugosi, I had high hopes for her ?? but these were canceled when it became obvious, after the start of a tedious conversation, that the main concern of the film was to appease the ever new sound technique and that, as a result, the result is scenic and extremely static . The thriller scenario is not really exciting either; The ostensibly Indo-British framework (with the affected accents and the behavior of the upper class), not to mention the excessive use of idiosyncratic idiots such as "I say", "rather" and "now, look here" ?? making the whole thing laughable more than anything else)! <br /> <br /> Apart from that, there are some unexpected howlers: Margaret Wycherly (as a false medium) implores police inspector Lugosi (her undeniable presence on the screen is already obvious) for him leave a little time "working" who is the culprit of the double murder (the evidence shows his own daughter, played by Leila Hyams!) ?? she hears a tapping and is convinced that the spirit world has really made contact with her, but then Lugosi enters the room and, in her undeniable accent, says to her bluntly: "I hit twice? Hear me! ", to which my brother and I almost fell to the ground in convulsions of laughter !! the editing is also very sloppy: when shooting a dive of the main set, we see a microphone quickly out of the scope of the camera ?? and even worse are a few cases where one person comes out of the screen, apparently in the next plane, into another part of the game - but each shot is kept on the other actors for an absurdly long time, so it seems to take an eternity for this person to walk a few steps! <br /> <br /> THE THIRTEENTH PRESIDENT marks the third non-horror walkie-talkie I've seen ?? Although this and MIRACLES FOR SALE (1939) both deal with murder and occultism, they could still be gender-related. Much has been said about the apparent slowdown of the director with the arrival of Sound: however, even if they have flaws, the four horror films he made throughout the 30s are infinitely better than the others ?? that I always found pretty stylish and weird enough to suggest that Browning was not as seaworthy during this period as suggested?
