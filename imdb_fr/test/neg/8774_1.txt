I waited long enough to watch this Lone Ranger movie. I was finally able to see him on the Lone Star channel today and I was very disappointed with the movie. Clayton Moore and John Hart have done better than Tonto, Lone Rangers and Jay Silverheels, rather than the two stars of this movie. The very bad quality of actor was made by everyone in this film. Even the plot was bad and fetch far. I believe that the horse, portraying Silver, was the best actor of this film. I'm glad I did not go out and buy a copy of this movie on its first release because I feel it's a waste of good money. I'm really sorry that the characters that Clayton Moore, John Hart and Jay Silverheels have interpreted and put on the big screen have been so tarnished. Unless, in the future, they find actors worthy of representing the characters in the same way as Clayton, John and Jay have done so well in the past, I will not spend the money to buy the movie. I will not watch this movie anymore. <br /> <br /> Wayne Davies
