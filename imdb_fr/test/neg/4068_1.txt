I can not believe anyone really paid to make this movie. Stupid, unrealistic and stereotyped. As soon as the huge 747 took off, the pilot pulled the gears back to increase speed. Then you have 5 armed people with semi-fully automatic weapons that fire without a single bullet breaking the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38,000 feet. Then once down in the belly of the plane, a stray bullet hits a fuel line and we see the fuel flowing to the side of the plane. The acting was just horrible and forced. There seemed to be no direction. I saw some horrific B movies in my lifetime, but with the names on it, I was extremely disappointed.
