I hate to admit it, but they were right to dismiss Schrader. The opportunity is there to create an atmosphere, attract an audience in a film. It was not done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. The staging was very poor. Schrader was out of his depth and it shows. I have watched it many times now in the hope that there will be at least one usable feature. But no, nothing. The next step will probably be to redo the original or, hopefully, to stay well alone. Anyone who wants to know which is the best suite of The Exorcist should read "Legion", written by Blatty, which must be the best follow-up of an original work to print. Unfortunately, that did not translate very well on screen and I doubt that it is possible. As for Dominion, Beginner. Avoid at all costs.
