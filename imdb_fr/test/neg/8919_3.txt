Today, You Die begins as the honorable criminal Harlan Banks (producer Steven Seagal) is hired by the sinister businessman Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe) to drive a $ 20 million cash-in-security 'A' point back from a Las Vegas casino to point 'B him, looks simple no? Well, what Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money had been stolen from him and that he had just become the driver of the escape during an armed robbery. Bummer. The situation gets worse for Harlan when the local cops capture him and throw him into jail for a long time. However, Harlan manages to hide the money before getting caught and with a nice $ 20,000,000 in play. Harlan must report back. the crooks want it the way the government agents do. Harlan teams up with Ice Kool (!) (Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in prison and they both manage to escape. Harlan then seeks revenge ... <br /> <br /> Photographed and directed by Don E FauntLeRoy, it is clear that the shooting of action films in Eastern Europe, in which Steven Seagal is specialized, is no better, and Today You Die is a good example. It's a terrible movie, as simple as that. The screenplay of producer Danny Lerner, Kevin Moore and The Weldon gives Seagal a new type of character that will allow him to become an actor. He is not a military clich√©, he is usually a government agent, a policeman, a soldier or an army. In fact, if you were a charity, you can say that Today You Die is a scam of Mel Gibson's excellent thriller Payback (1998), in which he also played a really nasty job with such an effect. While Payback was a superb black film action thriller, uncompromising, Today You Die is not insignificant by comparison. Unfortunately, here Seagal is terrible, it has no presence on the screen or threatened and the public is never really sure whether it is supposed to be a villain we hate or not. For example, in the beginning, his character is built like a modern Robin Hood, while he steals rich drug dealers and fools to give to the poor (while keeping a net profit for himself), which is ridiculous in itself, but then Seagal turns around and kills a lot of people, which is in contradiction with the amiable criminal morals that the film has gone to great lengths to put in place. The story is full of holes, for example, the agent Knowles is contacted by Harlan on the run and is then reprimanded by his superior curved to have met. It turns out he discovered it by tapping his phone. In this case, why did not his boss use the information he had to catch Harlan? The story is that of the usual boring and boring battle over a lot of money with surprise. The government agent in charge of the investigation is actually a bad guy! Wow, I did not see it coming, I must admit ... <br /> <br /> The director FauntLeRoy slows the pace of the snails and Today You Die has the impression that it lasts forever, the scenes action and scenery are also seriously lacking in entertainment value. The infrequent combat scenes are not great, most are shot in the shadows, very quickly cut and edited, or with the camera behind the Seagal character trying to hide the fact that most of the stunts performed here are a double. Again, Seagal looks big and distorted and uses long, loose overcoats to try to hide it. At first, there's a rather cool car chase in the streets of Las Vegas and I thought Today You Die was going to be fine, but it seems like the entire footage was stolen in another action movie titled Top of the World (1997), which discusses A Steal at a Las Vegas Casino, as well as images from this movie Today You Die, also features scenes from the Charlie Code action movie, No Code of Conduct (1998), Action movie by Jean-Claude Van Damme The Order (2001) & the Wesley The action movie Undisputed (2002), based on the prison Snipes, leaves no doubt about the original content of Today You Die. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is correct, considering that it was ridden together from four separate films. own sequences, he's just pretty competent and consistent. All the images of the American places are obviously extracted from the films already mentioned with all the original images shot at a discount in Bulgaria. The rap music that makes up Today You Die is frightful. The acting is mediocre and Seagal just sweeps his lines as usual. <br /> <br /> Today You Die is a very bad movie made up of other bad action movies, Seagal looks old and fat, action scenes are at best, most of the story is pretty random and it does not combine at the end at all. To avoid unless you are a fan of Seagal, if such an animal exists even ...
