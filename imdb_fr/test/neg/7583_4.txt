Roger Spottiswoode is not the worst director and he did a good job on the underrated sci-fi thriller "The Sixth Day" (see "Mr. Schwarzenegger's Fall at the Box Office"). However, "Air America" ​​must be one of his most inept projects. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a fusion of drama, comedy and war movie - it's not a very convincing mix. In fact, I found him domineering. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, Jr. (at his peak) plays the role of a pilot recruited from a secret CIA organization operating in Laos during the Vietnam era. Mel Gibson plays his co-pilot and discovers it is a drug trade. <br /> <br /> The release of the film was controversial as it featured two famous characters and Aerosmith re-recorded the Doors classic "Love Me Two Times" for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The repetition of the song is rather bad, which suits the film.
