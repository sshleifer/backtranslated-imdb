An atrocious violation of Welles' memory and genius, this senseless assemblage of complacent improvisation on a great theme should have been locked up with a number of other unfinished projects of Welles that no one has ever seen. Now we know why! To add an additional insult to an earlier injury, the appalling English dubbing by American amateur actors and even the great man himself only reinforces all the neglected errors in storytelling and construction. It's as if every weekend, a good-hearted Spanish soul gave Orson a few pesos, a 35mm camera and some negative film shorts left by another production, and asked Welles to go to the countryside. Spanish while continuing to shoot. until the film stock is exhausted. It is true that if Orson had really shaped this film himself instead of the famous Jesus Franco, he might have thrown 85% of what he shot, but we'll never know. Since Welles never took the time to change his own work here, and somewhere along the way, he or his heirs sanctioned someone else, he is not entirely faultless for the debacle. Those wishing to prove that Welles was the youngest young man in his early days because he surrounded himself with John Houseman, Herman Mankewiecz, Greg Toland, Bernard Hermann and Robert Wise do not need to a better proof of his adult inadequacies than this mess. of a film. In his sad old age, Welles was able to do anything when he needed a few dollars or pesos, including selling his soul as an artist. The devil certainly had his due with this one!
