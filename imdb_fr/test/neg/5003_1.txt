This movie was terrible. It was really terrible. <br /> <br /> The trial was very annoying. Defense counsel is permitted to continue to speak when questioning a witness without the prosecution objecting. He attacks the children brought to testify with a cruel ferocity and shouts to them several times that they lie. These are just not things they submit to children who have been sexually abused. The lawsuit is silly and ruins the whole movie ... (Law & Order spoiled me for the precision of the courtrooms).
