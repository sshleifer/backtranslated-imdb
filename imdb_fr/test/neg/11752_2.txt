I know that the original Psycho was a classic and that remaking it was a mistake, especially a piecemeal remake. I think it has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But there are many more problems with this movie than that. <br /> <br /> The first problem is color. The original film was shot in black and white but, what few people realize, the original film was shot AFTER being invented. The choice of black and white film was partly a budget affair, but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcock. This does not mean that the remake should have been redone in black and white, but the colors of this film are completely false. The most predominant colors in the film are orange and green, especially for Marion who is not supposed to be a brilliant character. Bright colors give the impression of a happy movie, and when horrible events unfold in these color schemes, it looks more like a cartoon than ever and the audience is prone to laugh instead of screaming. <br /> <br /> The second problem is lighting. It's a dark, dark story that should be underlined by subdued lighting, but this remake seemed not only to fail on it, but seemed to go in the opposite direction. Most of the scenes are very bright, even when it's illogical to do it because it's NIGHT! <br /> <br /> Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughn's performance. Yes, he does very well Norman Bate's clumsiness and madness, I do not deny him. But he failed to show one element of the character: gentleness. There should be some misleading usability towards the character, at least initially, which then disappears when we realize the truth about him. In addition to being a character trait of Norman Bates, it is a trait of character recognized by ALL PSYCHOPATHES !!!! <br /> <br /> This film presents some interesting aspects. Some of the performances are great. As I said, Vince Vaughn was about to perform a decent performance of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from that of the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been excruciating, but unlike Janet Leigh, who was falsely announced as one of the biggest stars in the film, Anne Heche was last entered in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> I read on the cover of a copy of the novel Psycho Gus Van Sant claimed that it was not a remake of the film Hitchcock, but rather a new adaptation of the novel original. I would now like to have bought this book and recorded the comment because after seeing this movie, this comment is probably the funniest thing I have ever seen. Nothing in this movie tried to hide the fact that it was a scam of the original, and it would be much more credible if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was really a monkey of three tons of the planet Zafroomulax. So many plans were copied exactly without any idea why Hitchcock had composed the original plan in this way. Like the scene in which Sam and Lila argue that their faces are completely covered in shadows. Hitchcock covered the faces of these actors in the shadows because he considered them as bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so that no one could see their executions horrible, and not for artistic or stylistic purposes. <br /> <br /> In other words, my comment is about as useless as the film itself in that it reproduces something that has already been said. Like everyone here, I recommend you do not waste your time on this movie and get the original.
