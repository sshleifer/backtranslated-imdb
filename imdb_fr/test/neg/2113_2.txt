If I were British, I would be embarrassed by this portrait of incompetence. A Special Branch Protection Officer unable to defend himself against a sick, unarmed and untrained assailant? The Home Office sends a single "scientific advisor" to investigate a potential biological risk of level four, and this "advisor" does not make sense to wear even a mask and gloves? Totally unprotected London police officers working side by side with technicians in protective gear against biological hazards? The "counselor" and his bodyguard under the den of a sociopathic doctor experimenting on human subjects without any reservation? Puh-leeze! It is questionable whether producers would not have the means to call on technical advisors or if, for some obscure reason, they deliberately decided to portray directors as hopelessly incompetent. Even my wife, who has no experience in medicine or law enforcement, rolled her eyes in disbelief. After the first episode, I was discouraged; now that I have seen two episodes, I give up.
