Contrary to what a reviewer has said, this is not a Magnum Force scam. Lieutenant Hal Holbrook created his own squad of Academy recruits to send repeat offenders. In Extreme Justice, this operation is sanctioned by senior Los Angeles police. One may wonder to what extent they sanction the exact methods used. <br /> <br /> This team of special investigators seems to be a refuge for the unsuitable LAPD, those who have forgotten their first duty, which is protection and service. That's why Glenn thinks that Lou Diamond Phillips, a detective who has more than his share of internal affairs responsibilities for excessive use of force, is perfect for the team. <br /> <br /> What should have sent him away from Phillips It's the fact that he has a good life relationship with a journalist, Chelsea Field. This one certainly launched me in this film, one would think that Lou would be the last man whom he would have tried to recruit for his team. <br /> <br /> And what his team is, it's a squadron of death. They target the perpetrators, follow them and wait to catch them in the act. Then it's open season. <br /> <br /> Extreme Justice has been very disappointing in trying to assert its point of view. It certainly would not hurt to wait for a gang of bank robbers to complete the robbery and take them outside. No civilians were injured when the citizens of Coffeyville did it to the Dalton. Or wait until three rapists have finished work before moving in. This is what has been asked to believe here. <br /> <br /> And frankly, I could not buy it. Many good players are really lost in this one.
