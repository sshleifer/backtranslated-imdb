This was done in 1993. Run freely by Robert Iscove and vaguely written by John Miglis, it's supposed to be based on a true story. Hard to believe that anyone can be so stupid and blind to the truth. It was obvious from the beginning that this lady was after all she could have. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson, looking a little older than his memory, played the empty-headed character looking for something romantic in his dull, empty life. Tracy Pollan, a girl a bit empty, having a perverted sex as a way to defeat her guys. <br /> <br /> Come on, by phone, even in the 90s, it was old hat. . I can not believe anyone would fall for this old line. But Mr. Matheson seemed to buy it. And it cost him a lot. <br /> <br /> The most difficult scene to face was the one where he finally threw the lady out of his apartment, putting all his crap in the hallway (in front of his apartment) and then had the stupidity of do not change the locks. That's when I got tired of this banal movie. It made me want to wish the lady tried it so that I could have the satisfaction of telling her to hike. <br /> <br /> I give this brown a 1 out of 100. That's how much I thought it was. I guess you can not blame the actors. But they were awful. Have they really tried to play this with an impassive face?
