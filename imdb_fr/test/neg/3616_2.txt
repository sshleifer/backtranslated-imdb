I really do not think it's necessary for me to write a review on such a derisory movie as "Snake Island," but even in the abstract confines of its own genre, it's gone to a new low, my anger must be known. . The only reason I even bothered to watch this incredibly bad movie was because I knew it was going to be bad, it was really late at night, I could not sleep, and in the past, really bad movies drained me energy and made me sleep a long time. Very quickly, very quickly, this film would become terrible, but it deigned to remain below these expectations. <br /> <br /> The film was directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who also stars in the film. tour guide on the African River, who must ultimately fail his team on a remote island called Snake Island until another boat comes looking for them. They drag, get drunk and then become subject to the onslaught of venomous snakes who are on a mission to purge their island of human beings. <br /> <br /> If your jaw dropped in the last sentence of my second paragraph, do not bother to reread it, you understood the first time. Frankly, I prefer my creature traits when the creature (s) just attack humans with no sense and stupid hunger, not because they have some kind of mission. These are not mutant snakes. They are not giants like what you see in "Anaconda". They are just ordinary African serpents like mambas and vipers, except that they have the brains to form armies, defend causes, work together to trap people, understand our language and even dance! Has your draw dropped again? Well, it will go down further. In the midst of this horrible B-movie, about the part I had already abandoned, the human characters start drinking around a campfire and suddenly they split up into a kind of orgy. And while they dance naked and others, the snakes chase them all of a sudden and stop over. The combination of this scene and the scene where we discover that snakes, among the most mischievous creatures on the planet, have formed an alliance against humans for some reason, has served my poor brains too well. And just when I thought filmmakers could not go lower, the snakes began to sing. <br /> <br /> The characters of the film? Well, let's just say that never before have I wanted creatures to kill everyone so quickly. I just could not stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> I really do not think I need to continue; you get the picture. If there is anything that sets Snake Island apart from its rivals, it is because it dares to try to be even more stupid and it is not an exploit. Why I continue to submit to these very bad movies, I guess I'll never really know. But "Snake Island" hits a new record. This is an inexpensive and trashy excuse for a film that makes "Anaconda", a brain-less snake movie, as brilliant, sophisticated and thrilling as Steven Spielberg's "Jaws". You were warned.
