Once a month, I invite some friends for a "late movie night". We look forward to movies that are so bad they are funny or those who know they do not have a plot and they show a lot of chests. Last night, we had the misfortune to have Zombie Planet as one of our movies. Cinematography lives up to what we are used to, but the acting was a different story. The main role is played by Johnny Depp / Rob Zombie who could not play a role in a high school play, let alone a horror film LOW-BUDGET. Our indecisive hero, who did not know if he wanted to be a rascal or not, this scene or a cowardly coward, was one of the reasons why this was the first of 30 movies I ever had to stop earlier at a film Retarded Movie Night. He had the opportunity to outdo himself with the standard zombie infection, but they took it in a totally different direction, based on Johnny Zombie. Personally, I would not recommend this to any of my friends. However, it is unfortunate that I have already invited a few last night to undergo 80% of this film with me.
