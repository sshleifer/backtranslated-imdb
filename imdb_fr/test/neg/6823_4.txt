It's a great family initiative that will surely please most kids, but it really does not please adults watching the movie. The film assumes that the Belushi policeman retires but is drawn into a case that leads him to become a private investigator. The plot of the movie is so obvious that most kids will surely choose the end before it happens. But on top of that, there seem to be arcs of history and secondary intrigues that are forgotten as the movie progresses. This coupled with a sub-plot where the K-9 holder is furrowed by Belushi. One to avoid I'm scared.
