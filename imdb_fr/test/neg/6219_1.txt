This film is pathetic not because it is poorly realized, interpreted, sung, danced, filmed, etc., but because it is very difficult to ruin a film using a soundtrack ABBA - but unfortunately, it is the only thing that the film succeeds. The musical presentations of the film SouthPark were much better than those of Mama Mia. The director of Mama Mia is proof that you do not need talent to become a director - you only need ABBA songs. <br /> <br /> Just to give an example of the atrocity: Meryl Streep ages close-ups in the harsh sunlight singing and ruining the song with all the annoying wrinkles on her face. Why do this to one of the most talented actresses?
