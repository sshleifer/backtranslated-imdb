This story of Ted Brice, an American pilot who is the sole survivor of an Allied reconnaissance aircraft accident in Belgium in January 1944, is a complete mess. The title would make you think it's mostly a story about Belgian armed resistance groups, but that only seems to be a background to support a silly love affair between Ted and Claire, the woman who takes Ted. Claire's husband, Henri is a committed member of the resistance, but it is Claire who decides, in the absence of Henry and against his will, to give refuge to Ted. <br /> <br /> The details of a crucial plot do not make sense. The recovery of the recorder in the failed plane that contains navigation codes and target positions is at the heart of the story. But in the opening scene, we see Belgians looting the plane, including members of the resistance. Why did not they retrieve the valuables at that time instead of waiting for the Nazis to monitor the plane? And the whole case of Ted's transfer out of the zone was conducted using secret instructions and coded words, while the transaction could have been a simple exchange. Heavy music tries, but fails, to give weight to this lukewarm business. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous part of the movie is how the love affair develops between Ted and Claire. At first, Claire is dedicated to bringing Ted back to the point of dying, and when Ted begins to recover, they become physically involved (while Henry is well placed to carry out resistance). Julie Ormond does a fair job as Claire, but she produces a French accent that I often found impossible to understand. His reactions sometimes seemed a little weak. When she was informed of the deaths of several members of the city, she reacted as if she had just been told that the local grocery store was running out of peaches. As Ted, Bill Paxton seems to just recite his lines; his performance is so uninspired that it's embarrassing. A true American pilot could demonstrate such a flat personality, but that does not convince the cinema. I did not feel any chemistry between these supposed lovers. <br /> <br /> The most silly thing is the way Ted and Claire behave like lovers on vacation. It may be understandable to sexually release such situations, but it is difficult to appear totally unaware of the seriousness of the situation. At first, Ted is sent to an attic and Claire is worried about her arrival in the house. But as things change, he does not just go home, he dances with Claire on loud music, enters the adjacent barn to play baseball with a boy from the area and finally leaves for an excursion drive with Claire to a nearby town. The young boy seems to be very attached to his role, but he is undermined by the screenplay. He has an incredible ability to attend crucial events without being noticed. And when he utters phrases like this: <br /> <br /> "Have you ever seen someone being hanged, it looks like he's dancing, but he can not find the floor." <br /> <br /> you have the impression that it is the scriptwriter who speaks and not a boy of thirteen. <br /> <br /> And, by the way, some scenes show that the Nazis are pretty bad guys. <br /> <br /> By comparing this film to the brilliant "Ashes and Diamonds" on the Polish resistance, or the very stellar "Lacombe, Lucien" on the French resistance, one realizes how much it is about a really lamentable affair.
