Some movies are offbeat but enjoyable, but many movies are just strangely strange. "Motorama" does not fit very well in this last category. Many seem to like this because of endless appearances and a total lack of meaning, but these two things can only make one movie so far, and "Motorama" simply does not have any other merit to his credit. <br /> <"Motorama" enjoys the improbabilities of the plot. His main character, Gus, is 10 years old and participates in a turn through an imaginary country. He is trying to collect game pieces to win $ 500 million. When they interact with adult characters, none of them seem to notice or worry about being 10 years old. At first, it's incredibly funny, but it's getting too incredible, especially if you think about the people he meets and the fact that he seems so insensitive to the many disturbing images (for someone of this age) who surround him. Gus has no depth and, as an anti-hero who does not have a hard time causing others to misery to get his pieces back from the game, it's hard to complain about him when he encounters problems. <br /> <br /> by numerous appearances, each one abusing Gus in a more and more strange way. In addition to making the already exhausted plot even more incredible and less enjoyable, the characters share Gus's lack of depth and are also immutable. The actions of the character can be a little interesting, but the actors themselves do not add anything, denying all the interest of getting big names (they could have been played by anyone and the character would have been the same). "Motorama" should be interesting. It's a unique idea, but the scenario is meaningless for it to work. . Incidents that should have a lasting effect on the anti-hero and the viewer do not, because the film passes quickly from one incident to another, hoping that something will eventually make the audience sorry or Comprehensive for Gus. This never happens because nothing is allowed to connect, it just shakes like on a treadmill, incident after incident. With a story so absurd that it ceases to be nice, and a main character who never moves to care for himself or anyone else at a higher level, "Motorama" has no more to offer than a kid sneaking and trying to get rich. Why should we care?
