Yeeee-Haa! <br /> <br /> I've seen him argue that most American movies are cowboy movies in disguise; Hollywood is so in love with his original creation that he constantly reinvents the cowboy myth. I'm not sure I fully accept this argument, but Slipstream is proof of the theory; it's a cowboy movie with planes. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's better than that. It's a spaghetti western with planes! Replace the planes with horses, make the android a priest and this film would be indistinguishable from one of the twelve "half-art shoot-em-ups" with pretensions of the Italians. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as bad as some of the reviews I read here had led me to believe, but it was certainly not good.
