What is night vision? Well, according to the star (Williamson), let's see ... a package store owner tells him "it's getting dark outside," to which he responds "it makes for better ..." night vision. "What does that mean?" In fact, what is this film trying to say? There are holes in the plot that you could drive through the killer van. a policeman on duty, Robert Forster wakes up at this bizarre attempt to take advantage of the craze for serial killers and a murderer who is filming his murders - that's all I can remember. <br /> <br /> The film took place in Texas with some car chases and a clich√© ending, maybe if you look at this film with your eyes closed - it could be nice, after all, without being able to see it .. it would make a better night vision, did it make sense, no, and that movie either.
