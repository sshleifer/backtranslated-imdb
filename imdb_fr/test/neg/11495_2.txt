I just watched Icon on DVD and although it's a good book, the film is a fragile substrate. Those responsible for writing should be banished to Siberia. Why they maul the beautiful story with all kinds of C-film sub-works that are totally unrelated to the story totally exceeds me. <br /> <br /> However, filmmakers and actors do their best to get something out of it, but in the end, the film was not at all satisfying. <br /> <br /> Can anyone please make a decent film to show how it is done. I'm sure crowds will come together for a novel of this kind, turned into a book, not a cheap C movie.
