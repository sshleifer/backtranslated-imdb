This is the worst movie I have ever seen. At first, I thought it was going to be good because I was interested in the Bermuda Triangle, but on the contrary, it was terrible. All that was producing was a series of lame explanations that made no sense (if the weather changes differently, why did not the woman get older and her son ages quickly) and she has a sinister and horrible end. The next time the guys who did that will go to Bermuda, they should take all the copies of that movie with them. Please, everyone votes for this film so that it can be on the list of the worst films.
