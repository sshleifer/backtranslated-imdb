Having some free time before going to work, I looked at my DVD collection "50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics" and chose the darkest title of the pack: Zis Boom Bah featuring a forgotten Grace Hayes. "Classics" is obviously the key word here since most titles I have never heard of and I suspect they are all public domain. Anyway, this movie also features his son Peter Lind and his wife Mary Healy (whom I just discovered, originally from New Orleans, originally from the state in which I live, in Louisiana), with Benny Rubin as a malt owner and Huntz Hall, taking a break from the East Side Kids, as Peter's boyfriend. The plot, about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her carefree rich son into a responsible son, unaware of who she is, is for the birds and does not have a lot of fun scenes although I liked the imitations of the Peter's celebrity and his dance with Hall in trail. And the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves. Rubin, however, is everywhere with his confusion of the American vernacular of the time and almost everything about him makes no sense (although I liked his fun dance). Given that it was only 61 minutes and I'm sure I played on the lower half of the dual function bill, I will be charitable and I will give a 3 for this one for some fun snippets that I said appreciate.
