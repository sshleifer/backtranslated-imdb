Savage Steve Holland wrote and directed his second film, One Crazy Summer, with John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong again in a supporting role. Cusack and Bobcat Goldthwait have just arrived in Cape Cod so they can stay at Goldthwait's grandmother's house for the summer. Along the way, they believe that Demi Moore is being sued by John Matuszak and a biker gang. Soon, they are all three united to try to save a house of transformation in another lobster restaurant by a complicated and spoiled family who considers the word "work" as a dirty word. The film contains several fun vignettes such as the Millionaire Dollar Contest gags and the Godzilla skit. <br /> <br /> Like the first Dutch film, Better Off Dead, John Cusack adds a lot to the film. Otherwise, it's a film of a movie filled with artificial situations and idiotic characters (as opposed to quirky). Moore even sings some bars in a nightclub with horrible synthesizers. Goldthwait gags wear out after a while, and Armstrong has never been an actor of any caliber that he has appeared in stuff other than Grade Z. The twins of the wrecker are extremely boring and odious instead of the endearing neglect they are obviously supposed to be. This is a comedy in a kitchen sink that could have used a better script and better direction. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
