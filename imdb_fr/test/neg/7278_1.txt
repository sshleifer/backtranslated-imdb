Slogan: The lucky ones are dead ... before looking at this. <br /> <br /> I've never watched a 1920s Bulgarian movie. So I can not say it's the worst film ever, but it's probably the worst film I've ever seen. I hardly remember it. <br /> <br /> All I remember is a family of stupid people who do not do anything right. Their car has one in four wheels stuck in the sand, so they decide to do nothing and prepare to live the rest of their lives. Then there is an old man who is aware of the existence of a cannibal band, but who has never considered reporting it to the police. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the police ... If these monsters ate humans for years, many people had to disappear ... How is it that the sheriff has not suspected anything? ? <br /> <br /> But I stopped asking questions after the first five minutes. or else The rest is boring. A hallucinated boredom. <br /> <br /> I will be merciful and will not talk about dialogues. And the acting game. And the effects. <br /> <br /> I will mention only the final scene, where the abnormal girl eliminates a snake (snakes! They go out at the end, what do they have to do with the story?) with a precise stone throwing, illustrating Mr. Craven's complete disregard for reality and all that happens on planet Earth in general. <br /> <br /> I think that riots took place at the time of filming. published for the first time in 1977. <br /> <br /> Even being eaten by a cannibal would not be a fair punishment for the director of this attack on the intelligence services.
