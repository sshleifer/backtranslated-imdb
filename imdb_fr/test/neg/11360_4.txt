... The values ​​of the sports production of "Flight of the Living Dead" that belie the unsatisfactory scenario of the director Scott "I am a producer, I can not say?" Thomas and two hacks who will remain nameless because I'm sorry for them to have to tie these non-names to this turkey. Apparently shot in a movie, this direct DVD release has almost nothing you've seen and heard a hundred times before. <br /> <br /> Despite the presence of several actors of recognizable characters like Richard "Three O'Clock High" Tyson, Erick "Stargate" Avari and Raymond J. "Little Children" Barry and many others even less recognizable "FoLD" is mainly populated with cardboard, most of which end up soaked with unconvincing fake blood. There are some (precious) gags that work (the umbrella and the zombie stuck in his seat come to mind), but most of the scripts are stupid, comics, and I'm here to make sure we speak pedestrian and stupid. You will never believe for a second that "FoLD" is anything but a cheap movie with cool pretensions. God forbid, never generates the result of his idiotic end promises. <br /> <br /> Visions strictly free, according to the impecunie of your local library, and suitable for the insomniacs and the blind.
