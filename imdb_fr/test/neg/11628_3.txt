The direct thriller of Jack Higgins on an IRA bomber vanquished by guilt and forced to occupy "a last job" (where did I hear about this plot?) Suffers brutal treatment from the director of the sect , Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with alarming red hair, confesses everything to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all people) who witnessed the shooting. The rules of the church prevent Father Bob from speaking, but Rourke falls in love with the blind niece of the priest. They bind to the organ of the church. What? Really, it's the plot. Alan Bates is the great gangster of dogs who calls (literally), and he seems to be the only actor to follow the jokey tone that Hodges is aiming for. Bates is ready to make a kind of HONOR OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, but no one else, including Liam Neeson, charismatic effortlessly, in a supportive role, has been informed.
