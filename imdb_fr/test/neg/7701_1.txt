You want a good recipe for failure? Take a shabby, leftist political plot, add weak characters and completely unexploited, then get into the worst footage a movie has ever seen. Simmer for a week (the time probably devoted to the manufacture of this trash). <br /> <br /> The result is "Steal This Movie", a cinematic experience that drives bad movies to dangerous and exotic locations never before conceived. . <br /> <br /> This film completely blew pieces in my face for the duration of its execution. Words can not say how painful it was to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can enjoy. This is not "Plan 9 of Outer Space". It is a long time loss, boring and sad. "Stealing this movie" is the biggest waste of energy and talent I have ever seen. It depresses me to realize that people * have * really taken time out of their lives to play in this guts, if you can call it "acting". But again, when you have bad direction, bad writing, a mediocre ALL - "playing" is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This film is like a huge shit to enjoy that you aspire to quickly flush out of existence, fearing that a friend or loved one might see it somehow. I really wish I could somehow destroy every copy of this film so as not to pollute the minds of budding filmmakers. Thank you, Robert Greenwald, for giving me a new respect for all the other films I've seen. You have shown me what is really horrible and why I should enjoy all those movies that are simply nil and / or boring.
