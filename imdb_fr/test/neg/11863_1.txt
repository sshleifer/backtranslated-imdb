I like black humor and things that are not on PC, but not if it's aimless but to elevate you. To taunt a group of people without any irony is shit. <br /> <br /> There are people who could make jokes about the concentration camp, but the one who made this film unfortunately failed even in the VERY easy task of making fun of the Turks in Germany. This is a very easy task, but if you are the German equivalent of a consanguineous redneck (= a southern conspirator from a village where virginity is often lost to livestock), you will certainly fail here and also in life. I have heard and seen so many fun things about minorities in Germany, but this "film" (this piece of shit listed here is an insult to the next worst film) is like the calf that the film's directors met there a few years ago.
