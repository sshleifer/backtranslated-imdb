Honestly, this film is weak. Very weak. Only the capital character can do anything. She works like a compressor with a bad engine ... so if you like red-haired Valkyries, see. But better to find a picture of Brigitte under the name of Sonja and put it on the desk. This will avoid disappointments. Well, Arnold is also his business ... but it's certainly not his best role. Other characters - bad is not that word. Sword fighting? Monsters? Ridiculous. The plot is really a shame. Why was it necessary to rape? Above all, we do not see it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is weak. Although worse movies exist ... Without major characters, it would be fair ******. And if someone talks about it, maybe ...
