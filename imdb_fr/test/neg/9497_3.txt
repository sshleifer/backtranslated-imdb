I love the distinctive and literary narration of Ustinov. And the photography is calm nice. We filmed the movie for our 3 1/2 year old who wandered around the room. So, during our first viewing, we only saw about a third of the film and were charmed. When we looked back, sitting during the family time, we were all mortified by the violence and life-threatening situations that the poor otter had known. At about halfway through the movie, there is a group of dead and bloody stuffed animals. A lot of blood, not a little. Then at the end, there is a fierce fight with a dog, then the blood is clouding the water. You'd think, given the grade G, that's all you'll see ... that they're going to IMPLY one of the dead animals. Nope. They pull the carcass out of the water and show it clearly for several traumatic seconds. Personally, as an adult, I love horror movies and I do well with violent films like Scorsese, Cronenberg, Tarantino. Damn, I love the very violent Battle Royale. But these films are not children's movies and do not advertise themselves as such. If you deliberately raise your little ones to see the harsh realities of cute animal life, this movie is for you. If you are like me and my wife, you may want to avoid your child's nightmares and avoid this one.
