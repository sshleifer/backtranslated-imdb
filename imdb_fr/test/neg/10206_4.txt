No Holds Barred is the film that, at nine or ten years old, was the coolest film on this side of Arnold Schwarzenegger. But then, when you grow up and look at it, you're embarrassed to know that you've been so credulous for having loved it. You feel cheated, embarrassed and stupid. If you have a little brother and you show him that and he tells you it's gay, give him a high number and take him to the Strip Bar for his eleventh birthday.
