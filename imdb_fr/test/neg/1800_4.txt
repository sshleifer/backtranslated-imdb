Criticism of Joseph Conrad's film Heart of Darkness Heart of Darkness is quite dark, deep and very deep. I must say that reading the novel is much better than the movie. The character of Mr. Kurtz, played by John Malcovik, was totally the bad actor to play the role. It corresponded to the character of "Mice and men". The film omitted the key elements of the man that I think is important to get the true message of the story. <br /> <br /> The film is badly edited. It shows a lot of non-important and troublesome flashes. In the novel, there is a very suspensive atmosphere, but in the film he lacks that kind of feeling. In the book, there are so many things that have been left to the reader's imagination. For example, when Marlow spent hours and days out of time waiting for rivets and that whole scene was left out of the movie. In the novel, Marlow waited a long time for the rivets to pick him up to repair his boat. It was a great source of futility in the novel. The movie added more useless and meaningless parts. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz broke the monkey's neck and killed him. This kind of ruining everything, makes no sense to me anyway. So my suggestion is not to watch the movie, but to read the book. You will understand better and have a better interpretation of the story. <br /> <br /> ~ Chris C.
