The creation of Brodzki is an excellent example of how it is forbidden to make a film. First there was a book written with great humor. Book that has many fans who would be happy to provide help when producers, for some reason, decided to employ people who had barely heard of the book. Then came a scenario as humorous and as absurd as possible. At the same time, the script was written in a way that would not allow those who had actually read the books to understand anything of the plot. Anyway, anything in this movie does not make much sense (eg "I'm like a piece of ice, you can burn yourself," said Yennefer as a warning - warning that logic is seriously lacking in this film). To add to this, we must mention that no matter how much money was spent on the film, everything looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects, one of which is a transparent dragon. Even the costumes seem to be borrowed from a really poor theater. These are the best look this way. And to add to that, we have staged some "nude scenes" only to include them in the film because they have no explanation in what could happily be called the plot. The film has only one strength that can hardly offset the rest - the music is not bad. Although if I had to choose, I would prefer to have it separately. It seems better if you do not have to watch this failure of the super production.
