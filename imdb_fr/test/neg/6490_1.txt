Charlie (George "Norm" Wendt) and Rhonda ("Just Say" Julie Brown) are two gay, deadly extraterrestrials who are stranded on Earth and fall on a small western town. They become deputy sheriffs and provide a form of deadly justice to speeding, murderers and others, while putting themselves in the wrong position of some locals (led by Wayne Grace). Meanwhile, their sexy alien daughter (Anastasia Sakelaris) arrives looking in a skinny / shiny outfit with her black human husband (Christopher M. Brown) and television reporters and government agents follow one another. <br /> <br /> From what I can say, this is a deliberate attempt to cover all possible genres (comedy, science fiction, horror, western ...) in a single film and what a stupid and not funny mess, despite the energetic play of the two stars. The script is downright atrocious.
