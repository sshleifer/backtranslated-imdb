How dare you? Adam Low, without apparent shame, gives his name to this false homage. This is not even a serious study, analysis or commentary on the work of the great Visconti. Yes, it's long and monstrous, yes, we have wonderful movie clips that most people interested in the subject have already seen. But what sounds the longest, leaving the most lasting impression is gossip. The last voice, the strongest, comes from a third German actor, unleashed and delirious. The director named correctly, Mr. Low, directed this, hoping, I guess, to get better ratings than his previous documentary, more relevant, but deadly boring on Kurosawa. Well, I have news for you Mr. Low and your cohorts. You missed a great opportunity and for my part, I will not give you another one.
