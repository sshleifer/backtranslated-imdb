Of course, I like some independent films. A lot, actually. I do not always understand them and it's okay. They were not all supposed to be understood, especially by the more important people like me. I probably show my ignorance, but I still do not understand why the "Book of Revelation" is so called. I love these stories of the end of the world and the only thing I could see was like the end of the world and this film was the torture it took to get through. I do not speak of the subject; I may have been subjected to all the other types of torture / porn I've seen. It was just incredibly slow story, a matter of an hour and fifteen minutes stretched for nearly two hours. A heterosexual dancer is kidnapped, seduced and raped six times from Sunday, or in this case twelve days, by three hooded women. When she was released, her little dancer and her somewhat distraught girlfriend jerked (except dropping a glass) after wondering what was missing most: him or the cigarettes she had originally sent him for her kidnapping. Always in a reasonable state of shock, he refuses to speak and she goes to work without even a hug, as if nothing had happened and he takes a well deserved shower. Problem. As much as he is tormented by the flashbacks of his "attacks", he is just as excited. Admittedly, I have not been tied up and used as a toy, but I doubt that I am really in the mood. Oh, I forgot, and how is he trying to solve this crime? Sleep with as many women as possible to try to spot birthmarks or tattoos of criminals. I see where they go with that ?? show a collective rape of the male POV. Well, despite everything, you could never feel that guy. Only saving grace, the good instructor of LifetimeTV Dancer / Cancer Instructor. But even she could not save the movie.
