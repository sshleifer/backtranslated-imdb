Science-fiction of the early 1950s by Lesley Selander. The special effects are of course very primitive, but quite good compared to the ones that existed before. Double entry rate in the movie Drive-in; still interesting enough to watch. Two important men, Arthur Franz, the brilliant young scientist Jim Barker, and the journalist Steve Abbot (Cameron Mitchell), who speaks frankly and lucidly, are joined by Carol Stafford (Virgina Huston), scientist and two other space experts (Richard Gaines and John Litel). As they land on the Red Planet, space travelers meet locals who seem friendly and mentally advanced. In fact, the Martians are led by Ikron (Morris Ankrum), who has the idea of ​​conquering the Earth to boost their civilization. There is a beautiful Martian (Maruerite Chapman) that Dr. Barker intends to bring back on the return trip. She is the redeemable element of the film.
