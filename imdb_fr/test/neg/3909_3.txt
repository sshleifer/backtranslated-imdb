If you are one of those who do not really like science fiction because of their sometimes fanciful ideas and surreal global perspectives, avoid getting as far away as possible from Stuart Gordon's Space Truckers! It's really an absurd space adventure, full of eccentric characters, colorful kitsch and ridiculous intrigues. In all honesty, I probably would not have cared about this movie without the name of Gordon in the credits. This guy is almost a genius in the horror genre, with undeniable milestones like "From Beyond" and "Re-Animator" in his resume. Apparently, Stuart Gordon likes his most twisted humor possible! He had already completely surpassed the top of comedy once (with Re-Animator), but with the slight difference that bizarre humor was effective there. Something that is not really the case for Space Truckers - most gags do not lead anywhere and the entirely exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses. In the end, all that remains is a mess that is sometimes amusing but totally useless. Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance (or at least a half-dance Charles Dance) are always a pleasure to watch and Barbara Crampton, always so breathtaking, has a small role to play towards the end of the film. Crampton was the regular heroine of Stuart Gordon in previous horror films. The story of Space Truckers is as stupid as they come. Dennis Hopper plays the self-proclaimed loner who is tired of his job. Who would not be when you are carrying pigs across the galaxy for a company called Interpork? He sees his change flee while bringing his muse to earth. They float in Space-pirates and discover that their cargo must destroy half of the universe! Stuart Gordon wisely began to horrify after this little getaway. Since Space Truckers, he has already realized the sublime "King of the ants" and the very brilliant "Dagon".
