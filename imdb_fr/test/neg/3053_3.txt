And you know why? Because they thought (or at least reminiscent of horror fans) that a group of odious, screaming, screaming teenagers, stupid demons (where do they come from, what is their purpose, who knows?) And a dark mansion are all you have to make a horror movie. Needless to say, they were wrong. You also need a script, logic, rules and an invention. This film has a scene worthy of its reputation (the lipstick scene, of course) and some fun moments (the description by the little brother of his mother's cookies, the scene "do not look at me" by Linnea Quigley ). He also has more blasphemies than any movie I've watched since I last saw "Reservoir Dogs". Literally, every fourth or fifth word is an "f ***" or a "b ****". Again, when a movie starts with FOUR FALSE alerts in its first 5 minutes, you know that you should not expect anything that looks like a good movie. (* 1/2)
