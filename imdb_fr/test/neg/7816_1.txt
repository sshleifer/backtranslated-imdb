It's easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are so many things that do not go home that do not happen, it's not even funny. True, it's a film that means things that will not happen in normal life happen here, but this film is far more far-fetched than theories that no child left behind is working. All these people are in the house and no one has noticed another, not to mention the damn owl that seems to come everywhere but in his cage. I could face a joke about owls the first time, but after an hour, I just can not stand it, I'd rather kill myself than see that damn owl again. Did I laugh during this movie? no. Not even once? no. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. The fact that this pile of garbage is closed with Ashton Kutcher bending over his boss and taking his pants in front of everyone makes the film even worse. But wait, the day is saved because this damn owl can fly. INCREDIBLE WAOUH! However, I give credit to this movie, it's not as bad as Epic Movie .....
