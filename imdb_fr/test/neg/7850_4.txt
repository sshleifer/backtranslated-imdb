The Kissing Bandit is the third and final film with Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and It Happened in Brooklyn. And in both Sinatra courted and lost Grayson. I guess the third time is the charm. <br /> <br /> For romance perhaps, but certainly not for the image of the screen. Sinatra in her 40s of movies once again plays the pretty little schnook in toreador pants. Breaking on the territory of Tyrone Power exhibited in The Mark of Zorro, Sinatra plays the son of a man who owned the hotel during the day and Kissing Bandit at night. He left and left California to study and came back to take the place of dad, but only in the hotel business. Where did he learn about the hotel industry, Boston? <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the former daddy gang members, who have grown old and threatened by J. Carrol Naish, want him to run the gang again. But Frank is just not made for life outside the law. But he makes a good impression on Governor Kathryn Grayson's daughter. <br /> <br /> Someone must have wanted to bring Sinatra to MGM after the bad reviews he had in Miracle of the Bells. Frank is in a game that suits Red Skelton better. But since it was a musical, I guess MGM's brain trust assumed that Kathryn Grayson had to have a singing co-star. <br /> <br /> In fact, the best figures of the movie are for her, Love Is Where You Find It. Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse also make a nice dance specialty. Frank's songs are cool, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> In the years to come, Sinatra would cringe at the mention of the Kissing Bandit and with good reason.
