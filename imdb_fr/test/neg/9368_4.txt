Has anyone noticed the fact that the first group of episodes is too inspired by the movies of the 90s? <br /> <br /> I seriously mean a woman who is trying to have her rich husband murdered by someone else so that she can claim her assets. Medical students who temporarily stop their hearts to recover lost memories; Flatliners. A group of college organizations meeting again to recall memories of the past, but not quite comfortable because they have done something in the past, Very Bad Things? Groundhog Day is one of my favorite movies of all time. Unfortunately, the writing staff behind his poop is made up of lazy bastards who can not present their original script. <br /> <br /> Noble idea totally devastated in its execution.
