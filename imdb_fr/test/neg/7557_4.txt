Ken Harrison, a young sculptor in his thirties, is seriously injured in a car accident. End of the story. <br /> <br /> "End of the story", that is to say "end of all physical action". Not in the sense of "end of the film". Ken's life is saved, but he is paralyzed from the neck. When he discovers that he is unlikely to ever regain the use of his limbs, he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to stop the medical treatment that keeps him alive. The rest of the film is essentially a long debate about the rights and the disadvantages of euthanasia and the right to die. <br /> <br /> Ken's main opponent in this debate is his doctor, Michael Emerson. Although the arguments against euthanasia are often presented in religious terms, they are here in purely secular terms. If Dr. Emerson has deep religious beliefs, these are never expressed in the film. He believes passionately, however, that death is an enemy against whom it is his duty to fight; to allow a patient to commit suicide effectively would represent a surrender to that enemy and a breach of that duty. Ken is in a "Catch-22" situation. He must be able to show that he is healthy enough and rational enough to make the decision to end his life. Emerson believes, however, that the desire to die is in itself a sign of madness and irrationality. Ken's dilemma can only be resolved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss in the role of Ken and John Cassavetes as Dr. Emerson have expressed their respective views with skill and sincerity, but this should not overshadow the fact that "Who owns the life anyway?" just does not work like a movie. At one time, the filmed versions of the plays were similar to theatrical productions, but in the seventies and eighties, this was often considered unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media. Therefore, when the pieces were filmed, the general tendency was to "open" them by filming them on the spot or in the studio, taking liberties with the playwright's text, often making important changes to the plot and even introducing additional characters. I've never seen Brian Clarke's play, but I imagine it's a story that would work better in the theater than in the movies. There is very little physical action; the action consists essentially of long discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character is paralyzed. Such a plot does not lend itself at all to the "opening" device, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by a conversation to the detriment of the action. Even if it is well written and there is good acting, I am surprised that a film has never been made of a subject as cinematic. 4/10
