Detective Sergeant Vince De Carlo (James Luisi) and the company are in the business of a vicious serial killer / rapist. Can psychologist Carol (Susan Sullivan) help or become the killer's next victim? And what is there with the hilarious hudari of killer White Dude Afro? <br /> <br /> Inspired by the case of serial killer Ted Bundy, "Killer's Delight", aka "The Dark Ride", is a rather dingy tale of Serial Killer from 1978 that does not offer much. In fact, it is more of a police procedural film than a horror film, because the violence is largely in camera. Of course, we get mutilated bodies, but we do not get a lot of them in the operations department, especially if we want them to be committed afterwards, not during the crime. Those who hope "The Toolbox Murders" or "Maniac" will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there is an awesome scene in which a woman tries to escape the killer who takes the right tone, and is suspense enough to start. In addition, John Karlen is quite effective as a killer, although his hilarious hairstyle (Whites with Afros are always worth laughing) is more than a little distracting. <br /> <br /> "The Dark Ride" is too routine and mediocre to truly warrant a recommendation, as it does not have the proper operating elements and is dated even by the standards of the time. Those looking for a better example should probably turn to "Do not go home" and a few others because that is not enough.
