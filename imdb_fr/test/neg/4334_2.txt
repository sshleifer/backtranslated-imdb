The evil gangs of bikies in this film were called the Wilds, hence the title, but Minor Nuisances would have been a better name for this group of weak actors looking to look dangerous. Whenever they wanted to kill someone, they used their bike very slowly so that the intended victim could easily avoid them or push them off their bike. Their leader was limping badly, but still thought he could face the hero and win. As for Karen Black, she did not seem to know where she was during most of the movie.
