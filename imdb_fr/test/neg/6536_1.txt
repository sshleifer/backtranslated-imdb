So, then ... that's what is considered great art by artists like the SXSW Film Festival and Sundance, huh? Well, I guess I can tell as long as the story, the storyline, the dialogue, the actors' play (with the exception of Mrs. Aselton), the cinematography and the editing are absolutely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I remember telling other friends a few years ago A long time ago, the main problem with digital video was that we had to sneak into a future ocean of shit to find anything interesting to watch now that anyone and his brother (or brothers in the case of Duplass) can run out. and make a movie. "The Puffy chair." Do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> This long video is another chapter of the dismal and expanding world of "dud√©ology" films; young guns armed with a DVX100A, a few thousand dollars, a superficial, hastily written scenario, and some friends they call actors who decide an afternoon to make a film and that's it! directors of instant feature films. Do not get me wrong, I'm all about independent cinema (ie Hollywierd is bad). That said, you can not dispute some of the realities of this system. <br /> <br /> If the Duplass brothers had to raise a real budget and appeal to real producers, it is clear that a scenario like this would never have been green! And that's where the problem lies. There is no longer a filtering process for preparing movies (for example, videos) for production. Just take a DV / P2 camera and go! And what aggravates the problem is that the high-level festivals like the one mentioned above embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense. And why? Precisely because it is without budget. <br /> <br /> I think it's important, especially in the current climate of independent films, to allow video producers to make themselves talk about themselves by calling themselves "filmmakers". There is a difference in my book. When you have to go out and put your scenario on the line, ask real money for your friends, your family or your businessmen to make a feature film, knowing the potential losses at stake, then you'll know what means to be a movie. "director." But to drop a few hundred at Sam's Club for DV tapes, soda and chips are not enough. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and by the way ... I must say how annoying it was to listen to a woman being called "dude" throughout the movie. Even Mark Borchardt reserves this nickname very overused for his male friends only when he is at least endearing when his friend Mike is concerned! <br /> <br /> I think it's high time for the independent film community to start calling them shoddy, videos without budget for what they are, and at the same time reprimand prestigious film festivals. have praised these occasional efforts. Either that, or ask these festivals to have at least the courtesy to add a new category to their programming ... "Dude Films".
