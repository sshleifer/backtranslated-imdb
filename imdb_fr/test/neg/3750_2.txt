Martha Plimpton has produced prestigious films, in collaboration with River Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but she has never been able to extend her limited and missed appeal in the same class as, for example, Molly Ringwald. This film, which has just been released, is only an extension of its attempts in the late 80s or early 90s to find a character on the screen that is identifiable by moviegoers and represents another failure. Plimpton plays a troubled young woman who discovers on her 21st birthday that she has been adopted and - worse than that - is in fact abandoned at the door of her parents as a child! She goes in search of her biological father and mother, but the viewer does not know why she would even want to do it (would a mere curiosity give her so much determination?). Unattractive material given the treatment of the sitcom; he starts from the wrong foot and never gets back. Plimpton gives a sour and snappy performance, but Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place are fine as his adoptive parents. * 1/2 of ****
