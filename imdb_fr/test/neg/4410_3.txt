** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> An unlucky South Sea islander is executed by other natives (Caucasian in appearance) after he becomes friends with scientists visit, scientists Tod Andrews and Tina Carver. Scientific scientists unearth him and discover that he has taken the form of a humanoid tree. He comes back to life and goes wild and it is certain that this boogeyman of the 50s, the atomic bomb, is accused of this aberration. To say that this particular monster walks as if he had a stick in place would be superfluous. Suffice it to say that the creature trots, like the movie itself, throwing its enemies into shifting sands and giving the main characters another thing about which to make silly comments. Paul Blaisdell created the man's costume of the tree and it's not his best work. Over the years, this movie has been subject to many comments such as "To Hell it can go!" Personally, I think it's the best tree movie I've ever seen.
