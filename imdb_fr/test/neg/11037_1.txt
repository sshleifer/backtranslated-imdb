I read comments on IMDb for quite some time now. An average of 8.3 for this movie just annoys me. I do not want to draw one of these "bits I just created an account to be able to post on this film" but I just do it. The only theme you will remember from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize that many "hoity-toity" movies like this movie; nevertheless, it's shit. What REALLY reaches me is that the director expects you to have sympathy for the "villain" of the film. If you have sex with your sister, you should probably be excluded from society. Just my personal feelings, I guess. Yet, I sat for 2 hours of this * expletive * expecting a very deep reasoning behind the imprisonment of Dae-Soo. I tend to like a lot of foreign films, but this is my first encounter with a Korean Flick and he put them last in my book. Oh ... I already feel better after a little breakdown.
