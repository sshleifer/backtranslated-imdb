The movie was half finished before I could understand what was happening. It's a dog's breakfast with a movie about four Thanksgiving family dinners. Clich√©s and stereotypes collapse. When all is over ten hours later - well, it looks like ten o'clock - you're puzzled about what it was. I do not want to see a movie about quarrels at the table. There is enough in my own family. The turkeys looked good. The rest gave me indigestion.
