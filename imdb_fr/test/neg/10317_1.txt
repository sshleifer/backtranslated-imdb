My first warning should have been that this DVD was on sale for $ 5.00. But as there was Sandra Bullock, which I like, I bought it. My disappointment with the movie started almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and steep. The color is distorted. I kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. The acting is amateur. Even scenes of massacres are a failure. Twice, the dead have moved their legs. When my daughter, who was short of money, offered me a dollar to extinguish the film, I immediately and joyfully rejoiced. It's an incredibly bad movie. Tomorrow, I give this DVD at the company's white elephant Christmas party.
