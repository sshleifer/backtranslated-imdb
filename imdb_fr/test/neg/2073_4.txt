Sad game, weak scenario ... the worst Spanish film in years ... <br /> <br /> attracted by the beauty (naked) of Paz Vega, but as an actress <br /> <br /> > useless, you can hardly understand what she says ... <br /> <br /> About the story, there is not much consistency to say ... we heard speak <br /> <br /> before, but as it is a "modern Carmen", we find some changes: -The French soldier is now a Basque soldier. -Merimee himself is a character in the story. -Carmen is a dangerous "bandolera" in love with a famous "matador" and she is fluent in Basque ... <br /> <br /> Can anyone understand this mess?
