In 1976, a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night, a box is placed on the threshold of their house and the next morning they open it to reveal a button that must be opened with a key. Towards the end of the afternoon, a man with a scarred face comes to their door and makes an offer to Norma. This man is called Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that if he presses the button, a person from the unknown world of the family will not die and will receive a million dollars in cash. If they do not insist, nothing will happen and the offer will be passed on to someone else. Norma and Arthur have no right to talk to anyone about this deal, including their son. Financial difficulties encourage the family to press the button. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, can not be accepted into a new job for which he is applying and Norma, who is a teacher, is learning that funding for his faculty is being reduced. <br /> <br /> The sci-fi thriller, based on Richard Matheson's new "Button Button", will be determined by the extent to which they are ready to adopt this ridiculous hypothesis. The opening of the film is particularly problematic to anchor in a sense of realism with the household. Richard Kelly's previous film, Donnie Darko, cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify his excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the dream state of this much superior film, The Box and the very idea of ​​a device capable of killing anyone in the world, is quite improbable. The fact that Norma also accepts at home a person who bears almost the same scars as Two-Face of The Dark Knight and believe that this offer seems just as artificial. <br /> <br /> If this seems unlikely to date, here is what follows. even more absurd, involving a plot about someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility of an extraterrestrial life or any other godly person influencing those situations. Scenes of public library walkways, random nose bleeds, and brainless drones tracking the Lewis family become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity. To a certain extent, the film could be described as intriguing only to see where it is going. Kelly is sometimes skilful in her ability to hold our attention through many artifices of the film. In one scene, Norma is teaching a class and then another boy asks the question. He taunts her as he misses four of his toes. Later, at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding attended by Norma and Arthur, this same student appears as a waiter and seems to hunt them down. However, the ultimate justification for all these quirks is summed up in a highly sophisticated science fiction revelation that many will find unlikely and difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing in the film is that The button is squeezed surprisingly early, many of the initially promised moral implications are diminished for most of the duration of the images. The end, which will not be spoiled here, brings back these moral questions in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy. While the similarities can be seen, at this point, given the incredible probability of so much of the film and uneven performance, there is little reason to worry. Cameron Diaz's southern accent may be useless, but it is surprisingly Langella that is the most disappointing of the film, with a very unobtrusive role in the role of the mysterious scarred man, who seems to hide a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud. It's just a shadow of his impressive performance in Frost / Nixon. Many other actors in the film do not have much to do; Norma and Arthur in particular could not be considered as characters but as spokespersons for Kelly's pastiche of ideas. Underdeveloped and brief conversations, such as those where Norma sympathizes with Arlington for their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur wonder if they really know each other if the button kills one of them, points out. <br /> <br /> Since 2001 Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that lives up to the quality and imagination of Donnie Darko. Although this film may be intriguing for a moment, it is too absurd and implausible to be fully appreciated and it certainly would not warrant multiple viewing given the rather illogical revelations of the film. Sci-fi fans may be able to appreciate it a little more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly is trying to say under the surface remains mysterious. The Box is a film this year that should have been put aside.
