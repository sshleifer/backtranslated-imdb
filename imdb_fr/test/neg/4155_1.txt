Will you let me go if I guess your "palabra"? - Ask William Geld, a Tim Robbins who continues to behave as if he told him a fantastic joke and tried not to laugh. <br /> <br /> He tries to go to a forbidden zone. The woman who stops her continues to chat: - Your "palabra" is Carrefour. <br /> <br /> - How did you know? - asks the lady, surprised. He answers, in the name of Wisdom: -I heard when you did not speak. : / <br /> <br /> Yes, that defines the movie. It is exactly. It does not matter that Carrefour is a "road conjunction" in French or that the future is coldly bureaucratic and mixes languages. Or if Samantha Morton has nothing, nothing Spanish (Maria Gonzalez being his name in the film) with his Irish or Scottish tone whatever the tone. <br /> <br /> It's boring and dull. If you believe that there are multiple symbolisms, you will buy the most bizarre and disgusting romantic relationship of all time, located in a future that could be in seven seconds. I guess the palabra of this film: it will be "painful".
