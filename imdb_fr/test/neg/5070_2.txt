Another example of the kind of women in prison. It's not exactly a genre known for quality movies, but it's a notch below most. A group of women are taken from neighborhoods where they work in a prison on a rocky island. Once there, they are subjected to a lot of badly directed sexual relations and an atrocious "dialogue". For a movie with an incredible amount of sex and nudity, nothing really erotic. The sex scenes are poorly executed and some scenes, like the shower scene, seem to drag on. That said, there are at least minimum production values. On the W-i-P scale, I would put it above Frauen fur Zellenblock Neun, but below Chained Heat.
