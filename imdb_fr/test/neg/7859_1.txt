"Heaven Can Wait" is a crushing boredom and a misogynist lie wrapped in candy. I can not imagine anyone other than movie students sitting today. Don Ameche is present in almost every scene and, while he has a melodious voice that has undoubtedly contributed to the success of his career on the radio, he does not have the charisma to wear this film. Ameche plays Henry, a womanizer. Lubitsch wants to make Henry's sexual incontinence adorable and fun, and he orders Ameche to play the role as furtively as possible. The combination of Ameche's lack of charisma and Lubitsch's insistence on blandness gives a principal figure both deadly dull and completely disgusting. You would not want to spend time with this man; he would have put you to sleep. You would not leave him alone with your daughter, no matter how old he was. Something terrifying could happen. <br /> <br /> The look of the movie is rather boring. Scene after scene, you have static shots, too much light and diket-like diorama, carefully dressed Gilded Age stuffed shirts, and truffled agitations in overly busy Victorian lounges. There are so many ruffles and volutes and curls, so much lilac and sky blue and roses that it takes Dramamine. <br /> <br /> This movie hates women as much as hardcore porn, but it presents this hate with a candy coating and a nice little bow on the top. The contrast between the content of the message and its diffusion is disgusting. In one of the most odious scenes in the film, an elderly woman is sent to hell because she is not physically attractive.
