The premise of the film was very promising - a kind of film like Napoleon Dynamite gay. And to be honest, there were funny moments and funny replicas but it was really not very good overall. The script and the dialogue resembled a local sketch production full of clich√©s and predictable scenes. <br /> <br /> However, there were enough fun things to keep me looking at how they ended, as clues that something special is happening in the end. But it seems that the film is out of money or that the writer is short of ideas, because the end is extremely abrupt and passes almost directly from what seemed to be the main conflict of the film to the final credits. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was very disappointing but not completely unassailable ...
