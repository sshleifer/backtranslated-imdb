My qualifications for this exam? I own all the Alien and Predator movies. I have read and read almost every book related to this series. <br /> <br /> I can safely say that this movie is a Stinker. Save your money and do not waste your time. If you like stupid action, the stupid half-blood, no conspiracy and as if you were caught by Hollywood, check out the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a serious fan of the Alien series, send a message to the one who is too drunk, the overpaid costumes in Hollywood and 20th Century Fox and do not give them a dime. <br /> <br /> This film contains so many holes in the plot that you could spend pasta there. Read the other negative reviews for an overview, everything has been said correctly, so I do not have to repeat them. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are cardboard. You all want them dead. And the film does not disappoint, they almost all die. Even the hot blonde with a blonde head. Do you feel sorry for her? Nope. No plot, no character development ... who cares. The Predators are now also idiots. They scan everything except their own dead warrior. They are supposed to be a high-tech company, right? In the movie Predator, they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. The trophy kills. In AvP, they scanned Charles Weyland and let him go because he had cancer. Main hole of the plot! <br /> <br /> In addition, the rating R is due to the fact that they have children in the film who have a hugger face, a lot of gore and violence and that there is a scene of a hospital where a very large pregnant woman gets injected with breasts. The hybrid Alien has implanted 4 or 5 eggs in a mouth-to-mouth love orgy scene and they all hatch in about 30 seconds. Sensational gore an abundance, nothing more. These scenes are laughable, not serious. It's almost as if the violence is happening and the Alien is staring at the camera and waiting for applause, a push or nod. <br /> <br /> Aliens in this movie all use performance enhancing drugs. They grow quickly and spread quickly throughout the city, tons of them, everywhere in record time. Pathetic because it does not stick to the plot of the series and adds nothing to continuity Aliens, Aliens Predator. <br /> <br /> I noticed that positive reviews are written by people who love gore. Ridiculous. As a film, a continuation of the Aliens franchise and the development of the Aliens vs Predator franchise, this film is at best a cliche of cheesecake. If you have faithfully followed this series, all the rules are broken and Aliens and Predators are reduced to comic characters. <br /> <br /> There is not a fantastic and memorable action scene. There is almost no special effect to remember. There are no brand actors. The plot is as fine as an onion paper that finally ends with a "We have two choices to get us out of this mess ... Hospital or downtown!". I almost wet. The center of the city means that everyone will get screwed up by Big Brother who knows the city is infested because it has an AWAC in the air that can see the infestation on a radar screen with special effects Red spots. I just fell off my chair. Special effect radar alien radar on an AWAC over Central America. I burst out laughing. <br /> <br /> Being forced to go to the helicopter platform strangled me with my popcorn. Has anyone played a game called ZOMBIES!? To win, you have to place your pieces on the helicopter. I almost wet with a laugh. <br /> <br /> The end is enough to make you shake your head with wonder. Who hired 20th Century Fox to write this script !? OH, oh, ask me ... a grade 5 student. There really can not be any other answer. Oh, yes, there may be another answer ... Sci-Fi Budget Cheesecake. <br /> <br /> The end? "Col. Stevens brings the Predator rifle to Ms. Yutani (Fran√ßoise Yip) and tells her that Earth is not ready for the technology it represents." Col. Stevens knows Yutani does not want technology to be used on Earth. " You make fun of me, do not you? Ms. Yutani? Who is Ms. Yutani? (for the group: Weyland-Yutani: The Corporation) She is in the film exactly 2 seconds and yet, in her infinite Far Eastern wisdom, she says that the world is not ready for technology. Seriously??!! The Dweebs brothers (Strause) as directors? Who is responsible for this haemorrhage-abortion of a movie? They are directors Doug and Bob McKenzie and yet Fox has entrusted them with the frightening Alien franchise. They are touted as special effects experts and yet the film only offers low-budget special effects. Hmmm, I see a motive. It's laughable. <br /> <br /> This movie is only for emptying your wallet. It is useless. He does not have a plot. There are no main characters to mention. It's disjointed. It does not respect any of the principles of character established in previous films. It does not do anything to advance the franchise. The special effects are lame, minimal and low budget. And, he has no end, strictly speaking. It's a small budget and strictly designed to take your hard earned money. Nothing more. <br /> <br /> Save your money. Either watch it on TV where it will very quickly finish. Buy a bootleg or miss this hemorrhagic ulcer. There is a reason why Fox did not watch this film for criticism. Critics would have eaten this mess alive and nobody would have gone to the theater to see it. JR Giger, the original creator, is right now, leaning over a toilet and spilling his lunch. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox, this film is an odor. It's as bad or worse than Alien 3. You insult us. <br /> <br /> Rinse now ...
