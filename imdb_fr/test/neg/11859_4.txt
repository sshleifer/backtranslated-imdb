I'm going to this game and everything is fine, I guess. I was expecting a little more. The main problem with this is that hacking is extremely difficult, even if you read the instructions, you can not get them. Plus, the graphics are not as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could be improved, he says that if the guards walk in the water and you shoot a sticky shock in the water, the guard will cook but nothing happens. In my opinion, it's the worst of the three. I did not play first, but I played against Pandora Tomorrow, this and Double Agent. This game deserves a 4/10. Could do with some improvements.
