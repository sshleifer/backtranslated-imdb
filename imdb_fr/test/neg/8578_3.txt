This film is very disappointing for the one who read the book. As Rafael Sabatini wrote, it was a true piracy story in the Caribbean, which would have made a big motion. In addition, it would have been very simple to do. All the action takes place aboard a ship and on a desert island. Unfortunately, the screenwriters took the title at Sabatini and then threw away the rest of the book. Even the name of the main character was changed and his on-screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel. It is a sad loss for those who love a good sea story.
