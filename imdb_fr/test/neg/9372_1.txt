Eliza Dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. She manages to be the indeformable center of "Tru Calling" but that is not enough to save her television series from mediocrity. It's a shame that a woman as attractive and as talented as Dushku goes from a fleshy support role in "Buffy against the vampires" to this clunker. <br /> <br /> Unpublished and desperately trying to be fashionable, "Tru Calling" fails to excite to a level higher than that of hormone. The eponymous heroine spends much of her time crossing what must be a very small city, to avoid the death of beautiful corpses she has already met in the morgue where she works. Despite everything she does, she always comes across as if she had just come out of a portable climate controlled locker room. <br /> <br /> In each episode, Eliza Dushku and the other cast members struggle to breathe life into the no-frills, characterless scenarios, but it's a useless exercise. "Tru Calling" rests on the slab, looking at the lifeless ceiling.
