Fuck is my reaction to this movie. I really hoped it would have been a good modern slasher, but he's not even in the slashers category. Instead, he tries to be what he is not, a psychological thriller, and he fails so sadly. Even the title "Freak" suggests that it might be interesting. Match that with the DVD sleeve and you say "OK, maybe I'll try this one". It is not worth the trouble. <br /> <br /> The story begins a little interesting with a poor child deformed with bandages wrapped around the head and chained by his big mother. She screams on him and probably beats him because in a scene we see him slap him for no reason. After all this, he decides that he has enough and smashes his face with (I think) a rock. Today, he is now in a lunatic asylum and is being transferred. On the way, he gets out of the van in which he is and escapes. Also introduce the 2 main characters, a little girl and her older sister. They move and take the road. So, most of the film is that they wander around in the car talking to each other. But the bandaged "Freak" is now free and he is about to embark on an exhausting murder! (I'm totally sarcastic) <br /> <br /> I can not believe how annoying this movie was. The budget was kept to a minimum, with no special effects and dialogue that I did not care about. It's one of those movies where the packaging is better than the movie itself. And to compare that to Halloween ?! Garbage! I'm not even a fan of the Halloween series (except the 3rd) but Halloween is far superior to this one. At least with Halloween, we have a very good score and really scary moments. With that, there is virtually no music except a piano here and there and there is nothing disturbing in this movie. Maybe this movie would have had better results if it had a good rating, because even the worst movies are tolerable if the music is good. <br /> <br /> Well, that's just my opinion of the movie. I thought it was just a complete size of time and money. But, since the film has a rating of 4/10 on IMDb, there must be people who like this film. I am not one of those people. 2/10
