Here's another pop star that's coming into the world of television and, based on her observations from her pop career directors, saying yes, your big Gwen, you could be a real star. Maybe you will be in list A one day, they would do anything to expand the series, there is just not a pretty face, but also a capacity for interpretation almost overnight. Gwen has found the ability to act by looking at actors like James Dean or Clint in the east direction, please give to the real people in the world who have to sit behind this box and have to undergo the efforts of pop stars to try to act. Thank you for sticking to your pretty pop videos with your Japanese composition and not insulting the British with your efforts as an actress. Anyway, I'm going back to work in the working class and I think I could do it. but yes, remember that I will work until I turn 65 if I live as long and yes, you put your feet in the air with your royalties every three months, so get married with the money, xxx
