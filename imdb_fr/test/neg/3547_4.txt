Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene cleaner. In his last job, he cleans up a new crime scene and destroys the evidence without knowing that the crime has not been officially reported. Uh oh, it can not be good. <br /> <br /> You hear about cleaners all the time, but usually when the crowd or a gangland hits, when bodies, etc. must be removed and the area cleaned. This is different in that Tom Cutler works with the police to clean up after the police have investigated a crime scene. Hey, someone has to do it. You know that the police will not do it. The film clearly shows it and it belongs to the family to clean the area. <br /> <br /> It's almost a good thriller, but a parallel plot involving Tom's (Palmer) daughter makes this story a little embarrassing. I guess they must have taken some time. Oh, they brought this secondary plot to connect with the secondary plot, but it was still a difficult attempt. You see? <br /> <br /> It was almost a good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of tension, suspense and a little sluggish pace. The music did not help either, as I noticed that the music was more appropriate for people watching a long trip. You know, travel music. Find? HA! <br /> <br /> The action of all was excellent in this almost a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No
