Do all parody movies require pure stupidity and a lack of any intelligence for humor? Is there even a single parody film actually FUNNY? All I see is zero-quality movies that look like a couple of defeated high school students who got bored one day with a video camera. These movies are not funny, they are not smart, they are not entertaining, they are simply useless in any way imaginable. <br /> <br /> The Comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its level of bastards by not calling itself "sports film". It's the same, though. There are a few different authors for these films, the Wayans have done so, Freidberg and Seltzer have others, and I'm sure there is another pair. To be honest, I can not even distinguish the differences in direction or humor, it seems that the same people have written and directed these people. I can not tell if the Comebacks were made by those who made Scary Movie or those who made Epic Movie, or by someone else, these are the same jokes as all the others. <br /> <br /> If you have Any piece of taste or value for humor, do not see this movie. If you trust yourself, do not worry about seeing it. If you have the slightest respect for making a film, do not even consider watching it. Do not see it in a ruined or abandoned theater that could carry it, do not rent it, do not order it on Netflix or pay-per-view, do not do it with Redbox and do not even look it's free on OD. Avoid him like the plague. <br /> <br /> The only imaginable reasons to watch this movie are as follows. <br /> <br /> A. Masochism. If you like to torture yourself, there are very few better ways. B. Seeing a great example of why we should avoid NOTHING who says "Fox Atomic". C. You receive a considerable amount of money. <br /> <br /> I would not really look at it if someone offered me $ 100 to do it. It's just a mentally and stupid collapsed torment. <br /> <br /> You might as well look at Zohan.
