While we welcome a movie about people with different romance challenges, I can not help thinking that this movie was meant to be a C-quality porn movie straight into the video, in which A) the actors stopped doing the explicit scenes or B) the producers ran out of money to hire for the inserts (an amazing thing if it was true). <br /> <br /> I had to go back to Blockbuster to understand why I had rented it, which was due to a hilarious credulity about the cover stories, which seemed to involve a John Waters seditious comedy festival with a sexual theme. Okay, I laughed a lot and it really has a sexual theme (though most of it can not be described as stimulating in any way). But on some movies, you can go back and make sure that you have heard the dialogue - on this one, you are moving quickly because you already know what they are going to say. But there is nothing to tackle quickly, so just move quickly.
