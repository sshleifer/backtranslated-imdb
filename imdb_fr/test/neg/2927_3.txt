Presented as a romantic comedy against the first years of the Second World War, it fails. The problem is that, although beautifully photographed, he has no narrative or coherent story. Beginning as a mysterious murder, he offers no hope to his actors as he travels through recent history. Depardieu is lost in a trivial role of which he is obviously not at ease. Adjani can not wear the photo. The hero is not; obviously, an imitation of Hitchcock's role of "wrongly accused" lacks balance. Neither heroic nor comical nor suspensive. <br /> <br /> It could have been a good movie. I remember "The Lady Vanishes" which combined suspense, romance and comedy in a serious film about fascism.
