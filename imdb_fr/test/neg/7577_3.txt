I have seen a lot of Japanese horror movies and I have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all pretty much the same. This one is no exception. the ghost is a black-haired girl who scares her victims by doing nothing but walking and looking dead ... the difference is just the reason for the obsession. the rest is the same as every time: black haired girl, strange things happen with some media (photos), scary game. While watching this movie, I constantly wondered why I was wasting my time looking at things that someone else has done so much better before. some scenes where pretty cool, I'll give it 3 out of 10
