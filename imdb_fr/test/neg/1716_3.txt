It's certainly a direct video, but the story is not as bad as most other critics think. I like the fact that the hero is wrong most of the time. <br /> <br /> The reactions of the hero and those of the rebels are simply human. The character of Hopper is playing God. It may be the right thing to do, but we may not like it anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end, the player god is sentenced to death and the hero, who would have spent his own life, can live. Enough morale. :-) <br /> <br /> The most unrealistic thing I've seen is that the Earth is doing so well without a moon that stabilizes its rotation.
