I loved almighty Bruce, but as soon as I discovered there would be a suite WITHOUT Jim Carey, I knew it was bad. Although Steve Carell was hysterical in the first movie (the babbling scene is one of my favorites) and deserves, in my opinion, an Emmy for his role in The Office, he is rather weak in this monotonous comedy. I am curious to see the writers' work, because we could just as well do without history. But even if we remove the huge holes of the plot (why elephants and lions came to help Evan when the flood only concerned this region of Washington), the film is simply ... not funny. I have not laughed once, and as far as I can remember, a comedy is supposed to make you laugh. Or laugh at least. Not this one. <br /> <br /> However, there is little hope. Evan Almighty wrote "family" and it may be nice to watch a family (children might be entertained by the variety of animals and silly jokes), but for me, Evan Almighty does not cut it . <I give him a 4/10 and hope that Carell will be more careful when choosing his roles in the feature film.
