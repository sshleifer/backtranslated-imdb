George and Mildred is a really funny movie. This attempt to translate the successful television series on the big screen was a dismal failure, as is often the case. <br /> <br /> The spirit and the intelligent line of TV series have disappeared. The plot is a typical English farce of confused characters and mistaken identities, which is neither funny nor strange enough to cause a lot of decent laughs. <br /> <br /> Die-hard fans George and Mildred may want to see this final episode (Mildred died of hepatitis before the film's release), but others should invest their time wisely .
