If the good intentions were enough to produce a good movie, I would have evaluated the "Focus" weighing and obvious as a little higher than 4. Macy does his best, but as said another poster, the small parable Miller we ask to suspend disbelief. too often. Maybe the novel gives us a little more information about Newman, so that we can understand how a person who is obviously not devoid of intelligence could be so dense in the perception of the attitudes of those around him . I agree with another critic who says that if we ignore all the fanaticism of the average citizen in America at that time, the film could be a revelation. I grew up in the 1950s and the "good" pastors of my Lutheran church found nothing wrong with the church picnicking on a commercial beach, whose sign clearly indicated that neither the Jews nor Blacks would not be allowed. It's hard for today's youth to understand that this was the norm, not just in the South. As recently as 1964, when I was leaving a public school in Baltimore somewhat racially integrated (but sexually separated), my black classmates could not attend the traditional "father and son" banquet, because he was in an establishment not admitted blacks. Unfortunately, it was an establishment belonging to a Jewish family. The focus of "Focus" is important and we must never forget, despite the persistent signs of racism in modern America, how much the attitudes of this previous generation were really disgusting (the "greatest generation", indeed ). So, maybe this film is a little precious to counter the recent wave of sentimental bullshit about Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow in the 1940s. But in the end, as in "Far From Heaven", the good intentions of the filmmakers are undermined by the fact that a protagonist is so ridiculously unaware of the social conventions of their time.
