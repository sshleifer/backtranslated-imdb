if I could give a score of zero, coming from someone who loves the shock / exploitation films of the time and Waters in general, I must say that it is useless. <br /> <br /> It's no use, no use, an idiot camera and the need to prove his intelligence by rebelling against social norms, all this is like. <br /> <br /> Its entirety, in principle as in execution, it has no purpose, it is filthy for The interest of disgusting, obscene with the spirit of a Neanderthal, it is useless. <br /> <br /> Someone said that Waters "probably" laughed at all the bad press and disgust that others had given with this film, but why? If I made a short film showing a man in a bathroom taking a sh * t for ten minutes in a row, he would surely receive the same benefits, but why should I be proud or "laugh" at that? <br /> <br /> Would it be because I'm so unintelligent that I have to resort to this so that I can say "HA! Take this censorship and the mainstream! I'm so rebellious that I'm doing what I want and I film it! " No. <br /> <br /> The waters should not be proud of this mess, water lovers should not look at it, it is useless, that is to say without any use. <br /> <br /> Even do not match the criteria of art for the sake of the arts. <br /> <br /> Wanting or defending this film means defending something that was purposely designed to be anti-culture and intended to be pushed to the general public, in modern terms. This film is the hot topic of movies. <br /> <br /> Useless and obsolete. A film of Poser that demands that he be recognized as a rebellion.
