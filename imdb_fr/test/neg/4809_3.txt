Adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and that everyone is wrong. She must be the center of attention and she will act stupidly to make it so. With her attitude, she is sent to the charm of the school. <br /> <br /> She gets to know the typical characters of today's cinema; the nerd, the clumsy, the stepford housewife and the sexual minority. Things happen and in the end Adela "learns her lesson" so to speak. The plot tries to give a deeper meaning to Adela's condition, but fails completely (at least I did not buy it). You only have a superficial interaction within the same stereotypes that you have seen in a million films before. In addition, the director seems to have a fixation within, Adela shows her crazy several times too much, at least I do not see that they are relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> The film is OK, but if you're like me and you do not like watching a teenager upset people and do a behavioral U-turn in an instant, that I found very Amazing, think twice before looking.
