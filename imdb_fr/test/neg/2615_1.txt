AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN IS IT STOPPED? That's what I said somewhere between the beginning and this other part of the movie that was really bad. This film has almost undermined my life and I have watched very bad movies. Coming from a real fan of Puppet Master, I would expect me to hear that, but that's the truth. The plot is absurd, the dreadful special effects, the sweetest and most infernal sound track I've ever heard. Oh! I had almost forgotten the acting, it was so bad that I forgot it was there, said Nuff. The only redemptive factor of the film is that the puppets themselves are really stars and could surpass everything except Guy Rolfe himself (he is the puppet master). Retro-Puppet Master finish. In conclusion, PM7 is recommended to true masochistic fanatics. <br /> <br /> Roach <br /> <br />
