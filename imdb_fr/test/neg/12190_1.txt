This film is simply terrible. The talent that this has created is beyond any human belief. I think they had to drink alcohol thinking about this idea. I have the impression that 2 hours of my life have been removed. Harvey Kietel will try to distance himself from this garbage, it should have been a great detective film, but it develops into a bloody mess of vampires. I would recommend this movie to people who love to sleep through movies, you will not miss anything.Humour is made to please At the lowest currents, movies can raise us and remind us that life is worth living, this film you are really depressed. As DeNiro said in a film, the saddest thing in life is the lost talent, this film is a perfect example.
