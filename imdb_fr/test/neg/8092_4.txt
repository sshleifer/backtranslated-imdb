Right then. This movie is totally non-funny, childish, has gags from other movies, has songs from other movies ("Mutt" by Blink 182, "We Luv U" from Grand Theft Audio), a main character, a ridiculous plot , and nasty parodies of movies like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty. Use features? Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly. Enough said.
