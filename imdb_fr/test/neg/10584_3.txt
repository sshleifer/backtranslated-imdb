It is not fair. I really expected it to be a hilarious and entertaining movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson has not been sneezing since his first classics, Airplane and the Naked Gun. However, after seeing the movie Superhero, I'm happy not to have to pay for it. It just would not have been close to $ 9 per ticket. More like a dollar and a few cents. Because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes. And as disappointing as this movie was, I'm glad the runtime was so short, if not shorter. I just can not believe how some scenes were incredibly vulgar, useless and most importantly, STUPID! And above that, I saw better playing a wooden dummy (without the ventriloquist). It's as if Craig Mazin deliberately wanted to make a movie that deserves his 3.7, if not less, and even try to be worse than "Meet the Spartans". Very disappointing indeed.
