I just have to comment on this movie because I gave it the 4 rating, and in my opinion, it's quite high for a softporn coal movie. The plot is a little hokey (who would expect it to be otherwise), but Hafron is incredibly funny, and he tells it all in a cyborg voice, so it's easy for him. Whoever wrote the script had a bit of wit! I had to laugh ten times in a row, and that's no reason for anyone to take this movie. The only softporn movie I've seen that has had a merit other than that of beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuelle has fallen into the void ... look at the cover!) <br /> <br /> N any film that can entertain me Given the poor quality of the plot and the poor quality of the acting, also considering that the film was not designed to entertain in an artistic way, so to speak, it is worth at least four in my book. I mean, who would not look at that before Stop! Or will my mother shoot?
