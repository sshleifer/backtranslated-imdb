I have been a classic horror fan all my life. Many nights lasted until the early hours of the morning watching Universal movies on "Horror Incorporated" and "Creature Feature Night". Unfortunately, I watched this movie in the early evening and yet it almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> I do not think I have ever seen a picture of "horror" where everything was so real. Dr. Edelmann does not seem to believe in the supernatural. Yet he is medically healing Dracula and watching Larry Talbot turn into Wolfman, barely winking. He and Talbot discover the Frankenstein monster as if it were a daily event. Edelmann is fully motivated to bring the monster back to life, but after Talbot's protest, Miliza and Nina, he says "Aww, you're right, not much." After realizing Dracula's betrayal, he opens the count's coffin to the sun and POOF !, he's gone, just like that. <br /> <br /> The only person who did not seem to be calling right behind her was Jane Adams, Nina. His reward is to be bounced by the monster Frankenstein at the end of the film ... and nobody even tries to save her! She, Dr. Edelmann and the monster all perish, while Talbot and Miliza leave the castle casually. <br /> <br /> The lowest point for Universal during its classic horror years.
