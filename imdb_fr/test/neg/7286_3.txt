Hi. I looked at the first part when she came out, and I do not remember leaving so bad a impression as this one. <br /> <br /> First of all, the animation is hectic, wooden, not worked, lacks Naturality - I understand that the drawing style should be of the "Atlantic" type, but it could be done with the usual finesse of Disney ... see "Tarzan" to see what I mean. If I did not see the DISNEY logo at first, I would never say it was a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> Second, the plot was more like a PC game style, a good old quest. Not that it's bad, but it lacked a story that links the viewer to the characters and their goals. It was unconvincing, at least. The film was meant for children, but it was sometimes too childish. <br /> <br /> Third, the music ... I would say it was inappropriate, but it fits the scene perfectly with the plot and the animation ... <br /> <br /> > All in all, I think it was a kind of fun, a side project like a project made by several animator apprentices, just to complete the count of Disney movies. Sorry to hear it from myself, a big Disney lover ...
