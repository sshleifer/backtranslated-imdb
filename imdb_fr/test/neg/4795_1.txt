So we are supposed to find it funny that this woman is going into the jungle, in the war zone, just to find out why her fiancee did not go to Switzerland? Or are we supposed to take it seriously? It's not even funny, smart or entertaining - it's stupid - and so is the movie. The lead actress is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a movie - even worse than Jar-Jar Binks. Dialog does his best to be funny (almost all the time) but it never is. The number of jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. And in terms of the plot, did they even bother to explain what the rebels are used for (apart from being anti-government)? I guess it did not matter to anyone, neither to the rebels nor to the characters who just blindly went to the battlefield. Do not waste your time. "Coronado" is neither funny nor entertaining.
