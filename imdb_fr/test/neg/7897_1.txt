This could very possibly be the worst movie of all time, with movies like "Howard the Duck", "Plan 9 of Outer Space" and "Ishtar". I do not understand why I decided to see this movie because it was a waste of my life. I do not understand why we would like this film, regardless of their sense of humor. The acting game is among the worst I've ever seen, just like writing. The characters are all stupid and there is not a funny scene in the whole movie. Tom Arnold is probably the worst actor of all time - this film proves it. This film is not worthy. Do not rent it, do not look at it, do not even say it looks interesting. It's pretty bad I saw it.
