The movie "The Tempest", directed by Jack Bender, was released in 2001. It did not make its way into German cinemas and neither the director nor an actor was able to receive significant awards for this film. The film refers to the Shakespearian play "The Storm", published in the late sixteenth century. The director tried to create a modern version of this piece, but failed. At the beginning of the film, the owner of the plantation, Prosper, clashes with his brother Antonio about the treatment of their slaves. Antonio takes a trip to his brother and tries to kill him, but with the help of a witch, Prosper manages to escape and runs away with his daughter and a slave called Ariel to a small island near the Mississippi River. He has been isolated on this island for more than twelve years, until a chance to get his revenge on his brother ... If Prosper is lucky, you must find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> In In my opinion, this movie is really a bad attempt to create a modern version of William Shakespeare's original play. The story of the film is confusing, as are the characters. Prosper does not have the same powers as in the storm ..... END OF PART I
