What a terrible movie. I can not believe that I sat down and watched. A very, very, very, very, very pathetic effort, without any redemptive characteristic. Hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! The sequences called "race" are ridiculously horrible, and the plot was so bad that I forgot it. Part of the film was made on the course of Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium, I think, in 1988, during the current Grand Prix. I was there and I'm glad I did not participate in any of the paddock scenes shown in the movie. It could have been good ... what a pity.
