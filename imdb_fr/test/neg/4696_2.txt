The summary of the IMDB plot wrongly conveys the impression that it is Noah Taylor's film, while Fairuza Balk is the central character. It's amazing how such a cast of established actors could have been in such an amateur film, useless and without film. Balk breaks up with her boyfriend Taylor, sleeping with the devil (I guess - played by Dempsey) and accidentally killing Taylor - who follows her during the rest of the movie as a ghost. Perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen.
