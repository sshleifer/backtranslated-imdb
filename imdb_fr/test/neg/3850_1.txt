This film is pathetic in all respects. Bad acting, horrible scenario (is there one?), Terrible editing, poor cinematography, cheap humor. Simply horrible. <br /> <br /> I had already seen "The Wishmaster" a few weeks before this movie and I thought it was a ringer for the worst movie of the year. Then I saw "The Pest" and suddenly "The Wishmaster" did not seem so bad at all. <br /> <br /> Bad Bad Bad. Atrocement bad.
