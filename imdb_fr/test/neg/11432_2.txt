The filmmakers have done their utmost to find ONLY the following demographics: Palestinians who have the appearance of peaceful goodwill and those who seek the solution, Palestinians (especially older women and families with children) who are particularly embarrassed by security and Israelis who do not believe in the security fence, deeply sympathize with its purported effects on Palestinians and unnecessarily see it as a factor of division and / or waste of money. Oh yes, they have appointed a member of the Israeli government who supports the fence, but they do everything in their power to portray him as inhuman and indifferent, and ask him very leading questions that are really statements (for example, "The wall is bad for the environment ... everything is destroying everything"). <br /> <br /> I have no problem that all this is presented in the film. Even if I disagree with the people they interview, their opinions are valid enough for a documentary. HOWEVER: there are at least two sides to the question of the Israeli security fence, and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of Israelis (and many others) support the construction of the fence and believe it has a overall positive influence, this documentary "does not present the same opinion to any of these people." They even interview an Israeli Jew who claims that "all Israelis support the fence" and are therefore foolish and then stubbornly refuses to interview only one of these "crazy" Israelis Oh, and to top it off, they set the tone for the film by interviewing a couple of young Israeli children (truly exceptions to the rule - I went there) who make fun of their Arab neighbors on the other side of the fence. <br /> <br /> A "documentary" is a film that explores an issue and presents a full range of facts, opinions and perspectives. , this is not This is a shameless PROPAGANDA film that very clearly and emphatically offers a battery of support to only one part of a very controversial, emotionally charged and politically charged issue. It's not more a documentary than, say, Fahrenheit 9/11.
