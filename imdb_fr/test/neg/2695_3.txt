Watching this movie and listening to the comments, it is clear that Michael Radford does not understand this piece. The first hint that he can not fully understand the work is that he takes great pains to shoot the film in Venice in the seventeenth century. What seems really strange, yes, this incomprehension of the film would be to try to make it as precise as possible. But anyone who has studied Shakespeare knows that even though he plays most of his plays in exotic locales, culture and values ​​are still contemporary in England. It does not hurt the film, but it shows a lack of necessary knowledge. <br /> <br /> The fact that Radford kills the film makes him so serious. He managed to suck each joke out of the script, leaving all production flat. Every ounce of passion is defeated by the characters. Even Shylock's "Let's Not Get It" speech is a mild, awkward speech of an angry who seems to be just saying and doing what he's doing because he's supposed to do it. Lovers are solemn and far too restrained (Joseph Fiennes delivers some of the most romantic phrases of cinema this year in a barely audible whisper), Gratiano (who must promise to behave at one point) is more sober and collected As Bassiano (who makes him promise to behave), Jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends her life with Lorenzo pouting. <br /> <br /> In the commentary of the bland and diluted judicial scene, the director expresses his shock an audience mocked Portia's sentence entitled "A pound of flesh, neither more nor less"; finally concluding that tension had to release laughter. "The Merchant of Venice" is a comedy and Radford makes fun of the idea that the most absurd and hysterical parts of history are anything but the most daring and provocative drama. <br /> <br /> The film does not yet have an intelligible intelligence center. cut out some of the most fun scenes. The characters are forced to wear dramatic veils, so they look like Ibsen characters reading Victorian poetry. And the comic end, in which all the Gentiles go to bed happily, is drowned in a worthy despair which gives the impression of finding peace in the upper lip with imminent death, rather than being reconciled with the lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio leave the film holding their hats as aristocratic mourners. <br /> <br /> The film is badly done because the creative power that is does not understand the scenario. He is severe where he should be hysterical. He is reserved where he should be passionate. It's Michael Radford where it should be William Shakespeare.
