It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am still trying to overcome the gravity of the situation. It's not because Godard's name is attached to it that it's great. Beyond the fact that it makes absolutely no sense, we see an incredibly long plan of a traffic jam that is not gorgeous, unbelievable, or otherwise. As you take this long traffic jam, you will probably want to make a pastrami sandwich instead of continuing to watch it. Pieces of a supposed story, stupid and stupid characters. What message do we expect to draw from it? He offers nothing and is useless. The arrogance of the director to present these French steaming, boring and boring, and to let them sit and converse for hours, then make it look like an art, is really stunning.
