It's the worst film I've ever seen in my life. I do not find anything positive to say about this film (if this production is even worthy of this word). <br /> <br /> This production is not even the norm for a low budget porn movie! <br /> <br /> My question is simply: why did anyone watch the screenplay thinking "Hey, will you do a movie with that"? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I did not even hope that "Nicole" was going to do it ??. She was really so annoying! <br /> <br /> So, for your sake, do not watch this movie ... unless you want to lose 85 minutes of your life ...
