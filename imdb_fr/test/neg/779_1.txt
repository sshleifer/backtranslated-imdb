Maybe if you smoked enough grass, it would look funny or make you nostalgic for the fact that completely disturbed people let themselves go in the early 70's. This movie has a funny innocence and sex is much more clumsy and playful than the sharp pros who do it for the cameras. <br /> <br /> The real curiosity here - and really the only reason to watch this movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell in the role of Alice. She was a Ford model and it shows. She has a classic look, WASP-ish - like a very cute sorority girl from the Ivy League. So what the hell is she doing in this cheap and nerdy skin film? From my point of view, she does not seem to take any drugs at all in this film (which could explain it) and she actually seems incredibly attached to this role. When she sings her first song, she really behaves as if she thought she was flipping Julie Andrews or something. I just felt that this girl really believed it would be her big break or something, instead of the career killer he was. Anyway, she is pretty cute and we can not even believe she would even be naked on the screen, let alone do a masturbation scene, some scenes of oral sex (with men and women ) and then do the real deal as a climax to the movie (snark). It's certainly not a double at all. It's our little Kristine who takes one for the team or for the biggest glory of showbiz or something. It's pretty amazing to watch and it's really stimulating (ahem) but in a way, I really wish she did not do it. She was a very pretty and talented young girl who was getting very bad advice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I guess Kristine Debell, wherever she is, has long wanted this film not to go away. She was very cute and attractive in "Meatballs". Almost impossible to believe it's the same girl - but it is.
