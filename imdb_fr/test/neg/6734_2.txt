Since I am from Norway (one of the ten richest countries in the world), it was a lot of fun to watch how we use the 1950s trucks and live in medieval cottages. And since we have very strict laws regarding handguns, it was amusing to see how many weapons there really were in Norway during the five minutes of shooting. Mr. Direct-to-video even managed to bring his muffler down very quickly. He must therefore have powerful friends at the customs. <br /> <br /> Do at least some research before you go to an "exotic" country, guys - you can hurt the feelings of old fans. <br /> <br /> Sverre - former fan with hurt feelings.
