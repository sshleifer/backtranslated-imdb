If you like really shocking movies, this is for you. The acting is the worst I've ever seen and the storyline is not going anywhere. If you encounter this movie in your video store, do not even consider borrowing it. The girl on the cover is not even that of the movie. I gave this movie at 1/10 only because I could not vote 0. Avoid it at all costs.
