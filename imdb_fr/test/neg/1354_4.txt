I believe that an entire book can be written on the odyssey to redo the classic film on which this film is loosely based. When Hollywood started talking about such a company, the reaction was always negative, because too many aspects could have been wrong, starting with the solid set that made the original unforgettable, and that's precisely where that things have begun to deteriorate, with the selection of actresses who otherwise can do a remarkable job, but who do not fit the roles, and unfortunately, have been directed with the heavy hand of a director who does not understand or do not like the source material. <br /> <br /> It looks like there is no direction, no direction, or the direction taken is to erase everything that was good for the original movie. This is called an update, as we will evacuate the story of humor, catchy dialogue and any interesting premise. Above all, let's prove that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we are not really going (at least watching this movie) where women are really going. <br /> <br /> For For starters, playing the central role of Meg Ryan is almost fatal to the film because it seems to be locked in a kind of limbo where women do not really change appearance, even after 20 years working in the cinema. Her Mary, who turned out to be a difficult role in the 30s, is sort of out of her interaction with other stereotypes, like Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" by learning, observing and realizing that she had the choice in this matter. It may not have been a choice that women were celebrating today, but it was fun, and it's a fun part of what was the saucy, silly, sometimes zany routines that propelled the film in the sublime. Here we are on earth with a thud. By changing the nature of Sylvia, the film has lost much of its spark and this is in no way the fault of Annette Bening. I could not help but admire how she had tried to save this sinking ship and had a gloomy feeling as she struggled with the awful lines she was carrying. Fortunately, I had fun watching some of her awesome outfits and I remembered how very talented this lady was. Her Sylvia is wise but imperfect, and she could have been a great creation. Unfortunately, Mrs. English did not pay attention to her own work and loses control of the character who could have given a new direction to the film. <br /> <br /> But it was not the biggest blasphemy of all. . In the original, Joan Crawford probably achieves one of the best performances performed by a woman. Its crystal is legendary, with complicated lines, incendiary movements, duplicating maneuvers and sexy poses. She was the link between man and woman, and through it we knew what the disaster was. She provided the tension between men and women. She was dangerous, sexy, ultimate femme fatale. A woman of intelligence that we feared and admired and that we wanted above all to destroy to save our heroine. Eva Mendes, as beautiful as it is, is in two dimensions in this adventure because of a weak writing and, again, a bad casting. <br /> <br /> There are other atrocities in the film, such as adding a terrible role for Mensing as a devoted mother who lives to have babies, and the rather boring lesbian twist of Pinkett. Then comes the biggest waste of talent in the film, since Bette Middler, who is a little unrecognizable in her makeup, shows the spark of what could have been. His acidic speech reminds us of the contemporary angle that the film could have taken. Her words come back and put a lot of the badness that the film needs, and it's exciting to see that it could really fly, so she left. She is in the movie every six minutes and she fades into confusion. <br /> <br /> Here is a film that raised our level of anticipation and we were really disappointed, a film that could have joined the "Sex in the City" that has managed its transition to the big screen because he respected his sources and did not compromise. That gave us more, a bigger and better adaptation. He really updated what had made him succeed before. "The Women" in her current reincarnation has to go back, just like "The Hulk" did it this year, find more suitable performers, a very good writer and, above all, someone who really loves this that are good movies. sure.
