This film could have been an impressive epic, but the producers seem to have made every effort to make it ridiculous. Even God himself is not spared in this film, in the sense that his words are imbued with childish jokes. The result is blasphemous and boring. Only people who do not care to see a cheap parody about Bible history can perhaps watch this film without embarrassment. Producers of this tasteless production should see Pier Paolo Pasolini's "Il Vangelo secondo Matteo" (The Mathew Gospel), which shows that it is useless to pervert the words of the Bible to make a good story. the most impressive result is obtained by a sincere rendering of the plain text itself.
