I guess I'm supposed to take something like that with a grain of salt. These laboratory films (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the lab), always fail in one dimension: it is clear that singles who laugh have discovered secrets that exceed the understanding of anyone at that time. Of course, they pay a price because their experiences have the same drawbacks as Dr. Frankenstein's. There is always something they have not planned. There are so many things that go from pure science to fashion for young girls and scandalous cover-ups that do not work here. The young woman will certainly look for it and the doctor can not help it, but he could have been a little discreet or even make an effort to protect what he was doing. Things go wrong and because of this intellect, it gains tremendous power, including an understanding of how it has become. Rock Hudson seems rather fit here. He never really succeeds in this role, however. He wanders everywhere with a lot of clich√©s and nonsense, which diminishes the fundamental problem. Once she retires, a more appropriate thing is for her to move away and allow her to search for and destroy her dramatically.
