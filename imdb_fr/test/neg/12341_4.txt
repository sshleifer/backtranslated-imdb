The second documentary-style drama by director Michael Ritchie and actor Robert Redford, "The Candidate", is a political satire that still seems fresh and relevant today. It is unfortunate that "Downhill Racer", made shortly before, seems so dated in contrast. The music is ugly and the ski sequences, perhaps innovative, are now the norm in the television coverage of this sport. The ski world seems strangely amateurish (probably, given the time the film was shot, but it's hard to understand the professional world of today), and the American theme in Europe also seems gigantic in an era of ever easier journeys. The most serious problem is perhaps the flat plot, centered on the arrogant but enigmatic hero; unfortunately, it is a dismal performance of Redford, which gives us a glimpse of his concerns and motivations. And a character-oriented movie without a big character is never a good bet. I was expecting a lot, but unfortunately, it's a boring movie.
