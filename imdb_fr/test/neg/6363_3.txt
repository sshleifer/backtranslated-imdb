I did not particularly like sliding doors or Twice Upon a Yesterday, so I certainly did not have that lame second choice excuse for those movies. An idea that was made to death (what would happen if ...?) And the script is of poor quality and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt to add sex / nudity just to get a grade R and some scenes that were not necessary, but were there to push the boundaries (I really do not need to see a child urinate or struggle with a diaphragm, especially when he has absolutely no connection with the movie or do not use it). <br /> <br /> The acting was also very poor, the only actor I found the least satisfying was his daughter; the rest was two-dimensional and quite incredible. The people I watched with left the room halfway; I managed to finish it, but not without advancing quickly in a part of it. <br /> <br /> In general: nothing new here is a generic and boring film. The rather amusing moments are largely offset by idiotic or stupid moments. It would be boring even if it had not been done before. If it were not such a rehearsal, I would give it a score of five, but even for an independent film, it was sorely lacking and, as a rehearsal, it also lost in originality: 3/10.
