First of all, this film is so confusing that it's almost impossible to summarize it, because I did not understand this horrible story myself. In addition, the unknown cast, led by an actress named Laura Mennell, is simply awful. The expressions and cries of Sara Tobias's character are laughable and ridiculous, confusing grimaces with acting. Last but not least, there are many favorable comments on this film in IMDb, as follows: <br /> <br /> - Top Notch - Can not wait to see more directors working ?? the author published only one article in IMDb on September 24, 2004. <br /> <br /> - Incredibly shot, incredibly intense ?? the author published only one article in IMDb on August 12, 2004; <br /> <br /> - It's not your blood and your coolness, it's better. 7/10 ?? the author published only one article in IMDb on February 13, 2005; <br /> <br /> - As intense as the Asian horror !! - the author published only one article in IMDb on November 14, 2004. <br /> <br /> Coincidence? Or are they parents, relatives, friends or people hired by the production to promote this shit? My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11.11 to Nova Profecia" ("11.11" The New Prophecy ")
