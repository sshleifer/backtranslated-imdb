Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies that at least makes you laugh at their incredible stupidity. It has no entertainment value at all. It's just bad. I do not know where to begin to explain how this film annoyed me. I think what really takes the cake is the unbearable soundtrack. It looks like someone is taking a simple beating and then, for the rest, let a 5-year-old go wild with a synthesizer and record it. It's really so awful and as if that was not enough, there is not a scene in the movie without "music" (= noise). At the end of the movie, you are either deaf or already cut off your ears earlier. Which would prevent you at least from falling asleep, because nothing happens in the film to hold your attention. Many bad actors, some inexpensive and unconvincing feats, no story at all (it jumps from one scene to another and you, as a spectator, can try to understand), can witness some of the worst "special effects" never. It's extremely boring. Do not watch this movie! You could do something much more fun, like looking at a wall or reading the phone book. Did I mention how much the soundtrack sucked?
