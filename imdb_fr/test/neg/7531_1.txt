I saw the movie at its premiere in Lawrence, Kansas. This hesitant story about a group of disgruntled high school students who killed the competition for the title of Queen of the Ball was simply awful. It fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad scenario, no clear point. But it was mostly as if the filmmakers were saying, "Hey, I have money, let's make a movie!" - without really thinking about it. Unfortunately, most independent movies do not make it suffer from this mentality. They just do not seem to realize that it takes more than just money to make a good movie ... or in this case, even a watchable film. With this film, I'm not ashamed to say that if I did not know some members of the team, I would be out. As simple as that.
