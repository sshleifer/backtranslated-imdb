I'm a huge fan of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. The reviewer below is quite right to say that the beautiful footage from the Detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film. I really would have liked to stay after that, instead of continuing to keep hope throughout the movie. My expectations were perhaps too great, but I felt depressed. <br /> <br /> The score is almost entirely a revision of the previous two - it's not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one thing that seemed to me like fresh. It was enough that I check the soundtrack anyway. <br /> <br /> But keep that in mind if you see this movie: if you realize at any time that you're not enjoying it, go for it and splinter - you will not miss anything, because that will not improve. <br /> <br /> I'll even summarize the summary here (warning! spoilers!): Many snapshots of athletes who look good enough for a Nike ad, snapshots of smiling people, frontal shots inexplicably dull on wax mannequins of famous people (WTF they thought here? bitchin '"Photoshop effects, images suggesting a comparison between the flow of water, information, money and people (I think) .. and then a multitude of fast and unrelated scenes of mass violence ... then a series of images of the stock space. <br /> <br /> I could do it again in 10 seconds Here is my argument: <br /> <br /> 2 seconds of a happy dad with a shaved head and lycra shorts playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with a string, 5 seconds of this scene in "Network" where the guy is talking to play with the "elemental forces of nature" and how "money comes in, money s' flows ", 1 second Reginald Denny is hit with a brick, then 3 seconds bouncing Alan Bean on the moon. <br /> <br /> This is 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life that I just saved. Of course, I would get a copy of After Effects and apply a filter or two so that the result is not so obvious. If Steven Soderbergh was reading this, hey, I would not even need a lot of money for this project ... <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching a movie about "Life at War", I suggests "Bowling for Columbine" instead. The pseudo-intellectual polish may not be fashionable among the crowd of black turtlenecks, but at least it's funny.
