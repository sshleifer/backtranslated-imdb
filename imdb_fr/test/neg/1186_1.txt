very disappointing and incoherent - from time to time, a germ of idea developed and was thrown to the next line - it looked like a movie that had been cut and redone to try to make it work - I got bored and distracted in the long run, and I speak as a big fan of the series. Many jokes were not original and tired. The medieval section lasted far too long and the acting quality was very poor. done in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's a shame. <br /> <br /> The only really interesting thing was to take a peek inside the little shed of Soho Square ever in this part of London wonders about.
