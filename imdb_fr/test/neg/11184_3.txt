The price of a dream - and some dreams can be "too" expensive. <br /> <br /> To have only seen the translated version in English, it is perhaps the reason of the low note of this reader. <br /> <br /> This made the film poorer than the story ... <br /> <br /> ... and other comments suggest that the subtitled version would be better. <br /> <br /> But some elements of the plot remained unexplained, leaving an unfinished impression. <br /> <br /> It also leaves in mind that "is there a series to follow?" (at this point at least, anyway).
