If Corky St. Claire in WAITING FOR GUFFMAN had directed Blaine's citizens into a horror movie with comical nuances, the result would have been very similar to THE MILPITAS MONSTER. <br /> To be generous, it was the longest one hour and twenty movie I have ever seen. Calling the icy rhythm is being nice. <br /> <br /> Almost nobody associated with this project has ever shot another film with the exception of Ben Burtt, who realized the truly admirable special effects (given the budget). He continued to make sound for films like MUNICH and several other big budget projects. The narrative is by Paul Frees, a veteran voice-over actor, who has probably donated his efforts. <br /> <br /> When you look at the opening titles and see the Milpitas Unified School District listed as one of the producers you know. We are leaving for a long and strange trip. <br /> <br /> The pollution at the landfill in Milpitas, California, becomes so toxic that it creates a monster. Remember that we are in 1975 and that ecology was a hot topic. A few years ago, moviegoers had been treated at GODZILLA VS. THE MONSTER OF SMOG. <br /> <br /> So far so good. The monster is a winged creature at least fifteen meters tall and able to tear the city. Instead, he steals garbage cans. <br /> <br /> The central idea is that this monster can prowl in a small town and leave footprints of a length of eight feet without being noticed by anyone. There is a well-designed scene in which you walk at night in the middle of a carnival, but nobody notices it. <br /> <br /> The only person who sees the monster before the final scene is George, the drunken village. Throughout the film, I hoped, hoped, hoped that George would be ripped to pieces in front of the camera, but that did not happen. Drat. In fact, nobody gets killed. George would supposedly sacrifice himself to save Priscilla (he is tied to a helicopter to lure the creature - George smells worse than garbage and the monster is attracted to the scent). <br /> <br /> The nominal head is a group of high school students. There is the pretty Priscilla and her indefinable boyfriend and some "bad" boys who (surprise, surprise) get in shape to help defeat the monster in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> The monster is involved in four main pieces. He attacks a Browning-Ferris garbage truck and leaves it beside an elevated road, but no one notices it. He goes through the carnival, again unnoticed. He rips a building (beautiful miniature work) and no one sees it except George. Then he attacks high school during a dance and catches Priscilla and wins him off like a very big monkey has done so many times, most recently this winter. <br /> <br /> Intrigue ideas come from nowhere and are dropped. The inhabitants of the city picket at the town hall because they want to get their bins. An elaborate secret weapon for tracking monsters is driven by private jet, examined and forgotten. <br /> <br /> Then why did I watch everything? Because these people had so much fun. I thought firefighters were firefighters, that businessmen were filmed in their own offices. Priscilla might live in this suburban lodge and scenes of people in their backyard might have been in their own backyard. <br /> <br /> They may not be great actors, but they are real people. No one is incredibly handsome. In fact, I estimate that four out of five adults on the screen are wearing glasses. Since the mid-seventies we have seen very bad clothes and some men have incredibly bad hair. A dignitary interviewed before a meeting at Ciry Hall has a tie and a sport coat so strong that you think he is about to play the role of Marcellus in THE MUSIC MAN. <br /> <br /> And the film earns him two more stars. Zero for the story. Two points for special effects sometimes decent. And two points for the fact that the members of the community came together and did it. They can actually say they played in a movie; Despite many live experiences and backstage live TV, I can not say it and I'm happy for them. <br /> <br /> Do you remember those great old movies with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland? At one point, someone said, "Let's make a show! Aunt Edna has all those old clothes in the attic, and we can use Uncle Ned's barn!" Then they would do "neighborhood shows" with sets and costumes that would cost up to seven characters if they were duplicated today. <br /> <br /> This is the spirit that the good people of Milpitas have had for this project and have blessed them for this.
