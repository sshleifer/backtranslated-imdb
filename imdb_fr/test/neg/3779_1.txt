I heard that this approach was developed by a group of high school students. As an art or theater project in high school, it's not that bad. Unless you lived near the milpitas in the seventies or if you knew someone involved in the making of the film, it's really awful. Most of the actors are clearly not actors, but locals who have volunteered. Bob Wilkins (the original host of Creature Features on KTVU in Oakland appears, but only for about a minute). Some of the monster effects are done with a stop motion animation and some with a man in monster costume and each one works fine, but there is no continuity between the two. Looking without dialogue, you would assume that the movie had 2 monsters. The most unbearable aspect is that even the main characters, who are, I suppose, the children behind the film, can not even pretend to act. These young people must have been involved in the theater in one way or another to want to achieve this project, but they show no credible emotion in front of the camera.
