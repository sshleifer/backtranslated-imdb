With some movies, it's very difficult to say for whom they were made. Huevos de oro seems to target the well-educated Spanish middle class. There must be a lot of jokes in this movie that you will not understand if you are a stranger. It can be pretty boring. <br /> <br /> The symbols and references to art and popular culture abound, the film hints at the work of Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel and surrealists in general, a craze for bidet baths seems to point to brands ready for Duchamp. In addition, the main character is also gifted for karaoke tapes with songs by Julio Iglesias. But why all this is mixed in a pretty way but also free simply escapes me. I only guess that all this serves to highlight the vital, impetuous, and crude vulgarity of the main character that the director seems to admire and despise at the same time. The way all the very pretty women run it (the main character, I mean) is slightly disconcerting. <br /> <br /> The film has three parts. It begins in the Spanish enclave of Melilla in Africa, where Benito, the main character, does his military service, apparently in the corps of engineers. Then he heads to Benidorm resort in Spanin where Benito just wants to build the highest skyscraper in the area and become a popularized Howard Roark. For the last game, a defeated Benito moves to Miami, Florida, probably to start a new life. "But the change of venue is not explained satisfactorily. The film falls into a soap-opera without convincing irony.It must be said that Javier Bardem performs very well as a young stud that grows and deflates. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie because I am interested in cityscapes and Benidorm is a kind of privileged place, and it is also a special place Huevos de oro only partially satisfies me In the book of Jess Franco entitled She Killed In Ecstasy (1970), this precise location has been used in a more rewarding way.
