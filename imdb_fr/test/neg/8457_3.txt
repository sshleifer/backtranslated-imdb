"Terror in the Aisles" may seem like the ultimate treat for horror fans, but it actually has very little to offer. Certainly, it presents a decent and versatile selection (too versatile?) Of horror / thriller fragments considered as classic, but ... what's the point? This documentary is aimed primarily at the horror-loving public. So we have almost all seen these clips, is not it? The only really commendable thing about this project is editing. If you like scream-queens, vile murderers, and stuff like that, "Terror in the Aisles" offers neat compilations of the most famous sequences. All of these different scenes are linked by a lame wrap-around story starring Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen sitting in a movie theater. Between two sequences, the address of the viewer and "explains" why we love so much horror. These speeches are naturally soporific and rather obvious (it's in our nature to be afraid ... blah blah blah) and I do not understand why many people like this concept. It's worth a look if you're a loyal horror fan, but it's certainly not essential. On the contrary: if you still have to see a classic genre title, beware that bits of pieces here do not spoil your future vision. The main reason I hated him overall is because he shamelessly ignores many lesser-known but fundamental (foreign) titles that constantly focus on "Halloween". This leads to an inner joke when Donald Pleasance screams on the screen in front of his own character.
