I'm a fan of the horror movie, whatever its hemisphere. I know what to expect from the West, East and most of the horrors in the middle. So I received the DVD of 'Acacia' by mail and I was expecting a slow rise in tension and scary children with strange and disjointed movements hiding under duvets. <br /> <br /> The main selling point of this film is that it has a much more linear story than many actors like this - you see who the characters are, where they come from and what theyre doing. You get the basic information (nice couple, you can not have children) and you realize that the premise is too normal for something weird to NOT happen. <br /> <br /> And then comes the bad. The number one complaint is that the story is OBVIOUS. I got it about the time the kid hugged the tree. I knew where the movie was going and could even predict the order of death and why. <br /> <br /> The editing is shocking and, unfortunately, does not benefit the film. Even though I always meditated on events, the tension could not increase, as the director seemed to have a new editing suite for his birthday and wanted to make the most of it. <br /> <br /> And my finale The reproach is this .... the tree was useless. It would have been a very good story of subtle horror with just the couple collapsing after the child's death - the titular tree was not buying anything new or exciting for the movie. So I'll finish where I started - my overall impression was "Oh."
