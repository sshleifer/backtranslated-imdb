Larry Bishop is 60 years old. Dirty and not beautiful in this film, it is like a drug for twenty-year-old women. <br /> <br /> It has been claimed that many movies are sexist, but The film deserves this title, it is this one. <br /> <br /> I can not even count the number of breasts shown in this movie, probably more than hours spent writing the screenplay by Larry Bishop. <br /> <br /> The scenario is ridiculous, Bishop and his gang argue: ride a bike, party, have sex, kill people and the next day, they argue, ride a bike, do the party, kiss, kill people and the third day you see the idea. /> <br /> I love ERIC BALFOUR and, considering what he worked with, he did a very good job as a Comanche. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is about Larry Bishop, Pistolero, who is so one-dimensional that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> He's also a horrible actor, and apparently he never intended to play the lead role, but everyone he asked said no so what was he supposed to do make? Once he realized he was going to take care of himself, he probably rewrote the script so he could reach more women. <br /> <br /> Although visually, it's pretty pretty, at least the Biker scenes and Eric Balfour are not that bad. This movie is just a big mess. <br /> <br /> I hope I never see Larry Bishop again on camera.
