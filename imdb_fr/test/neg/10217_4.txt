ALERT: This notice contains major SPOILERS. Do not continue reading if you plan to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Judging by the number of votes this person got (my voice was the fifth), very few people know or care about who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, at the end of the 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. An all-female federation, called the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association, has opened. It was a big league, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the list. I always thought she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of band and acting skills. Unfortunately, the LPWA closed in the early 90s, so it seemed natural that someone as talented as Mimi started an acting career, right? But surely there was an alternative to that kind of thing? This movie is really bad. As I progressed, I constantly compared it to an underrated film called "Survivor Quest", but this film lacks everything that made "Survivor Quest" enjoyable. <br /> <br /> When I started the band, I went to quickly go through the preview to get to the bottom of the band. At first, I was not very careful, but I realized that the premiere was a film starring Mimi Lesseos. "Oh," I thought, "here's another movie with Mimi to look for." But over the preview, I realized that it was a preview for ??. 'Beyond Fear!' You know that you have problems when the only preview at the beginning contains the movie you are about to watch! The plot of this thing is pretty standard. Lesseos plays an ex-boxer who feels guilty of hurting an opponent / friend. She focuses on her second career, which she shares with her friend Sammy: being a guide in nature. On this particular occasion, she gets a troop of three couples. Two of the couples are only there to take up space. You think that a couple, a Caucasian husband and a Korean woman, will be explored, because a problem appears between them halfway through the film, but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about the bears in the woods, which constantly scare. the Korean wife. . The joke is funny the first time you hear it, but it's certainly not the ninth time they've done it. The third couple is just painful to watch: it is composed of Mr. and Mrs. Page. They exchange insults, and Mr. Page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he is not playing cruel jokes on his corpulent wife - just like your typical American couple! Before the hike, Mr. Page spies on two stupid guys and their prostitute. One of them accidentally kills the prostitute and discovers that Mr. Page has recorded it. The danger begins as the two guys follow the group during their journey and we wait, wait, wait, and wait for them to finally do something. When they do, it's a fiasco. <br /> <br /> You can not blame the casting. They try as hard as possible with the equipment they have to work with. The principal responsible is the director Robert F. Lyons, who has to play again roles and stay out of the director's chair. Lyons starts and stops scenes in a case so sudden that you begin to think he was suffering from dyspepsia for the duration of the shoot. There is even an incompetent moment when a daytime scene with thugs is slipped between some night scenes. Then there is the sound department. The music and the background noise completely dominate the dialogue, so you have to move your ear right next to the speaker of your TV. Do not bang your head on the screen! It is not worth hearing the badly written lines. Speaking of mediocre writing, Lesseos gets some of the merit as a co-author. The few interesting developments between characters are often abandoned for rogue shots or bad jokes. Very early, Lesseos knocks a thug with a sharp knife, so you do not think they are in danger from the two stupid thugs. When the scammers are finally pulled by Lesseos in a well-played and long-term fight, all the players on our team have a lot of fun, even if one of them has been hit and bleeds everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy in the end. Everyone, except the poor souls who attended the movie, wanted the good old days of glory when Mimi was playing in the wrestling ring. Zantara's score: 4 out of 10
