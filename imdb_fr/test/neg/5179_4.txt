'Rise of the Footsoldier' ​​follows the ruthlessly cruel journey of gangster Carlton Leach and his associates through drugs, violence, sex, violence, guns, violence and I mentioned violence? <br /> <br /> The protagonist Carlton Leach (Ricci Harnett), member of the ICF (Inner City Firm); a group of football hooligans who have become professional gangsters, guides the public through the events that led to the 1995 Range Rover Killings, in which three gang members were the victims of particularly vicious professional blows. Leach's success as a doorman and talent to find friends strong enough to control unruly players in a local night club throws him into the company of notorious drug traffickers and gangsters, profiting from the rave scene and the drug culture of the 80s / 90s. <br /> Opening with brutally realistic images of dead men, the viewer is thirsty to understand what has happened, but is totally dissatisfied. The next two hours crisscross a series of introductions of countless characters. Each of these basically establishes another typical "hard man", showing him aggressions towards generally undeserving victims, before probably ending up in an even more cruel end. The lack of emotional understanding that the public is allowed to train for some of the characters (for example, a family member accused of having lost drugs) is quickly destroyed when they are killed in an anti-climate way or their scenario is left unresolved. The allusions to an intrigue introduced at the beginning are not conclusive enough and give a vague idea of ​​how the murders took place, because the events are set up without much reward for persevering in the confused confusion of previous events. <br /> <br /> This film was designed with a standard formula, for an audience that prefers violence and slang hard to a real story. "Rise of the Footsoldier" borrows too much from "Football Factory", leaving aside the good sides, showing no moral ramifications of the subculture of thugs or establishing empathy with the protagonist. The violence, although brilliantly filmed, seems excessive and improbable, because no one is long enough for the public to create an emotional bond. The implication that gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough, but doorkeepers with machetes who regularly commit blatant killings in public places repel the imagination of the most willing spectators. The public is puzzled as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that did not affect the final conclusion. The attempt at "gritty realism" is furthermore destroyed with a substance called "truth serum", which the Turkish Mafia uses to persuade honest people to answer their answers honestly. This is NOT the kind in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs, and makes the interrogation almost absurd. <br /> <br /> Violent scenes (before becoming repetitive) sustain tension, linked to fast bursts of color or at the end of a reel of film. Perfectly choreographed fights, combined with compulsory but effective hand-held camera work, save the film, but unfortunately the plot (or lack thereof) limits it to a demographic niche. <br /> <br /> In essence, the events of this film is based on are not properly represented, and a sufficiently sequential scenario is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and a non-original plot. This film has its place on the market, but if you like the head with your brutality, it does not suit you. <br /> <br /> http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/
