Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humor and I personally think he is an excellent actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example). <br /> <br /> However, this movie is supposed to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so know immediately that if you do not find his funny comedy style, you'll sit in the pebble throughout the film, because he has NOTHING to recommend it. <br /> <br /> Even if you like it. Carrey's comedy, I'm not sure you'll find this movie fun. I went to see him on a Saturday night at 10:30 pm and the audience was really ready to laugh. They laughed in the caravans, which was not particularly funny, but when it came to the film, a stone silence. I think this has generated about five sincere laughs. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that he does not know what he wants to be. He can not decide, either for slapstick or seriousness. If it was stupid from start to finish, it could be forgiven, but (I guess), it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie is the ups, and there was a lot of potential here. But these only started at about mid-term and remained largely underdeveloped. During this time, you have to sit down for the first 40 minutes while the couple's life is getting worse. <br /> <br /> Four separate groups came out of this movie while I was there and if my roommate did not ask me away from home (his girlfriend just returned from a month of vacation!), I would have done the same. And during my 25 years of cinema, I had done it only once before.
