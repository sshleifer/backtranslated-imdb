I tried. I really, really tried to think of something that deserves to be rated higher than two. It's not that I do not "understand" - I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is that the film is childish in its construction, slow and painfully incoherent. <br /> <br /> I guess if you're from Alfred Hitchcock's school of thought, "Do not tell them, show them" then you could try to enjoy this film, but you'd be in a hurry. <br /> <br /> First, The Terrorizers tries to follow the current in the manner of Jean-Luc Godard and fails in this respect. Edward Yang seems to understand the basics of the technique, but he is very poorly qualified. (Maybe he will improve with age, I do not know because I have not tried other Yang movies yet.) The fact is that he uses a lack of "show, do not say "which really only serves to interrupt the parade. Of the history. Of course, it gets striking images, but they do not bring the story closer and do not make it better. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main concept of stream-of-consciousness and "show, not to say" is that, with good images, good drama, repetition and a close correlation, the viewer will be able to make his own deductions; This does not mean that it will be the right inferences, but these can be changed as the story progresses, and each director must strive for this type of interaction with the audience. In this, Edward Yang disappoints deeply. The spectator is constantly on the periphery. There is no reason to be involved, no reason to consider the characters or their motives, no reason to get involved emotionally, and really no reason to stay alert. <br /> <br /> Finally, Yang gets lost in the story he wants to tell, not the story that the film itself tells. His art moves in one direction, but like a big dog that he can not control, he constantly pulls forward, trying to bring him back to the course he wants, not the one he naturally follows. The most glaring example is the end. The end really should have happened at the moment of the husband's revelation. The end of the book on which the film focuses (and by extension a possible end for the film) has already been announced. If Yang had chosen to finish at that time, he would have had a much more powerful piece, leaving the observer in suspense - does the story unfold as the book says or the "real world" of Yang is it different? Asking the viewer to think about it is the type of audience interaction that Yang painfully needs. Instead, he continues to tell the story he wants to tell, tending the natural conclusion for the sake of what? To dwell on a main character - we did not need to know more about her superficially, and Yang would not feel the need to tell us if he had not turned her into a polish instead of bothering her to make her a more engaging and profound character to begin with. <br /> <br /> Why else is Yang prolonging and torturing his film? To learn more about these "visually striking images". The film really suffers. He wants to finish, he has a conclusion that seems natural and leaves the viewer unstable, but instead, Yang continues. Instead, Yang builds a complex ending that drives the viewer, asking him to constantly ask "so what?" The first ending, the one that Yang ignored, was fine. The second end, well, my thought was "so what, do not we care?", Because it's not like he's introducing something that has not already been presented in the storyline ... but the last ending? It was really a waste of time. Not only did the "real" denouement disengage me, but I also felt it was an affront to what the story might have been. Yang sacrificed a good story for the nuanced conclusion of melancholy and black melody on which he insisted from the beginning. <br /> <br /> My last problem with the film has nothing to do with the film itself, but rather its post-production. The subbing (if you see the subbed) is horrible. Long sentences last one or two seconds, while short ones last much longer. In addition, as Yang changes images quickly, subtitles are removed from the screen. This is one of the rare cases where subtitles should be able to remain on the screen even when the image has changed, because in any case dialogues are rare.
