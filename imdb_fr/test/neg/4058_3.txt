"Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a very bad rehearsal to make a sequel in a single year. The first movie was cute, cuddly and charming. The idea of ​​a dog playing in a basketball team is quite common, but he managed to do enough stunts to save the concept. Even human history had an explanation. Josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he's sad. And the audience also becomes emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Let's move on to the ill-done sequel. It's terrible. This is the worst kind of bad result, the one that changes good ideas and turns them into bad ones. The kind that changes the main plot in a way, this time, the K-9 plays football instead of basketball. Do not waste time on the subject, trust a doubt, enter the open mind that you have with a film like this, there is no positive thought when it's is doing a bad job. In the following, Kevin Zegers plays the role of Josh, who is in eighth grade. He lives with his mother and little sister in a suburb of Seattle. In the first film, human history involved the loss of his father in a plane crash, which the public can understand, but most people know what it's like to lose a loved one. <br /> <br /> In this film, the emotional plot is a bit more complicated. Josh's mother goes out again. He and Buddy, his dog who can play basketball, do not like it at all. Why? If I were in his place, I would love to have another parent in my life, especially one so beautiful. The man's name is Patrick Sullivan and Josh's mother, Jackie, who met him became a local vet for Buddy. <br /> <br /> The story of the animal is too simple. Josh is influenced by his best friend to try for the school's football team, the Timber Wolves. The team itself looks like some of the funniest videos in America, it can even catch a balloon without stumbling or collapsing into one another. So when Bud shows up one day, he proves that he can play as a receiver for them and that he is undoubtedly the best player on the team. <br /> <br /> Buddy is extremely cute in his football costume. Oh, just melt the heart. The dog is also the best in this movie. Too bad he did not do enough stunts to draw attention to the fact that no one asks any question about a dog playing on a football team at school. <br /> <br /> There is a very bad under-plot on Russian circus workers who like to steal extraordinary animals, of course, they try to catch Buddy. But their dark spirits are ruled by animals and end up doing what looks like a "Home Alone" scenario for them. <br /> <br /> "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is much more awkward than the first one. The Russian kidnappers add a bunch of lame slapstick that, I must admit, made me laugh, at the stupidity of it all. There are way too many sequences that describe a dumpling nature and too few scenes describing the real reason people will see this movie: see a dog playing football. <br /> <br /> The performances were also quite annoying. I liked the presentations of Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo, but the overall rating in acting would be equivalent to a D +. Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic. <br /> <br /> There have been some hilarious moments near the end by some football announcers, but it's not even worth mentioning. Will children enjoy this movie? Perhaps, but even they will get bored when the heart feels that the discussions become too long and too deep. They will certainly complain that the dog has not spent enough time on the screen and is reluctant to the rapid evolution of the scenario, and protests against the boring performance. I suppose. <br /> <br /> I guess they will think that the dog is adorable.
