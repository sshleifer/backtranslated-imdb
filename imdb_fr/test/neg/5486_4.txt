I have already seen a lot of films by Pedro Almodóvar, but that would be the most disappointing one. This film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story never interested me. Many regulars of Almodóvar appear in this film. This is not a lack of talent on the screen, but this film seemed more serious than his other films. If there was a comic side in this film, I certainly could not find it, and it made a surprisingly weak movie.
