Disappointing burglary film indeed, I was actually expecting the film and the mouse to be pretty cool throughout the movie and there are very few, but it was really stupid. And basically, it showed all the good scenes of the trailer. In fact, if you saw the trailer, you simply saw the film as a whole, because it is quite predictable. The plot concerns a few workers in armored truck companies who are trying to steal the $ 42 million they are supposed to carry, until one of the members becomes aware. I thought the film would be better with its well-known actors, but I was wrong. I mean, it's not necessarily a bad film, but it was not so good or had no depth. It's definitely a rental at best, but it's definitely not worth seeing in theaters. diversion <br /> <br /> 4.8 / 10
