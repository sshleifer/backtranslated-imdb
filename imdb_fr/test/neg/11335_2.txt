This film may have the worst title for a short film ever dreamed. A bit appropriate, given the current content of fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> I can not do without any of the "Shemp A.D." but I'm going to admit that Lore and Moe and a few comedians offered us some comedies in some of the new sequences (and congratulations to these guys for trying to give it all, given the position they were forced into < br /> <br /> Another positive point to this last and the last debacle of the AD "The commotion on the ocean" is the decisive lack of time spent on the screen for Joe Palma and the back of His head, no attempt to make him talk or to beat his arms like a chicken (see "Hot Stuff") may not be worth another point. <br /> <br /> 2/10
