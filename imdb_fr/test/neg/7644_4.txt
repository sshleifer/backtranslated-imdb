SILVER CITY (2+ out of 5 stars) As a big fan of John Sayles' work for many years, I am reassured to say that this is the worst film he has ever done. That said, the movie is not really * terrible * ... but very devoid of inspiration. Sayles incorporates familiar elements from his previous films (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, selling ideals of youth), but fails to bring them together in a new or meaningful way. Even the dialogue (usually Sayles's highlight) is disappointing this time around. It sounds cliché and imposed in almost every scene. The film looks and looks like episodes of a television series that has not gone beyond its third episode. There are tons of big stars on hand ... and they do their best to bring their wicks to life ... but the material just is not there. During the filming of a campaign spot, a governor (a mediocre and obvious mediocre George W Bush) is fishing a corpse in a lake. An investigator is hired to try to warn the people who deliberately put this in place to discredit the candidate ... but he quickly discovers that there are deeper and darker secrets (and more clichés). Sayles has done much better in the past with similar themed movies ("Lone Star", "Matewan", "The Return of Seven Secaucus", "Men With Guns"). It's unfortunate that he went to the well once too many times and had contaminated water. A good sentence, pronounced by Richard Dreyfuss: "Danny, you're a loser, this has already been established without any doubt, so just try to be good, okay?"
