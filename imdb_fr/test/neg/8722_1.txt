What can I say? After reading Herbert's books and enjoying the Lynch film version, I was extremely disappointed. I felt that I was watching a rejected version of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like the remains of a special Star Wars TV show! I felt that the game was a bit amateurish by most. The costumes were screaming and over, which gave him a Flash Gordon pulp sensation from the 60's. The worms! They are supposed to be sand worms and yet they seemed to be "big stalagtites" with a pointed mouth. The effects in general were rather second-rate. I will not even talk about the shady "Navigator" effect. <br /> <br /> This so-called "Frank Herbert Dune" was not even true to his books! It should have been called "Frank Herbert's Dune - for dummies". The key elements of the plot have been left out, the names have been changed and the entire "feel" of the story has been "sanitized". I did not even recognize the Harkonnens! In fact, most of the characters do not appear as the descriptions Herbert had described. I'm getting angry just remembering what tragedy it was. I'm glad I can not support the second installment ....
