I saw this movie and I was bored! I'm a fan of Peanuts, but I do not understand why Charles Schultz let this disaster happen! Spoilers to come. <br /> <br /> I can not believe Snoopy would let his friends sleep on the floor in a dangerous situation and go out to a bar to get some cold unattended! The story was completely absurd, even for comic characters. It takes them too long to arrive in France, and once in France, I had the impression that the writer (I still can not believe it was Schultz) did not know what to do once there. <br /> <br /> The best way to make peanuts is to make 30-minute episodes and not 80-minute movies. <br /> <br /> Go home, Charlie Brown, you'll be at your best. <br /> <br />
