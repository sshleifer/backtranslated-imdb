Anyone who watched "Alien vs. Predator" had to know that the conventions of the "Quadrilogie Alien" were not exactly adapted to the film. Among some of the unusual elements, the rapid growth of extraterrestrials in just minutes, extraterrestrials with extremely long tail, etc. However, the idea of ​​predatory species giving impetus to the building of the city and temple to create a warrior hunt would seem to be such attractive warriors that I could not resist. <br /> <br /> I had hoped that the end of the film would not be the momentum of this sequel, and unfortunately I was wrong. For those who have forgotten how the first film ended, the deceased Predator blew up an alien reminding him of the features of the two species. "<br /> <br /> For this movie, I'm just going to review the list of" good "and" bad "traits. <br /> <br /> The good: Many beautiful people, especially the men. <br /> <br /> The Bad: Many sumptuous characters are sucked by both the Predator / Alien mutant and the Predator. <br /> <br /> The Good: An interesting idea of ​​the Predator planet. <br /> <br /> The bad: An incoherent scale of a city.It is a small city without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated sewer system (read: big city) and homeless Is it a small town or a city? The police are composed of a sheriff and three deputies, that's how I counted. <br /> <br /> The good: Uh .. . <br /> <br /> The bad: Why are these extraterrestrial / mutant predators growing so fast Within five minutes, they seem to be reaching their maximum size.I mean, go ... what are these things. .. Chia Pet Aliens And while we are on this subject, why does an Alien in the body of a predator mutate, but not an Alien in a human body? Does this make sense? <br /> <br /> The good: We still think about it ... <br /> <br /> The bad: Why would a single predator come? And why is he pouring acid on all the remains of "Aliens", but decides to assassinate a cute deputy, and then skinning and hanging upside down. I mean, too bad to be incognito! <br /> <br /> The good: Ah ... I'm stuck. I guess there are a lot of loud sounds! <br /> <br /> The Bad: How do these extraterrestrial / mutated predators procreate? Apparently, they find a pregnant woman and, in a kiss-like movement, they lay several products in the woman's body. Yeah, just what you'd like to see, huh? Pregnant women having their bodies explode into alien mutants - as if the previous method was not coarse enough !!! I mean, there is not even an extraterrestrial queen. <br /> <br /> The Good: Did I say that the guys in this movie are gorgeous? <br /> <br /> The Bad Side of the War: When a Nuclear Engine Destroys Buildings, How Does a Helicopter Survive the Explosion? And how difficult is it for one of the passengers to mockingly reprimand the pilot "I told you not to crush you!" I mean, given the nuclear fallout, when he wakes up in the morning, he will not have any hair !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I think you're getting the message. Alien / Predator mutated through the body of the dead predator, grows within minutes, kills all the Predators and manages to get crushed on the ground. Other extraterrestrial / mutant predators are created, while a lousy predator comes to Earth to destroy this new mutant species. Predator kills humans. Mutant Alien / Predators kills humans. Humans kill humans. Sucks to be a human in this movie, huh? <br /> <br /> If you're impressed by a lot of fringes and bumps, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked the First, I suggest you skip this sequel.
