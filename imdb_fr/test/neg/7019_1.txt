For starters, I really like Lucy. His television show still makes me laugh. She was one of the greatest comedians who ever lived with Chaplin and Keaton. But his performance in this film is disappointing. She was too old and the gauze filters on the lens make her look like a refugee from the London fog. She could not sing and her voice was so frog that she was humming through all the songs. His dance days were long in the past. Just because you are a fan of Lucy, do not neglect this sad and misleading representation and sing her praises. I prefer to remember Lucy in her wonderful TV series (I Love Lucy) and draw the curtain of charity on the terrible mess of a movie called "Mame".
