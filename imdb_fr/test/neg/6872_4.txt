A jealous husband holds a car dealer hostage while Williams weighs on the viewer with his worn Mork shtick at every turn. Yawning. <br /> <br /> Grist channel channel. An unusually bad scenario, coupled with an unconvincing scenario from Robin Williams, who is a talkative and talkative philosopher-driven car salesman, caught in a crisis at work as a hostage. The laughs are not there, the message or the mores are all wrong, and the film can never decide if it's a comedy or a drama. Very good casting all acting badly enough. When a movie ages so quickly, you feel bad. Not much to say except maybe, to avoid at all costs. The mediocre textbook movies like this one are actually more tedious and less pleasant than the bombs.
