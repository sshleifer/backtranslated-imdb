The film begins as we see a sequence of tremendous drought in the 1930s in America. Then a short story is told about a scary looking farmer, Elija, who made a deal with Satan to get a good harvest. Elija hired young men to work in her garden, killed them and used them as scarecrows. He also fed the soil with their blood. Some time after two cops come to visit him. One of them is shot by Elija, another kills the farmer himself ... After that, the current day is displayed, and a guy named Sean learns that he has an old farm inheritance. He decides to go with friends to see what happens. Sean was unaware that the next night would be the "night of recovery" ..... <br /> <br /> As for me, this movie had a good story for a horror movie, but its limited budget and its effects mediocre specials ruined everything. he. "Dark Harvest" is a perfect example of making lazy movies. For example, we see a scarecrow (an ordinary guy wearing a funny and cheap mask) chasing a girl. When he raises his hand, we see normal human skin under his glove, instead of rotten flesh. The gore is not very impressive too. There are some unpleasant murders committed by our "charming" scarecrows but everything is very cheap and unrealistic. Surprisingly, the acting is a little OK in this film, or I would say it's credible. Some nude scenes are also shown to fans (even a lesbian scene), but these scenes do not save it. <br /> <br /> Verdict: good music, good story, solid acting. But dreadful effects, cheap gore holes and cheap plot slow down this movie. Not really recommended.
