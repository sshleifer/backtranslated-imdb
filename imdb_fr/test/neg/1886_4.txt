Okay - the title "Frankenstein's House" was referring to a line from Frankenstein's original film. When they follow with a film called "House of Dracula", which makes no sense, you know that it starts to turn into franchise. <br /> <br /> Without explanation, Dracula is back, and he calls himself Baron Latos. He infiltrates Dr. Edelmann's home, claiming he is seeking a cure for his vampirism. Edelmann has a hunchbacked nurse who assists him (what about hunchbacked assistants in these movies?), But what really interests Dracula is his other, more handsome assistant. At this point, Larry "Wolf Man" Talbot returns (again, no explanation provided) and is just looking for the same doctor to heal his lycanthropy. And then, he accidentally falls into a cave in which plants can be grown to help him, which also contains the monster Frankenstein. God, when will it end ... of course, the other Universal monster suites were ridiculous, but that's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> First the good things. There are very good settings and the effects of vampire bats are slightly better than usual. Some of the other effects are very good too. John Carradine is not bad as Dracula once you get used to it, but still nothing as brilliant as Lugosi was. In my opinion, Onslow Stevens plays a much better vampire in this movie, although he has exactly the opposite problem to Carradine: all the creeps and no class. None of the performances are so good, but it's more because of the atrocious scenario than anything else - women's roles are particularly poorly written. But stupid as it is, it's still pretty entertaining for most. The best thing about this is its length. <br /> <br /> Now, the bad things ... it's not scary, it's badly written and it does not work. I was hoping the three monsters would start some sort of supernatural struggle for power, but that did not happen. The focus is almost entirely on Dracula, which is not particularly well described. On the other hand, this is the only movie in which Dracula infects another man, but this is done by blood transfusion rather than by bite, Universal always being uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtext. Larry Talbot is as decent as the werewolf, but he plays a relatively small role. Once again, Frankenstein's monster's share is reduced to the anti-climatic closing moments. For God's sake, Glenn Strange was fantastic as a creature! Why not give him more time on the screen? It is unfortunate that the series ends on this note (not to mention the classic comedy "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"). In the end, he simply fainted in the sun and died, much like Dracula himself.
