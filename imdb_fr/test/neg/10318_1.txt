I do not know how this DVD came into my collection - my wife suggested it was one of those "3 for £ 20" offers in a big box store. The thing is not worth 66p, not to mention £ 6.66! Having invested a lot in this software, I felt compelled to look at it until the end, just to make sure the problem was so serious throughout the process - and it was. <br /> <br /> The line was impenetrable (I still did not understand what was happening despite the summary), the work of the camera was disjointed and hopeless, the acting was wooden (not helped by the dialogue). <br /> <br /> In fact, there was no redemptive characteristic - no, not even the lovely Sandra Bullock, whose brilliant career was probably sold. She should ask her agent to buy all the rights and bury her as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Last amusing example of the director's incapacity, there was a scene where the young principal converses with that of his father, former acolyte of the army while driving. It was the clearest dialogue of the film - no motor noise! I can not wait for the engine damping technology to cross the pond to reach British cars!
