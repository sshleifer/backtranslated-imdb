8 days no script that's what the DVD tells you is how the movie was made. This is a blurry video that is sometimes used wisely, but it is actually partially naked women sitting in a room for most of the time. It's very well played and it helps a lot. But the killer only appears once in a while and the girls / women stay seated and do not try to escape or do anything that is too interesting. This is why everything remains frozen after about 20 minutes. Would have been a good short film maybe even powerful. Even for eight days, they do very little. Why? Because they did not have a script. How many movies have been made without scripts. Not too much. I wonder why it is? How many great movies have been made from bad scripts. Not too much. Why is that? In working against this major problem, management is trying and doing interesting things but with essentially nothing. The topless girls, filmed in dark and grainy video, watch for a while, but not for a short length but too long. The actors still deserve praise, if only there was a scenario. <br /> <br /> The quality of the video, or lack thereof, is really mediocre, they try to use it wisely and, sometimes, some shots give the impression of coming Miami Vice, the recent movie that is. But this is not meant to compliment Miami Vice or this failed business.
