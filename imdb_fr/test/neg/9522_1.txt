I'm a little scared by some of these critics praising A.K.A. Not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of inside information that you can certainly only find by reading the press book from one end to the other. Do not tell me that the director writes his own criticism, it would be too sad to contemplate. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I'm one of those who hated the movie and was surprised by its apologetic character. amateurism. Excellent idea, a pity for the execution. And it was very disconcerting to see so many good actors (as well as very bad, including the lead lead), apparently thinking that they appeared in a series of very different films. <br /> <br /> I wish that ALIAS had been bold, innovative or just interesting. Unfortunately, it was like watching an unintentional hysterical home video with artistic aspirations. A missed opportunity.
