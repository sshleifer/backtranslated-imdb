First, it has nothing to do with the much better Kung Fu weapons with Gordon Liu. I mention this because my Kung Fu Theater Gift DVD has a totally misleading photo on the cover, a false plot on the back and continues (without knowing why) The Young Hero starring Hwang Jang Lee. Aside from an introduction to the story of the 18 weapons told by a monk to children at the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is looking for, the weapons do not really appear and the fights are all boxing . The hero is Lee Shao Hwa whom I have never heard of before, nor any of the other actors. The film mentions another director, Wu Yuen Ling, as well as one of the IMDb lists. The other actors are Wang Fu Quen, San Wang Wing, Fei Fei Chen, Wang San Ki, Suen King Kai and Hwa Yue Suen who seem to have sunk without a trace after this film. The fights are reasonable and frequent but not great and the "star" does not have much charisma. The turn at the end is just stupid and the movie seems to end abruptly as if they were bored. The landscape and training sequences in the river are a little different from normal. Unfortunately, the pretty sister does not drown the very irritating (but acrobatic) boy.
