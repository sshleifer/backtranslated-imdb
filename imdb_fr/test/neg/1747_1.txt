Although the game was excellent, I spent the whole movie waiting for the bad boy who was causing so much grief to so many characters and getting his ultimate nemesis. Instead, everyone has suffered except him and he gets the job of the husband whose wife kills him by fleeing his friends, wins the girl to whom he gave an overdose and tried to rape. Even his friend gives money to his father, but the butterfly effect does not come back to his cause. <br /> <br /> It's a very dark film, because each person touched suffers an endless depression. None of the usual relief routes seem to be effective and the only thing the authorities seem to do is to distribute amounts of anti-stress pills. <br /> <br /> If this is normal in Finland, I will never go back in case I am touched by such an amoral butterfly and find myself as destroyed as the characters in this film.
