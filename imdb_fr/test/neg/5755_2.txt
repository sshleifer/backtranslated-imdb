Return to Frogtown was a difficult film to retrace. Well, I accomplished that mission and she stayed on the shelf for a long time. I wish it stayed that way! First, Sam Hell is of course not Roddy Piper. He is replaced by a guy with a big face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very sweet for the game! Sam Hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome. Here he is captured THREE times! What kind of hero is this ?! Spangle is also replaced here by another actress. Why did not we have different characters here? It was stupid! Lou Ferrigno plays in this film and he is not even the hero. Common sense says that Lou is the hero of the movie! Bad effects, bad acting and just a forgettable film. It's funny how they take pictures of Ninja Turtles 2 with all the concert scene of this movie. At least Ninja Turtles 2 was funny and not bad as a movie! I really wanted to love Return to Frogtown, but I collapsed when the fight scenes started. This film gives Turtles 3 a golden aspect! Avoid that or you'll be the one to sing "a TV dinner with a greener, greener talking turtle!"
