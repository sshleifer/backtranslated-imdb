THE AFFAIR is a very bad 1970s TV movie starring Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood at the time, hesitant lovers. She has polio and leads a reclusive life as a writer of pop songs. She is an ambitious lawyer, very sociable and completely in love with her. Their business, as it is, is doomed from the beginning, and she knows it, but she accepts it anyway. Two things to watch out for if you're trapped watching this: Jane's hairstyle Jane from Wood, who is never disheveled, no matter what type, and a melody she sings at the beginning of this awful movie. She sings it for four, five or six minutes. So you know it's a classic padding between ads. It's also one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman who plays Wood's voice should have been filmed and sheltered from her misery. Also, keep an eye on all the tops and dresses of the peasants. In comparison, Wagner looks relatively timeless, with short cut hair and a series of classic suits.
