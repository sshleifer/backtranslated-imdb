I really like Harrison Ford, so I rented this movie and I'm disappointed minute after minute. Mr. Ford seemed to be walking in very hot water looking for a place to urinate. His co-star was very good and had the best lines. The story intrigues me but the mistake - BIG MISTAKE -, everyone is identified by his driver's license or his passport before boarding an American commercial plane, left many questions of conspiracy in my mind . <br /> <br /> I could have cared less about these people. In fact, the sub-plot of the internal affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed while flying in first class for Miami. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the director, Sydney Pollack, who gave us the classic Tootsie. and other movies. This one is a waste of time and energy.
