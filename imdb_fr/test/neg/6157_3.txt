The story and the characters REALLY needed work. The idea of ​​the world is rather nice, but no one has bothered to develop it, either through exposure or intrigue. Despite the cheese notes at the beginning of the film, it makes sense not to use any exposure because no one is new to this world. And yet, when Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Peck) go astray and get lost, and get introduced to the wind worshipers and the rich, fat, lazy and rich people of the museum, real idea of ​​who these are people, or why we should be interested in one of them. Smart movies have the means to develop that simply by bringing characters to life around the world. Simple things, like ordering a drink in a bar or talking about something in the past, these are the kinds of things that make the film world unforgettable, not endless plans of crappy planes and cheap CG effects. of someone trying to make curls. in an ultralight. <br /> <br /> If that's too much of a problem, here's a tip: reduce locations. If everything becomes disjointed because you stop too often, stay in one place for a while and let the characters speak a little. All the unnecessary shit should be removed. Get rid of the whole scene of wind worshipers. Get rid of stifling museum people. Get rid of all those shitty crap shit, unless you make the wind relevant to the story. Have the whole thing put in a big plane, or something. Just make people talk about something that is important to us. <br /> <br /> Hi, get rid of Bill Paxton. Have the film center around the character of Tasker and his relationship with the robot, Byron. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the biggest problem of the film is that we do not care about anyone, because no one takes the time to either explain their motivations or dive into their characters. We do not like Matt (well, because he is played by Bill Paxton, among others). It's a scoundrel who does not redeem himself enough, except to let go the Android, Byron. And this action makes even less sense than most others because of three key points: <br /> <br /> 1. Byron is a murderer. 2. Byron is indestructible. 3. Byron can leave whenever he wants. <br /> <br /> We try to love Byron, because there is a kind of pathos, but he is largely underdeveloped. All we have left is a robot with a glassy and robotic eye, who acts is subjugated and wooden for a moment, and almost wacky to the other. We do not know why or how he develops his emotions, but we know for a fact that he murdered someone. We do not know why he murdered anyone, nor the circumstances of this macabre event, because he is not developed. We can not have pity on him if we do not know the story. All we know is that he kills people. And he likes Bill Paxton. <br /> <br /> We do not hate Tasker enough (partly because he is portrayed by the brave Mark Hamill), because although rude and unforgiving, he does not do anything extraordinary for his character - an agent of post-apocalyptic peace. Of course, he kills Montclaire (Robbie Coltrane) and his team, but they are drug dealers who are about to grow poppies for heroin. And they shoot him first. He does not kill those who do not interfere or who do not try to hurt him physically first. This goes equally well for the final confrontation in the museum. He uses a bit of police brutality against a lazy dilettante (F. Murray Abraham is lost in this role), and everyone shoots him a revolver. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand what he's getting from Belitski (Kitty Aldridge), Tasker's partner. After only 10 minutes accumulated with Matt, she is ready to change sides, despite her shouts of loyalty and despite the fact that Matt speaks to him unceremoniously and does not hit her. If it's love, I'll choose to hate any day. <br /> <br /> Really. The character of Paxton is about as endearing as Simon in "True Lies" or Pvt. Hudson from "Aliens". Does anyone fall for him in these movies? No why? Because he is a strong fool and a loser. Why put him at the helm of this film?
