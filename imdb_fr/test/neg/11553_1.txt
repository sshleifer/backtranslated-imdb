It is inconceivable to me that EVERYONE could enjoy or laugh at this film. I would say it's the worst film I've seen in years and I see a lot. I may have forgotten college? It is also very difficult to believe that it is the same Jeff Daniels who made such a brilliant performance of George Washington in The Crossing. It looks like since Dumber, he entered the tank. Can you believe that he even wrote and realized this junk?
