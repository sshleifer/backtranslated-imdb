I have not been in the art theater for a long time and I went to see Cold Showers because he had such good reviews in the newspapers. <br /> <br /> The thing is with this movie, is that it has no head or tail, but just a section in time on the life of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> When that started, I already knew it would be a long session, but sometimes things can get better, in this case not. There is no real development of the character or interconnection between the players. You start in the middle of a situation, there is suddenly a girlfriend, then a guy with whom he must be friends to meet his sporting ambitions, but the way they are together is quite strange, because are " just assembled, "it seems. <br /> <br /> And all of a sudden, they have sex, at least one that you can see. The feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is barely noticeable and all I could think about during the movie was "when will they have sex again?" And when you think about it, it's really crazy. Because it basically means that there is nothing worth watching, but three teenagers go there and that, for me at least, makes it a very shitty movie, avoid it and save your money ( my 7,50 â‚¬ is wasted), there are better artistic films than this one. <br /> <br /> I give three stars for the acting performance, one each.
