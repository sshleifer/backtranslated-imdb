Although this film had some scary moments (great use of music and film angles to create suspense), it is obvious that the director Ethan Wiley and the screenwriter Ellary Eddy have not wasted time searching for their subject ; which also makes me question their claim that the scenes of exorcism were supervised by a true Catholic bishop. <br /> <br /> Among the many inconsistencies: <br /> <br /> * Jacob, the Roman Catholic priest, when we meet him outside the church, wears an academic dress on his employees office rather than his typical dawn, his chasuble or his surplice. Protestant ministers usually wear academic attire in liturgical denominations, not Catholic priests. <br /> <br /> * Jacob, the priest, quotes obscure and disturbing writings on the angels taking up arms. He attributes this to St. Paul. This verse does not come from the writings of St. Paul nor in the Bible. I can not even find it in the Gnostic writings. <br /> <br /> * Jacob tells his bishop that he does not believe in demonic possession and rejects the request to study exorcism, but does a total of 180 (later the same day?) a few minutes after talking to the possessed Isabelle. Of course, it's possible. but a little unrealistic. See Father Damien as a priest / psychologist in THE THE EXORCIST for a more realistic portrait of the skeptic who has become a believer. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former priest who became a farmer, is the first to attempt an exorcism on Isabelle. He quotes writings, and she quotes back. He says, "I see you know Psalm 65" - she corrects it "it's Psalm 67" - they're both wrong. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former priest who has just finished an exorcism - makes the sign of the cross, calls the name of Christ, applies holy water, etc. - told Jacob that he did not believe in the church and he does not believe in God. (Maybe he's just been in conflict?) Jacob sends him to wear homemade clothes and make another one anyway. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former priest of ROMAN CATHOLIC, retreats (in the Eastern Orthodox way). As a Hispanic Roman Catholic who used to be a priest, he should have crossed his forehead against the sternum, from left to right of the chest. <br /> <br /> I had to read the little stories aside to get the idea that Satan was playing with the whole family, not just Isabelle; but even at the end, it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in his head or if all that was a demonic trick (with the exception of the sheriff - it's pretty clear that he was guilty). <br /> <br /> On the positive side: Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion, she was the best part of the whole movie and I liked the plot plot with Claire. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or to be a travesty. <br /> <br /> Listening to the current commentary with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I'm inclined to believe it was a joke.
