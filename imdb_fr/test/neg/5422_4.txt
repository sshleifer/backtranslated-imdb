I bought this film for a few dollars at a "Liquidation Warehouse Sale" one day when I'm just watching. The cover looked pretty good, (in color), but the film is in black and white, (I wish they did not try to trap us with colorful covers on black-and-white movies, but is something to watch for!). <Br/> <br /> When I looked at it, I was pleasantly surprised. It turned out to be better than expected. I was disappointed that it was a black-and-white film, but the effects are pretty good, certainly better than, say, "Invaders from Mars" which has zero effects, and it's good to see John Banner in something other than Hogan's Heroes. <BR/> <br /> Overall, this film is not so bad for a grade B, and is certainly worth the two dollars from a nostalgic point of view. It's not my favorite science fiction, but it's not my worst either. Its good.
