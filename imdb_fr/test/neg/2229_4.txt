A few of my fellow writers have covered the plot elements of this film, so I will stick to a few remarks about the armband ... <br /> <br /> 1. It's fun - but not for the reasons you would think. It's nerdy, but we can still watch it. <br /> <br /> 2. Tamra, Daniel's love interest must be about thirty years old. The Christian whom Dan ignores is much more cute. <br /> <br /> 3. Muriel stole her shirt from Mr. Spock. Also, if my guardian angel is like Muriel, I'll have to make a transfer request. <br /> <br /> 4. Okay ... so apparently ... Dan is responsible for his parents' divorce! What kind of horrible guilt trip is this ?! Muriel says it was Dan's prayers that kept her parents together. I just thought it was absolutely ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as much as I want but the only way to stay together is to decide if they want to. <br /> <br /> 5. I will echo the atheist's comments on how this film describes non-Christians. Apparently, they are all neglected criminals. <br /> <br /> 6. For something positive - David White is a decent actor. It gives a little credibility to the film, even if it is the only one. He's holding pretty much everything together.
