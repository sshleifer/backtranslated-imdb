I completely forgot that I had seen it in a few days, which is quite revealing in itself. The umpteenth version of the mystery of Gaston's locked door country house "The Phantom of the Opera", I had heard it was an engaging and witty update. Thus, it appears from the sequence of sympathetic title and some retouching in the opening scene, but the film stops very quickly and becomes vaguely tedious and totally unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> As a mystery, the main problem is that it is fundamentally insoluble for the public: like the worst Agatha Christies, it depends on the character that appears in the final act with a wealth of information which we had not been aware of. As a film, be it a comedy or a thriller, the crucial problem is that characterization is almost non-existent. With the exception of the murderer, everyone is a face value version of the typical suspects of the typical story of a murder in a country house: journalist, heiress threatened, fiancee suspect, father of a scientist at the mindless (Michel Lonsdale, very poor), etc. depth and little interest, and performance that is often too mature or misjudged does not help. Frankly, you do not care about anyone, so there is no danger or suspense. Only Claude Rich and, in the last film, Pierre Arditi, have something to work on, and it is only in the last film that the film approaches a feeling of resonance too fleeting to be really effective. <br /> <br /> For the rest, we have an endless exhibition and two or three invisible works for the comic strip (a promising film with a photographer trapped in a grandfather clock is too badly thought out for to be profitable), with Dennis Podalydes reduced to Irving the Explainer for the last third of the image. I do not really like country house movies or Agatha Christie style whodunits, so those who think it might say it's a lot uglier, but I thought it was a bad show. As Rich says when the mystery is revealed, "it's more of a disappointment."
