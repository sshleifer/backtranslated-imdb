"Chupacabra Terror" is saved from a "1" by the presence of the beautiful Canadian Chelan Simmons in the role of heroin. She is a pleasure to watch, from the front, from the back and from the sides. Otherwise, here's what you have here, it's your standard monster movie, John Rhys-Davies plays the role of the captain of the ship on which the monster is transported and plays the role of a low-budget ship, and the unconscious monster is simply a man in a suit. He commits about 100 fools. Bloody murders, at least, so the number of corpses in this one is rather impressive. Formula for the least. I like the moment when Simmons tells someone in a disturbing way what chupacabra is: goat eater! Oooohhh ... scary!
