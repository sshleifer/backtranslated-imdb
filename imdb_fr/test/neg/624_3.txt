I do not understand why many people seem to hate this. <br /> <br /> This film brings together many overlapping scenes from the historical and biblical epics of the 1950s, using sets, props and costumes similar to those seen in other films. Here, however, the story attempts to go through the entire history of man, with a full account of the human race being tried, with a verdict of guilty stating that H bombs will fire around the world. The prosecutor is the devil, played with devilish joy by Vincent Price. OK, so it's a little hokey to call the defender "The Spirit of All Men", but I think this is one of the things that gives this movie a sense of vintage charm. The Spririt of Man is played very well by Ronald Coleman in his latest film. It is also the last film in which Groucho, Harpo and Chico Marx all appear, but not together. Groucho plays Peiter Minuet buying Manhattan from the Indians, in a scene played only for campy humor. Chico is not funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat and Harpo, we are told, is supposed to be Isaac Newton, discovering gravity. However, most other representations are well done. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the trial would apparently take place in space, described as a region of clouds and blue. There is something called "The Great Clock of Outer Space" which at midnight can signal the end of the world. <br /> <br /> But the heart of the film is dealing with the problems of weapons of mass destruction and the eternal question of whether man is fundamentally good or fundamentally bad; and the pose in what I think is an interesting way. Also, whoever loves the look of the epics of 50s costumes should love the look of this film.
