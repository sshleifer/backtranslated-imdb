It is perfectly correct that people are dying in an animation, but there are far too many deaths in this one. From the very beginning, the story is about battles, fighting, death and revenge. It lasts another hour and a half. It was interesting at first, but I got very tired after the mid-show. Unlike other animations, it lacks humor. There is not a lot of interaction between the characters either. The good thing about this is that the sword fighting scene is pretty beautiful and the characters are beautiful.
