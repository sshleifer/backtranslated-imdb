Come on, let's put aside the sophomoric humor that can be found in racism and let's be honest ... it's not funny. I was appalled by the fact that the two main stars would be willing to make such a shocking and prejudicial film about race relations. I'm not talking about the film's obvious black / white comment, but slam to other ethnicities, such as Betty White's characterizations of Hispanics. Should we just tell her that she agreed to make this film a sign of senility ... is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical garbage? Or is it the fault of writers? How about the third assistant makeup? No, the fault is with us to perpetuate this kind of bullshit (under cover of comedy), that Hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say that's enough ... racism is real and it is not a matter of laughter. We are all different, celebrate this diversity, do not make fun of it and encourage division.
