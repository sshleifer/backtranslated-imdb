I thought this movie was ok.I did not think it was great.It was a bit too slow for my taste.Many drama, but not much action until the end of the film.This movie was basically dramatic film, with the gain, if you can call it like that, not before the end. For me, the scenes of the dam that broke out and the water that flooded the city is good, but much too brief. the acting is ok, but he just did not do it for me in the long run. I think it has something to do with the fact that there was very little suspense or tension created throughout the film. The other factor is that I had just watched '10, 5 'and his sequel '10, 5: Apocalypse'. These are two "big budget" event films that, in my opinion, are very difficult to follow, in terms of effects and scenes of destruction. As a result, I have to evaluate Killer Flood: the day the cursed broke out at 4/10
