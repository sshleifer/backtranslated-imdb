It's so wrong! The plot seems to be a generic adaptation of the medium blaxploitation movie. The common themes of sexual exploitation such as racism, oppression and the fight for the integrity of your community are exposed in a very simplistic / superficial way. And the jokes are not even funny! Dolemite offers these truly painful monologue comedy routines. All the people around him are delivering this canned laugh. Even the soundtrack looks like funk. For a better comedy in a blaxploitation, try "Coffy" and "Friday Foster" with Pam Grier. For a more realistic blax experience, try "Black Heat".
