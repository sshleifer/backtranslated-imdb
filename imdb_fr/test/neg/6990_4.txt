Why can women in virtual "x-rated video games" speak by mouth while Dante's virtual fighting game champion has to use a combination of telepathy and dramatic facial expressions? I think they needed to appeal to someone who looked more like a villain (Michael Bermardo's big brown eyes do not scare the heart of the good, a "bad boy" heroic.) OR they had to let him use his real voice (and move his mouth), and maybe give him a suit that would not make him go out like a sore thumb in the street. (But of course, that's the future and we have to assume that the bad taste of fashion is considered the norm.)
