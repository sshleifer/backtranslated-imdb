This horror tale unfolds in the Namib desert in Africa. Zach Straker (Scott Bairstow), a Canadian systems analyst, is sent on a mission to a diamond mining company. Although he hates field work, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the desert, fighting sand flies and whipping, blowing sand. There are four diamond prospectors ... we discover what remains of their bones scattered. During a long cold and desert night, a changing-shaped monster appears. Zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stuck and the members of the unit are horribly dying one by one. There is no character development; let alone the dialogue speak. The desert laid in its own way is beautiful and without revealing anything ... the creature is as old as the sand of the desert. Rachel Shelley, Warrick Grier and Patrick Shai are also part of the cast.
