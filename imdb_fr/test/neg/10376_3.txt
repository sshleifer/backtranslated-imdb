Maximum Formulaic Neither title reflects the actual content of the series, "Fighting Nazis in Morocco" (in fact, the Iverson ranch). The plot is just to fill the lulls between fist fights. The packaging boasts more than 40 "festive meetings" in 15 chapters. It's at least three a chapter! In addition to seeing Duncan Renaldo interpreted as a Frenchman with a Spanish accent, the amount of furniture knocked down, shattered, thrown, burned or exploded is the goal of this series. When the protagonists start fighting, you can bet that everything in the room will be there too. So, congratulations to the combat choreographer, who is the real star of this show! <br /> <br /> Two positive remarks: the characters sometimes lose their hat during the fighting and, better still, we have the feminine kick (often a journalist, as she is here) who really takes part in the chaos, mainly by shooting and killing the wicked. Upcoming, Linda Stirling is killing the main villain of "Manhunt of Mystery Island" (1945). On the negative side, there are just too many breakaways - before the slab falls, before the car passes over the cliff, before the outboard explodes, before the building explodes, before that the truck does not hit you, etc. . <br /> <br /> It is claimed that this series partially "inspired" George Lucas to make the first Indiana Jones movie, but it is more by implicit concept than by the story or evolution of the series. <br /> <br /> Rod Cameron "shines" like a rock in motion, a role he has played in all his films. Apart from watching all the furniture break, nothing happens here, compared to other series that have fewer fights, more story, better actors and more developed characters. <br /> <br /> I give him a 3 for all the smashing furniture.
