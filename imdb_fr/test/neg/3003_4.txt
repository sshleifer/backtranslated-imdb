"What symbolism!" exclaimed a woman leaving the theater after seeing the Polish brother's pean to Ingmar Bergman. A little symbolism is there. But not a lot. "Northfork" adds up for a nice action weakened by a dreary cinematography that makes no coherent statement and a confusing story that irritates rather than fascinates. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a city threatened with extinction after the construction of a new hydroelectric dam in operation. We are from the beginning to the mid-1950s and a team of state agents with identical clothes, as if they had just answered a call for "The Untouchables", has the task of relocating the recalcitrant inhabitants who not understand both their immediate danger and the bonus offered for the move. An exciting film against development is always a possibility, but let's be realistic: the electrification of rural areas is one of the greatest advances in creating decent living conditions and a boosted economy in American history. Dams can be built without forced relocation? Not in this country. <br /> <br /> But this film deals less with the fate of the owners than with a fantastic creation of the imagination of a dying boy. Nick Nolte is the priest who looks after the boy and much of what he says could have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to be heard. <br /> <br /> Alternating between the evacuation agents dressed in black (working for "Lakefront") "earth when the dam creates this precious area" and a spooky collection of weirdos, the film develops no theme of way coherent or even interesting. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is mediocre.A faded, attenuated and depressive color permeates the whole film without great dramatic utility.There is no reason for this vast terrain to be portrayed in such a way The contrast between a largely untouched natural beauty and the massive and grim solidity of the evolving dam and power plants would have been very effective. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
