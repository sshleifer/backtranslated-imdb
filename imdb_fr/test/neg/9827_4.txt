"Jefferson in Paris" is a really disconcerting film. He portrays Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) as unflattering as possible, portraying him as a liar, a racist and a pedophile, but not offering the slightest condemnation for these sins. That's what he was, seemed to say the movie. End of the sentence, end of the movie, the door is behind you. <br /> <br /> After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson tries to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of a homosexual English painter (Simon Callow, criminally underused). However, the turn of events sends Maria to England and Jefferson forgets it with astonishing speed for a man who, a few minutes ago, asked him to live with him in America. <br /> <br /> You see, he is under the spell of Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton), one of his slaves who just arrived from America. It's hard to say why he's bewitched - though Sally is undeniably beautiful, she behaves like a mere child in front of Jefferson. When she does not tell stories of ghosts in exaggerated "dark" speeches, she slips into her room, her thirst for thirst for her distinguished massa. <br /> <br /> If his behavior is an attempt to excuse Jefferson's, it does not work. Jefferson is damned even more when Maria, tired of waiting for her letters, leaves England to see him. I have not changed towards you, he insists, offering weak excuses for not writing. To her credit, Maria sees immediately through her brazen lies. When Sally appears and Jefferson and she flirt openly (and cruelly, in my opinion) in Maria's presence, the illusion collapses completely. <br /> <br /> Nobody believes today that Jefferson, Washington and the others were completely nil. paragons of virtue and morality. Yet are we supposed to believe that Jefferson, scholar and distinguished, would be attracted by Sally, a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how "the friends Massa Frenchie carry a grain of wheat" and who rubs against his forehead when she passes, Just in front of Maria's eyes? <br /> <br /> Even if we let this slide slide, the dreadful revelation that Sally was only 15 when this case took place (Jefferson was 41). Strangely enough, this fact only appears towards the end, when Sally's brother, James, is naturally furious at the blasoming announcement that she is carrying Jefferson's child. <br /> <br /> Jefferson is also jaded when he is informed that Sally is carrying her child. and condescendingly told her that she would be much better protected than living freely in France with her brother. But, he promises, I'll free her when I die, and our children (including all the others who will come, says Jefferson, in a scary statement from Sally as * her *) when they turn 21 years old. Oh thank you, massa, you feel like saying on the screen. A big deal. <br /> <br /> However, the worst scene that awaits Jefferson's daughter, Patsy, is still ahead. She is already angry with him, first for violating her wish, and asked her mother on her deathbed not to marry again. (Clearly, the woman was not just talking about marriage.) Jefferson also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun as she wished, despite the fact that she had previously moralized religious freedom (this seems to mean freedom to agree with him). <Br /> <br /> Having promised Sally and his brother their freedom, Jefferson calls Patsy to attend the transaction and promise to fill it if something happens to him. Sally's brother reveals the child's imminent birth and Jefferson asks, "Do you swear?" Paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant, although she has almost nothing to say. Her face twists under the excruciating pain of this revelation, but she controls her grief and murmurs yes. <br /> <br /> If anything, the filmmakers could have had something if they had insisted more on this point, "Jefferson in Paris" is an indication of the status of women at the end of the 18th century , considered even by men like Jefferson as an attractive property, pleasant but without real intellect or soul. We see Jefferson shedding a few tears over a letter from Maria telling him where to get off, but he soon laughed at Sally's frantic dance, with his hair streaked and his chest swollen. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this is a true portrait of Jefferson or not. I do not care to watch it, however, just to watch it. This Jefferson is neither a hero nor even an anti-hero. He's a selfish liar pedophile-and who gets away with it-not the kind of man I want to see a movie for.
