While watching this movie, you will immediately notice the derisory elements of a standard TV movie ... even if, throughout the image, the plot changes (if you're bold enough to say that this movie has a plot) are completely original and ... and with each film KEPT GETTING TRESE! <br /> <br /> Candace Cameron Bure, famous for her role as DJ Tanner in the hit show Full House, is not very convincing as Possessed twenty has something to ... avenge the death of the possessors. I think she is a good actress .... but not in the range of thrillers. <br /> <br /> The filming was trashy, and as I said, the plot ... but looking at it, I knew I was automatic cheese, I did not know how bad this movie could be ... <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie ... unless you prefer filming and bad writing.
