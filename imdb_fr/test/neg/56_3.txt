This show should be titled "When bad writing happens to good actors", since most players have shown immense talent in other places, for example. Andre Braugher in Homicide: Life in the Street and David Morse in St. Elsewhere. I hope the frenetic pace of the series will be adjusted as the series unfolds, with obvious clich√©s and a dialogue so absurd that I wondered how much the writers imagined the stupid target audience. We are beaten above the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to light up little by little, almost as if the writers felt that they had to spell the main character as a sort of vengeful angel condemned to redeem himself from sins, venial and mortal, by hitting in his taxi carries many business. To attend the premiere, there had to be a lot of disbelief, the fact that Mike Olshanskey's fees were so quickly escaping them, and that he would feel pressured into the lives of strangers. That he possesses these abilities of "super-cop", that he is everything for everybody, expert in weapons, master of martial arts, psychologist, confessor of father, locksmith, etc., to infinity. Pure drivelesque fantasy. What about recent televisions based in Philidelphia that all seem to be imbued with a nasty ex-wife and a very disrespectful child? Exaggerated. I really wanted to like this series because it had the advantage of having a slightly different premise than many clones in this season's tariff featuring some of my favorite actors. But I'm afraid it's just another good idea, ruined by careless execution.
