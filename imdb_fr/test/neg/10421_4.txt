What about the French? First, they (apparently) like Jerry Lewis much more than the United States. Secondly, they (seem to) like the work of Edgar Allan Poe more than anyone else. This must be the "Beaudelaire" effect. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong ... I'm a fan of Poe myself. But this trilogy manages to turn three Poe stories below average ... well, I'm not sure what they're transformed into. <br /> <br /> "Toby Dammit" is a good film by Fellini, it has nothing to do with the story of Poe, at least in terms of theme. It's nice during the first viewing. Terence Stamp does a good job with an interesting role. However, this has nothing to do with Poe or the spirits of the dead. <br /> <br /> "Metzergenstein" is a big bazaar. How were Vadim's films produced? It's horrible ... not even to the standards of amateur film schools. Depending on the DVD menu you have, try to skip it and save time. <br /> <br /> "William Wilson" is actually the most faithful segment of Poe's work. That said, he does not have much style, even though he includes the strangest snowball fight I've ever seen in a movie. (It looks like the boys are throwing paper tissues, or maybe handkerchiefs, that have been rolled into balls.) My advice is to skip "Metzergenstein", look at "William Wilson", and then, if you are a fan of Fellini (I am not), keep "Toby Dammit" while you prepare dinner or have a snack.
