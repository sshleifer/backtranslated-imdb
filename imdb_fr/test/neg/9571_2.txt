This very forced attempt to merge Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino (himself grossly overestimated) is neither informative nor entertaining. The development of the character is arbitrary and incredible - especially in the final scene of thugs and little boy, as other commentators have noted. In addition, apart from a few humorous moments, the film is not as funny (black humor or other) that the director seems to believe.
