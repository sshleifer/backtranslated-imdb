Following the resounding success of The Wrestler (see my review), Mickey Rourke had this "jewel" head straight to the video. Each copy was rented for months and I even heard good rumors around him. So, months later, I saw him on a movie network and I sat down to watch him. First of all ... one of the movie locations (Walpole Island) is a place I used to visit regularly as a child because we lived very close to the reserve. Cool huh? That's about where the freshness ends with this failure. I mean the story is decent enough to warrant a 4 and even the direction is not bad, but the performances are horrible, and downright ridiculous with a really lost star power and Mickey $% # @ * &! Rourke plays a Canadian / American Native Hitman?!?! In the name of the Lord, what were they thinking? He does not even look like native blood, and his attempt at a native accent made him even more ridiculous. They could have gone anywhere with this story ... they could have hired an Aboriginal actor or changed Rourke's character, how about a white man raised by Native parents? Instead, they made Killshot a complete and complete joke. <br /> <br /> Since you may have caught Mickey Rourke's "stars" in Killshot, I use this term vaguely. I never really liked Rourke, although his Oscar performance was decent. This shows and confirms my aversion to him. He looks bored, constantly bored, and his lame attempt to represent an aboriginal person is almost insulting, I think. He's a cold-blooded killer worthy of the name but history never explores that part of him that's totally at the back of the story. Diane Lane, although respected in Hollywood, plays another dull performance. She had her moments but overall she usually does not take off in a performance. She looks good, but when she's not, it's even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays her protective husband. I always thought Jane deserved a bigger career than him. I think he has an action star in his blood. All in all, his performance in Killshot is actually not bad. He does not go too far, he is tough and almost heroic in a way. He and Lane manage to have a decent chemistry, but he does not interfere much with his character. I do not know why Rosario Dawson A) made this movie and B) had a character at all. Her character is absolutely useless and has no interest in the plot or story making a performance that she would give just as badly. I have rarely seen a character who supports so incredibly useless. The only character and performance redeemed in this film are those given by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a deranged mini killer who wants to team up with Rourke's hit-man. Gordon-Levitt is completely crazy and entertaining and his character is really engaging. If this film had entirely revolved around him, it would have been a crash. It literally saves this from total shit. His performance is worth the detour. <br /> <br /> Oscar-nominated director ... who will wait? Yes, director John Madden (I think the football coach could have done a better job) led this mess. I have never actually seen Shakespeare In Love, but I remember the rave reviews he received and it surprised me because the direction in this film and with the characters was downright horrible. Screenwriter Hossein Amini did not do anything I recognized but it was apparently planned to write Jack Ryan's next film and, after this chaos, I can not even imagine why they would like it. I understand that this is based on a novel and I really hope that the novel is a world above this mess. A bit of action and a kind of frantic attempt to tell an emotional story of a hitman, his partner and the mess they are involved in. Unfortunately, unless you are a huge fan of Rourke or you really do not like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, then there is no reason for you to suffer. I did it for you and I still feel the pain. 4/10
