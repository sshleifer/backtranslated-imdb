The new celebrity deathmatch is terrible. They kill popular people and win low-budget celebrities. I mean ... Andy Milonakis? Lil 'flip? Lil Flip and Lil Wayne should both die. Lil 'Flip fears. the fight between Lil 'Jon and Lil' bow wow and Lil flip was crazy and short MAD. They should just kill them all. Why did Tobey lose to Jake and Christian to Adam? they are better actors and superheroes. They also spend too much time talking rather than fighting, which can annoy viewers. Everything seems rushed for some reason, they can not just do a long fight? the old match to death is much better.
