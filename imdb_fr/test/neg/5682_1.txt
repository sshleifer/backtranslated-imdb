First of all, I must say that I do not really like fiction movies! But there are some movies that I really liked. This is one of the others;) I have the same opinion as others (most) here. The film is still running in my back, but the few effects are really not enough to watch all the time .... I think they did well the animated sets with 3 suns and 4 moons, but c loved. There is no intelligent dialogue (is there ???). But it's a great movie for anyone who loves Lara Croft or other girls from HOT-PANTS ...;) <br /> <br /> For the filmmakers: "Stop trying again, PLEASE !!!"
