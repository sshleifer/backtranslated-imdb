Unfortunately, Koontz seems doomed to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work. Whispers follows the original book very closely, apparently until the production company runs out of money. All the sets in the first half of the film have been meticulously recreated from the book - something that is lacking in many other Koontz films. Despite its many (many) falls, I continued to look for beautiful landscapes. False. By the time the detectives show up at the crack head apartment (in the book), the movie is running out of money and one of the most moving scenes in the book is in shambles. Where the book offered a macabre discovery, a search and a chase through the guys 'apartment, the movie offers the backseat of the guys' car. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - Koontz writes without a budget, because the imagination is free. If a Koontz novel is ever turned into a decent film, no one will see it, because it has already been abandoned so often. That's why Dean Koontz's Frankenstein is now just Frankenstien - if you had seen your work slaughtered many times, you'd come out early if it seemed to happen again!
