I know that Terry Gilliam is considered a good director, but to pretend that this film is good is simply stupid. What was the film about? What is a parody? Fancy? The comedy? Satire? No answer from Gilliam's screenplay. Totally confused and unnecessarily rushing from one historical age to another. I find it amusing that some people consider this film as magic. Is it because they have to rent any film that is vague and undecided? 3 stars for special effects since it is 1981. Roger Ebert is right in his comment. The film is ambiguous and it looks like Gilliam is fighting with money to make a vague movement of children pretending to be a historical review. The film also tries to confuse the viewer by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery the highest rating.
