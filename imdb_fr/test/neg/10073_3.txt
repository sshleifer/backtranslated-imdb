How sad that a film as wonderful as "Jurassic Park" slips slowly into a dilapidated and mediocre territory throughout his franchise. Jurassic Park III, the new suite, did not think about the characters, nor a story, nor a scenario, but rather relies on an uninterrupted action of the dinosaurs, which is neither exciting nor very interesting to watch. The dinosaurs seemed incredibly wrong compared to the 1993 technology. After 7 years of CGI's progress, this only gives the impression that the film was projected for the summer by relying solely on its name. The introduction of a pterodactyl does not make a good movie. <br /> <br /> Go see "Shrek" again. <br /> <br />
