"Stealing Time" actually dates back to 2001, when it was mysteriously titled "Rennie's Landing". This explains how the director Marc Fusco was able to offer this cast of television actors / cinema set in what is obviously a very small budget production. About ten minutes after the beginning of the film, you understand why this thing was never released indoors after the tour of the film festival several years ago. <br /> <br /> Its recent distribution by Franchise Pictures probably reflects the perception that it is possible to take advantage of the growing popularity of some members of the distribution to recover some of the modest production costs. While this is not a great addition to anyone's resume, the young actors did worse when they were desperately seeking acting. <br /> <br /> Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Scott Foley and Charlotte Ayanna play with friends in college. a meeting of early "Big Chill" and compare the stories of war on the failure of reality to live up to their dreams. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. Yes, Alec (Facinelli) dreams of a hold-up in a liquor store and a robbery at the bank, which are then staged "cheap and unpretentious" on a completely inappropriate music. This is the least suspensive banking job since W.C. Fields was the guard in "The Bank Dick". <br /> <br /> If anyone can say any time in "Stealing Time" where something is happening "in fact", I'd like to know because nothing happens in the whole movie . . Maybe Fusco, through ceaseless visual reflections, is trying to say something deep to take control of his life before it's too late. As in "St. Elmo's Fire", the film is littered with all the deep thoughts of a young adult who left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time. <br /> <br /> I had the feeling that Fusco was leaving. for some sort of young professionals' motive in action by Howard Hawks "Only angels have wings". Again, I'm sure I was reading a lot too much in the movie. After all, there really are Howard Hawks movies. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
