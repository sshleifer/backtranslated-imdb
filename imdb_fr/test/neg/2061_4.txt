A girl is looking for her soul mate - this movie was very strange - a lot of sequences that look like hallucinations. Tommy Lee Jones is the only stable member of the photo. It was hard to understand what the director was trying to say - most of the time, the main character is dressed with strange clothes and makeup. A strange combination of reality and madness.
