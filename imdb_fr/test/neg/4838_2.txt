I do not understand why someone would waste his time or money on rubbish like this ... Do not get me wrong - I like a good western - notice that I said "good" - it's not only from the basket <br /> <br /> The acting game is horrible - Val Kilmer must know someone or he owes a favor or something, just to use his face and his name in this ridiculous piece of shit. .. <br /> <br /> for those who liked this movie, I make a list of your names to make sure NOT to watch what you suggest - our tastes are very different, but you have the right to express your opinion, as far as it is. <br /> <br /> I gave a 2 to this film just in case they would throw all these without counting them .... Simply bad in all areas ...
