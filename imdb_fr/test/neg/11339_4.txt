I came across this movie on Amazon.com. Had never heard of his release, but the three critics gave him five stars and rave reviews; I am therefore a lover of German films and I bought a copy ... <br /> <br /> I must say that I was not impressed. The values ​​of production are not expensive, the story is derived, the characters are not very engaging and for a comedy, it is surprisingly short laugh. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like that, but I found it dull and dull. Or maybe I was expecting more independent German cinema than a gay movie about The Full Monty and a cast of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> There are passages in the movie that make no sense, like Leather Bear's trying to put Ecki in a sling - like he's even looking at it twice? Or the ex-wife revenge who comes to the match but who ends up applauding her separated gay husband? Bunkum is not the word! Well, at least that explains the title of the British film, I guess ...
