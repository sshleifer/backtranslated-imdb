We chose to see this film as an alternative to The Polar Express, presented in our local IMAX room. What a waste of time and money! First of all, it's not cute. The snowman sometimes looked demonic. Other times, he was just a zombie. He showed no expression or emotion most of the time and his hollow, blue eyes were simply frightening. <br /> <br /> Second, Santa Claus declares at first that it's a film about the spirit of generosity. Santa Claus and a snowman declaring war, is it a film about giving? I'm totally for a little parody, but it was just not fun or entertaining. <br /> <br /> The idea that the snowman's flute is his voice is different. Too bad you have never seen or heard the snowman play the flute ... not even a "thank you" to Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The only fun parts of the movie are the "exits" at the end of the movie. movie. Too bad they did not use them in the film. He could have been better.
