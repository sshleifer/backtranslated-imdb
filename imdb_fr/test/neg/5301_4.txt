I really liked Get Shorty, but this movie was a totally disappointing sequel. First of all, Travolta does not look like Chili Palmer from Get Shorty. He simply knocked out this performance as he did in all his more recent movies. It is absolutely not smooth or does not have the presence of gangsters on him that makes you a little root for him throughout the movie. It seems that Travolta got up from the bed and decided it was good to play in this movie. The plot was just not exciting or smart, there are not really any highlights, the only thing that looked like entertainment was watching Christina Millian play and The Rock was funny. Anyway, in short, this movie was a crap and I had to force myself just to cross it.
