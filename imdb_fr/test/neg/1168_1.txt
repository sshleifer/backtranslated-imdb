My reasoning behind the viewing of this film (despite the fact that it is free) was more or less out of curiosity ... slight, slight curiosity ... I did not know very well this video "biographical" story of Mr. Gein and discovered during the opening credits that he presented the horror icon Kane Hodder in the lead role. My emotions have turned away not only from curiosity, but now from a slight glimmer of anticipation as to the evolution of his portrait of Gein. Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barns also appeared in the credits (among some sinister photos of Ed's crimes). "Okay," I said to myself ... "It can be a little fun." As the film started and progressed (slowly), my microscopic confidence (or, as I call it, "micro-hope") for this film was completely blurred and I was overwhelmed by a feeling of overwhelming humiliation as I was dying a little inside watching this movie. pile of manure. Hodder, who is widely known and respected for his earlier work as an unstoppable serial killer, misquotes this here - turning Eddie Gein from a reclusive, gentle-mannered man into a deadly and wholly killing machine. He hides at night, killing guards at the cemetery, his boyfriend pillaging the graves and teenage girls, leaving Plainfield panicked while the local sheriff's department seems to be doing nothing to fix the dangerous situation. The MP and his mother have a warm little relationship that gave me a fuzzy feeling inside (or that could have been the cyanide pill I had ingested in the middle of this turkey). I am not sure of the interest of this film and the director obviously knew nothing about the subject with which he worked. There is already such an abundance of films about Gein's story that, unless I discover the "Ed Gein Snuff Footage", I do not want to see it on the shelves anymore. If you want a more authentic movie of this nature, go to the movie "Ed Gein" (2001).
