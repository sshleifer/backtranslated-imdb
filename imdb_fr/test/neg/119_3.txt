Technically, I'm a fan of Van Damme, where I was. this movie is so bad that I hated myself for wasting those 90 minutes. Do not let the name Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II) fool you, I had high hopes for it, according to what I saw in (Undisputed II), dude .. was I wrong? ?! all the action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic hero, but I guess we will not be able to see him soon, as our hero keeps coming up with these (going-to-the-border-far-away-city- and-kill I mean, for God's sake, that we are in 2008, and they insist on making these disappointing movies at all levels.Why ?? !!! Do yourself a favor, skip it ... seriously .
