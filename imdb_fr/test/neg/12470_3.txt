The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest was predictable. It was just one of those movies I had fallen into my netflix instant queue and thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips team up together again since Bully. Unfortunately, "interesting" has never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl in a private school whose best friend is rich and does whatever she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain loves one of the "crowd" boys (Renfro) and ends up hanging up with them. And, of course, as in all other movies, things are going well (or so you assume the movie never lets you know that everything is fine) and that things get worse when you hang out with the rich kids. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. It's just a lifeless dead movie that after looking at it, you feel like you could have done better. Some scenes (those with Renfro's parents) do not even make sense to be in the film because the director and the writer did not follow through. <br /> <br /> All the interesting things that MIGHT have played were completely ignored and it's almost like watching an episode before they're stars (CO's Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison). <br /> <br /> The only light that shines in this film, and the reason it did not get a rating from me, is Phillips. They needed more scenes with her inside. Renfro just seems to have brought some of his Bully character. And, for Pete's sake, the title is BS, change the name.
