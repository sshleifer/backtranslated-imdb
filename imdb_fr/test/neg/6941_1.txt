This film essentially uses conjugal rape as one of its main comic devices. Now, I turned it off when he literally tied her to the bed and raped her, but I can not really imagine how it was finally turned into something endearing and funny. Not only did this movie waste a fantastic cast and was still insignificant, but it actually managed to be quite brutally disturbing and misogynistic. How many people seem to think this is a family film that is beyond me. "I enjoyed canning these apricots last night" is not a funny joke when you know that it's about forcing a reluctant virgin to have sex with you in the hope that she will eventually appreciate it. Watching a fool is not a pleasure for the family. Honestly, I feel worse for watching half of this "comedy" and I am totally confused by these positive reviews.
