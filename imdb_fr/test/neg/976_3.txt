Looking at Showtime, I had the impression that the producers had the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just to have a movie that featured them. Otherwise, I see no reason to justify the existence of the film. It's not fun in places, but the concept is so ridiculous that the laughter is a little muffled. <br /> <br /> What really appealed to me was Eddie Murphy's character. I can not understand the concept of policeman as a day job. When I was working at the New York State Victims of Crime Council, I had to deal with all sorts of cops and they covered the whole gamut of really dedicated slugs, but I can not think of anyone who thought that I was just doing it until my career started in a distant region. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or whoever is undergoing the rigors of the real Police Academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job? <br /> <br /> Anyway, DeNiro is your hard working detective who is on the trail of a big arms dealer. He is undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does Murphy Murphy do, he calls a reality-based TV show like COPS to film the action. <br /> <br /> DeNiro's bust exploded, but the producer of the series recorded good pictures of Murphy and DeNiro and decided on a new television series based on reality. Thus, these reluctant partners join them and try to continue to treat the case of DeNiro with all the television cameras. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is a funny guy, I loved him at Beverly Hills Cop and in Doctor Doolittle movies, but he's doing better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has. <br /> <br /> I guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro had to get a big paycheck to make this movie.
