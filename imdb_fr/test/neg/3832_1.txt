This film was very disappointing and, apart from a few moments, it did not fly at all. More than anything else, it was just a stupid mistake. The music was bad and the plot unfolded as a BYU bowl game ?? very predictable (avoid embarrassment by scoring points, a series of touchdowns at the end of the game, a rally that fails and leads to a defeat). Essentially, Will (the film fetishist) and his brother Danny (confused, religiously confused), half childish and naive, treat Kirby (the "Sweet Spirit" of the film), the third member of their unfortunate " group of boys "Mormon, like shit until the man and the father figure of the movie (the ruler, Jill) argue with Will and straighten it up. Incredibly, Will's personality changes 180 degrees and he is instantly the mature and conscious leader of the group. It would be a nice 10-minute concert on the roadshow, but the fact that the film lasts 93 minutes really sucks you in if you look at it all the way. My advice ?? take the money you would normally have spent renting this show and burning it in your fireplace or throwing it in the bathroom? more entertainment with a lot less time. If you want to watch a better movie of the same kind, get yourself Saints and Soldiers ?? not a comedy, but an infinitely better show (in fact, Kirby has more fun stuff in Saints than in SOP).
