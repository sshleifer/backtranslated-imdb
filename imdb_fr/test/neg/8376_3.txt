Let me start by saying that I do not remember laughing once during this comedy. From the opening scene, our protagonist, Solo (Giovanni Ribisi), turns out to be an egocentric, weak and neurotic loser, unable to cope with smaller responsibilities, such as balancing a checkbook, keeping his word or forming a coherent thinking. I guess we are supposed to be attracted by his fragile vulnerability and support him in the process of ending the deep crisis. I guess we're supposed to sympathize as he stumbles into a series of mishaps apparently triggered by his purchase of a dog, but actually provoked by his own despicable nature. At no time did I have the slightest hint that Solo had any redeeming character, which became worrisome when he did not feed his dog for a few days. No spark of humanity or glimmer of conscience gave me the hope that he would never realize that his life is so miserable because he is a man with a low and scared life. I have not developed any connection with this character. He did not seem to care, and neither did I. I really wanted him to tear his kneecap at some point. <br /> <br /> The dog was not a character in the movie. It was simply an accessory to use, to neglect, to despise, to abuse, to covet and to eliminate on a whim. So be forewarned. Even though "dog" is in the title, this movie is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers. <br /> <br /> Scott Caan's role is fun and believable as a best friend / cad. Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic - I always want to see more of him on the screen. Mena Suvari was deliciously repulsive. Lynn Collins' role as "stripper with a heart" was well played, but the character was both absurd and clich√©, not to mention that there was no chemistry between her and Ribisi. <br /> <br /> Romantic? Barely. The comedy? If you say so.
