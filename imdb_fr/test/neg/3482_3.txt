I am amazed at the main comments here for this OK surf movie. It really comes from the "California Dreamin" school from the backyard school to the beach, and is not really plausible. The idea that the head boy learns to fly SOI in a concrete wave pool that beats real surfers in their real ocean match is simply ridiculous. In Australia, where most urban teens surf, this film made the audience laugh with a grain of sea salt. Made in the '80s but with its heart in the' 60s, it's fun to watch and looks and sounds good, but it's not a class at all. Even the actors did not survive that. We are seriously in the LIQUID BRIDGE or RIDE THE WILD SURF or BEACH BLANKET BINGO. The Oz stars, like Occy and Gerry Lopez, Wednesday's big hero, were recruited to add a touch of recognition to the prowess of our farm boys, but that only spoiled the movie crowd. This is for 10 years that do not ask a lot of questions. It's not even in the hands of God and it was silly too.
