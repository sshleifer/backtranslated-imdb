I saw about half a dozen low-budget westerns in the B series that Ken Maynard made in the 1930s, and I'm always amazed at how poor he was. How did he become a leading cowboy actor? They say he could fit in silences, but he does not do anything particularly impressive in these latest sound movies. That said, he may have had the advantage because he was tall and could ride. <br /> <br /> Phantom Rancher is not as bad as some of Ken Maynard's other films I've seen, but it's not a lot. Some other characters sometimes refer to him as a "young guy", where I think he is as old as other older actors. <br /> <br /> And if that's not stupid enough, there's a pretty big script problem in this movie. At one point, one of the characters made a remark about how the ghost had prevented the poisoning of a well, which had not happened yet. A few minutes later, we see this scene in particular. No, it was not a flashback. At first, I thought maybe when Treeline Films was doing the DVD transfer, they might have reversed two of the reels. But at the time, the film reels contained about 11 minutes of film and the total reversal took only 3 or 4 minutes maximum. Everything else was in a logical order. So it seems that this is a real problem of continuity in the original film. This may be one of the reasons why Colony Pictures did not last very long.
