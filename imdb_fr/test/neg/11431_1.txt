With a humor that would seduce a small and exclusive audience, the average viewer would find it useless and monotonous. When Cartoon Network announced the promotion of the show, it appeared to be a drama or a major event, with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the sheep. <br /> <br /> In the air, I was disappointed to see how all the characters were so simple and totally bland. The names of characters like "Private Public" and "General Specific", some vague references to cultural aspects, and how Lady Richington pummeled Sheep with his steel wig were the only things that hit the spotlight> <br /> Slightly off topic, but I do not see why Sheep would have fallen in love with this dirty cotton ball called "Swanky". It was hideous!
