A wonderful semi-humorous tribute to the expressionist black-and-white films of characters such as FW Murnau, Fritz Lang, Carl Dreyer, Marcel Carne and others. Allen plays a character caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare, initially thinking he was part of a self-defense group seeking to catch a murderer and slowly realizing he might be a suspect. The writing is a little forced (after all, Woody Allen tries to be a shy Kafka), but the point is advanced, and no harm is caused. The cinematography is interesting, about 100 shades of gray, but be sure to look in a very dark room with a good screen, otherwise the details would be swallowed by the fog. It's a funny little movie with some bursts of laughter that are actually "uh-huh" words. The acting is good, considering the strange vehicle, and it's worth watching if you're a big fan of Woody Allen. Also interesting for those who know Expressionist films. I would give a 6.5 out of 10.
