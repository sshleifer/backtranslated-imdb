I have nothing against Paul Schrader. In fact, HARDCORE (1979) is one of my favorite movies. But some horror movie fans were premature when its original version of the prequel EXORCIST (DOMINION, the one you are currently reading) was dropped by Warners and when Renny Harlin was substituted for the spruce and made a new version that was "more frightening". In my opinion, some viewers were prejudiced and automatically avenged for hating Renny Harlin's opinion on the subject (EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING) even before the first image of the film was ever unveiled so that she could to judge. And I should know; because I myself entered the premiere of theatrical BEAUTY with stubborn arms bent and I prepared for the worst, which was bound to happen. Imagine my surprise when I found Harlin's Harlins to be much more serious than I ever imagined, with Stellan Skarsgard's good performance as a young version of Father Merrin struggling with his faith in God. It was certainly not a great film, but it was far from waste for which I had prepared, well in advance, without being seen. <br /> <br /> Well, I finally saw the real version of the garbage. - and it is the DOMINION of Paul Schrader: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST. It was a relentless, uninteresting and tasteless conversation. Stellan Skarsgard's troubled priest was not nearly as interesting as he had been to me in Harlin's film, and the actor himself was not so good in the role. For all those who have highlighted the obvious effects of the CGI in BEGINNING, guess what? They are here too in DOMINION. Do you remember the stupid ending in Harlin's performance (which I'll also have to defile the rest of the movie)? You will find that this end of Schrader is not a hell much less lame. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that I disliked the nonsense presented by those who appreciate this film. better than Harlin, saying that we are "retarded" or "can not appreciate the making of subtle films". As someone who despises the 1999 MUMMY by Stephen Sommers and is a true fan of the very suggestive and discreet old horror movies of the '30s and' 40s, I can assure you that this is not the case with me. At least there was "a" certain degree of terror and exorcism in the film DEBUT de Harlin; This is just a tedious exercise and a challenge, even for the most certified insomniacs. It will be very interesting to hear horror fans trying to convince themselves that DOMINION: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST was as good as they had already been to make it happen in advance. just as they were already ready to rob Harlin's BEGNING the second they learned that Paul Schrader's name was soaked in White-Out.
