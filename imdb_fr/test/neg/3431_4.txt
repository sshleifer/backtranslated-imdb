This (very) low-budget movie is fun if you're a fan of John Krasinski, but it's also disappointing. At least it was short, so I did not feel like I was wasting too much time. John's scenes are quite amusing, but the "deep" scenes with Lacey Chabert are pretty nauseating. It's starting to look like a funny movie, but some characters are so weird while others are way too serious to fall flat. Do not get me started. It was totally implausible and did not even fit the rest of the movie. I will say, however, that I was not bored, which is why I noted it above three. John Krasinski fans will enjoy seeing him with a bandanna and stockings around his head and eating Cheez-Its. Oh, and make sure to check John's deleted scenes, they are better than some of the ones that were actually included in the movie.
