The "Clubbed" promotions project a smooth-looking movie based on the 1980s clubbing scene. We end up with a movie with identity issues. Subplots eventually take precedence over what viewers would presume to be the main plot. The film focuses mainly on "clubbing" and ends up staying in the gutter. <br /> <br /> Boxing, depression, self-hatred, gangsters, bouncers and drug trafficking, are all rushed in about 90 minutes. On at least four occasions, I had to check the film's running time, because we were more and more worried about the disappointment of this movie. <br /> <br /> The club scenes we see are bland and repetitive, with about 3 extras dancing in what is barely recognizable as a "club", barely capturing the mood of the day. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie on the 80's club scene, what Human Traffic did in the late 90s, forget about Clubbed.
