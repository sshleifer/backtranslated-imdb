With a cheap store that just opened, I thought it was worth looking to see if there were cheap DVDs that looked good. And on the back of the cover was this Jeepers Creepers movie sound, an anthology film! and I thought one or two stories seemed very familiar to me. Plots of land: <br /> <br /> First story: the classic. <br /> <br /> A young couple thinks it's time to try to prove their financial situation by buying a $ 1500 car. But when the guy goes to get a car, a car starts talking to him. The car (called Banns) says that to get everything he's ever wanted in life, he has to buy Baans for $ 5,000. The relationship crumbles, Baans is doing everything in his power to show who is really in power. <br /> <br /> Second story: culinary culture. <br /> <br /> A guy who could be overthrown by his landlord, because of the dirt of his apartment, discovers that because of the conservation of a tuna pasta in his refrigerator for six months, it has now evolved to become a green and moldy version of itself! And when they start as friends, they end up having a big quarrel, the fight leads to a last battle to see if the real guy or his fridge clone will survive. <br /> <br /> Third story: Too good to be true. <br /> <br /> A girl joins a dating agency and gets matched but she does not know if this guy is too perfect, and when she thinks she sees him "closed", she starts to to fear. View of the film: <br /> <br /> The first thing I must mention is the score given to the film in England, which gave it a score of eighteen, even if there is no nudity, neither swearing nor blood. all.And the other strange thing about all the stories is that they all have a happy ending, where the goodies win !. And although the first story is too close to Stephen King's classic, Christine, the second story is easily the highlight of the film, with director Tom Parkinson, making it a thorny story like a low-budget episode of Muppets !. <br /> <br /> Final view of the film <br /> <br /> Although the film has a little 'redo; feel, theirs is pretty wacky to make a good "comedy" of horror.
