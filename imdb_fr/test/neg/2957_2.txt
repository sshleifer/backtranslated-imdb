This film is much too long. I lost interest about an hour after the beginning of the story. Saratoga Trunk tells the story of Ingrid Bergman, daughter of a prominent New Orleans man and his mistress. After the death of his mother in Paris, Bergman returns to New Orleans to scandalize his father's "legitimate" family and to blackmail him. She meets Gary Cooper, who is also seeking revenge on the railroad magnates who cheated his father from his land in Texas. She takes him into his projects and the film culminates in a Saratoga complex. Long and boring, but worth watching if you're a fan of Bergman or Cooper. The cupid midget is the only bright spot in this winding story.
