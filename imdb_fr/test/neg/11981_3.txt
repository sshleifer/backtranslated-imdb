In fact, I was quite surprised to learn that a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created. The story here is not something that I would consider a strong point in the game world. No worries, as in the typical Boll fashion, the film's story has very little to do with the game on which it is based. I now understand that there are certain freedoms that must be respected in order to transfer from one form of media to another, but it seems that he does not even try to establish a connection. Not only that, but the actor and action sequences are so old-fashioned that you almost feel like the whole project is a big joke. This has already been said a million times, but why could not someone more talented acquire the video game rights to create a movie?
