This film is bad. Really bad. So bad that it made me want to shoot myself in the forehead. I hated this movie. First, the plot was unsuccessful and nothing shocking about this movie was seen in the 30-second trailer. Secondly, anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it was also a bad movie and totally unworthy of a remake. The best part of the movie is by far the house in which it takes place. Which does not say much for the film itself. There have been passages in the film when the music becomes very suspensive and you are sure that someone is around the corner and that it turns out to be the cat or the cat, but when someone one is around the corner, it is impossible to be surprised even because you expected any movie. So save money, save time, save headache and watch the trailer. It is absolutely useless to see this film, neither in the theater, nor on DVD, nor on television, ever.
