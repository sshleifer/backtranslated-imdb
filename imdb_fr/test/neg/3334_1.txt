You will probably get something like this. I translate movies for a living and this is the first film of my 5 years of professional experience that I find offensive to my intelligence. Of course, there are stupid Hollywood movies about drunk teenagers on a spring break, but these movies do not even claim to be serious works of art. But when someone aspires to greatness and poetry, but tells a confusing story (and often ridiculous), a bunch of disparate scenes, a pretentious dialogue ... You get then the worst type of film that another critic has very precisely defined as "pretentious shit". To those who find this film intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination that you obviously used to try to make sense of this lamentable attempt (it's in our human nature to try to make sense of things). <br /> <br /> One last thing: I can tolerate the political disadvantage very well, I am all for artistic freedom and the suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was too strong. I would like someone to tell the director that it is a bit ridiculous (even in an unrealistic art film) to describe a Slav woman as a semi-articulated disheveled creature, connected to the forces of nature, probably because because she spent all her childhood watching the stars and milking the cows on a three-legged stool.
