This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. It's been a few years since I have not seen it and nothing has come close and I doubt that there is ever a film as bad as this one. He tries to make fun of a variety of different movies, for example "Nell" (!) And instead of funny, it's just pathetic. Whatever you do, do not rent or take this trash and if someone throws it to you ... turn around and run the other way!
