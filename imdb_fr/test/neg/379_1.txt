If you fancy a really awful movie, it would be hard to find something that could even compare to that. I spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the pure pleasure I get from it, and man, that's one of the worst. This movie was so bad that I had to buy the third Beastermaster online. This one was not so bad, which is amazing, because it was directly in video. It's one of those movies that is hard to understand how it was done. I mean, someone really had to read the script (or several scripts, I'm sure they wrote several rough drafts) and said, "Yeah, that's all, that's money." In fact, they probably just wanted to do a Beastmaster 2 before they even had a script, and then with everything they had. Ack, horrible. So, if you're a fan of really bad movies, watch this one. It's a real classic, and the movie is not worse. And if so, thank you for letting me know.
