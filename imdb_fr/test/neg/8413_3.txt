For a film that has so much recognition and evaluate this fallout of "Rosemarys Baby" is a big mistake. It all starts with Andrew / Adrian, whatever his name is, because he is so confused that he does not know who he is anymore. He flees a cult with his mother and is quickly abducted by a strange woman who ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother. The acting is terrible as Andrew grows up in his twenties and looks awful, his buried smile, his endless smile and Dukes of Hazard's clothes look more like a drunkard than a son of Satan. In fact, all he does is drink and fall on himself as he tries to understand his past and the last memory of his mother who scrambled away in a bus. He finds a friend who seems to be an angel, but he is quickly killed and electrified in a mountainous scene in which he looks more like a Christmas tree. Andrew gets screwed and worship with the first party members tests him to see if he is really the Son of Satan. Her idiot fails the test and gets up from the shimmering altar of myme makeup and jumps off the stage of a nightclub and dances like a clown on crack !!! This scene is memorable and worth a visit. The end is terrible and quite predictable given his stupidity throughout the film. Do not look at this trash or you will lose respect for the first part.
