A rather appalling undertaking suggests that Welsh is an infantile artist, helpless in the violent environment he knows best, but unable to resist empty elaborations based on banal fantasy. The first story is a story of fists and meaningless with a premise of science fiction in the movie B. The second acquires a certain intensity, but only through the excess of humiliation provoked by indignation, focused on his character central. The third and most laughable seems to aspire to be a disjointed sequel to Child's Play. The management is still clueless - all swirling with noise and fury, slaves to the extreme inconvenience of the environment; suffocating in a badly chosen score and in a play of indifferently sparkling actor. It is pure stupidity masquerading as a guerrilla sensibility - as arbitrary and hollow as the abstract images that connect the three sections.
