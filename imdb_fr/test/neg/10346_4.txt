I watched this film wrongly thinking that it was this zombie movie from another radio station. The disproportionate values ​​of low-rent production and distribution quickly revealed that this was another of those inexpensive imitations of the style of the science fiction chain. <br /> <br /> The central performance of Bill Moseley is initially quite engaging. radio shock jock, but as the movie progresses, it becomes less and less convincing because it is actually forced to act. The rest of the cast has nothing to do but to appear concerned and has no depth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is dull, flat and completely devoid of inspiration, like so many others of this type of film. He does not even manage to convince, the zombie makeup is literally pathetic, with the exception of one notable exception towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The film tries to inject originality and a message. It is a half-cooked idea that has been wrenched from the idea of ​​assimilating this outburst to intolerance of Islam and the war on terror. This is unfortunately managed with all the intellectual weight of a 6 year old child. As the characters and apparently the writers are unable to differentiate between race and religion - describing all people of a certain skin color as "Muslims". More particularly, a character turns out to be Muslim by the only color of his skin. At the same time, the "Muslim" terrorists behind the epidemic are the usual psychopathic stereotype. <br /> <br /> Probably the Pontypool, which was much higher, had a budget similar to that of Dead Air, but shines everywhere this movie fails miserably.
