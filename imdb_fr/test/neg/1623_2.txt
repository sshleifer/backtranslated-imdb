The redeemable quality of this movie (apart from the loincloth just there of Ator) is the hilarious action on the part of the evil Zor. This wonderfully over-played villain has some ... oh, Shakespearian presence that made this movie bearable (hence the 2). I laughed every time he pirouetted, raising an incredulous eyebrow at a henchman or a hero. A real example of someone who is not paid enough. (And that BEARD!) <br /> <br /> Now, what about the 12-minute hang gliding scene? Really, really, really bad. I can not emphasize this point too much. <br /> <br /> So, seriously, if you deign to even see this movie, look at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. With these dear silhouettes, a lot of horrible movies have been tolerated.
