What really surprised me in this film is that it sounds so wrong. First of all, who in the late '80s (when the film took place) lived like this family? A university professor would not earn enough money to support the lifestyle I saw in the movie. As a result, he and his wife at home would be struggling financially, especially when she has cancer. Second, Streep is my age and most women, especially in her class (educated, white and well-off), have experienced the feminist movement. Yet this woman seems unaware of her anachronistic behavior. In fact, I felt that she was a very influential woman who kept her husband moved by taking care of all her needs. <br /> <br /> The fact that so many people were moved by the film is incredible. I've already admired Carl Franklin's films, and I like Meryl Streep, but it's a manipulative and lying film.
