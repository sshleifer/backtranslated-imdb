After reviewing this horrible 82-minute excuse for a movie and having previously wanted to take my eyes off after watching another film directed by James Toback entitled "When Will I Be Loved", when I came to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world. How to make sure that this horribly written and misdirected garbage is done in the first place. <br /> <br /> I love Robert Downey Jr., but maybe this film has led to the abuse of psychoactive substances. <Br /> <br /> Heather Graham must be embarrassed by her zombie performance. Half the time, the camera is on her, she is just stunned. <br /> <br /> Such a crappy scenario. Get ready for the profusion of Hollywood names (example: five-minute talks about Denzel Washington acting, etc.). <br /> <br /> Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22, named Dunbar, has an excellent character. He spends most of his time in the skeet film, which he abhors. When asked why he always pulls on skeet if he hates him so much, he says it's wasting CREEP's time and will have a longer life. Well .... if you really want to feel the time, watch this movie! I swear that the 82 minutes will be longer than a four-hour David Lean epic. It goes on and on over and over again ... <br /> <br /> I hope I never see another movie from James Toback again. If I could give this NO STARS, I would do it.
