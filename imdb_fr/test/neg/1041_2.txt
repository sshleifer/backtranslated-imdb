I mistakenly thought it was a 70s art movie on the bed that was eating people, which seemed interesting. It's not. Interesting, I mean, not to mention a man-eating bed. <br /> <br /> I suppose Stuart Gordon gave his name to this in the same spirit that Lloyd Kaufman put "Troma" on just about everything that was shot with a video camera, in order to build a library of franchises. We can say a little more about this opus except that the execution time is less than 90 minutes. This is of course a bed haunted by the spirit of a man, or something, that has already killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes. Along the way, we get ** a five-minute opening credit sequence ("Lawrence of Arabia" is that long?) ** a murderer with contacts of Marylin Manson who kills using the same technical as the troll of "Cat's Eye" ** demonstrations of a sexual practice, Michael Hutchence might have used ** a glimpse of what Emilio Estevez will soon look like and behave like ** soft core porn even Cinemax would transmit * * manbutt and a topless ** scene a bit wacky (or it's "whack" -ee?) ending with involuntarily hilarious hammer blows and strawberry pie remnants (well, that seemed to be like that) ** and a rudimentary surprise that finally ends in nothing more. It's as if the scriptwriter had even fallen asleep on the "death bed" before finishing the last draft. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not sexy, it was shot in high definition video and does not look bad, but does not. Not looking good either, the acting is just good enough not to be bad enough to be fun, as is everything else. No one would have seen or heard of it unless it was a record with another film, today's "modern" film. I was not paying attention to certain parts, so I may have missed something. But for some reason, I doubt it. Rating: PASS
