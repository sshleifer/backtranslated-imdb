Out of boredom and curiosity, I decided to watch this show today because my four-year-old niece loves it. I should have known it was a show that only a four-year-old could love. The show was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the show was just not funny. The laughter was triggered at the most inappropriate moments, which was very annoying, especially since no jokes were funny. The laughter went off at one point when one of the children, who is the cameraman, said, "I'm going to polish my lens". How is it funny? The parts that were supposed to be funny (like percussion) were just stupid for anyone who was over eleven. <br /> <br /> Now I have the feeling that four-year-olds are not the target audience. . However, since I have a four-year-old niece looking at him, that kind of thing worries me as I look at him: it does not show very good behavior. In the episode I was watching, it showed that Sam was stealing Carly's sandwich and pushing it to the ground, just so Carly could get up and do the same thing to her. I would not want to see my niece play this rude role. I also do not like the idea that two girls are organizing a web show where they give personal information ... If that were true, there would be fools about it. <br /> <br /> This show would probably be good and funny for someone under eleven, but if you're older than that, get away from it. I'm going to give these two stars because I guess I can see how funny it can be for a child.
