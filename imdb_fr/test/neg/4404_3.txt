I was very worried about this movie. It was to be presented at a Jewish film festival and would be very hostile to Israel, while using ingenious humor and irony. <br /> <br /> I was relieved that the movie was not a diatribe, but as a film, it was deeply disappointing. The movie was full of random events, some of which ended up being connected, but most were not. Some of the events were very intelligent and fun, but others were purely random and useless. <br /> <br /> The scenes are repeated between two lovers: they are sitting in a car, without a word, and play a game of hand. Maybe in some cultures it's erotic, but it's like watching wrestling. After the third time, it became really tiring. <br /> <br /> I've always found David Lynch incredibly bizarre, using strange stories and images to make people think he's so sophisticated that he does not understand his work; in fact, there is nothing to seize. The same is true here, the stories do not add up and there is not really any political discussion (in one scene, a rowdy Israeli soldier humiliates the Palestinian drivers at a checkpoint. <br /> <I do not understand why this film was controversial, or why it attracted attention. It's an inferior job and seeing it was a waste of time.
