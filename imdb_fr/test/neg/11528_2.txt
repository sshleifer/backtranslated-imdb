What a clunker! <br /> <br /> It MUST have been designed for television or cable. <br /> <br /> Look: forget the scenario - forget the group of forgotten actors. Excuse me? Continuity? The NSA / NIA / whatever it is (an officer) takes off in an F16 - is depicted on an F18 tending his bowels and later the rolling shown aircraft is a F4 Phantom! Oooh, I wish I could be so cavalier. <br /> <br /> Aside from the male actors (!?), the women are WASPS: blue-eyed and long-legged, and finally, cry about the heroes who save them. Even when a solid weld could save most cosmo-astro-sailors, the blonde drops the welding tool. Duh! <br /> <br /> As a SF movie, one in ten. As a movie in itself: 1/2 (it's half a point). They should have abandoned the space station and headed for Mars. <br /> <br /> Major raspberries.
