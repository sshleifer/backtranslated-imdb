How is this a documentary? It's much more like a ghost walking tour that can be done in a given city in the South. Quotations were generously abandoned without the first effort being made to identify the source. George Orwell was the most identified speaker. <br /> <br /> Reference has been made to documents without ever being produced in any form. Flat-sided fraudulent plans depicting period films have been separated from the reels of historical films without the separation of reality and self-promotion. Film reels totally unrealistic and improbable for the time were introduced, as if to try to ape Blair Witch, hoping to create a spooky house on what would otherwise be a dead real estate. <br /> <br /> Is not it somehow a big lack of respect for the real victims of tuberculosis, a dance on their common graves in the name of commercialism? The line between real footage and self-service made is so thin; the trickle of doubt has minimized so little; the scientific limits so obviously ignored ... how could this be listed in my TiVo as a documentary? <br /> <br /> This is a promotion for the holidays that succeeds fully. <br /> <br /> I would go to the joint if I could locate it on Google Earth. Not scary, said a previous poster. Not too serious either, says I. fascinating story. Fragile film production.
