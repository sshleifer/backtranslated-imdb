Another version of the gangster movies, the classic "Godfather", and another case of media hype due to the media circus. Sarkar, the 13th Hindi film by Ram Gopal Varma as director, is also the weakest of his Underworld trilogy, the other two being the excellent Satya and Company. The Charisma, the magnetic character of the two Bachchans who play for the first time the father-son duo on the screen is a treat to watch. Not just good performance, but their perfect chemistry is the most important point for which Varma should be applauded. However, the same duo's equation is missing with the other characters in the film. Reason-the other characters look more like cartoons cartoons esp. the bad guys are the typical villains of Bollywood. A character that catches the eye is his eldest son played by Kaykay but again unable to stand because of a half-cooked characterization. . The drama and conflict arise from the excessive use of Close-Shots, which has created a claustrophobic effect that is rightly needed to create a mood. Haunting score (Amar Mohile) and sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani & Anup Dev), associated with a dark and murky background covered with stunning powerful images (camera work by Amit Roy) contribute to such typical visuals of Ramu's style. But there is excessive use of music, but fortunately no song is in the movie. But can the interest of today's "growing intelligently" be maintained solely on the shoulders of two powerful performers and visuals? I do not think so. True, the public "maangey over" and here the film fails to deliver. In any adaptation, to add a new dimension, the most important pre-requisite is the scenario, which is slow here, and therefore the pace slows down quite often. What the audience is finally subjected to is a very predictable drama, very ordinary and not very surprising. Allan Amin Ghani, the best stunt director, is not in his best form. Some scenes requiring different treatment include: a minister speaks of Sarkar and the son is attentive; Sarkar Jr., a very amateurish shootout in Sarkar prison, escapes the clutches of his enemies, a son easily motivated to kill his own father, a son secretly enters his father's room to kill him, a police commissioner slaps Sarkar All this requires a more realistic and powerful approach, which is the cornerstone of the creation of the required conflict. Dialogues are weak for example. look at an amateur line where a CM tells Sarkar Jr. ?? "The police commissioner who is responsible for the fight against fraud". The women who take on Sarkar's work are completely ignored. The uninterrupted negotiations on criminal activities while Sarkar is with his family also seem slightly displaced. In fact, the film follows a graphic quite similar to Ramu's production, Ab Tak Chhappan. In describing the battle between good and evil, the other side of life - law, police, administration, politics is completely ignored. Certainly, more content is expected. Here, the film is definitely missing and could not exceed the average rate. Dear Ramu, I agree that now that you are making fun of the bank, you absolutely must take radical revision steps in your film production plant before it's too late.
