Another direct Disney movie, great for kids. The problem with Kronk's New Groove is that everything that made the first movie fun is replaced by a sadder and darker movie. In this film, Kronk learns a lot of lessons at the expense of many others. It takes a lot of time to create a more enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove deals with two stories: Yzma returns for a return on investment and another, Mrs. Birdwell, hopes to defeat the Kronk championship. All this leads Kronk to confront his father and his disapproval of his son's orientation in life. <br /> <br /> From The Lord of the Rings to Michael Jackson's Thriller, Kronk's New Groove recycles at any time. its viewers. If you liked the original or are looking forward to attending the next Kuzco TV series, I recommend Kronk to its loyal fans.
