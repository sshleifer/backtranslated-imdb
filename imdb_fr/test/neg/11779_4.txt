This film, which I just discovered at the video store, apparently spent two years without a distributor. It's easy to see why. The story of two friends living in New York looking for their high school friend who is now homeless under the Coney Island sidewalk, seems like a very good movie, but is finally weighed down by the story centered on Stan and Daniel rather than their homeless friend Richie. Cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice appearance, with the ghostly images of Coney Island. However, writer Cryer and director Richard Schenkman are too busy with the relatively uninteresting life of Stan and Daniel rather than focusing on Richie. A flashback in a music store, where Richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this movie could have gone. But finally, not much. Two scenes of annoyance, like inside the Skeeball building. NOTE 4 of 10.
