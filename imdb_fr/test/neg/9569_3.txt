Well, I saw this movie at the last San Sebastian Film Festival. The reaction was ... let's say as funny as the film is unintentionally. It happened that they showed a copy with Spanish subtitles terribly false. They seemed to be a translation from Chinese into English and then into Spanish. Everything was confusing, the genres were reversed (the girls appeared as boys and the boys as girls), and my friends and I remember great sentences ... but because they were so absurd. All in all, it's not a good movie, but if they show it on TV and you have nothing to do, and if you want to laugh (let alone with the movie), continue, "Visible Secret "is your movie.
