The scariest thing about this horror movie is that the end alludes to a sequel. 'The Cave' is really a disappointing action movie. A team of researchers specializing in caves and submarines goes to Romania (one of these inexpensive places to make a film, at least for the moment) and, following a destroyed church, enter a cave that turns out to be a kingdom of underground monsters. Or are they demons? The film never decides if it wants to be action, science fiction or horror, it's a mix of everything, without salt or fun, and acted in a woody way. The best thing about the movie is cinematography, but even the dark landscape of the cave quickly becomes boring, as the film lacks rhythm and the characters are just not interesting. Waste of time.
