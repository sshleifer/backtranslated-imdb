OK, it was risky to rent this movie, but I thought I had nothing to lose. I was wrong. It's next to "Bloodsurf", the worst "horror movie" I've ever seen. Poop actors, crappy shit, shit story, and so on. The soundtrack, though, is not so bad. That's why I give him a 2 on the vote and not just a 1. And of course, cats are a positive surprise. By far the top actors in this movie ..... Do not rent it and do not buy it. Stay away and hope that this horrible horrible film will disappear to become obscure and not become a "cult classic". This certainly does not deserve recognition.
