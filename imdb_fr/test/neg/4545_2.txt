Not surprisingly, there's a good reason why this movie is so obscure and unknown as long as it relates to the ever-popular zombie principle and the star of the 1980s movie Queen B, Linda Blair, to know: it sucks! "The Chilling" is trying very hard ?? too hard ?? to be a story with depth and factual background, whereas it should have been a dizzying horror movie full of blood on frozen zombies. It takes an incredibly long time before anything happening at a distance is interesting or meaningful There is a lot of intelligence about cryogenics, what I learned in my physics course is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. So naturally, in this film, a group of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when they are frozen. Needless to say, this is extremely boring, until two confused nocturnal watchers decide, during a power outage, that it's a good idea to place cold metal cells at the height of a thunderstorm. It is obvious that coolers are struck by lightning and that bodies spontaneously thaw and live to live on a deadly zombie. "The Chilling" is a boring and surprising horror movie (for an effort of the late 80s at least) without gore that does not even use a quarter of its potential. All the painful attempts to create an atmosphere of suspense and fear fail tremendously and I see no reason why the zombie attacks should be so bloody. Even in spite of the small budget available, they could have done better. The sets, the makeup effects and the costumes are pitiful. The research lab, for example, looks like a real apartment, while the zombies might not seem less threatening with their green faces and their wraps wrapped in foil. How did Linda Blair get involved again in such an embarrassing, low-budget horror movie is a complete mystery. She is attracted by mediocre B movies as bees are cherished.
