Unfortunately, this film had potential with such a cast, but everything was so badly thought out and poorly executed. I do not think I have ever seen a movie where every scene falls like a feather, as it is here. Also, I do not think I've ever seen a "stoner" sex comedy that did not provide at least a laugh, but this vortex of pain only provided moaning and misery. The last time I was so amazed at how funny a comedy was, it was with the awful "Big Momma's House". Scene after scene, these films will turn your brain into jelly. Stupid and stupid can sometimes be funny, but here, silly and stupid are used as a means of torture against the viewer. An absolute, missed low rock.
