To begin, I must admit that I have never been a big fan of the Dutch film genre. Unfortunately, watching De Dominee did not change my mind. It shares some common flaws, like having a plot too predictable and linear for my taste. <br /> <br /> Worse still, the actors have their dialogues as if they were actors of theater. Unfortunately, this is also common in many Dutch films and, at least for me, it is impossible to feel any involvement in the main characters. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Adri (I'm sorry his name for now) offers at least a decent performance, and that's one of the reasons I do not evaluate this film yet Another reason is the fact that it seems at least that he had a budget, and the production seems professional. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the fact that the acting is often too articulate may not be a problem if you do not speak Dutch, although I have already warned you that the plot does not is not spectacular either, but unless it could make it an acceptable movie to watch.
