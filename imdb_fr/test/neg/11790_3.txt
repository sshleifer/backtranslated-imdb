I am sure that any legitimate submariner would be delighted to participate in the USOS Seaview (yes, SOS ...) Why, you can play basketball in the torpedo room, it's so big. And what about the bay windows in front, to better see giant calamari or minefields that appear from nowhere? Did I mention the colorful cook with the parrot on his shoulder? And the admiral's cabin with what appears to be a loft? A big buzz ... <br /> <br /> OK, OK ... he will never win a prize for his authenticity. And if the submarine is laughable, the plot is even worse. In one way or another, Van Allen's radiation belts, "hundreds of miles into space," have "caught fire" and will make global warming look like a real roast. The pompous Admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon) and his sidekick Lucius (Peter Lorre, look uncomfortable) scaffold a ploy to extinguish the fire by throwing a missile in the middle of him. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of intrigue (sic) along the way, with a born again survivor (and his little dog too!), two "ladies" who can never leave alone enough, a passel of "red shirts" that are expendable, and holes big enough for Godzilla to cross. Marvel at the Seaview being chased 60 miles per hour by another submarine - no need for advanced sonar when you can follow a hundred yards away. <br /> <br /> The film passes from one to the other another; the gain is so anticlimatic that it is useless, it is certainly not worth the wait for 1 hour and 50 minutes. <br /> <br /> The technical adviser of this sinking was to be a 14 year old boy with a stack of Popular Mechanics magazines. It's worth watching, if only to cry.
