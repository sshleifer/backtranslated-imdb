Terrible. The only way for me to start considering it funny is to make fun of itself. "Amazing, it's about a donkey fighting crime, and it drinks / smokes, it's funny, it's funny because where most people put things in their mouth, it's puts in himself! show is so great! "That's what I would have to say if the show pleased me, although I'm sure you can see the obvious sarcasm. I noticed that some people compared this show to 12 oz. Mouse and Squid Billies. Why would you even try? There is nothing to compare. The other two series actually have a decent character development. In conclusion, I hate Assy Mcgee. I nibble on behalf of this one.
