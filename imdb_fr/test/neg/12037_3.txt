Some movies that you watch and you say, "Well, that makes no sense." And you do not really think so. You're just saying that things were too complicated or slightly foolish. <br /> <br /> "Bread and circus" does not make sense. And I really think so. And it's not because it's surreal. From the beginning, it is clear that it is a weak excuse to create splashing special effects. There is no script. There is no conspiracy. There is no story of any kind. One event does not lead to the other. That's why bad writing is fundamental. <br /> <br /> And then? I mean, there are tons of movies that fall into this category. They want to show you gore, they give you gore. Why even talk about it? <br /> <br /> Because, in this case, "Bread and Circus" gave me hope. Okay, there are surreal elements. Vagina, in the ground - people crawling. The earth, in space, two legs on each side. These kinds of images are wonderful, funny, funny, crazy. But the movie does not do anything with them. <br /> <br /> There are things going on, the film is coming to an end, and all of this is very unsatisfactory. I suspect that the script was created on the fly. Pity. If there had been a story of ANY type, it would have made a movie a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> The movie is very much like the beautiful car you would like to own. Then you lift the hood and there is no motor. Just a little man peddling a bike. <br /> <br /> GRR!
