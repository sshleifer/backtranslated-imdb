Before Airport 79, these movies were pretty good. They had decent special effects, a cast of stars and a good acting. This film destroyed the franchise, for several reasons. Let's talk about special effects WOW !!!! they are horrible, what was the director thinking? I know we're only in 1979, but let's look at some other great special effects movies like Star Wars (1977) and Moonraker (1979). I like the idea of ​​the Concord and it could be the best movie on the airport, but they did too much. How about Joe Patroni (George Kennedey) shooting a flare through the cockpit window to prevent a missile looking for heat from striking concord. He also does 90-degree dives and loops. It's completely unrealistic and unrealistic WOW !!!!!! Believe me, the special effects do not help this scene, and are really poorer ... They look almost like cartoons, and that's how the whole movie looks !!! extremely mediocre to just at best ... The role of actor is a major problem in this movie, especially George Kennedy .. What I really like as an actor, but that does not cut in this movie. The director, who did a very poor job of editing, really blamed the airport franchise. Too bad the Concord is not yet used today, it was a marvel of air transport ...
