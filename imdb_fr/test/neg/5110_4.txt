From time to time, I remember that I actually saw this strange fiasco that is a mix between "What happened to Baby Jane?", "Sunset Boulevard", the movie "The Big Cube" Lana Turner and the Manson murders that also took place in 1969 but perhaps before this so-called "film" was made! There are already some descriptions of the plot here, so I will not go into detail. But it should be noted that Miriam Hopkins plays a parody of herself: a talkative, selfish, decadent actress. Maybe she was thinking of making a movie that would be as successful as one of Bette Davis' horrors. The old Hopkins girl has never stopped working, so you have to give it to her. She shows a little too much flesh in this film, which Davis and Crawford would never have done. And there is a scene with Miriam in the Hollywood Christmas Parade, which must have been shot at Christmas, 1968. <br /> <br /> Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. It's shocking how she looks wrinkled and awful. John Garfield, Jr. looks a bit like his father, but not as interesting. I think one of the Three Stooges is the guide at first. If it's not one of the Stooges, it's someone. <br /> <br /> I was stunned to discover this thing in the form of a commercial video that was given to me by a friend who knows all that is junk like that. It's incredible!!!
