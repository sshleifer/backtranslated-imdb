I like the series "Star Wars". I also like a good cheap sci-fi movie from time to time. Heck, I even like the nickel and dime jobbies produced by Roger Corman. <br /> <br /> I do not like "The Ice Pirates", though. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it sounds too cheap, you know? For a film supposed to take place in space, it feels cramped and locked up as if it were filmed on the front seat of someone at Mazda. And the special effects, although just nerdy, look more like foam rubber painted in metallic gray. <br /> <br /> I usually do not let myself be disturbed, but especially if the story and the characters are worth it. <br /> <br /> They are not. <br /> <br /> The whole story, about these pirates of the space do not mix who decide to find a planet filled with ice that they can melt and sell like water (a rare commodity in the future, I guess) is about as original as the jokes, which is not a compliment. <br /> <br /> Humor happens at the level of the crotch (like the one that castrates machine you will see early), and everyone seems to have a grumpy attitude. And who told John Matuzak that he was funny? Whoever, shame on them. The good old Robert Urich is trying, but he is a reliable actor aboard a sinking ship (or a spaceship in this case). <br /> <br /> I looked at this one about three times and I ended up feeling the same each time - shanghaied. <br /> <br /> No star. Despite the presence of Huston (a year before "Prizzi's Honor") and Carradine (at the end of a once noble career), these "Pirates" should walk on the board.
