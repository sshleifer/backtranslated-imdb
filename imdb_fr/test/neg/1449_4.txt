I did not expect much from this film, but I was eager to try something that was, at first, essentially a horror for a teenager in the early 80s. Although three teenagers make up a little bit of a plot critically, this is by no means a horror movie for teenagers. <br /> <br /> "The Power" is a small Aztec idol who swaps many hands as a possessor (who must be an adult and, "corrupted") becomes the means to free all evil from the idol, with often deadly consequences for the victims not only of the possessor, but of the possessor himself. After several exchanges trying to control this thing, three teenagers eventually find it and can not understand what it is, except that since they found it, strange and dangerous things are getting ready. They propose to explain the situation to a journalist who does not adhere to spiritual Bologna. Although it is his producer who wants to deepen his research, especially if it means he can get control of the idol (I presume that teenagers are not even corrupt enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol ). It's a story told a thousand times, especially in the horror and science fiction movies of the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> At least, for me, it's able to support a certain interest. Although the budget is low, it has not been done as obviously and cheaply as the horrendous budgets of previous decades (nowadays, they have the same qualities of cheese, but larger budgets). . We have enough to at least give us an opportunity to soak up at least a bit of the disturbing atmosphere and so on, despite a clich√© story. And, although not terribly bloody, the special effects were well done. <br /> <br /> Again, it's a horror story routine, especially with the end (which by modern standards has become a boringly overused device), but one that is not not so uncomfortable. It may be worth checking out, even if only for laughter.
