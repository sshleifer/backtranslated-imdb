Although I'm not a woman, I can enjoy a girls movie if it's good. This one is however beyond the evil. You have the story of the book, the girl is getting divorced, a boy with problems comes up. BOOM magic occurs and her demons are banished as she realizes that her life has a new purpose. Now, even if I can believe that this kind of thing could happen, I'm not an idiot. This would not happen during an overflowing geriatric weekend, it would take time. But here, producers know they only have an hour and a half to force the changes of the two, I guess a night of pounding and a night of marmots and grannies running like dogs in heat could be enough. Love novels were the gospel ... but most people do not. Now, if that was not enough ... the producers remembered that a movie of chicks should make the viewer cry. Well, they tried to make you cry with the two elderly citizens who started to jigger with she's failing ... so how could they hit you again? Why I know, can kill one of the characters for no good reason except that a random death will surely bring a tear to the eye ... and now let the teenage girl magically bind to the heart broken by his mother for no reason In addition to the fact that it would be good (completely unreal, but who cares). <br /> <br /> There you are ... girl finds boy, boy finds love, death finds boy and mum cries ... what movie - NOT.
