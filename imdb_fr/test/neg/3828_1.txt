I can hardly find the words to describe how much this junk offended me. How is it that American filmmakers always strive to portray Jamaicans as a group of backward shrub babies and, worse yet, to make Jamaicans play a ridiculous sound when they try to emulate the accent? We are not all extremely dark, we do not all walk with machetes, whether for work or protection, we do not walk naked at home and we do not practice the VOODOO! We are doctors, lawyers, architects, businessmen, musicians, actors and filmmakers. I'm tired of looking at all these portraits of Jamaicans as a band of dreadlocks dressed in Rastafarians who just sit all day smoking grass on a beach or firing shots in the air ( When we do not live in our huts). Yes, we wear clothes. Yes, we have electricity. No, weeds are not legal on the island and the chances are better to speak English than you! The worst part is that it's not just me who's angry and bitter, it's a concrete answer to the questions that most Jamaicans who traveled abroad were asked at one point. Read a book before you imagine what is happening in another country and, even worse, decide to make a film about it. <br /> <br /> WELCOME TO JAMAICA! We only kill whites and beat our bongo drums ... The stories of the Crypt officially made me sick, as well as the whole team of people who worked on this trash, especially the writer.
