The best way to have fun in this movie is to count the number of shots it contains. Chinese gangsters snarling. A woman vice-president. A ventilation duct large enough to accommodate a tall Caucasian man. Pulling through the wall to kill the villain. A situation in which you have to eliminate innocent people to prevent Armageddon. Scenes of independence day in which you dig up memorable landmarks in a fireball. The vice president in a well-lit room surrounded by subordinates, while the Chinese prime minister is virtually alone in a dark room with just a little subdued light, roaring as cruelly as sticky gangsters. A solitary hero left alone in a ship (building, plane, whatever) ravaging clueless villains with big automatic weapons. Etc., etc., etc. <br /> <br /> The second best way is to count the number of zeros to place after the decimal to accurately gauge the probability of the film's scenario. I counted to 45. A president accepting a meeting aboard a private ship. The command impossible to replace from the suggestion box. The part where the Chinese decided to play shoot 'em up. Etc., etc. Man is more likely to fall in the sun than for this film to happen. <br /> <br /> I recognize that the film was interesting to the point where Taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the president. Then the trouble started. The suspension of disbelief stopped, and I began to think of the pleasure I would have to torture this film ...
