It's your typical junk food comedy. <br /> <br /> There is almost no laughter. No authentic moments. No memorable lines. No scene where you think of yourself, "it was intelligent". Nothing. The plot is embarrassing of harm. <br /> <br /> It's ugly to look at and boring like hell! There is no substance here. This film has nothing. It does not matter if Farely was in this situation or not. A shitty movie is a shitty movie, no matter who is involved. <br /> <br /> In addition, David Spade is a terribly unusual comedian who plays the same ugly character in a television / television series in which he finds himself. <br /> <br /> This film was dead on arrival. There is no life here. Not funny. No intelligence. There are many other comedies "beasts" more enjoyable than this one. This film is just pathetic. <br /> <br /> 2/10
