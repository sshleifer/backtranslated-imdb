Even though I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I was wondering again why do you have a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a real scam. Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a wounded child who healed with love. I could not believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck owned this role. Unfortunately, Zeta-Jones should have found another one she could own (she has other roles she owns). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but happy Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed without passion in comparison. This version was nice but bland. <br /> <br /> The love between Mario and Martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying. The therapist added an interesting color that did not seem important. I liked it when in the end he said he would be back but the movie was finished before he came back. I especially have Martha at home. From time to time, I revisit it.
