One would think that since this movie has a bad reputation I would exaggerate when I say that I hated this movie. But I'm serious, this movie was so stupid and so unpleasant, and such a waste of time. I mean after The first 30 days, I had a headache and my smile (which was mostly prepared to laugh) was dulled. When this film ended, I was very happy and I was expecting a lot of fun. I was extremely disappointed. The acting is not great, the moments of comedy are nil and without fantasy. All that is serious is good about it, because I laughed like maybe two parts. is, I think it could be used as a suicide technique.I mean I do not think for some, it is even observable.So, my last words on this are, AVOID AT ANY COST.
