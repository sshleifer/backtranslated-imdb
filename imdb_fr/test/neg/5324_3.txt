In fact, I saw the movie before reading the book. When I saw the movie, I was upset because I wondered why Dean Koontz had made such a bad book / movie. The movie was confusing and had no content at all, it was hectic and made me want to throw a stone on TV. I absolutely could not communicate with the characters, so I did not care what had happened to them (normally, I like characters because I can understand their personality or their problems). Then I read the book and I liked it. I read the book often and the film is gathering dust. I would like someone to make a Koontz movie that follows the plot of his books, so the movies would not be so bad. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM EXCEPT IF YOU NEED TO GET MONEY!
