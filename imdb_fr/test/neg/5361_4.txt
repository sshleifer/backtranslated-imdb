This show was hasty and relied heavily on surprise cuts in ads (when it came back from an advertisement, the noise or "surprise" looked like a simple mouse). It is a pure scam of Ghost Hunters and he tries to go "beyond" and fails miserably. Also, what's going on with the administrator's log? Is it Star Trek? It simply ruins the novelty of this show, which quickly dissipated. The only reason this has been seen is that people want to laugh at its purely anti-climate nature. They never find anything and probably never will. Curiously, they always emphasize something that is the thing they "hunt" and guess what ?! This is the tower of the local radio station that is flashing red!
