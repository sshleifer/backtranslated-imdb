Okay, so I have to start this criticism by saying that I was really expecting to see this movie for months. I used to watch his trailer and think he looked really cool ... I did not know that the only cool thing about this Dread Turd shot was his trailer. <br /> <br /> At the cinema, I watched the first 3 images of this film and even if for myself, "this film is not so bad, do not be silly, give it a chance you only saw 3 minutes while I rolled eyes with shame. All these mounts showed ... get this ... a guy with a poker face (because he does not feel anything ... it's deep) looking straight at the camera in the middle of the mount. In the second or the third, he stays awake in his bed perfectly done (because he sleeps like a dead man ... because he feels nothing), and his father calls and says, "John Garden State, it's is me, your father ".... oh come on! I've seen a few more shots to hate clichés like "it's me, your (insert parent)," how on earth am I supposed to react ?: "Oh, he's having a tough relationship with him ".... uh ... yeah, that's exactly how I'm supposed to react ... <br /> <br /> Man, this is a shitty movie ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, over the course of the film, we learn about his friends, everyone's an EMO WALKING INDIE MOVIE CLICHED ALTERNATIVE. For example, one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval themed restaurant and who speaks Klingon (Strange Characters + Pop Culture = Your Standard American Independent Movie). Then we know the character of Natalie Portman, who is a copy of Alissa Jones (from a movie that hits the ass of GS, Chasing Amy), Amelie and this bitch of Eternal Sunshine ... you know , intelligent, original (not really), cultivated, beautiful and ... in touch with her sexuality (!). She listens to a 70's band named The Shins and gives ... what? they are of this damn decade ?? So why do they sound like that ?? Oh, they do not have personality, OK ..... so she passes her CD player to John Garden State and he looks at her with a stupid face (you know, my love). As the song was playing, I heard the lyrics saying "you're going to love this soundtrack, it's so alternative and cool, you'll love this movie, it'll define you, and your generation, even if it's it's an ideological photocopy of The Breakfast Club, In Ghost World and all the other smart teen movies of the last 20 years, you'll drink coffee and read books you do not understand "... <br /> > <br /> Now, nothing really original! ... he makes fun of his death in a plane crash (because he's already dead ... and he does not feel anything) and he lets us know in a scene idea straight out of an unknown movie called FIGHT CLUB! !!, it's a cool scene but, oh, did I mention that she appeared in the trailer? ....... so in an evening, and just when you think this guy is really deep and asexual, he stands out bimbo .... so oh, this is not an emotional zombie, after all ... a skillful development of the character or just a sh movie! tty? ...... well, let's analyze this scene, it is represented motionless a neck ch with everyone who advances at a very fast speed ...... idea of ​​scene straight out of an unknown film called REQUIEM FROM A DREAM! ...... so just a sh movie! tty, sh! tty ... <br /> <br /> Then they meet more eccentric characters (clichés, in fact), and finally, those who live next to a big hole in the ground. John Garden State says bullshit like "good luck exploring your infinite abyss" and the guy says .... and now I really wanted to choke on myself, "you too" .......... ... and then we are told gently that Neo is Jesus .... oh no, wait, this is another piece of stupid shit, obvious, repetitive, overrated and cliche. <br /> <br /> Finally (well !!!), there is still shit and he goes into the big warehouse to defuse the bombs: he has to talk to his father that he has not seen for zillions of years because he killed his own mother .. .. (you see, he killed his mother, so he is also dead ....... and feels nothing ..... it's deep). Now, I was really expecting an intelligent and moving dialogue, like Magnolia, between a father and a son ...... but it's Garden State, so it's about that: -John Garden State: Father, I forgive you, you do not I do not know what you were doing when you drugged me for a zillion years, but I know you love me - The father of the director of Cheppy: No! !! No!!!! I'm going to say a few simple things because I'm not really such a deep character, like this whole movie actually, so no !!!! -John Garden State: No dad, we have to agree because we are equal individuals ..... I mean different people. -Papa of the director of the brand: No !!!!! No !!!! ............ OK, you convinced me. <br /> <br /> And he takes the girl (because he's no longer dead, you know) and the movie ends and I'm going to eat a piece of chicken that makes my day .... <br /> <br /> This film makes for the trailer is zero
