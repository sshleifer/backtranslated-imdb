Celebrity singers have always struggled to get into movies (the cinema is cluttered with unsuccessful attempts), and we can go on and on wondering why John Mellencamp has never managed to become an actor. Instead of playing small roles in sincere projects, Mellencamp immediately played the lead role in "Falling From Grace", which he also directed, and the results are as clumsy and unbecoming as this title. The story of a famous singer returning to his hometown in sticks, opening old wounds of the family, claims a script by Larry McMurtry, but the winding film goes nowhere slowly. The distribution is decent, with notably Kay Lenz (whom it is always a pleasure to see), Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share the most striking scene of the photo). As for John's role, he does not seem particularly at ease, despite the apparent efforts to make him appear at home; it seems to dodge the camera most of the time, and it never connects with the audience immediately. * 1/2 of ****
