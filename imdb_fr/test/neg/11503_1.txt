I think it was like Lizzie McGuire except that it was way worse than the original. the only difference is that she loves animals, science and all that geeky stuff. Everything else is the same. she likes a guy she is too nervous to ask to go out. and later, she finds a guy who likes her and she has no idea. I think people need to stop doing this kind of shows. and another thing that's the same thing is it's always thaw friends are two girls and one guy. Do not people think that these things are getting old and tired and that these ideas continue to be used again and again and yet they continue to use them? but I know people watching this show and I know they love them.
