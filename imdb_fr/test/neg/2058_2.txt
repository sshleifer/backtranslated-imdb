This film is just shit, I can not say it otherwise. From the very beginning, we know it will be shit. <br /> <br /> The story, the dialogue, the acting, the special effects, the makeup, just about everything, is zero. I love vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar-winning films, but this one is not even worth seeing. I can not believe how someone produced this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality experience. The development of the film is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is ... Does not exist, everything seems to be a big joke. Maybe that's what they tried to do, but I sincerely doubt it. I would have liked to know what they tried to shoot, but it turned against them, it's certainly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen a lot of bad movies, but nothing comparable to that). favor and not look at that. <br /> <br /> P.S. It's also full of clich√©s! P.S. 2 Wrong scenario, wrong direction, bad cinematography. P. 3 I have taken the trouble to comment on this as a favor for everyone.
