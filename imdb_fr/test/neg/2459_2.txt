I do not worry much about the things that others have been opposed to - acting, lighting, and so on. For the most part, these things were done well enough to carry the film and bring out the points. It's just a horror movie, after all. <br /> <br /> What irritated me is the very points. Because it is a deeply moralistic film and its morality is deeply sticky. In fact, it is a fundamentalist Christian morality, and it is a fundamentalist Christian film. Look at the 'sins': <br /> <br /> * Sutherland's character was chosen from a child at school when he was pre-adolescent, resulting in his accidental death. <br /> <br /> * The character of Baldwin used male tricks, persuasion and beautiful face to seduce several women, which he filmed some. Ooh, the pig! What a misfortune for him that women are creatures so passive and irreproachable that they have no complicity in this matter. <br /> <br /> * The father of Roberts' character came back from Vietnam, a drug addict, so ashamed to be caught red-handed is killed. Yes, what a terrible sin! Why could not he have become an alcoholic like everyone else? <br /> <br /> * and the Bacon character chosen for another student. How awful! The fact that he is a child himself apparently counts for nothing. The children, it seems, are divinely judged according to the criteria of the adult. <br /> <br /> Well, many people may support this level of moral absolutism. This certainly seems to have been overlooked in the comments of this movie. Does everyone buy this stuff? At least human laws treat children differently from adults, recognizing that their ethical sense is partially formed. This film has no such scruples, and I find it rather unpleasant. Same idea that women are impotent and fluffy creatures before the bad desires of young men. Or that a Vietnamese veterinarian trained in addiction is so ashamed that suicide is a valid option. Pathetic.
