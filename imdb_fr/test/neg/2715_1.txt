Yes, it was a horrible movie, but there was a song at the beginning of the movie, I think, titled "I Got A Woody" or something like that. I would love to find a sound track of this movie if there is one. I saw this song on MST 3K, and as horrible as it was, there were moments, and this song was part of it. <br /> <br /> If you like girls in bikinis, this film is for you but if you do not do it, do not worry. It was excellent material for MST 3K, I have to admit though. I really want to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack. Not just this song, but some others were really funny, and are classics for me.
