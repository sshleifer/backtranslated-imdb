Hercules ended up falling into the same category as many promising television productions that could have been a very big classic, but became a sad joke. <br /> <br /> I really like Kevin Sorbo and his actors, but I do not care either about the direction taken by the series since their equivalent films. I think the series would have been much more successful if they had kept the same format as for the movies. <br /> <br /> I looked at the beginning and lost interest all along the way. I met the strange episode afterwards, but my attention was lucky to be able to take a commercial break.
