Calling a boring movie is not something I would like to call a valid critic. However, when a movie is roughly made from spare parts of other movies that were not very good at first and it's slow as molasses without real benefit, I think it's fair to 'call a cat a cat. And The Ghost is a very boring movie. <br /> <br /> A film as original as its name, The Ghost tells the story of an amnesiac girl haunted by a ghost who holds the secret of his past. Only it is much more complicated and less interesting than one might think. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost incomprehensible for most of the image and the hook, the amnesia element, only makes things worse. It seems that no one, not even the scriptwriter and the director, has the slightest idea of ​​what is happening at any given moment. Instead, they chose to do what amounts to roughly the filmic equivalent of a sitcom clip. There are scenes taken directly from Ringu, Dark Water, Shutter, The Grudge and some Pulse. To make matters worse, the half-dozen female chiefs dress and read in the same way, making them indistinguishable. <br /> <br /> There is simply nothing to seize with this film. The story is not so well thought. The gimmick of amnesia is lazy. The mystery element is uninvolved and treated with little grace. The characters never deduce anything, all the information is simply transmitted by the main voice recalling its past whenever it suits the plot. <br /> <br /> The cinematography, full of reflections and bodies of water tries at least to add For the subtext, a thematic link with the amnesia and the final twist (which I will not reveal) is nice, but often overworked. Even the score seems to be borrowed and cliche. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, the action that incites the curse is not very interesting and the last turn is predictable and lame. "Wait, do you mean that a character who has 15 minutes of time on the screen but apparently has nothing to do with the plot comes back in the end? No!" The public is too aware for this kind of tripe. Anyone who has seen one of the films that tears will find very little to keep it even awake with this feature film. I used to think that Shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for that kind of shit (remake his grudge movie not less than 5 times) but even his second-rate work like Reincarnation, a movie that I could not even finish myself, is Miles in advance. <br /> <br /> For more comments, visit www.collider.com
