I agree with most of the reviews above. Moreover, I was shocked by the presentation of love scenes with the homosexual couple. Why? because while they - the director, the producers? - had no compulsion to present the different heterosexual couples in the most passionate arms, including nudity and super close-ups of French kissing and all kinds of naked contortions in bed, completely useless in their length and in the When the time has come to show the same experiences with the homosexual couple, they do not dare to go to an excruciating hug, almost painful, almost among learned laughter, with two very nervous actors. So, in reality, the filmmakers discovered that homosexuality was UNNATURAL, as one of the characters says in some scenes. What a difference with Spanish cinema !! I remember watching a Almodovar film screening in an Italian cinema in Rome and being completely astonished at the total lack of reaction from the Italian public. They were afraid to react !! when in Spain people fell from their seats laughing at all the risky situations and the fabulous spirit and flair of Almodovar. Evidently, in Italy, dark forces in its history prevent the free manifestation of certain very natural and natural emotions. Pity. I must add that I was quite surprised to find that this same comment was censored by another correspondent. It is very serious and dangerous when we can not be left by the narrowness of others to express our opinions on certain points. Where is freedom of expression? I do not know whether this censor will approve of the changes I was forced to make in this commentary and I hope he will not receive the same treatment from another narrow-minded judge. Still pity.
