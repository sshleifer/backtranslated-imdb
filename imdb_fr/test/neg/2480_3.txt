I saw all the episodes, and the characters all remained the same as the little brats thought, there was no character development in 5 years (getting pregnant is not a development if you are still the same daddy girl, only now Delinda moans to Danny Sam never changes and never grows up, which makes her boring, repetitive and so annoying that he's disgusting after season 3, Danny is a very sweet character that everyone orders in his life (he has no principles his own morals), especially Mary and Delinda Will the old boring clich√© be used? The relationship quickly becomes boring. <br /> <br /> James Cann can playing and his character is OK, but it's just another daydream for writers, an ex-CIA man who has huge contacts and training etc. to be able to stop any known thief or cheater from man, even though the cameras can not fa half of the things they make fun of for a moment. Why? Because they have all this expensive and advanced technology, but there is no simple walkie-talkie (communication is fast and easy), security is never visible, but only when the situation arises and that everyone is here. <br /> <br /> The intrigues go very quickly from fraud and burglary of the casino in one way or another, to ships of relations typically American, the same thing is done with the equipment of the death seen all over the world, they have sex, but I hate you, I've always loved you, I think I love him, but I love him, but if one day maybe blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> I would recommend '' Hotel Babylon '' to people like Las Vegas, it has so much more to offer simply because the characters are interesting, engaging and not forced in the throat for 6 months of the year. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to be British ?? I would prefer to see the same actors in 5 different series rather than 5 years less and less worse in the same.
