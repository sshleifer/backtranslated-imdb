I'm sorry to say that this movie was one of the biggest disappointments of the year. After one of the biggest disappointments in history, one might think they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel falls into many of the same traps, the plot is completely forced, the dialogue is so difficult that the film can be better on dumb, and the action is artificial and far from the heart beating the splendor of the original movies of each monster. The best part of AVP-Requiem is actually the trailer, which, browsing the film, ends up realizing that almost all the dead and all the really cool shots of the movie were already shown in the trailer, this which leaves little to reveal and little to say. to be excited about. I gave the film an extra star for letting the extra hot woman in the nudity. the film was like a sci-fi monster festival, color by number, which also showed that nothing was a surprise when it happened, because you had seen it a thousand times before. The main flaw of these two films is that the creators thought that placing the films in our time would interest us more in the story than if it could happen to us one day. but what attracted people when they released the arcade game at the time was that it was rather produced in a futuristic version of the ALIEN trilogy, which allowed more to suspend disbelief. This is where future films should be inspired. because to be honest, to see a waitress killed by ALIEN we all fear since childhood does not really do it for us. Let's take the series back to its roots. learn from the old masters and not play with a winning formula when trying to create a "bold new vision": we liked the originals for a reason, we want to see this again. Finally, the end is the real WTF moment of the whole movie, * SPOILER * after the big climax, the survivors are ambushed by the Special-Ops soldiers who justify their horrible actions by saying "we were following orders," then we light a dime and start acting all kind and are turned into saviors. then, after the long retreat with one of the survivors looking into the heavens, we cut the strangest cliffhanger I've ever seen, with characters you've never seen in the rest of the movie (Save the Government Dude), then with all the subtlety of a punch on the face, they reveal that there will be yet another movie with the hint of a plot that would make people blush and turn the nose of an original movie channel of Science fiction. So, in summary, if you have to choose between this movie and any other activity on the surface of the Earth, skip the movie and do the other thing instead.
