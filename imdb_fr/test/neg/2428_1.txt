Ugly, ugly, ugly ... <br /> <br /> I loved the original movie. It was funny, charming and had a heart ... this piece of bric-a-brac has NO of those things. <br /> <br /> Reused jokes of the original film, stupid plots, bad animation, different voices (with the exception of Kronk and Yzma) that do not look anything like those of the original (especially Pacha ... * shudder *). <br /> <br /> The characters are out of style, the animation is flat and boring, it's just a bad job all around. <br /> <br /> And why is Kuzco still a fool? I thought he had reformed ... but since when are these television series faithful to the original * rolls eyes *. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but there is nothing refundable about it ... at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
