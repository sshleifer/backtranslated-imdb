The children of the suburbs meet the forest. Killjoy is better in this part. He is more mean and stronger too. Nevertheless, most of the acting is equally bad, as in the first. Sometimes the characters say things that are meaningless and unconvincing. I made a mistake by watching this one sober. You will probably enjoy it more if you are not ;-). If you have not already stopped loving clowns after the first movie, you will definitely have it after the second one ..... ;-) <br /> <br /> Problem kids and their watchers are on the way to a camp in the forest. . And what a coincidence, their car broke down in the middle of a forest and ..... at night? It's just their luck. They find a house and one of them is shot, one of the observers stays behind (why I do not know) and the rest ends up finding another house. A voodoo priestess lives in this house ..... but she is not responsible for the resurrection of Killjoy. Who is it then? Well, you'd better watch the movie and educate yourself ....
