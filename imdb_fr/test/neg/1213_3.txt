I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It's actually quite interesting and attractive. The cast is strong, even Dan Cortese. Brooke Shields has become a full-fledged actress. Black and White must have really released her, because I've never seen her play so many roles by playing a conventional character. If marketed properly, it could be an average success.
