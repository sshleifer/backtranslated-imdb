This is another of the anticommunist polemics of Hollywood's 1950s gold. The faithful American Gene Barry, the lovely British Valerie French and three others are kidnapped by an alien who is given shells containing fantastic power - and incredibly vague. What will earthlings do with such power? Throw it to the sea or use it to eliminate all humanity? Anyone who knows American cinema around 1957 knows the answer to what commissions are going to do, but the story is ripe when the Americans are really testing things in the middle of the Pacific. Then a scientist, alone with the ultimate power of the universe, develops his own theory and uses it! Subsequently, his neatness is nauseating and the cheerful disposition of all the others is appalling. <br /> <br /> Here is the fin of this dog: the capsules in the shells have a mathematical code that tells the teacher that they only kill "confirmed enemies of freedom"! That's right - do not worry about the ethical enigma of killing everyone that an extraterrestrial pill decides is an enemy of freedom; just do it! Hurray! No commies! Silly woman - and you have thrown yours into the sea! Ha ha! Kiss me baby!
