OK, this movie was not good at all. Video games are not what I would boast if I was over 15 years old. It's cool to play games, but writing a comment about video game players might like this movie, it's strange. Just play a video game, do not tell a sorry story about being trapped. I'm using my cell phone, I hope I do not lose my girlfriend in there. Fat is the worst? OK, Grease has a very well thought out story and a musical. Even if you do not like musicals, everyone would say that Grease is good. My brother plays video games all the time. He watched for 30 minutes and left because it was awful. I feel sleepy
