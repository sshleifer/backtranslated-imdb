On the one hand, he produced this film. It's like being in more recent films with international dubbing. The opening credits tell us that the film was shot in Vienna. <br /> <br /> Bey was a delight for the 1940's Universal Adventure movies. It was as beautiful in a film I saw maybe ten years ago but I've never seen heard from: "The Amazing Mr. X". It may have been Dr. X. I remember it as an exciting and scary movie. <br /> <br /> This one is wooden, unfortunately. The plot is not easy to follow. In any case, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Francis Lederer looks great as a concert pianist. He was a very handsome man, ten or fifteen years ago. He has never really been recognized as a major star, but he should have done so. <br /> <br /> It's not terrible, but it's pretty heavy.
