I saw this film last week at the Berlin Film Festival and my expectations were average. - The director is Bertrand Tavernier and I already knew some of his previous work in French cinema. I really enjoyed some of his previous films. -The actors: Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgard, Mary Steenburgen ... I could not wait to see all this talent on the screen. -I did not know the book he was based on and I had not read anything about the movie before, but I was told it was an investigative film taking place in the Great South ( we have seen many in the past). , maybe this one will be as good as the others ...) <br /> <br /> 2 hours later, the final titles appear: THANK YOU GOD WAS FINISHED !!!! - The plot is beyond comprehension. If you have read the book, you have a significant advantage. There were too many minor characters and many unnecessary arcs. We did not understand anything! - accents. My God! The accent of Tommy Lee Jones is correct, but I still have nightmares of the Cajun-French song of Mary Steenburgen ... - Bad casting in my opinion. I can not believe that old man Tommy Lee Jones can defeat the shit of a moron built by a linebacker ... And I'm not afraid of John Goodman. - Who were these people?!? We hardly understand who all these characters are and what they do. There is a bait shop? Tommy Lee Jones has a daughter from Guatemala? Bl√∂rg! - The comic attempts were pathetic. The funniest thing about the movie was probably his "action" and "suspense" scenes. They were horrible. No chills. Bad acting (Can Tommy Lee Jones make different faces or is he like Derek Zoolander?) ... - And then there's the science fiction stuff. No spoilers but it becomes ridiculous and boring. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write comments on IMDb but I found the movie so disappointing that I felt compelled to share my opinion. But it's just me ...
