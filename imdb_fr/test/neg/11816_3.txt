The title lets you know what you are getting. It's a howler of degree C but not as funny as I hoped. Directed by operating film specialist Eddie Romero, based on a story from Jonathan Demme (long before making "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this low-budget 1972 action movie has obviously was filmed in the Philippines but takes place in a Third World country. The superstar of the Blaxploitation Pam Grier plays the first half of the lead role, while Margaret Markov, forgotten, is the other half, Karen Brent, an improbable political revolutionary who resembles that of Patty Hearst's comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government . Naturally antagonistic to each other, they are in a women's camp where they wear yellow miniskirts of a yellow inexplicably as uniform. Managed by a caretaker and a lush matron, the prison is just an excuse for a long shower scene and some fighting heartless cats, Lee and Karen are opposed. Of course, they escape but are chained together at the "The Defiant Ones" and continue their fight of cats until they attack two nuns to steal their habits. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, various groups of sneaky men find themselves pursuing - the rogue drug lord in search of Lee who robbed him $ 40,000, the rather passive revolutionaries in search of Karen and the incompetent police (who suffer the humiliation of exposing their soldiers to the lord of drugs). Needless to say, everything ends up falling in the head but not before the free nudity on the part of a number of Filipina women, a dog wearing Karen's panties and some of the worst fashions of men's fashion of the 1970s (a revolutionary beer belly wears a leather top with face). The end is rather sad, but what is really sad is that part of the potential black comedy is totally missing in this hilarious ridiculous exercise. Unfortunately, Grier is disappointed by this release because his character is not allowed to do more than deal with all the "jive", while Markov is an Amazonian blonde that I am convinced she is desperately trying to be credible. Since no one has any talent to play, the rest of the cast is not worthy of mention, with the exception of Sid Haig, a bald guy with eyes on his eyes, who uses his classic psycho character as a drug lord. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer in supplement.
