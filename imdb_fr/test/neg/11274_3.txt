Thank God, I have a quick lead. I think it's a movie about a guy going up and down. It does not matter: it's a stupid cliche. It does not make any difference. There is this guy, Javier Bardem, who builds buildings or something. It does not matter. It is beautiful, this Javier Bardem. We do not care? I think there is a car wreck but I looked at it in advance, so ... who cares? The car wrecks and the beautiful heroes fighting against them feel melodrama for me. Javier loves someone, but he marries Maria de Madeiros instead. She is beautiful, poetically beautiful, with a heart-shaped face. Then, Javier has an oral interface with Maribel Verdu, who washes her vulva before, for some reason. One would think that Maribel Verdu, with her hand-washed vulva would be sexy. No she is not. It's a tedious story about a group of people who do not interest me. Javier, Maribel and Maria have a threesome: What a nuisance. This film is annoying. I think this could be a minor theme of (some) Spanish-language films: The rise and the foreseeable fall of a little guy who succeeds against all odds. Let me just clarify this: it's a high-class melodrama or maybe a soap opera. It's not worth your time except for laughing.
