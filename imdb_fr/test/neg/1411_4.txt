I found this vehicle Robin Williams rather fun at best.I guess you would call it a political satire of the kind.It is a political talk show host / comedian who decides to run for president and I win out of the box. I found most of the humor to dry up and Robin Williams is much more sober and quiet than usual. I would say that the film is more of a drama than a comedy, with a little mystery and suspense. I think the drama parts worked better than the comedy parties, and the mystery and suspense aspect (though it's a small part of the movie) worked out optimally. I would not give a very high score to this movie. For me, it was a good loss of 2 hours, but nothing special. My best advice would be to watch it on TV or cable, or rent it cheaply, before making a purchase decision. My vote for the man of the year is a 4/10
