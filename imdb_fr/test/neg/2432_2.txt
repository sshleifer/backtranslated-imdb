All this show is, is the same plot. Kuszko (spelling?) Is in danger of school failure, he needs to pass to become emperor. He needs to learn something he finds stupid. He then uses it / learns more and realizes that it's not so stupid. Eezma, posing as the principal, tries to turn Kuszko into an animal to stop him. Every episode. <br /> <br /> The jokes of the film are copied (incredibly complicated plans of Eezma, Kuszko constantly breaking the 4th wall, squirrels.) They should try to hire writers. <br /> <br /> 2 / ten
