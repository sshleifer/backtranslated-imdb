There is a part of a sequence where water rushes into the engulfed plane. Everything that happens in this film is an archive stock for Airport 77. You can even distinguish Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee in some shots. A total scam? Well almost by definition. The movie may contain more archive footage than in Plan 9 when viewed from space. <br /> <br /> All new material, actors sitting on a plane talking, is bland and terrible at all levels. Dennis Weaver is totally lost in a low-career film, although it's true for everyone except director Fred Olen Ray, who uses one of the many false names needed to keep working. <br /> <br /> There is a level of lean professionalism that makes this movie a waste of time, it would actually be better to shoot it with someone without any technical knowledge, because Ray just has enough knowledge to put together a scene in the worst old school TV. fashion that this film, like most of his films, is totally devoid of life. The worst kind of hacking work. The worst kind of movie. Boring. <br /> <br /> This type of film is a waste of money, a case where the team, at all levels, is a ghost who hopes to get the leanest paycheck and nobody will know either. will not be able to show up / participate in this scam. There are so many people who want to make movies that it's disgusting to see Ray spend the money given to him to do nothing, but to save time. <br /> <br /> His commentary track is interesting in that he must begin by explaining that he is really Fred Ray because he is not credited on the film itself. That led me to see him, do not let him fool you.
