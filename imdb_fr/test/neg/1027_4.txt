Technically abominable (with audible "noises" between scenes) and brilliantly amateurish, "Flesh" requires a lot of patience and will probably remain silent in front of most viewers; but the dialogue sounds incredibly true and Joe Dallesandro, who exposes his body in almost every scene, also gives a quite convincing performance. A curiosity, certainly, but the more refined "basket", realized two years later, constitutes a decisive progress. I suggest you look at that instead. (* 1/2)
