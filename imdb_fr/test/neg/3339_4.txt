Pretentious claprap, actualizing Herman Melville (!), About the vaguely incestuous relationship of a young man with his aristocratic mother who was transferred to his lost sister who was raised by gypsies. Or something like that ?? not that anyone really cares to unveil his multi-layered plot adorned with pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic images (siblings swimming in a river of blood) and other strange little touches (a Gypsy child repeatedly insults passers-by in the street she is beaten to death anonymously (loud music of a rock band used in the demolition of old buildings) Given the sources and the presence of Catherine Deneuve (who at least bathes in the nude) I was expecting a lot more from this one, apparently there is an even longer version of POLA X on TV ??
