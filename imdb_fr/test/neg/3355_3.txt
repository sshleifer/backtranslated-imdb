I really tried, but this movie just did not work for me. The action scenes were sad, the acting was surprisingly mediocre and some of these characters were TOO stereotyped to be fun. Pam Grier tries, but when you have nothing to work with, even her considerable talent can not prevent a disaster. Even by the standards of this weak genre, this film is rather bad.
