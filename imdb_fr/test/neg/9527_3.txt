As I understand it, the story is "based on real events". This can be good or bad, depending on the type of license used with these actual events and the way they are rendered. <br /> <br /> In this case, the results are sufficient to gag a fly. I was not expecting much - anticipating a story of rich high school students taking a deep-sea cruise under the guidance of a stern skipper. That is, what I imagined to be an age-old film resembling something about training camp or basic training, of the kind in which the sergeant instructor says: "My duty is to get you out of your seductive civil manners." Well, that's it, in a way. Children start as children and end up as an organic group. But it's a lot more hokier than any training camp movie I've ever seen, apart from a deliberate comedy. Who wrote this thing? The air is filled with slogans that belong, not in high school, but in third grade. Dialogue hurts the ear. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges usually does above average work, but in this case his performance is poor. It does not add anything to the game, even though, given its lines, it's hard to know how it could do a lot with them. The rest of the cast is not distinguished and some of the children are terribly inadequate. There are many tears and tears. The best scene involves a dolphin. <br /> <br /> Immature shots continue to the end. The Coast Guard plays the role of the hard core court in the post-disaster hearing. The interrogator is only hitting Bridges over the head with his misinterpretations and misinterpretation of events. "You let the crew drink alcohol, do not you?" (Some safe drinks.) "And you did not punish them, although you punished them for killing a fish." (The dolphin trade.) The technical details surrounding the sinking are confused. What is a "white grain" anyway? And if it's as dangerous as Bridges claims, why was not the entire crew alerted and wearing lifejackets? But why continue? If "The Albatross" was a Dreadnaught, he would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ridiculous scenario of the comic.
