Wow, did this episode start on a STOOOOOPID site! The Enterprise is racing when suddenly Abraham Lincoln floats in space and welcomes the Enterprise !!!!!!! Is it just me, or is it a really lame idea ?! Lincoln comes on board and they welcome them. Abe suggests they teleport to a barren planet, where they meet other famous people, dead or devastating. It seems like a really old-fashioned rock monster has brought together a BON and EVIL team to fight for supremacy. All this seems really daffy and inherently unfair, as the BON group is struggling with Surak - a Vulcan who gives Gandhi the appearance of Rambo !! Despite a totally AWFUL premise, the action is pretty good and it's great to see vertical shots of double sided fighting in this match reluctantly. But do not confuse this with great art or deep science fiction. The bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as a first run series and it really looked like having dusted this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise.
