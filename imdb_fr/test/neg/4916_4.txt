Not a good one. -Not at all. <br /> <br /> This slice revolves around the descent of the original murderer inside the home of Amityville who has to face his past to get rid of the nightmare terror of Amityville itself . <br /> <br /> It's basically nothing. My bet is that this film was shot to earn a little money to buy a boat or something like that ... because it is just ridiculous ... Fortunately, it does not kill or ruin the series but that has no effect on the series at all. <br /> <br /> I must say that the only fact that she constantly refers to the infamous old house is probably the only thing that makes this one slightly more bearable than "The Amityville Curse".
