This film deals with the complex friendship, romance and deceit between two men and two women during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Many efforts have been made so that "The Edge of Love" looks like the right time. However, I find this effort too excessive, especially with regard to the color tone. Most of the first half of the film is so transformed to have a pronounced bluish tone. It is difficult to distinguish who is who on this tone. <br /> <br /> Another disadvantage is the sophisticated use of an image division lens. There are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing, like Keira Knightley's three smiling faces or four pairs of arms in her arms. This makes the film confusing and difficult to follow, instead of being artistic. <br /> <br /> The plot, meanwhile, is simply boring. The way the story unfolds is not at all engaging. The unstable character of Sienna Miller is annoying. In fact, all the main characters are boring and inconceivable. Keira Knightley's accent is impossible to understand, which makes it an additional obstacle to understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> I strongly advise to avoid "The Edge of Love" unless you are watching a movie only to enjoy great costumes and beautiful scenery. and lighting.
