"This film is great! I watched it with friends and we thought it was proof that a movie does not have to be commercially successful to be a hit!" ... I would like to say about this movie. In the words of the film itself "you are very very bad!" I went to see an unlicensed acupuncturist so generally agreed with the moral of the film. <br /> <br /> I would include a spoiler, but the lack of intrigue makes the task very delicate. overall, a film disaster. <br /> <br /> quotes; you are not a leper at all! 'you are beautiful, and I bet you're nice too' 'have you ever seen the body of a naked man?' "you could not break a piece of straw." <br /> <br /> dubbing cameos; Micheal cane x3, harold bishop, steve erwine, benjamin netinyahoo, yoda.
