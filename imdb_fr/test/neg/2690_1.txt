I have long tried to understand why people like Shakespeare were so numerous, and every year I give them another chance. I was hoping that this play / film (my sixth Shakespeare play different) would unlock the coffin of luck and marry me with the riches of this literary Demigod. Well, I clearly chose the wrong key. <br /> <br /> Once the phrase "pound of flesh" was pronounced 10 minutes after the beginning of the film, the main parts of the plot are transparent, which corresponds to a languid writing. and acting lifeless. At each step, the plot is unveiled two scenes in advance. The idea that a dying aristocrat would persuade his daughter to choose her future husband by means of a lottery is incredulous. It is not a surprise to know who wins the marital jackpot because Bassanio is one of the main protagonists of the play .... and he is the third man to try .... and there has three coffins from which to choose ... and that his friend risks his life to pay the dowry. The only real surprise I had to watch this movie is that it did not stop right after the case was resolved. However, from the beginning of the ring betrayal, what was going to happen was obvious. <br /> <br /> OK, I know that millions of you love Shakespeare not for the surprise in the well-known stories, but for the depth and passion of the characters. But I did not feel anything for the characters. Rather than suspense and admiration during the hearing, I waited impatiently for it to be over soon. <br /> <br /> One day, I might find a Shakespeare play that does something other than bother me.
