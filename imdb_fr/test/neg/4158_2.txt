There is nothing worse than science fiction designed by people who have no idea. Grabbing a concept that would not be so terrible in itself (a future where cloning is common enough to make it a crime to reproduce with someone close to you genetically), the The screenwriter then let his pain go wrong. The imagination suited the race. <br /> <br /> When the character of Tim Robbins was able to guess the password of a security officer by simply asking him to tell him something about it, I knew I had trouble. This ability later proved to be due to the fact that Robbins had taken a "virus of empathy", viruses used to grant instant upgrades (or almost) skills to their users. Robbins' love interest complained about her own experience of such a virus - a Chinese-language virus that allowed her to speak Chinese, but as she complained, "she could not understand what she was saying ". First, empathy, no matter how intense, is not ESP. Without incorporating some kind of real mental reading (like an empathy virus that actively releases virions into the neighborhood, infects nearby people, recovers fragments from their memory, and then leaves for the original host - this which, as you can probably see, (a smidgeon on the impractical side) you can not justify being able to determine a specific detail like someone's password simply by "listening to things you do not have You can not either acquire the ability to speak a language without understanding what you say - the virus can not infect your vocal cords and translate for you on the fly, because a virus can not * think *. To give you the power to speak Chinese, such a learning virus should change your brain.It should encode knowledge among neurons, and once it's in, it's * yours * - you understand certain what you say, because you have to do it. To use your own brain to perform a task, you must understand this task (for the most part). Unless, of course, their film suggests that the virus was deliberately designed to set up a bizarre mental schema with multiple personalities, in which some of your sub-characters function as a one-way integrated translator. <br /> <The mixture of languages ​​spoken by the characters is quite correct, although it is not remarkable enough to justify all the love that other critics have given. In addition, all the multicultural insertions of the world can not compensate for a simple frustrating fact: the dialogue stinks! It's slow, it works, and it's not natural. Once again, I am sure that the believers have convinced themselves that dull strangeness is simply the result of an inspired genius that has created a truly futuristic language (and thus subject to a linguistic drift). I do not agree. A good dialogue is a good dialogue in all times - and so is the guts. <br /> <br /> Finally, I come back to the central concept of the film - the prohibition of sex with oneself. General cloning is a beautiful classic science fiction subject. The same is true of global warming leading to ecological devastation (which code 46 also integrates). Unfortunately, the two do not go together! If an ecological disaster significantly reduces the living space, do not nail people in cloning! You have enough population problems, you do not add anything by creating new programs. Classic and old-fashioned sex and birth provide the entire population you need and cloning of any kind would be ruthlessly suppressed. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the movie was not so bad. There was a beautiful cinematography. Maybe if I had watched it in silence, I could have appreciated it.
