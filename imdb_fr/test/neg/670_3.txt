In comparison with other dishes like "sand and sandal", the Egyptian leaves much to be desired. The film is based on Mika Waltari's well-researched novel, which focuses on the adventures of the Egyptian doctor Sinhue at the Akhnaton court, as well as his travels through Canaan, Minoan Crete and Africa. Unfortunately, due to the moral restrictions of the time, much of Sinhue's story (which is full of romantic and sexual exploits) remains on the floor of the editing room. The audience is rather invited to play with the actors of the wooden game of Victor Mature. Same Gene Tierney ?? a woman of "inescapable" head of the time ?? can not watch or play his best in this film and gives a rather somnambulistic performance that can only be justified by the fact that the actress had some serious psychiatric problems at the time. There is a lot of rhetoric and theological machinations about the idea of ​​monotheism over polytheism, but Michael Wilding is so tiring that the revolutionary Akhnaton, that one surely encourages someone to leave it and restore the old religion before the second round. My advice: buy the book at E-Bay, rent something more entertaining like Solomon and Sheba, then call it one night!
