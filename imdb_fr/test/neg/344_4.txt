This film is proof that you can not just go in a red box and read movie descriptions, pick one and try it. <br /> <br /> I will give them great credit for producing a film with special effects mid-course on such a small budget, and at least a scenario and a decent story ... Unfortunately, was that: midway. <br /> <br /> If you like movies where everything is wrong All are not perfectly packed and do not worry about low budget effects, you might like this movie. Honestly, it was not really my cup of tea. I should have gone to bed rather than spend my time watching. <br /> <br /> For a better sci-fi movie produced with an even lower budget (!), take a look at "Primer".
