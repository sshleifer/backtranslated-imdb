Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination that will lead to an excellent comedy. Great expectations often lead to disappointment, and this turns out to be the case. <br /> <br /> When Eddy spoils as a policeman a drug deal being concluded by Detective Robert, live the action reality TV show. Logic is not an important part of this film. The super-pistol they pass in pursuit of the film confirms it. A machine gun of twelve calibers that leaves big holes in the sheet and three that will destroy a house in about a minute (without reloading) is more a fantasy than science fiction. A five-pounder gun, firing hundreds of bursts per minute without recoil, is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this movie was not designed for adults or children, so if you are somewhere in between, this is the movie for you.
