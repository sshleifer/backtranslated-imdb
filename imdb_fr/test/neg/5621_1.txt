If you watch the documentary in addition, you will notice that the director is totally inexperienced and that he was in fact a colleague buddy of Quentin Tarantinos in a video store. Put two and two together and you realize that Quentin is doing a favor to his old bud, although the bud is rather talentless. Was it hard? Well see this movie and you will realize that this is not the case. Too slow at first, too absurd in the middle and too slow to finish. it sums up pretty much. Eric Stolz & Delpy were the only two to show charisma. And Kemp has actually achieved a satisfactory performance. But the rest was really bad. A case of stupidity in the plot occurred when "the lead thief" accidentally left his mask removed during the raid. So what's going on? Well, the other thieves decide that they can also withdraw theirs! What a good thought. The violence was relentless and insane. But not in a cool way. Rather ridiculous. I wondered if it was supposed to be a comedy. More stupid Tarantino to have his name connected to this trash. No more deceiving me to look at it.
