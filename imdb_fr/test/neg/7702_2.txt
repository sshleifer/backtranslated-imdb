The problem with this movie, like so many others that fail, is the script. <br /> <br /> The scenario is so vague that it stumbles in every way. What is the story here? OK, it's a biopic, but I think everyone will agree that a whole life can not be condensed in a hundred minutes. Some selections and editions are needed, but this script just was not selected or edited enough. Hoffman's life was not reduced to one or two determinable moments or themes to which the public could relate and, through them, to obtain the greatest image of the whole man. <br /> <br /> The movie strolls. from the biopic "troubled genius" who walks straight to the semi-docu / mocu-mentary (using new falsified shots to match archival footage), switching to the movie True Life Sob Stories of the Week (the all-a-son who does not know that I'm his dad "shtick), the political conspiracy theory film, etc. etc. He never decides what he wants to be, and the timid Citizen Kane looks like a structure narrative (interviewing people from Hoffman's past) is quickly abandoned, leaving the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with moments and incidents who do not contribute anything to the story and could have been cut to leave room to develop something more important.The whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after Vincent D'Onofrio banged the window, shouting: " I am Abbie Hoffman! I am Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! "(" I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing! ") Could easily have been cut off, all that's happening is that the psychiatrist says," You have bipolar disorder, here's lithium. "And the two women in his life say," We could see you more often on weekends. "And bang, that's all, no more mental health problems, it's a symbolic scene so ridiculously useless that it could have been, and should have been, thrown before it was shot, the scene where they are wreaking havoc and watching news reports from Viet Nam and where Hoffman calls GOD Useless, does not tell us anything. this is a crucial moment like the collapse of the drug, the film is so in a hurry that the situation comes only from the left field and does not make any sense to the public. heroin? Where does it come from? Why? What's going on here? <br /> <br /> Myself, as a middle-aged leftist, I suppose that I'm sitting in the target audience of this film, but even I got tired of the portrait of "The Man", "The Pigs", "The Fuzz", etc. like brutal, decent, thoughtless androids who hate hippies. It may have been like that in America in the 60s, I do not know, I was not there, but in the film it was a clumsy and inexpensive controversy. <br /> <br /> That said, Vincent D'Onofrio was convincing. Charismatic, the young Hoffman and I could watch Janeane Garofalo in anything, even reading a bus schedule, even though she just was not good for this part.
