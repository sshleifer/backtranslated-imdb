Without a doubt, the biggest film waste of the year. This film is badly structured, sadistic, cruel and filled with inimitable characters. On top of that, and perhaps the worst crime, it's uninteresting and extremely predictable. As soon as Bill Pullman's character scribbled on the picture changed the word "proof" into "violence", I understood the whole plot. There are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to look at this trash. The only feature that buys me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and I did not lose any money. I would be really angry if I had paid to see him in a theater. <br /> <br /> Anyone who qualifies this thing as a thriller really needs to go out more. A horrible film, horrible in all the areas that matter.
