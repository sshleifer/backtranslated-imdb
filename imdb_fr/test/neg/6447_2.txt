I value this one better than terrible, because I like to see Buffy's Jonathon, even if it's the same role. <br /> <br /> First of all, the concept is pretty cute for a short film, but not for an entire film. The writing was forced and artificial. I feel that the film has suffered the most during the editing. <br /> <br /> Second, Amanda Bynes always seems to cross her eyes - even if she does not try to do it. She's just not funny. She always plays a kind of maladaptive girl who triumphs by being herself - ironic, considering that Amanda always seems to be a caricature. I would like to see her in something serious. I really want to give her a chance, but she always plays in those banal roles where she wiggles and grimaces, which is a good thing? <br /> <br /> Finally, all the "I'm a Dork" segment was ripped off at Revenge of the Nerds. Nothing in this film was unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame, shame.
