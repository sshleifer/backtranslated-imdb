The original Road House is by no means an award-winning film. But it's one of the great guilty pleasures of all time. It should not have been so difficult to do a sequel. No need for big budget, big stars and spectacular visual effects. Even the story does not have to be original. All he needed was a good atmosphere and good fist fights. I do not mean "wire-fu" in the Matrix, but just well-choreographed fights. Many of them. There are some decent fights in the film, but none of them are memorable, and the focus is more on the gun game. Moreover, its link with the original film is laughable, even insulting. Johnathon Schaech plays Shane Tanner, a DEA secret agent gifted on the hands and feet. But here's the kicker ... he's the son of Patrick Swayze's character, Dalton !!!! Can you repeat that please????? Let's see, the original Road House was manufactured in 1989. So for Dalton to have a son in his late twenties (maybe even 30) in 2006 ... well, you see the idea. They explain that he lived with his uncle Nate (Will Patton) while his father "traveled a lot". Oh, please. That even almost guaranteed the closing of this film. But I go astray. Schaech is completely out of his element. Of course, he can kick things off, but he has nothing as an actor. Moreover, in the film, the bad guys call him a "handsome boy". I have never looked at men that way, but I do not think that guy is too handsome. He looks sick. His face is too thin and his sunken eyes give the impression that he will faint at any moment. I had never heard of him before, but I think he should stop playing and return to his daily work. Jake Busey plays the local drug racer, Wild Bill. Busey is not a terrible actor. He was good in Starship Troopers, and even made a threatening villain in Hitcher 2. But here he is just chewing the standard nasty mode setting. Even his "threatening" dialogue is worthy of yawning. We are supposed to buy him as the man who has the whole city in his pocket. But why? What is he doing? Because he wants to buy a Patton bar "by all means necessary"? Ellen Hollman has the role of symbolic girlfriend. A woman with a secret Too bad this secret is as difficult to understand as 2 + 2. She is the teacher of the local primary school who is a former soldier of the army. Guess what does this mean? This means that even if she fears for the majority of the film, she will be ready to break her head when the fur begins to fly. Oh well, at least she's hot. In fact, the fight between her and Wild Bill's daughter is the best of the movie. It's fast, brutal and fun. Which brings me to my next problem with the movie ... the fighting. As I said, Schaech knows how to throw a punch. The same can not be said for anyone he faces in the movie. Obviously, the film will return to Schaech against Busey. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. He does not have the skills to shoot from a movie fight. Swayze may have been a trained dancer, but his athletic abilities gave him the means to lead well-choreographed battles. He also faced two worthy opponents and had a fatal blow (literally). None of this here. With few exceptions, the fighting is forced, poorly organized and routine. The punches sound as if someone is hitting the concrete of a 2x4, and there are even two or three parts where the sound does not even match the punch. It's embarassing. There is not even the good Southern / Redneck music of the original. Road House had the band Jeff Healy, which was a rather popular band at the time. This film features a singer named John Otto, whose music is lukewarm and his game even worse. The film gave him a line, which was probably inserted to appease all his fans. Either that, or someone owed him a favor. My last complaint about the movie is the one just right ... continuity. The films are shot out of sequence, then it is up to the editor to reconstruct everything. Well, someone should give a boost to the publisher of this movie. The problems range from small things such as people not looking in the same direction when a shot changes, to RE-USED images at the end of the film. At first we are introduced to the bar, the Black Pellican. As the camera moves into the bar, you see the group, the bouncers and the people dancing. At the end of the film, when the villains have been defeated, we get another shot of the same bar, with inserts from our hero sitting at the bar with his daughter. The problem is that the footage of people in the bar corresponds to the SAME footage of the beginning of the film! I am not joking. They are the same people, standing (or dancing) in the same places, wearing the same clothes. Want to know the funniest part? You see bouncers in the shot who were killed earlier in the movie. Do yourself a favor, do not watch this movie unless YOU feel the need to go out and hit someone. This movie will make you angry enough to do it.
