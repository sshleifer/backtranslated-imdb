As a USAF MSG (Airplane Maintenance) retiree, this must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. the fact that a teenager can never fly, let alone get into an F-16 is ridiculous. The army spends millions on each pilot to be the best in the world and this film gives the air force and its members a semblance of stupidity at best. yes, I know it's just a movie, but it tells the kids that we're all idiots and believe me, we're not. the logistics required to set up any type of mission is very complex, even in the 1980s, military computers were too safe to be hacked by a teenager, and the other flaws in this film make Peter Pan more believable. sorry, for me, this movie has no entertainment value.
