I sat for 2 hours of pure boredom. I look here on IMDB, even if it is not at the top of the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little surprised. Even so, yes. I am very impressed by the acting abilities of Robin and Matt, they still have not saved the film. I'm not sure what I did not really like in the movie. It may be because I challenge mathematics. Maybe I'm not too much to talk bleak for 2 hours. Although I liked "American Beauty", but that was it. I just want to recover my 2 hours. It was a big waste of time. If I miss something in this movie, send me an e-mail. I am curious to know why this is among the top 250. And do not say "Because it was a good movie". <br /> <br /> 2/10
