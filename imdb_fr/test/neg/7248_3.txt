Yes, Edward G. gives us a retro vision of the world of criminal defense. It is an overzealous prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the presidency (played with passion, though briefly by DeForrest Kelly), then he is so filled with remorse that his only solace is the bottle. Add to that a bored love story, a really quick descent into scarcity and no scruples about who he stands for, and the next thing you know, Shazam! Black Leg Lawyer (god I love this sentence). He sees the light just in time to save his beloved jaded armchair. Yawning. <br /> <br /> But in reality, the action in the courtroom is pure melodrama. See him knock out a witness, see him drinking poison, see him arguing passionately as he grabs a bullet in his chest. Prepare yourself for melodrama. <br /> <br /> Jayne Russell is the maddening film. With curves defying the laws of gravity and an IQ approaching absolute zero, it is something to behold. Even sing a little.
