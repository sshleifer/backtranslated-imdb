By far the most racist and ghettoish design for kids ages 7 and up. Children watching this caricature will probably try to dress, talk and behave like the characters they represent. I am disappointed by Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for agreeing to broadcast this terrible program. The Wayan brothers can be good in movies aimed at young adult viewers. They should stick to the movies and stop doing episodes for this cartoon. Usually, young stars start working in movies and dubbing cartoons, and as they get older they turn to programs for young adults. Nick Cannon is a good example. He first appeared in All-That, then in MIB II, then Drumline, and now in his TV show Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'n Out, where comedians compete to tell inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally for Thugaboo, but I wanted to show examples showing that the celebrities that children watched on television not so long ago can become the ones who get involved in programs that are not intended for children. It's very sad that it happens, but all celebrities change and grow. It's just the opposite with the new Wayan cartoon. It's bad enough that we have to deal with all the bad people in the ghettos. By allowing the younger generation to watch this program, it will only convert children with opportunities to those who do not have the chance to live well. Just my feelings about this drawing and my beliefs about what will happen to our children if they look at it.
