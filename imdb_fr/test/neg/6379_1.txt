I tried to watch this show several times and found each time she was quite pale. <br /> <br /> The reason, to name just one, is that it is based solely on the ridicule of what Republicans have. completed. In short, it is essentially partisan political opinions characterized by humor. <br /> <br /> All that Mr. Stewart is doing is a madness of all that the Republicans have done and the public is getting wet with the delirium of bursts of laughter. I suppose the left is so devoid of real substance that it has to define itself according to its hatred for Republicans. <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> _____________________________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
