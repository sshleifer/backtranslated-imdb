This movie was just horrible. How could anyone like this movie, and those who loved it because of the jokes should really look in the mirror and wonder if the stereotypes are not bad. Ignoring the face of racial stereotypes, it was horrible. He never had his moments, if he paid tribute to the 1980s, "Plane!", He must pay a little more. A terrible actor's act, a terrible scenario writing, even for a movie with Mo'Nique or Tom Arnold. This movie was bad from the beginning, but people might have seen it all, thinking the plane was going to crash. One of the worst movies of all time, stay away.
