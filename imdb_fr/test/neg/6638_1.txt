"Chairman of the Board" is a ridiculously silly movie from the popular Carrot Top comic book (also featured in 1-800-COLLECT ads). He plays a surf inventor who falls on a man who has a puncture. Top helps him out and a few days later, discovers that the guy is dead and has given his company to the comedian. Even if someone else was in the role of Carrot Top, it would still be bad. The jokes (which are constantly faked) are terrible and the idea of ​​a romantic "plot" should have been ruled out. DO NOT LOOK!!!
