28 years before September 11, another September 11 marked a key date in the history of Chile, South America and the world. It was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende, the first democratically elected Marxist president in the world, thus ending the Chilean experience of democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is too biased and too nostalgic for the time of Allende's reign to be an objective restitution of man and his place in history. Times were troubled and Allende was a contested figure in the history of his country and the world. While he was democratically elected, his policies plunged Chile into an economic crisis. He was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship was followed by repression and flagrant violations of human rights, but he was also an ally of Castro who saw in his policy another way of to make the revolution. We will never know if his attempt to build a society that is both socialist and democratic would have succeeded. The film's authors adopt a totally pro-Allende position. There is no opinion or point of view that tries to explain the other part, to answer questions such as: why did the middle class oppose it? or being supported by Castro. The tone of the comments is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandist. People who want to better understand this episode of history must wait for a film or book more balanced and objective in the future.
