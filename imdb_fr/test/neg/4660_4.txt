I watched this film about six years ago and I did it again recently. If I remember correctly, I did not like it at all the first time and I enjoyed it a little more this second time. <br /> <br /> This film obviously has a big budget. The effects are mostly of superior quality (with the exception of one or two "impacts") and the distribution is impressive. However, some elements destroy the overall impression of the show. <br /> <br /> First, whoever decided that Peter Stormare should act as a crazy Russian astronaut should be fired. Swedish and Peter's fan, I'm pretty sure he can play a Russian character. But his performance in this case is simply stupid, both with regard to the lines set out and the acting of the actors. So ... something is wrong with the script. I would rather see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is almost unbearable to watch them. It is total chaos that lasts more than thirty minutes with too little time to catch one's breath. Moreover, the events that are happening are simply not credible. I would like to see a much more sensible and simplified version of this part of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, scenes involving space shuttles are too biased. The shuttles maneuver as if they were two MIGs, at a safe distance zero, while bouncing on blocks of ice the size of a car, like ping-pong balls. The director should look at Apollo 13 to know the limits of spacecraft like these. <br /> <br /> I like the score, because it is dramatic to the point of making it very touching. The overall performance of the actors is excellent. Aside from the things mentioned above, the story is interesting and quite easy to follow. <br /> <br /> With a few minor modifications, it would have been a 8/10 movie. I'm sorry, it's not!
