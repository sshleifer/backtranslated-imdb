I just saw this stinking old boiler on TV. Better supervised with a very large bottle of Dr. Jurd's Jungle Juice on hand, this exploitable cheese festival is hilarious. On the positive side (very thin), Raquel was in her physical physical state, she looked good and could be seen a good bit of herself as she plays a go-go dancer; she had big legs, that's for sure. There is also a minor interest for moviegoers in Los Angeles images ca. '69, and identifying actors in minor roles who have continued to improve things. Veteran Ron Rifkin ("brothers and sisters") delivers his first performances as "Sailor", the "fagot junkie" bartender who takes Raquel to the bad guy. You can also recognize the armed security guard in the hit-and-run scene - this is an early appearance of Gordon Jump, who gave such a fine performance in "Soap" as a piece of Chelief Tinkler. <br /> The plot of 'Flareup', as it is, follows the course of an exotic dancer (Welch) on the run from her murderous ex-husband (Luke Askew). This turkey is a classic Hollywood mud produced on the production line: a number-by-number scenario, pedestrian directions, fun photos, tweaks and effects, ultra-cheesy background music, plywood sets, and more. corresponding performance. <br /> <br /> The cast is as uniform as the script. Although Raquel is able to perform well in the right vehicle, this old wheez is so bad that she does not really have a chance, any more than the public. One of my favorite moments happens when Raquel wakes up in the hospital, sees the Vegas policeman chasing after her ex-murderer and asks, "How did you get here?" - which he answers of course "In an airplane". Oh, humanity ... And you will not be able to look away from the doctor (Michael Rougas), who has what might be one of the worst clashes in the long, sad history of bad cameos. I do not think I've ever seen anyone stand in such a bad place before. <br /> <br /> The love interest of Raquel Joe (James Stacy) walks in the film with a frozen look somewhere between puzzled and embarrassed - and not surprising. This bombshell features almost all the televised snapshots of the book, from Raquel's dreadful horrible trick in mounting the dreadful nightmare to the sheer ride of the romantic promenade straddling the beach of Leo Carillo. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler Warning ** - The only interesting thing in the whole movie is the denouement, in which Raquel finally recovers his back and decrees the title hilariously by setting fire to the villain. Whoever the stuntman really earned his money on this one - he rides like Yorba Linda in a heat wave. Yet even this rather spectacular scene is compromised by the fact that the crew approaches a ball towards the end. <br /> <br /> There are so many crappy things about 'Flareup' that it's strangely convincing; I wondered if this could be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The answer seemed to be a resounding "yes" ... until I saw the movie that followed, the classic Roger Corman's "Big Doll House", "The Big Dollhouse", propelling Awful to a whole new level. I can warmly recommend these two shlockers as a double bill. You will laugh stupid yourself.
