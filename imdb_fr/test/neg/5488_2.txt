The story is that a cast of turn-of-the-century actors, as well as producers and movie theater owners, have very complicated relationships. A resident playwright wrote a psychological drama. He wants to have a good production on stage, but can not convince a particular critic to return to production and give a positive critique. If his production does not continue, the troupe will put The Doll House, recently written by Ibsen. Many different relationships between the main ones are explored; none of them interesting. But the involvement of the characters with each other leads to a second blow to the play by the resident playwright. <br /> <br /> This film is a pure excuse for the director and his friends to get together and make a film. . The stories are inconsistent for anyone who is not a friend of one of the stars. The only reason I did not leave the theater after about half an hour was that a fat lady was eating a full meal over her belly at the end of the row.
