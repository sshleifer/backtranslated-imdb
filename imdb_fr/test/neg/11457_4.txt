Not all films made in 1931 are so cute, and the fact that it is the "Best Film" should give even more impetus to the development of television. <br /> <br /> What is typical of all Ferber novels is not the case. possible to bring the whole story to the screen, not to mention the development of the character. Ten - so solid in the first third of the film - makes a face, but no one knows why and that makes no sense. And what is it about Dunne that makes her so stoic? The scenes of Edna May Oliver are priceless, as usual. <br /> <br /> This film has a role to play in the history of cinema, but it is long and boring.
