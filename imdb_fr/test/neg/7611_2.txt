I had never seen IMDb before, but this documentary is so overvalued that I felt compelled to express myself. I would not even finish watching if I had not been invited to someone's home. The film was mediocre on several levels: First - Treadwell's video footage was artificial. The more I watched, the more he seemed to act as a person desperate to be famous instead of acting out of conviction. <br /> <br /> Second - The others in the film, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were as artificial and as lame as him. God, they seemed artificial. <br /> <br /> Third - Treadwell's mission to protect bears makes no sense, because it has done more harm than good by forcing bears to become accustomed to human presence. I think Treadwell really liked bears, but there is a lot of research that indicates that his efforts have been misguided. Sometimes we have to give up wild life to really help them. <br /> <br /> Fourth - The entertainment value of the film was not half that of other wildlife movies such as "The Penguin March" and "The Winged Migration". In my opinion, the filmmakers mis-sequenced the scenes and encouraged them to watch less. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Alaska, bears and other wildlife, I would love to see more people dedicated to preserving our natural spaces. Hopefully their efforts will be less focused on people.
