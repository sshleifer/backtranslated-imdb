I say "film" because it does not deserve the name "film", and certainly not "film". I regret having paid for the rental, and although I have never been out of a movie before, it would have been the same if I had seen it at the cinema. An underground society in the future (oooh, THIS IS THE ORIGINAL), many barrels of barrel, an unexplained ambient light shining through the windows, an ungrateful woman and her suffocated son ... the list goes on and even. C. Thomas Howell affects the hoarse voice of the stereotypical loner; you know how Eastwood was made to death. He needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and child. Yet, in flashbacks, he is the same age! You speak of a bad memory! I looked incredulous when the little boy Abe randomly pushed a code in a door and it opens! No tension, religious pithy (what religion?) Sub / tones ... sad of all: I was expecting better from Roddy Piper; <br /> <br /> Most likely the worst movie experience in my life.
