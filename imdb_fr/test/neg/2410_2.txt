I did not really know what to expect from "Future-Kill", but I certainly hoped it would be a little better than what I had. I knew the rating was bad and the reviews were unfavorable, but the cover illustration of the DVD Subversive seems more than cool and I can not resist that. For a very long time (too long in fact), this film gave the impression of being an unofficial sequel to Porky's with lame, vulgar and offensive jokes of fraternity. Five mega-dorks, one of which looks like an exact young clone by Jim Carrey, desperately want to become members of a fraternal home, but their ultimate initiation may well be a little exaggerated and dangerous. They are dropped in the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces, at the same time as the outbreak of a violent gang war. It does not take long before they face Splatter, a seemingly half-man, half-machine warrior who runs a gang that I never really understood who he was or who he was. Is this a government experiment? Cyborgs? Terminator imitations of a distant future? Does anyone care? "Future-Kill" is a strange amateur film with a scenario that jumps from one subject to another without any form of logical or narrative connection. The plot borrows elements essential to cult classics such as "The Warriors", "Escape from New York" and "The Terminator", but the end result is a gigantic monstrosity of science fiction. The costumes and special effects are pretty pitiful and there is a bunch of free and cheap nudities. The acting is terrible, but I'm ready to blame the delayed dialogues instead of the members of the cast. One to avoid at all costs, despite a DVD sleeve really cool. Resist!
