If you like low SEs, (some) bad actors and a total lack of credibility, this is a movie for you. So a really cheap movie, but I liked it anyway. Why? Because I like this kind of movies. I can not help but smile at seeing these kind of movies ... What were the producers, the actors, the director and the people of SE thinking when they made this movie? Do not expect an "abyss" or an "extraterrestrial", but just a horror / adventure movie with a very small budget. <br /> <br /> There is a nice "splashing moment" when a man's head is shot, but for the most part, the horror is pretty tame. The final monster is also pretty cool. <br /> <br /> It only lasts 73 minutes, so you can not go wrong. Maybe you can pick it up at your local video store or watch it on TV. I'm sure you'll have a good time watching it. <br /> <br /> But do not say you have not been warned .............
