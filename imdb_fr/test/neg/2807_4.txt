As has already been mentioned in other comments, the main problem of the NVA is that it can not decide what it wants to be, a slapstick of the cheapest kind or an honest parody of the army is -German. Some moments are very moving, for example when one of the recruits returns from the Schwedt military prison with a completely broken personality. But in the end, Leander Hau√ümann focuses on infantile humor. No wonder the film failed at the German box office because it is historically unfaithful to the actual situation in these training camps and is led by an actor who is unfortunately unable to give a nuanced performance. <br /> <br /> Camera of Frank Griebe who, as always, does a remarkable job. Without his beautiful images, I would have evaluated the film much worse.
