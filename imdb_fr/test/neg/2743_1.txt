In the wake of the well-received and acclaimed classic film about teenage life as an adult, George Lucas's American graffiti, we have Cooley High. Eric Monte, co-creator of the popular 1970s CBS sitcom, Good Times. <br /> <br /> Cooley High was and is still considered a black version of American Graffiti. Instead of the American Graffiti, Chicago's Cabrini Green's black dump is the backdrop of the story. Instead of America in 1962, Cooley High is located in 1964.The movie stars Welcome Back Kotter, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman are the main protagonists of the film and its main characters. Garrett Morris plays the role of principal who tries to keep the characters of Jacobs and Turman, named Coceise and Preach, safe from trouble most of the time. <br /> <br /> You know, I'd like to say that Cooley High is a comparison worthy of American Graffiti or a great movie, but I can not. The problem lies in the fact that the film's producers could not or would not want to hide the dark side of black life in America. Taking the film in Chicago's Cabrini Green neighborhood does not help things. <br /> Here again, rough attempts at humor. When Coceise searches for a letter of intent from a college, he discovers that his little brother has thrown a toilet. When the gang goes to the Chicago Zoo, one of the gangs named Pooter is thrown manure by a monkey. When Turman's character, Preach, is pursued by two thugs in the school's den (a dirty, depressing place to eat food in a lot less people), he opens the girls' bathroom door that a girl gets up he escapes through the window of the same bathroom! The high school, the houses of the characters, the bathrooms, all over the film show the unhappy look of urban decadence and poverty. <br /> <br /> If that was not enough, there was a brutal lack of humor in the film. The use of violence and profanation in the film. Cooley High may be a hit movie, but it's a difficult movie, with little or no wit, and likes to use the nostalgia that has made people like and appreciate American graffiti. <br /> <br /> Motown Records participated in the making of the film. The company's music was part of the film's soundtrack. But even in this case, you have the feeling of the same age that you have already heard these songs a million times. Not that they are not great songs in themselves, but black music, this period was more than just the Motown. Especially in Chicago. The song towards the end of the movie, by G.C. Spinners Cameron, was not so impressive. There is no doubt that the best Motown artists have made better ballads to Motown than Cameron. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film shows where the characters went to pay homage to the film Cooley High. , American graffiti. This shows that Preach, a smart but underperforming student, went to Hollywood and became a successful TV writer. Eric Monte may have modeled himself as the character of Turman. The last shot of Preach, fleeing Coceise's funeral, was a dark and rainy afternoon, and all the sadness that Cooley High has come to represent. Eric Monte, through Preach and this final scene, had a little lesson for all of us when we look at Cooley High and for the sake of the past. Do not look back.
