what a waste of time! I was expecting better from cameron diaz! I guess it was not really his fault to be in a terrible movie. the film does not capture the beauty of europe ..... and failed to bring the audience into suspense or wonder. Weak attempt at storytelling and narration - the dialogue is dull and has not been able to convey what I sometimes think that simplicity is beauty. no love, energy, electricity on the screen. never mind !!!!!!!! 1
