This film examines the now infamous Wannsee conference, where leading Nazis gathered to discuss the organization and implementation of the "final solution". First of all, I was amazed to see Kenneth Branagh play the role of a Nazi. With blonde blond hair in the back, he certainly looked like the role but he did not really play the role well. The threat and cruelty did not exist and in the end, he came out, looking like a cheerleader who was smiling, holding the meeting. The real Heydrich would not let the conference go out of control as in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth, who played the role of Dr. William Stuckart, the one who wrote 1935 The Nuremberg Race Laws and who gave the "legal respectability" to everything what did the Nazis do? Firth's performance was staggering, the main vocal opponent of what Heydrich was proposing. The best part of all was when he was verbally dressing one of the Nazi hooligans. The thug whispered, "I'll remember you," and Firth replied "you should, I'm very well known!" The film is historically accurate, but let's sum it up to what it really is: 90 minutes of a group of men gathered around a table to chat, shout and boast. There is no excitement, no real conflicts (except the brief argument). It's just 90 minutes of conversation! Same room, same table, same people. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that the DVD is worth it. For my part, I felt escaped.
