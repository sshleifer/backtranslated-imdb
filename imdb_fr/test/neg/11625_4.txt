When I was little, I absolutely loved The Swan Princess, it was reliving the same fairy tales of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, the princess and her prince who save the day is always a timeless story that will never die, well, I hope. But I thought I would take a look at The Swan Princess' suites to see how they were. Unfortunately, this is the typical cartoon suite that disappoints more than entertaining. The only character I always found very entertaining was the queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part. But with the changes of voice, they were noticeable and bothered me a bit too, I did not want to be difficult, but it was too weird for me. The story was also borrowed from the first Swan Princess, but the villain of this film follows in Rothbart's footsteps. <br /> <br /> Odette and Derek are about to celebrate their first birthday, but Derek has been too preoccupied to fight for his kingdom to keep him safe. As his mother's birthday approaches, he forgets it because there's a new villain in the city, Clavious, who hopes to go beyond Rothbart's power and kidnap the queen on his birthday. But Odette must convert to a swan to help Derek fight him and save his mother. <br /> <br /> The Swan Princess 2 is more than good for children, it does not bother me, it's good own pleasure for them. If these suites are disappointing, it is because they are generally for children, but it is more pleasant to enjoy the jokes and history of everyone. Now there are some laughs and chuckles here and there, but it was not as clever in my opinion as the first Swan Princess. I would recommend it to toddlers, but if you are looking for a fun animated film, I recommend staying with the first Swan Princess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
