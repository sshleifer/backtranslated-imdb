The basic idea of ​​ENCHANTED AVRIL is excellent: two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To cope with the extra costs, they bring in two more foreigners. What makes it interesting are the relationships before and during these holidays - in particular, they show how this beautiful setting really changes their outlook on life. Unfortunately, this good idea is totally ruined by two key performances in the overall formation that are so bad that they ruin the film. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film so as to make her ridiculous. Her expression "doe eyes" and her vacant looks really make you wonder if it's not a zombie movie or if she's just supposed to be an idiot! And to make matters worse, Reginald Owen plays a character so odious and so explosive that I was about to close the film - it was so terrible and incredible. I noticed that at least one critic attributed this film to a 10, which is very, very difficult to understand. Of course, the film has a good atmosphere and a good plot, but these two performances as ridiculous as possible can not be neglected because they undermine the rest of the image. Sorry, but this movie hurt me again!
