Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie. Less than 50 billion out of 10. If you want a hard action, do not rent it! If you want a good independent film, look elsewhere! <br /> <br /> I never thought I'd see Burt Reynolds in such a shitty movie. He has the slimmest line of intrigue ever. The films of Van Damm should win an Academy compared to this one. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe proves once again why he is not the most popular actor in the world. Even Hasselhoff would have made a better addict than him. I do not want to bother you with more facts about this shitty movie, except to say that you'd better rent something from Hulk Hogan or Dolph Lundgreen. This should prove my point of view, if you understand my drift. <br /> <br />
