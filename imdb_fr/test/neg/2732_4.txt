"The Core" meets "Crack in the World" (1965 for television). The acting game is stock, the suspense predictable. Once you subtract the entire plot taken from "The Core" - basically the inhabited drilling machine - you end up with the plot of "Crack in the World". "Crack" was really a great movie with Dana Andrews. His team of scientists, working in South Africa, exploded and "pierced" with a nuclear device to provide a stable source of geothermal energy. One of his subordinates, also a brilliant scientist, does not share this opinion. He thinks the blast will not make a single hole, but will create cracks in the crust. (Spoiler possible) He is right. To prevent the resulting crack from destroying the Earth, they must place another nuclear device on the path of the crack. <br /> <br /> Although I placed a spoiler warning, I do not know if I really spoiled something for one or the other movie. And since "Crack in the World is only available in a very rare VHS format, if my decision not to reveal if the counterattack works is probably academic. <br /> <br /> All in all, I evaluates "Descent" just below average.
