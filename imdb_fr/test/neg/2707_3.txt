Laughs are rare in this boring movie, and I can not help but wonder how this mess was created. Griffin Dunne's talent is pretty much what's good in this film, but his best efforts have been easily overshadowed by Madonna's odious performance. I could sit through all of this without getting tired of it, but it's probably the nicest thing I can say about this wasted time.
