I've been a big fan of Lynn Peterson since her decisive role in the hit movie "Far North" in 1988, and although I loved her in her other movie "Slow" (2004) where she plays "Francis", it's is by far its strongest role. <br /> <br /> Lynn, I'm sure you all know (or should), plays the essential role of "Pilot". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, others I think this movie does not have much to do. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait, there was something else: the incredible creativity of the editing to eliminate the blasphemies of the viewers. . Memorable lines such as: "You, gun son!", "You, witch son!", "Shoot!" And "Well, you must forget!" <br /> <br /> O.K. Hi. <br /> <br /> P.S .: Does anyone know where I can get another poster from Lynn Peterson?
