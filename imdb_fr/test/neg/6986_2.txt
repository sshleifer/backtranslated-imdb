Don Wilson plays the role of a cop who likes to play virtual reality occasionally, but things go wrong when game makers decide to take virtual reality to the next level by creating real characters from the video game. Okay, they make models in cybersex as a prototype but the main villain of the video game wakes up and starts killing people and now the only man who can beat him is Don Wilson, who falls in love with the cybersex model. In fact, with all the things considered, my biggest confusion was trying to figure out if people brought back from virtual reality were robots, humans, cyborgs or just a type of unidentified computer program. It does not matter, because it's just an excuse to watch one of the worst actors ever interacting with a butcher like he's running a deli. The total lack of charisma of Don Wilson is the biggest flaw of the film because we do not like the type, he is too kind, his voice is too acute and does not look very impressive in the action sequences . Athenia Massey, who looks super hot in ribbed outfits and undresses from time to time, makes me forget what holds me the lowest. Loren Avedon (a good martial artist), Stella Stevens and Michael Dorn are the main voices of the villain, but their efforts are in vain, because they are all hidden under the bad game of Wilson. Another flaw, which is the movie's biggest mistake, is the lack of action, as we are asked to watch the story unfold, but aside from Massey's nakedness and perhaps some unintended fun due to a game ridiculously unconvincing, there is really nothing interesting. This also extends to action sequences in which are choreographed flat, misdirected and completely drained of any possible excitement. Make it virtually unassailable. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
