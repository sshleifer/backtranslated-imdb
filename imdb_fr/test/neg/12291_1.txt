I'm sorry, but I do not understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought Ethan Mao was. I saw a better development of actors, characters and intrigues in porn! WARNING: I will give a key element of the "plot". After holding his family hostage for one night, Ethan leaves his ugly, mean, hated stepmother going to the bank - ALONE !!! - to recover the piece of jewelry from his late mother that he desperately needs. Guess what? She's calling the cops! Wow ... what a twist! I could not see him coming at all. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that it did not last more than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Pure and flawless waste!
