An American goes to Paris after the suicide of his mother, becomes an artist, then discovers and returns to the United States to rectify the situation with his old friends. <br /> <br /> I have to think that the people all fans of X-Files, even if there are no strangers or serial killers, are very much appreciated by this movie. Do not be fooled, this movie blows pieces. <br /> <br /> The story is incoherent, with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. When you get an explanation, it does not match the story that preceded it. What it does is annoy you. For all the acting talent in the film, it's not interesting. I spent the whole movie wondering when Duchovny, a sex addict, was going to hit someone. Maybe he was doing it behind the scenes; They should have filmed that instead. <br /> <br /> The story of a conscientious artist who worries about minor incidents in his life and tries to fix them - even if they did not seem bad at first. There are no particularly interesting or shocking revelations, despite the mention of a big secret in the first minutes. He's just a guy who thinks his life is as good for him as it is for him. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> I saw in the anecdotes that Duchovny claims to have written the script in one week, it's quite credible. The guy can play without a doubt, but writing and directing go far beyond his talents. <br /> <br /> Why Hollywood continues to shine a spotlight on these self-discovery stories, I do not think so. I find myself in the shower every morning but I do not mind doing a movie about it. Mine would probably be better than this one, though; at least there would be nudity.
