This film is null beyond any limit. It's amazing - a very bad scam of Jaws and other (best) shark movies. A very bad one - everything is really pathetic. The story is pure shit, the actors are bad, the effects very cheap, no creativity whatsoever. Looks like really debilitated kids took the Jaws script and arranged it randomly, then his parents took their 8mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors. The music is really inappropriate, just elevator music, bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens, then a little less optimistic when a shark is there or when the kids get depressed (listen again to VERY elevator music HOUETTE). Carlo Maria (the author) should be so ashamed that he should ask that his name be erased titles !! The film shows how crap music will destroy *** ANY scene *** supposed to be thrilling. Jaws, however, has a major difference: at the beginning of Jaws, it is about stupid people who try to kill sharks with dynamite. Well, there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. When that does not work, the guys take a big load of dynamite and spend like 1/4 of a movie putting explosives in a sunken ship. It's a very original way to catch fish, I must admit! They use so much dynamite that they would try to kill a battleship (I guess the Bismarck battleship class) or dig another Panama Canal. It's just amazing. I'm glad they did not try to use a napalm flamethrower or a tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this nasty shark by about 2m. Well, there is an endangered Indian mystic (who looks like a German retiree) also in this mess. It's not a movie, it's an example of a warning, how bad movies can be! As a warning, it is useful. But the public should be protected from this shit. Most Italian films are bad, but that ... it's really exceptional in the worst sense of the word.
