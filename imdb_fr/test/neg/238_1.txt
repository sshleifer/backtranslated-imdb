A bunch of confusing and confusing shit south of the border. I have watched it twice and I do not know exactly what was going on. It had something to do with a stupid Aztec mummy, a "human robot" who is the stupidest robot I've ever seen, and a woman who is the reincarnation of an old Aztec chick. Most of the story is told with painful slowness and insight by an incredibly boring scientist. This guy is a wonderful sleep aid. His enemy is a big slob called The Bat, which is a rather unimaginative name for a diabolical scientist. <br /> <br /> I guess the boring scientist and his worm-eaten wizard dug up the mummy, and what a shocking, female scientist has just been the reincarnation of the mom's girlfriend. They keep the mother perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I suppose, so that the careless villain can steal it. It takes him five years to do it, because he invented a "human robot" to steal the mummy, attack it, and so on. He is looking for a treasure that the mother has, to be able to be rich. But, excuse me, if the guy had this huge intellect and a strong will to succeed, why did not he patent some of his ideas and get rich this way? <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I guess that would make too much sense. Instead, there's a ridiculous brawl between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one of them looks like a fake thing or something else. To tell you the truth, I looked at this because I was thinking of a movie with a name like The Robot Vs. The Aztec Mummy just had to be fabulously old-fashioned. Instead, it was just terribly horrible and confusing.
