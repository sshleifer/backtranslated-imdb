Based on a rather bland "bestseller", this film - like most of Lifetime's other films - played more like a reenactment than a real movie. The only difference was that Meredith Baxter was not there. The women in this group do not age even after 20 years and the acting of the actors in general is rather bad. <br /> <br /> The characters were clich√©s and one-dimensional. The story was of the nature of cheese. I would not recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who love the book and those who watch this network all the time will think it's great. I only looked at her because my girlfriend wanted to see him so as not to have to read the book that his sister had lent him. It was not for someone like me - my girlfriend cried a little at the end, so she did not think it was as bad as me.
