As a baseball history enthusiast, especially in the early 20th century where Cobb was a leading figure, as well as many colorful characters, I was eager to see this film on baseball. Well, it was not a baseball movie, which was disappointing. No, it was just the story of a sportsman who told that he had rubbed Cobb later, while both players were collaborating on a book. Even then, it could have been a more appealing movie than they had done. <br /> <br /> Granted Cobb was anything but a nice guy, an extremely talented but brutal player in that he would do anything to beat you. ... and he was slimy, intimidating and had a lot of demons to fight. He was so hated that his own teammates tried to compromise his chances of winning a title batting a year. Nevertheless, it is an exaggerated representation of man. That makes him almost a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Looking and listening to an old man screaming, letting go and being profane for two hours is entertainment? No it is not. One day, I'd like to see a real Cobb biopic show it in his ball game days and if they want to portray him as a villain, so be it, but the way they did it here with just an old bitter and blasphemous blasphemy to be sodomized in front of a reporter is not fun to watch.
