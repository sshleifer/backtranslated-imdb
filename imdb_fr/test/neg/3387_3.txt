Last night, I sat in my TV room, a beer in hand, a bowl of pretzels on the TV set and decided to put the movie "Monster Man" in my trusty VCR. Expect a fun movie, gore, crash & bash. What do I get instead? One of the most stupid, stupid, fearless and predictable movies I have ever had the displeasure of attending. And what's even worse, throughout (and I use this vaguely following phrase) "sex scene" the girl keeps all her clothes! I'll do this short and sweet summary: mix "Dude Where's My Car" (about a good half of the movie) with a very diluted "Hitcher", add a redneck version of the "I Madman" antagonist the main villain and finally a Black and incoherent gibberish and you'll get an idea of ​​how this movie is rotten. It is also quite predictable. The only notable factor of this boyfriend movie disguised as "horror movie" is that some moments between the two guys (even though the "hero" is a boring geek MAJOR and the other is a clone of Jack Black) (c 'that is to say quite funny, that is to say like most sketches of SNL). Other than that, "Monster Man" is a monster mess! 3/10 (This one that I will distribute at Halloween time - I hope right after the person has seen it I will not see my house get worse or worse)
