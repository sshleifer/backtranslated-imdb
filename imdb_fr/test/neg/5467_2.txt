Many questions arise about the making of this film. The first is: why make a movie that is little more than an awkward female fantasy? It's one thing to let an audience with problems discuss the intent of a movie. It's a completely different thing to get into the process of writing a scenario that does not properly address real human problems before they are displayed on the screen. Why this outrageously melodramatic and often comic soundtrack? Why this excessive and often clumsy dialogue? Why is the main character's girlfriend one of the hooded kidnappers? What is the purpose of turning into a joke the fact that the main character is no longer the victim of an abduction by doing his "mission"? (This is a classic Australian film moment - use the quirky comedy at the wrong time.) Why so many scenes where nothing happens? (That's about 15 minutes of the movie, which is at least 30 minutes too much.) Why, if a man is imprisoned for so many days, does not he try to make a serious escape attempt? <br /> <The director, who co-wrote the screenplay, failed in many ways to deliver a satisfying story. <br /> <br /> Dave Garver, Australia.
