For an unknown reason, 7 years ago, I watched this movie with my mother and sister. I do not think I have laughed so much with them before. This movie was so bad. How the suites were produced is beyond me. It's been awhile since I did not see this "film" for the last time, but the only impression it has on me over the years is this: "They had to find the scenario in a dumpster in the back of a cheap film studio, turned into a "movie", and decided that it was not enough, and that it got worse, I'm pretty sure they spent their entire budget on camera and so-called "special effects", then that they had 13 cents scenario AND pay the "actors".
