I must say that Krasinski is the only reason I even watched this movie. It is good. However, all the rest of this film is so below average that the time and effort spent viewing this movie is not worth it. <br /> <br /> This film presents many technical and aesthetic problems: selections of shots, framing, camera movements in monologue sequences, extremely bad editing (probably due to the total lack of fluidity in and between shots), and terrible action game (except for Krasinski). <br /> <br /> It was far too theatrical and presentation) to develop all kinds of suspenseful moments in this film ... which is surprising because it is a bank robbery, which should be at least a little exciting. <br /> <br /> How can such a bad film be made, then published, AND THEN distributed? <br /> <br /> It reminds me a little of a C-film student's thesis project, probably not so good.
