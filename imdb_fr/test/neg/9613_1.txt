Greeted with derision by most critics when it first appeared, "Frenzy" recently toured British television. I remember seeing him on his initial release and then thinking that if Hitchcock wanted to parade some sort of on-screen confession about his entrenched misogynist, he could not have found a smaller vehicle more nasty to do it. <br /> <br /> But the weather is changing, so what was nauseating in 1972 could, all these years later, be worthy of an upward reassessment. <br /> <br />. . but no. "Frenzy" is dirt. The grime of an aging filmmaker who desperately wanted to exploit the artistic freedom of 1970s cinema without seeming to realize that freedom imposes its own obligations - including the need to make one's work work. <br /> <br /> There is no here. And not a lot of evidence of the previous brilliant staging either - the transition from the implicit to the explicit odious is neither shocking nor elegant, for a stylist supreme: stylish: it is simply banal (the scene of Prolonged murder is precisely that: prolonged, without rhythm, without reason, without any other purpose than the cheapest directors to want to appear as a contemporary artist like, for example, this other famous practitioner of cheap sleaze, Michael Winner ). <br /> <br /> And it goes from bad to worse, with a dialogue that defies any human origin (especially in the ridiculous diversion of the daily life of our dear wooden inspector and in the kitchen of his wife). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the scene that best sums up the "frenzy". (and persists as the most explicit indictment of Hitchcock's character) is the insidious exchange between two lawyers in a bar, where they discuss serial murders and agree that at least the women had a good time first by being raped. <br /> <br /> I remember my revulsion at This scene dates back to 1972, and it still has not been removed, because it's not Hitchcock who was smart, sardonic or trying to argue a universal point of view (the great themes, the great truths, were neither the strong nor the personal preferences of Hitchcock). Just Hitchcock, allowing his reflection of his own distorted mirror of life to shine through the texture of the film. <br /> <br /> Calling 'Frenzy' Hitchcock's latest great masterpiece is to betray little or no understanding of what Hitchcock actually has actually achieved in the path of cinematic trickery, cinematic thrills and dazzling cinematic mastery. <br /> <br /> "Frenzy" is now what it has always been: a cheap, naughty, and flat-fisted movie that did not render any service to anyone involved, or to the memory of a filmmaker who has been in Hollywood one of the greatest he has ever known.
