After seeing the television commercials of this film, I went to my local cinema hoping to laugh a lot. In the end, it was one of the longest 90 minutes I've ever had. The Wog Boy really failed to provide a script with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes did not fill that void. <br /> <br /> A scene where the two "Wog Boys" dominate the dancefloor world of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all. The only character who was worth watching was "Nathan", played by Stephen Curry of The Castle, his fight with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughter. <br /> <br /> One word to say this is boring. Save time and watch TV advertising because only bursts of laughter are displayed.
