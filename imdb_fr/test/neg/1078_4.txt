I was really disappointed by this movie. Big actors, and potentially a big plot, but it seemed to flirt. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron was masterful in her role and beautiful, but it seemed that 90% of her on-screen work was in the car chases done with Austin Minis. The product placement went bad, so very badly. <br /> <br /> The direction also seemed wrong. Edward Norton is the bad guy, and it was so obvious from the start. Every time the camera passed over him, it was too long and Norton winced or something. Come on, Hollywood, give us some credit! It's good to surprise us with a plot without having to telegraph it. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie was just below average. I always appreciated the work and the talent of a film, but this one just did not have it.
