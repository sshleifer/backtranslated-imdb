"Wired" should be considered one of the ten worst films I have ever seen. Writing and directing show a breathtaking lack of imagination and I'm sure most actors are always thrilling whenever someone mentions this film. <br /> <br /> It does not work, either as a tribute to Belushi's unique talent, or as an accurate account of his short life. <br /> <br /> A wasteful mess without redemptive features
