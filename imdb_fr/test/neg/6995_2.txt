The film mentioned here as having been shot in 1980 is not the one that is available from Something Weird Video in their "Driver Ed Scare Movies Vol 5". On the one hand, the 1980 version is in color. SWV has on this disc a previous version (1972) of the film made in b & w for the television channel WLWT Channel 5 in Cincinnati. Anyway, this film is notorious. However, unlike most driver-edited films, this film was intended for television broadcast and visualization by the general public. Thus, the level of carnage has been reduced. Exploiting the bloody death for the purported purpose of education is always a rather sinister exercise. I live in the Cincinnati area and I remember this thing airing every year to Channel 5 if you're looking for a film that shows the tone of this uniquely American cinematic phenomenon, "The Last Prom" is pretty typical - morose, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, heavy in melodrama. Nobody knows if it really affected the behavior of a teenager.
