High School Bigshot is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> High School Bigshot talks about a geek who makes a plan to get rich and get the girl. However, he is completely mistaken and of course, at the end of the film, he died with a few other people, including the girl, fortunately. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is that all women care about nothing. about wealth. Also for us men, I suppose we are just supposed to accept that we have either "have it" or "we do not have it"! <br /> <br /> I could easily see how this movie could be rated 1, but it is better than the worst movie. The acting is not totally horrible, and the production values ​​are not extremely terrible. Overall, it's a bad movie and does not deserve to be watched for several reasons. If you insist of course to torture yourself, look at the MST version. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 1.5 / 10)
