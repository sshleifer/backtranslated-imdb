Lance used to get quality support from James Cameron. Heck, he even had his own TV show (Millenium) for a couple seasons. Why is he doing this? Could he not find a better way to pay his bills? <br /> <br /> I like good movies on a budget. Some of them can make people laugh simply because of their ridiculous principle, their stereotypical characters in textbooks, or often because the actors are related to the director / producer. But, this film has no redeeming value. I did not laugh I did not cry. I only had that feeling of discomfort in my stomach. This feeling was quickly identified as pity. At one point, Lance Henriksen was a major supporting actor. He was in Terminator (he was going to be BE terminator before Arnold's coming), Aliens, AliensIII, the classic movie B Pumpkinhead, among many others! I wanted to send him money after that. Maybe we should create a support fund or something similar. <br /> <br /> Again, for making this thing ... maybe not.
