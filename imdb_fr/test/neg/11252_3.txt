This movie was a huge disappointment. The animated series ended with a relatively stupid scenario and the hasty introduction of a lame villain, but I was expecting Shamballa to stop everything. Unfortunately, that was not the case. He added more holes in the plot than he solved and confused more than he clarified. The animation and dubbing were excellent, but with a silly intrigue, a monotonous decor (most of the film did not even take place in a dull planet of the second world war, rather than in the world of alchemy), and a disappointing end days in a world without alchemy, and he gives up Winry?), he was quite dull enough. Do yourself a favor - ignore the last half of the anime as well as this movie and read the manga.
