"Undercurrent" presents a leading cast of wonderful actors who might have been gathered together for the perfect comedy in the living room. Alas, they are almost wasted in a boiler in the sight of women - and thin as a paper. Katharine Hepburn is radiant effect as a young-old girl who finally married, but her husband is deeply disturbed and conceals dark family secrets. The director Vincente Minnelli has no idea how to ride this extravagant conspiracy concocted by Edward Chodorov from a story of Thelma Strabel, and the friendly cast and first class (including Robert Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Edmund Gwenn) is left in the troubled waters. ** from ****
