Comparing this film to anything from Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I can say is that he's desperately trying to look like a Almodovar movie and he's failing miserably. The scenario is appalling, the characters are unidimensional and the performances are the quality of dramatic drama in high school (except that of Marcia Gay Harden, which is rather good given the material with which she has to work). In addition, cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of Gaudi's architecture or the communicative charm of Barcelona. If you like the grain, the pathos and the dark and strange comedy of Almodovar's films, you will not find them here. Spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid.
