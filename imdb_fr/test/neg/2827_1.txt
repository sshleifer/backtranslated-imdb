You know, I do not know at all how was everyone else's teenage life, but it does not reflect the people I knew and with whom I was hanging out, let alone myself. And just in case you're wondering..NO..we were not virgins / clean cut / teenagers like Pat Boone. <br /> <br /> Listen, I'm not saying that being a teenager is easy. In fact, the best teen movie of this era is "Fast Times at Ridgemont High". Now these kids I knew and were as realistic as now (and maybe now). <br /> <br /> It was shit. It was a moderate rent version of Fast Times and even then it did not help much. It took a few moments, but not enough for me to recommend it, or even to claim that "that's the way things were for teenagers in 1982". I could not tell. The main girl did nothing for me and please, if they really wanted to keep their virginity, they would have done it, in which case, this film would not have been shot. Pure shit and a bad staple to be left in the early 80s as a time capsule movie for teens / young adults.
