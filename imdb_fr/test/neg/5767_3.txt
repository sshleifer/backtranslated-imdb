Let me start by saying that I LOVE horror movies. Big budget, small budget, actors of big names, actors without name, it does not matter. And when it comes to judging movies, I forgive a lot. However, this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The actors show little or no emotion when they present their lines and the acting is worse than many low-budget horror movies I've seen. As the actors get killed, you do not care. There is very little gore (I have no idea of ​​the movie that other critics have looked at when they say that there is good gore in it, because there is none) and the effects Specials are at best of inferior quality. They steal so much from so many better horror movies (Jeepers Creepers, Friday the 13th, Leprachaun) and it still does not help. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I saw this on Showtime and I did not have to pay any extra money to see it or lose a spot in my Netflix queue on it. There are so many better horror movies and I recommend you see them instead of this big disappointment.
