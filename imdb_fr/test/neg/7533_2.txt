With Pep Squad receiving an average of 4.7 on IMDb.com, it's no wonder that Steve Balderson is releasing this website in this way. But the fact is that Pep Squad is a "comedy" "badly conceived" (the two words in quotation marks have a reason). It's a movie full of over-action (Cherry, Beth's mother), coupled with some lethargic performances (Beth and Julie's boyfriend). A movie where you can follow cars thirty meters in a bright red jeep and never get noticed. A host of movies filled with cleavage and nudity not so tempting as you wonder, "Does the director think it's funny or smart?" Above all, the characters are so thin and poorly developed that the movie becomes quite unpredictable, but probably not on purpose. Pep Squad can not decide if it should be a comedy, a drama or a satire (patriotic music, I understand ...). The film fails to be serious, because the idea of ​​killing for any position in a school (Prom Queen) crosses the line of demarcation (not to mention the flag shots and driving shots, a mediocre attempt to be controversial and nervous), and fails to be a comedy, despite all the jokes forced and awkward (big mom, big black "funky", and excessive insults delivered badly by the main distribution). Watching the documentary "Wamego: Making Movies Anywhere" only made this film more crazy, praised by him ... the director and the father of the director ... hmmmmmm. Not a black comedy, or anything else. I guess Kansas will have to wait.
