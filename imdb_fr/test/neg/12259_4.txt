As a fan of ZaSu Pitts comedies, I thought it was worth a try. I was pretty disappointed. <br /> <br /> (The version I saw was on TCM, but only contained the Niagara Falls movie, Miss Polly's movie was missing.) The talents of the actors, who give great performances, is lost in one of the most stupid stories I have ever had the misfortune to attend. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown (Tom Wilson) surprised me by being the strongest actor in the series, but the spotlight is overwhelmed by Slim Summerville (Sam Sawyer), who, if he has talent, do not demonstrate it here. <br /> <br /> ZaSu Pitts (Elly Sawyer) is excellent, but does not have enough role. The biggest laugh in the movie is when she finds herself under Sam under a table. <br /> <br /> The only one in the film that makes sense is Tom Wilson. Margie (Marjorie Woodworth) is unreasonable in general. Although physically attractive, her personality and attitudes make her completely undesirable. Elly, Sam and the hotel receptionist are just fools. <br /> <br /> Sam and Elly abandon their honeymoon suite at the crowded hotel for Tom and Margie. But then they get it back. Sam ends up trapping Tom and Margie in their room. Most of the film is their attempt to try, but Sam, using a rifle, always puts them back. <br /> <br /> The worst is at the end. Tom, who is finally about to free himself, runs into a minister on the lower floor of the hotel. Now, the guy who, as I said, is the only one in the whole film to have his head on his shoulders, suddenly, for no reason at all, decided he must marry Margie! <br /> <br /> He takes the minister to the room where he just escaped, but Margie does not want to marry him. He kisses her and after a kiss, she feels compelled to marry him. <br /> <br /> Finally, Sam has the nerve to say to Tom: "You cheated on me", when it was practically the only thread Tom had to tell Sam earlier: "We are not married Sam replied, "Do you think I'm going to believe that?" <br /> <br /> Idiot.
