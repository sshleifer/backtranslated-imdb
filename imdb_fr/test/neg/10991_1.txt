As other reviews say, this could be a surprise for those who have not seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But have you ever seen Delicatessen, there is nothing new in this movie. I thought Delicatessen was fine when he came out, but this film comes too late to be of any interest. I do not think it's a worse movie than Delicatessen but it's a hassle to see it now, as if it would probably be watching Delicatessen again. The movie really does not make sense, nothing really matters or stays with you. There may be a distant similarity to Kusturica's films, but he's really in a different league, so you should go see his movies instead of wasting time in Tuvalu.
