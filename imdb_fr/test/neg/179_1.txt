Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? It's just that bad. Really unequal and unfair representation of "bad" versus "good" in the world of wine. Did you notice that the filmmaker was trying one of the wines among the protectors featuring wines and terroirs? The work of the camera is at best dizzying, while the content can put you to sleep quickly. It's not insightful journalism. This film told me that the filmmaker was trying to make wine globalism understand by showing, for example, that the Mondavi family owned wineries around the world. Ok, it's a good start. So, how do these wines compare? Do Mondavi Napa cabins have the same taste as their Italian wines? We never find out because no one in the movie comments on this. Instead, there are many insinuations about Nazism and fascism. Well, these things do not grow grapes. Hmmmm.
