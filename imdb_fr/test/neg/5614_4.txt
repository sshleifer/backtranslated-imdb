"Kicked in the Head" is about the character of Corrigan, a twenty-year-old man in search of himself, and his involvement in a handful of weird characters. This thin and ambiguous story, written by Corrigan, exudes a make-up impression and a scenario that sounds like an uninspired, low-budget, independent actor. Despite this and a few interjections of boring scenes in Hindenburg, the film has an offbeat and quirky charm that could, to a lesser degree, please people with the same sense of humor. Not for everyone, not for most, but maybe fun for some. (D +)
