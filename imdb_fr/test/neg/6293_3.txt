1st seen 1/1/2003 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Henri Verneuil): sober drama about a well-endowed doctor who has problems to maintain a relationship with a younger woman and with whom his family wants to live in addition to being married to another member of the same household. His search for happiness is unclear, but they explain quite well the reason for his misfortune by displaying the dominating trait of women in the lineage of his wife. Well done, but predictable drama.
