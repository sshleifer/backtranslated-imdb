And unfortunately, me too. ANY film based on a play on words, its slogan or title should be relegated to the $ 2.00 bonus, but we decided to try a second consecutive bad movie for the movie night. We had a winner in "House of the Dead" - go with that one if you want a laughable movie. <br /> <br /> A witch jumped into the water after being burned by Mr. Miner. A guy took a dump in the woods. And this same guy caught a new girlfriend right in front of his old one. I do not remember much else. The last third of the film was totally tasteless and we all waited with anguish until the end.
