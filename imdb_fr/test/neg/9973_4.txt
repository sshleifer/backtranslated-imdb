I was looking forward to seeing this movie and was therefore extremely disappointed to find it complete and disappointing. The direction of Akerman is both heavy and clich√© (how many shots can you get in Paris at night?). The male actors seem to have been entirely chosen for their resemberlance to the anguished self-portraits of Egon Schiele. Yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal, which should have been at the center of a film of this type, are virtually unexplored. What's left is a turgid melodrama that takes an age to start and even longer to finish. The only advantage of this type of film is to make you understand how Goddard and Truffaut are really good.
