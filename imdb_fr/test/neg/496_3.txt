Here's another great movie review you'll love. The problem is that it's not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The basic principle of the film is simple. Nine convicts escape from a prison after the tenth goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is. <br /> <br /> The first half has a lot of very wide slapstick while the second half is a descent into a fantasy and melancholy character. <br /> <br /> The two halves simply do not mix. Individual scenes work very well (guys who crush a friend's house that has a new Filipino bride are hilarious, while a more recent scene with the big guy working in the restaurant pulls to the heart.) They just do not not good housekeeping. br /> <br /> The film also lacks complete settings. One scene shows the guys who are desperate for change under an abandoned cash machine to buy a snack. The following scene has the whole team lying in a restaurant. Where did they get the dresses and the wigs? (The crew includes the fat guy and a dwarf) How did they get all the clothes and money needed to buy the meal? And why are they in trail? These are clearly guys flirting and admit it, is there anything more memorable for the witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as a woman? I mention the big guy and the dwarf because, apart from the old man, all the others seem to blend into each other. (In fact, they wear matching white suits in most of the film). The development of the character is very weak in the first part and the second half lacks really emotional punch. As we often try to find out who is who in their individual earnings scenes. <br /> <br /> Talking about the second half drama has all these wonderful spectacular shots, great emotional moments and a great symbolism that makes it a movie. It is also extremely slow, making it a boring movie. <br /> <br /> 9 Souls is a big disappointment, critics gushing out of a great movie and this is somewhere, good luck finding it yourself.
