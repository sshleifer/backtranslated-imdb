Few people remember "The Carey Treatment", and I can not say I blame them. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards did this during his lean years (that is, between the films of "Pink Panther") and the story of a doctor who became a detective (Coburn) at work to solve a murder in his hospital is actually quite forgettable. <br /> <br /> Coburn is reliable as always and O'Neill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the procedure. The twists of history are not very complicated and even the climax, which is supposed to be heartbreaking for the nerves, is heartbreaking. But a missed opportunity and simply unfortunate because it was based on a book by Michael Crichton. <br /> <br /> Well, at least Crichton did not write a sequel. <br /> <br /> A star. "Carey", Coburn.
