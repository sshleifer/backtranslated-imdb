One of the best lessons I ever had to watch a movie was: <br /> <br /> I worked in Roger Corman's office, like so many other wanabees before and since then, I was in an internship and I was trying to understand how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon, Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and full-fledged producer, asked me to load a cassette. I do not know why she wanted to watch that. I had the impression that it was a student film or a show, something like that, a sort of business card. Whatever the reasons she had to see it, the only free video machine in the office at the time was in the room I worked in, and I was the closest person to the machine. I started the band. <br /> <br /> Fade in: on the screen, a figure was sitting in front of a desk facing the camera. Behind him, to the left of the screen, was a door that opened to the room. Against the back wall was a coat rack. A second character entered the door and started to speak. The first character, the guy at the table, turned around to answer (it's a plug, a static camera, no cuts or diabolo cuts, only one device locked). The second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line. Julie Corman said "I've seen enough." and left the room. <br /> <br /> What she had seen in the ten seconds of filming she had watched was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs on the camera delivering lines? No, sorry. Following! That's how long you have. Ten seconds. Trigger in the foreground and you're dead. <br /> <br /> I remembered that moment as I watched the opening of this piece of shit. After an interminably long journey through the jungle, we see several monkeys apparently jumping into cages. A man carrying a gun laughs. A jet plane lands and we see it rolling all the way to the terminal. God is boring! Cut inside the airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something is happening! They shake hands. Cut to a different angle of the two men - <br /> <br /> - and the director crosses the line of demarcation. <br /> <br /> The first two shots of the movie that have some kind of spatial relationship between them other and the guy armed. "Do not cross the line" is one of those basic rules of cinematic grammar that prevents characters from jumping across the screen and confusing the public. The public does not like to be confused. Mystified? Confused? Intrigued and intrigued? Yes. The public loves all those. Confused? No, you lose them. They go out. "Do not cross the line" is one of those things they write you at film school, or they should. It's basic things. This is not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules), directors respect it all the time - but not at the first real cut of the film. <br /> <br /> I thought "I've seen enough". And off.
