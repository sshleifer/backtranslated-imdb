Someone should teach the film's writers that there is a difference between "presenting multiple twists" and "doing nothing to the public". They even use hypnosis as a tool to cover the holes of the plot; every time they can not find their place in a scene or come out of it, they just say "she's going back to her past now" or "she's coming out now", and they think it explains everything . This movie is a dishonest cheat and in the last 20 minutes becomes a fiasco in its own right. (* 1/2)
