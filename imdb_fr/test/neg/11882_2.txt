In terms of historical accuracy, this is the worst Roman movie I have ever seen. The list not only of errors, but also of absolutely impossible plot ideas, would be longer than the three-hour film, but just to give you an idea ... <br /> <br /> Julius Caesar and Augustus are liberal Democrats, taking the side of the "people" against "the nobles". This is obviously absurd. The Caesars were as noble as possible. Their interest was to consolidate power and stabilize a country devastated by 150 years of civil war. There were reformers, including the Gracchi brothers, who lived about 100 years ago and who defended to a certain extent the rights of ordinary citizens. <br /> <br /> Several scenes are quite ridiculous, if you know something. about the period. "Cleopatra", with Richard Burton, will give you a much better idea of ​​how the events unfolded, even if it's whimsical. <br /> <br /> Historical accuracy is one thing. Play and dialogue are something else, and here, this film is dangerously close to poor production for lower secondary school. I burst out laughing a few times, especially when Julia, Auguste's daughter, met a lover. They clung passionately as she breathed: "My father ..." "Ah, your father, your father ... your father would disapprove." Peter O'Toole is at his worst, forced to gnaw very pompous and stupid lines. The actor who plays Augustus in his youth is a nebulous - and the character is written as such - it is impossible to imagine him as a cunning and crafty Machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. Here, he's just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the time. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Rampling manages to emerge with dignity from the underlying role of Livia, Auguste's wife. If she had had a more complete role to play, she might have saved this production from absurdity. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful pictures and battle images, helped by many standard CGI numbers. Oddly enough, this was done for British television (and seems to be an Italian-British co-production), but bears the mention "R". <br /> <br /> The DVD image is excellent and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is very nice, although you only notice it during the few action sequences, because the movie is mainly a conversation. <br /> <br /> Almost all Roman films, even "Cleopatra" or "The Fall of the Roman Empire", have more historicity - to say nothing of convincing drama - than this weird adaptation of Classics Illustrated, Jr. This one gives a new meaning to the very abused phrase, "Based on a true story." In this case, they could have said "suggested by real events".
