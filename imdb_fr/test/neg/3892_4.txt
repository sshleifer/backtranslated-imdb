DO NOT BELIEVE HYPE! <br /> <br /> I had to see why all the critics loved this movie. I saw it and I still do not understand. The plot is thin, very thin. After the movie, I still did not know the name of the main female character and one of the two male characters did not even have a name in the credits, he is credited as "the farmer". I did not care about the characters, so I did not care about the movie. <br /> <br /> The sets and the cinematography were brilliant, but the same goes for National Geographic or The Discovery Channel. <br /> <I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
