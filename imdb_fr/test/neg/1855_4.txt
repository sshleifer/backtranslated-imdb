The real surprise of this light and effortless film is the way in which such a remarkable cast has been assembled for what is nothing more than an uninteresting affair. Presumably, it was a proverbial snowball that swept down a hill, gaining speed and size. One could imagine that by the time Miranda Richardson had been contacted by her agent, the conversation had been: 'Do you want to shoot a movie in Dublin with Neil Jordan's script? Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are already here! Michael Caine and Dylan Moran are trying to create a well-planned atmosphere in which Moran must emulate a London gang leader (whose arrival is imminent) to collect a large sum of money from King Michael Gambon. The rest is simply a forgotten boil that is happily over soon enough. Moran is slightly fun in places, but on this evidence, he is more suited to life on small screen in successful comedies such as Black Books. Caine is undisputed in her role and gives a steady performance without being overwhelmed. One can only imagine what motivated him to join this film: it can not even be a summer in Dublin, since many scenes have an autumnal appearance in the back. plan. Gambon is actually stealing the spotlight and anyone who has ever seen some of his performances in the movie Have I Got News For You will know he is an incredibly funny man. But overall, the result is disappointing and it seems like there's a life, Neil Jordan was making quality movies like Mona Lisa.
