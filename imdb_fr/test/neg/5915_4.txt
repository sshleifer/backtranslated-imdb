Produced at one point in his career, where he had the courage to do whatever he wanted, Eddie Murphy took on the production, directing, co-writing and star in HARLEM NIGHTS, a expensive but ultimately empty gangster saga A group of black club / gangster owners running a luxury club in the 1930s, led by a sexy shooter (Eddie Murphy) and his adoptive father (Richard Pryor) and their attempts to avoid to be invaded by white gangsters who think they are taking control of their territory. that, it seems, seems to them legitimate, simply because of their color. It was an idea that probably looked great on paper, but it certainly lost something in the translation. It was a centerpiece for Eddie and I think he's moving a bit too far to try to be the whole show here. Admittedly, it was a pleasure to see Murphy and Pryor together on the screen, but the rest of the mass market, including Arsenio Hall, Redd Foxx, Della Reese, Michael Lerner, Jylline Guy, Danny Aiello, Stan Shaw, Thomas Mikal Ford and Eddie's brother does not have much to do (although I admit that Murphy's fight scene with Della Reese is hysterically funny and probably the best scene in the film). Murphy has clearly spent a lot of money in this film and a good part of it appears on the screen. The art and the staging are impressive and the breathtaking costumes should have been rewarded with an Oscar, but this was a big shortfall for Eddie, who clearly tried to wear too many hats.
