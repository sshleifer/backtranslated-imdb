"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is sad because it is obvious that he is trying to succeed and clearly has no chance of succeeding, apparently because of the lack of a clear goal. Catastrophic failure of the Irish drama with Spacey, a thief who likes to thwart the cops and make his competition a kind of folk hero in his mind, this film manages to be slightly fun when it comes to trying to be funny, slightly more than annoying when it's trying to be interesting, and forgetting sentimental or poignant or endearing although it also draws on those qualities. "Ordinary Decent Criminal" has an awkward scenario, a naive direction, a companion performance, a lean story, a mediocre cast, a mediocre game and ends up getting lost in itself and sinking into a quagmire of mediocrity without hope. Pass on this one. (RE)
