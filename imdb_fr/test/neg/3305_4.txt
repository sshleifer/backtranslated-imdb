Bad news for those who want to film a complete parody of a Lifetime Network movie: the creators of A Deadly Encounter have already done so, even involuntarily. All the tropes of life are there: a divorced mother in danger by a deranged stalker, an unreliable ex-husband (who, of course, cheated on her while they were married), and a police department that rejects her complaints with conduction get up for herself. The scene where the heroine, after being broken and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker, decides to relieve stress by shopping is particularly impressive. Having seen the harassment of a colleague she met at church, I know that stalking is not a joke, but it is certainly the case in this film.
