I rented this movie for $ 5 and I'm sorry I did it ... I would not give 5c for that if I knew it. It's the worst movie of all time ... None of the filming locations was in the former Yugoslavia, map starting with what English actors are trying to speak Serbian, for example. my mother tongue is Serbian and I did not understand why they were getting married. They drove a big jeep in a country where 3 camps (Croats, Serbs and Muslims) are at war and Sara Sara writes: Peace Sarajevo ??? Ah, oh, that was stupid ... I do not know why the English make stupid movies about war like this ... or even if they do, why do they blame the Serbs for everything And we know all they also killed, not just sitting and pretending to be innocent, so they should at least show the whole truth. This film also contains Harrison's Blossoms, Behind Enemy Lines, Party Hunting and a few others were bullshit and this has been proven for example. The hunting party was the biggest loser in 2007/08, it spent $ 20 million and they won 800,000 ha, ha, what shit ... The truth will be revealed sooner or later. to be Serbian !!!
