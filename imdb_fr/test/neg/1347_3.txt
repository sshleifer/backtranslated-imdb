This movie could have been a decent re-shoot, and that then, he tried (or Mrs. English tried). Bringing talented actors together with a seasoned and experienced screenwriter / director should be the formula of a decent movie. However, Ms. English's experience - according to her biography of IMDb - is limited exclusively to television work and is blatant throughout this film. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that none of the comments I read mention what I read. I find that this film is particularly unpleasant and prevents it from reaching even part of its potential: it's as if it were designed for television. To give Mrs. English some credit, a lot of jokes that just did NOT work on a movie screen would have been great on TV (and maybe a laugh would have been helpful). Much of the use of the camera and lighting would have worked well on television but would seem weird or strange on a big screen. If the whole film had been cut into a mini-series or a sit-com, I think it could have worked. But it's cinema and, unfortunately, Ms. English's talents have not been translated. I felt overwhelmed by so many different aspects in my embarrassment for actors and screenwriters that I felt like I was leaving the theater half-shriveled! Meg Ryan is as usual, cute and cute (except for the plastic surgery she has had on her face), but where did she get the opportunity to use her talent ?! She made movies where she does not recreate her stereotyped role and did them well ... but not here. Annette Bening seemed to follow the movement: such talent and performance so poor! I enjoyed the other female characters, but they were more caricatural than melted and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s does not correspond to the 2000s and no one helped Ms. English to obtain the correct modifications, updates or subtleties. If only she (as a writer, director AND producer) had asked for help, I think it could have been good. But that was not the case. <br /> <br /> It's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good screenwriter or director and came out thinking it was a waste of time and money for everything the world! This drawing of New Yorkers that I saw yesterday is appropriate: some film directors have a meeting and the caption reads: "Let's go back to a classic with everything worse!"
