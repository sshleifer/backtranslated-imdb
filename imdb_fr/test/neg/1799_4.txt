The film 'Heart of Darkness', based on Joseph Conrad's 1899 book, is one that has little or no detail and an almost schizophrenic line. If you have read the book, you know that few or none of the important scenes of "narration" have been inserted into the film. In the book, there are so many things left to the imagination and I feel that it is one of the parts that make the book what it is. An example would be when Marlow spent hours, days or even months waiting for rivets and the whole scene was left out of the movie. Again, if you have read the book, you will know that this scene almost describes the main theme of futility, the better. Finally, I feel that the film was too cut and too dry. However, the original text was not inserted enough and how it made history what it is today. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the book 'Heart of Darkness' (preferably, Norton Critical Edition) then do not waste your time renting or buying the movie. However, if you have read the book, I think you will enjoy it a lot more if you decide to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Eric 2007
