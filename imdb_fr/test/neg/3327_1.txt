My daughter liked it but I was surprised that a character from this movie is smoking. As if it were not horrible enough to see "product placement" actors like Bruce Willis smoking in their movies - at least children's movies should be more thoughtful! I wonder: was it intentional? Does Big Tobacco "sponsor" the movie? What does it take to ban smoking in movies? At least movies for kids and teens.
