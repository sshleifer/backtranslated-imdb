Because that's what Hell Ride is about. Larry Bishop and Tarantino celebrating Weinstein's money with the promise of delivering a movie someday. I'm all for the fake boobage and alcohol as much as the next guy but do we really need the movie? In reality, there is nothing worse than the used leftovers reheated from an old trend. And I do not even talk about the Grindhouse cinema of the 70s, because Hell Ride does not have the raw and unpolished impression of the time it claims to pay tribute to. No, it's Hollywood MTV slippery and brilliant. The old trend of which I speak is that of the film world, where pseudo-hip and where hides a fear of the conscience, where Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. The three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason. Hell Ride is a second hand copy, unstable and uninspired, polished to the maximum when it should be raw, the aspect "supercool" coming off forcefully and silly. <br /> <br /> There is no reason for that. a simple and totally meaningless story must be told in a very complex way, back and forth in time. It's just a post-Tarantino whim. There is also no reason for the dialogues to be so insane, people stir gums saying NOTHING: at least when Travolta was talking about cheeseburgers in Pulp Fiction, he felt cool. The dialogues here are little more than pseudo-macho postures. There is also no reason for a creaky rock'n'roll guitar to get tangled in the whole movie. Maybe the lowest Hell Ride hits when he tries to be near-existential. There is a hilarious scene of dreams / illusions in the desert where Bishop eats peyote and sees the colors. I was almost expecting an old Indian to come and offer nuggets of wisdom. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves from this abyssal shit is Vinnie Jones's boobage and monologue on her tattoos the outer planes of the desert). A lot of boobage and hot babes lightly dressed. Now it's something I can get but a movie they do not do. All the rest is an empty shell, an imitation of other imitators infinitely more talented.
