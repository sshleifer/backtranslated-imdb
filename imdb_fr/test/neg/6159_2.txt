This film was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The title refers to a vicious wind that makes the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but it seemed to have nothing to do with what was happening. The film seems to be an extremely poor scam of Bladerunner, ie an android thug is pursued by a bounty hunter (or a ruthless cop in this case). Luke Skywalker performs a surprisingly good performance as a rogue policeman mentioned previously. Nothing seems to be solved at the end of the film, we never find anything of substance on the android or what are its intentions. There's a confusing scene where Bill Paxton (who kidnapped the Android) plays a special song in his cardboard plane for no reason (the song is called "Shape of Things" by The Yardbirds). This is repeated in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. Does this song have relevance for the movie? Do not believe.
