OK, let's start with the best. building. Hard to believe that she had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire, the macabre walls and strange objects found throughout her journey were interesting. other than that, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> as far as evil, it's done by the WWE. WTF? is that supposed to make you want to see it? if anything, stay away. horrible, horrible idea for them to make movies and allow Gregory Dark to realize it. bad choice. previews were more interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I can not even start discussing the seriousness of this film. actors without talent & a disappointing vague scenario. apparently many actors are of this show "all the saints". It's a wonder why I have never heard of them or their show. Apart from that, the bus driver, whom you never see, just by closing the door, has had more action than almost everyone else. at least he manages cascades for some decent movies. <br /> <br /> I like to see horror movies, really. but it blew so much that everyone laughed and encouraged the characters halfway. very annoying. the child behind me was yapping more during previews of other horror movies. <br /> <br /> it's not a movie to watch, let alone if you have to pay it.
