Even if he only made his first film in Australia and went to Britain and then America to continue his career, the Australians will tell you that the biggest movie star they have ever produced is Errol Flynn. I'm not sure he even returned to Australia after his phenomenal success in Captain Blood. However, I attribute this film to Australian irreverence well known for undermining the reputation of one of their own. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem in telling the story of Errol Flynn's life was that he had told enough high stories in his life to the end in his memoirs, My Wicked Wicked Ways. I could see that the film was largely based on that and on the reading between the lines of this book. <br /> <br /> The infidelity of his mother to his father was not written, but could have been deduced from the reading of My Wicked Bad ways. He did not particularly like women, this is clear from some sources. <br /> <br /> I would like the film to focus more on his adventures in New Guinea, which for me was the most interesting part of My Wicked Wicked Ways. As for his street fights in the Depression, I tend not to believe that. Even if he had succeeded, I guarantee you that enough of that would have ruined his appearance and that he would never have made a career as a leader. <br /> <br /> Yet the underpants still seem to think that Sydney's atmosphere during the Depression was well captured and Guy Pearce is a charismatic Errol Flynn. The American public knows him better as being the Lieutenant Stuck But Honest Lieutenant Exley in LA Confidential, released the same year as Flynn. <br /> <br /> But LA Confidential was a much better movie.
