The sound is terrible, the picture is worse than worse, the acting is horrible, the main actress is chubby, and the story is ... wait a minute ... There is no story ...! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading. If you expect to see Piranhas, you may be disappointed. This film has nothing to do with the Piranha films of 1978 and 1981. In fact, I can only think of a scene involving Piranhas. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked in this movie, aside from the fact that it only lasts about 85 minutes, is the song at the end. It was written and sung by Jim Stein and is entitled "I like all things that love the sun". <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie. It's so bad that it's not even funny to watch. I fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and I'm the type to watch anything.
