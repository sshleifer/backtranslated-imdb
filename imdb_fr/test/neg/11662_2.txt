Now, I remember what the "independent" filmmakers had stolen before Pulp Fiction. It was David Lynch, was not it? <br /> <br /> I looked for this thing to see Kyle Secor. What a waste of a perfectly good Bayliss. It was so painful to watch, like when someone you love is horribly sick and you can not do anything. <br /> <br /> Almost all the clich√©s of the book: the desert, the psychopath, the weird mafia boss, the biker, Tracy Walker (who luckily was in a scene, but I was still waiting for him that he reappear and say something strange and deep, like "If a man wants to know where he is going, he must look where he went" or artificial garbage like that). I have a theory about why so many indies lack localization in the desert. I think it's because they can save money on lighting. <br /> <br /> If you like to suffer, find this film and watch it. If you're a fan of Kyle Secor, check out Homicide's re-runs on Court TV. If you want a quality thriller on the road, go see Wild At Heart. <br /> <br /> There is a reason why no one has heard of Delusion! My god, what a waste of a good title.
