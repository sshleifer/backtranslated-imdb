FREDDY FORSYTH has developed a scenario that will suit the mood of Western suspicions about Putin's Russia. Forsyth installs an evil president as president of Ruski who wants to return the country - not so much to Stalin's communism, but more to Hitler's fascism. In fact, his Political Manifesto could have come directly from Mein Kampf rather than from Marx. And the loonie has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the pogrom of ethnic cleansing of the Russian Federation. American mercenaries band together with Russian Prez to realize his fanatical and genocidal dream, but then enter Pat Swayze from Dirty Dancing ... and, yeah, things get complicated. This is a former American agent who has become a wanderer, Jason Monk, who is charged by the British government to see what the Russians are preparing. The character of Swayze, who is not a monk (!), Has embodied the Russian beauty Elena (interpreted by the magnificent Marta Kondova) during his previous missions in the former Commie State. Hardman Swayze does a fair job trying to defeat the evil Russians. But the young unknown actress Marta Kondova steals the film while she is her nubile Russian girl Elena, aged 18, who helps her father eliminate the terror that threatens his beloved Mother Russia.
