I'm a fan of the original 50s and after about 20 minutes of making this remake, I started to think that it was going to be as good as the original, but it was not. The motive for the murders was unbelievably stupid. Two of the film's lovers turn out to be brother and sister - excuse me while I mumble. The main character stops in the middle of the film to have sexual relations that do not make sense given the situation in which he finds himself. If the filmmakers wanted a sex scene, they should have put it earlier in the movie before the main character (Dexter played by Dennis Quaid discovered he was about to die and he was charged with crime.On do not know where the sex scene is. "In the movie, Dexter does not live his life to the full, so he's not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan, I always think it would be more logical than the scene. of sex was cut or earlier in the film and the two brothers and sisters are not lovers. <br /> <br /> One of the most stupid parts of the movie Gunfights, a couple of people being killed and a person being crushed within 15 meters of a crowded carnival and yet nobody was seen on the carnival, there are also the tar pit of the university where the film Si you fall into the tar, you sink to the bottom and f seconds. only it is hard to believe that materials would sink so quickly into the tar, but more importantly, build a university on tar pits. I would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is but I do not want to put a spoiler in my post.
