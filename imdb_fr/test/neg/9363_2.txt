<br /> <br /> I understand that people have different expectations when it comes to low-budget art and test films. I also know that John Sayles has a kind of glimmer on him, this earthy and intellectual anti-Hollywood vibe, at Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan, who makes him a darling critics from the start. <br /> But it's not a good movie. I'm sorry, that's just not the case. <br /> <br /> It winds. He has too many characters. His tone is uneven, his point of view is confused, the acting is omnipresent, the naturalist at the top. He lingers for long moments with minor characters we do not care about and cuts through the tense scenes just as things get better. <br /> <br /> It misses the target. <br /> <br /> The Worst The flaw in the film is that the two closest things to a protagonist, Edley Falco's Marly and Angela Bassett's Desiree, are straight shirts in helpless characters. Marly is an apathetic drunkenness, immersed in the inertia of her life. Desiree is a woman trapped in her own repressed pain. When the worldview of your two main characters can be summed up by the expressions "I do not care" and "I want to leave here", why should the public give the patootie of a rat? <br /> <br /> I Let's be clear: Sayles writes a fun dialogue. He is very adept at creating a scene. The problem is that these scenes are not going anywhere. There is no spine in the film. No reader. The film does not arouse any fundamental interest for any of the characters. In my opinion, it is also too preached about the big American companies that engulf the little guy. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a "little" quality movie, check out David Lynch's "Straight Story". Pass this one.
