Did people expect "Jurassic Park 3" to be full of surprises? Not a single moment is worth it. Many things could easily scare movie people ... and these are not the dinos! Tea Leoni ... I think she's an excellent actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she has reached the end result. I wonder if he has ever forced a vocal chord by shooting the movie ... Laura Dern ... she's fine, but why not be more visible in the movie, perhaps exchanging intelligent dialogues with Sam Neil. Alessandro Nivola - "Have you ever heard of a facial expression? Feelings, emotions ..." ... he must work harder on it! Sam Neil, no problem. The soundtrack ... must change this disc, or you're fed up. My applause goes to William H. Macy, a talented actor whom I have never seen play a bad role ... Unfortunately, he can not save the film, any more than the dinosaurs well created by computer.
