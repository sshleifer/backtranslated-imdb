You must see that. I could not help but laugh at the nonsense I had seen in this movie even late after the event. There may be a million individual mistakes and stupidities in this movie. The acting is bad. The story is so predictable and flat. The effects are like 50 years old. The supposed thriller is nowhere. You will not appreciate the film, but you will laugh and enjoy it a long time later. We had a good time after the movie. Really. My friend and I spent a long 40 minute bus trip home talking about this film as if we had seen the next Oscar winner. Unfortunately, we were talking about all the bad things we had just seen.
