There were so many problems with this movie that I have trouble keeping them all straight. But one thing that bothers me is that if Jigsaw was the one lying on the floor in the bathroom, what would happen if Zep never showed up? What if Zep was killed by Danny Gloover before going to the bathroom? Jigsaw simply get up? The guy in the middle of the bathroom would not it be a puzzle, but another element of the game of Jigsaw? And if Zep killed the woman and the child, how can Jigsaw give him the poison antidote if he's lying in the middle of the bathroom? Why does the doctor wait until the last minute to finally cut his foot? It was too late, it was past six, and as far as he knew, his wife and child had already been shot, this was not the best time to live heroism. These are just a few questions I had about the movie, but I may miss something or everything because I only saw the movie once. Please help!
