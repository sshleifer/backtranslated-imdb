Oh my God!!!! It was Broken Lizard's first group film (although recently shot on video), and I've never been so disappointed in my life !!! I tell you that if I had ever seen this movie before seeing Super Troopers (which is also a movie kick A $$ !!!), I would have never watched !! I had read several reviews online, as well as on the cover of the DVD: "The Funniest Broken Lizard Movie To Date!" Now, if they were talking about Super Troopers as their funniest movie of all time, I would agree, non stop, but not this one. Speak dry. It took at least 45 minutes for the film to begin, and at that point I was so startled to watch it that it was not worth it. Maybe you have to be high to make it really funny? I do not know. I really like these guys, but this movie is by far the worst movie they've done. Dread Club was a very good movie, but this one, wow! I would highly recommend Super Troopers if you want to laugh, but if you want more romance, drama, with some fun spots, I would recommend going with Puddle Cruiser. Just my opinion though, everyone is entitled to theirs! :)
