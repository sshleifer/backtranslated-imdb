The television announcer who presented this Saturday night late night said he should have won Oscars. That's quite a statement for a movie I had never heard of ... but I do not know why I should have been watching a TV advertiser. In this case, the advertiser spoke in guts. <br /> <br /> It's a monotonous and miserable movie that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. I could not get along with Hoskins' terrible Burr-ming-gum accent. Anyway, we do not see any benefit from it happening in the Midlands. <br /> <br /> Unresolved discussions abound ... and normally I would not mind, but half of them are meaningless. And what about when Hoskins' will say that he will come looking for Felicia in front of her B & B even though she never told him where she lived exactly ??? Or her purchase in the funeral which clearly never took place (and where was she during those days ???) clumsy and badly thought through business if you ask me. . It's full of pretensions. It's depressing ... <br /> <br /> I did not like it. I thought it was garbage. I would not recommend it. 'Nuff said.
