This is a total piece of shit. This is an insult to Frank Herbert's superb book. They mutilated the story and the characters. The acting is average to bad. The only well played and well played character is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies pretty early in history, then everything is downhill (it's not a very high hill to start). <br /> <br /> The 1984 film was directed by the legendary David Lynch. The film did not impress me too much, but given the technological limitations of the day, they did their best. Surprisingly, the crappy mini series makes it so much better by comparison. It was at least a bit faithful to the book, which I really like. <br /> <br /> They had the chance to do it right this time, unfortunately, it was not taken.
