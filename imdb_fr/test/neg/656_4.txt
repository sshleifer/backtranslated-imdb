An extremely uneven film where the major problem is the delicate mix of comedy and thriller. For me, the unusual premise is clearly comical and they should have been aiming for a complete comedy. For example, Rock has some fun lines, but sometimes it's too implausible for a comedy. The scene where Betty's husband is being scalped is too bad for a comedy that should have been less violent. An even better example is that of the Hollywood leftist writer who preached to us very early through the character of Freeman on the plight of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They should have given Freeman something fun to say in this segment, but it's of course a lot harder than writing a boring PC talk. <br /> <br /> There is still more New Age PC in the form of the end: not only does the girl not understand the boy, but she gets none; In fact, the message is that the girl does not need a boy at all! A bit of a feminist statement there. The first half hour is weak, but the film improves - ironically - once Zellweger has arrived in Kinnear. I say "ironically" because I'm not a big fan of Kinnear, although he's solid here. Zellweger is very cute, as usual; she has the kind of pretty all-American looks that should appeal to almost every guy, and I wonder why such women are not "represented" nowadays, instead of dogs that have inexplicably become stars, like Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez or Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Since the film tries to be sometimes very serious, I have no choice but to criticize the character of Freeman, who is the equivalent of the gangster with the hooker of the world of the film. -Gold heart. Moreover, nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock allows one to think, even from afar, that they were father and son.
