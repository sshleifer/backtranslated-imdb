I had to write a review for this movie based on those who say: Gore, nonstop action, great movie .. <br /> <br /> These people were obviously watching a different movie. Killpoint honestly sucked from the start! I waited and waited for this film to go better and it was in vain. Some said that the film was brutal and others vexing, but I can not find any of these adjectives in the film. I mean, there are so many scenes where people get shot and there is no blood, it's not even funny! ! I guess the best way to summarize this is that it probably should have been rated PG by 1984 standards and now, in 2010, there is no doubt it would be PG !! Bad, BAD not in the funny movie of varieties "B"! !!
