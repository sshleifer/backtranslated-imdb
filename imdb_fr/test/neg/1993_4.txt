It's good ... a few years later, Chayefsky's classic "Network" will be his true big cinematic home run ..., but for now, this black comedy is not the classic it aspires to. It is rather horrible, although there are good scenes: the first victim of a murder found, the emergency clerk responsible for billing patients making a surprise discovery, the confessional delusional Drummond and the very last scene where Scott's character regains his professional integrity and self-esteem. . There are also ridiculous scenes: the sly monologue of Scott's character on his first visit to the hospital psychiatrist, Scott's rape, Rigg's rape, Dysart's horrible aggression in his brief scenes , and the OR A doctor jumps on the operating table to resuscitate the wrong patient because "I already have action for malpractice". <br /> <br /> Chayefsky also tries too hard to throw all the imaginable obstacles to this hospital (murders, mistakes, poor people protesting outside, etc.). It might have worked better in the whole industry. As for the actors: Scott is passable, Rigg seems to have been misunderstood, Hughes is inspired and Dysart holds his brief performance. The rest of the distribution is too one-dimensional.
