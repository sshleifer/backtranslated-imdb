This film had potential. The scenario was not bad and presented a dark and interesting atmosphere with themes of suicide, patricide, regret and, as Chris says, "10 years of lack of progress". It's a stark contrast to the original MAG7 that was brilliant, humorous, and even the villain was adorable. <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting change of tone, and if they had developed the characters more, maybe I would have liked it. <br /> <br /> But instead, they are wasting too much time on free (and ridiculous) battle scenes poorly edited together. At some point you see a horse fall and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again. But few would notice it, because there are already 2 dozen horseback rides (I'm not exaggerating), and at that time, we have already fallen asleep. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to the title of my magazine. This film was largely cut due to animal cruelty, so you will probably (if you decide to watch it) the sweetened version for kids. There is a bullfight where the matador stabs the bull and, suddenly, while the crowd is bursting with joy, there is no bull, there is only the matador in an empty arena. Wow, maybe the bull was a Jedi, I do not know. More likely, the scene has been cut off. <br /> <br /> Later, there is a cock fight scene where, in the original version, one of the birds is horribly manhandled in front of a crowd of jubilant Mexicans. It was cut. But we still see enough to annoy us. <br /> <br /> But by far the worst scenes are those of the horse. One after the other, you see the legs of a horse being shot, sending thousands of pounds of horse on his head. In one scene, a horse is thrown and, while squirming on the ground in paralytic convulsions, an explosive runs under the neck. <br /> <br /> This film was shot in 1966, while Hollywood was just beginning to regulate animal brutality on the film. It's probably one of the last movies where you can see it coming. So, if this stuff is floating in your boat, check it and you'll get a slight chill. But otherwise, you will be either irritated or bored.
