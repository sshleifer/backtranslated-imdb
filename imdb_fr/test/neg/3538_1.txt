The only reason I saw this movie was because it had Giovanni Ribisi and it was supposed to be "Horror". Do not be fooled, this movie must be the worst horror movie I've seen. These are people who go to a secret place that contains a "monster". The monster is a man with a deformed face who runs in blue jogging pants and thirsts for brains. Some people die, others do not. In the end, they throw the monster off an airplane and then fly away happily. BUT OH NO! THE MONSTER IS STILL LIVING AFTER FALLING! Go spend 2 hours in another way, like watching paint dry on a wall, believe me, it's more fun than this shit.
