Who gave money to these people to make a movie? There was nothing funny about it. The fact that the farting dog was the funniest thing about this disease speaks volumes. First of all, it has nothing to do with Christmas, it's the name that was taken and all the people who loved the original Chevy Chase. They took Randy "I have no talent, I'm just a big sweaty pig" Quaid (the only thing that's wrong in Part 1) and I made a "film" about him ... He there are only morons in his family, but not the "they are not cute" a little weak, but the "do not touch me" a little stupid. Watching this pile of earth helps you to hope that all those who participate in it die! They did not even bother to get the effects in order ... when they are on the boat, the only thing that moves is the false bottom ... when the Pigface Quad is in water, you can see it in the light. a studio. This film was sexist (Uncle Nick), racist (Uncle Nick) and should never have been filmed ... never ... throwing money into a volcano would have been much more useful. <br /> <br /> I hope to have joined some of you ... Nobody had warned me and now I am marked for life Merry Christmas *
