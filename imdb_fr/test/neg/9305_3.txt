I know everyone said that this movie was shit and I agree with them. I spent a few years after seeing it tell others it was shit. I recommended they do not see it. But when he came on television, we saw the advertisement. I turned to my family and said, "I know it's sad, but I think I'm looking at it." My sister turned to me and said, "Yes, me too." And you know what? It was funny. <br /> <br /> This is by no means a good movie. It is absolutely a waste of time. But it's a good waste of time. You may still think it's shit and that's right, but I thought it was a funny, funny comedy. I did not like a few things, like when the fish was hit by the car, but other than that, I thought it was good. I loved sitting here and picking all the famous Australian faces: Flacco, Elle McFeast, Garry McDonald, etc. <br /> <br /> So if you like to waste your time, watch this movie. If not, see a drama or something.
