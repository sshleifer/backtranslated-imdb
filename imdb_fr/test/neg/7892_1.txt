Very good can break it down. Why is this one of the worst movies of all time? Because there are so many answers to this question, I have a headache. Come on ... Cracker World? Mr. Honkee? The part with the Arab type? it's horrible, I did not care about all that white shit related to racism, but when they did it with the Arab guy, I wanted to get the names of all the writers. It's really not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie. It's not even funny-bad this was my first rendition. I hope that the person who made this film does not commit suicide, but it seems likely, I do not see any other option. NEVER watch this movie, if you look at it, you can not say that you died without regret.
