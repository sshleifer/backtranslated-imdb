the film is precious, and cage is a baby. <br /> <br /> but will everyone agree with me that the punk performance in this film is ATROCIEUSE?!?! <br /> <br /> where is the shock? the Ramones ?? unsuitable? social distortion? cramps ?? Sexual guns ?! ANYBODY?!?!?!?! the music is this movie is incredibly disappointing! AT LEAST they play the treatment. <br /> <br /> In addition, Randy's feather hair and pleated khakis ... <br /> <br /> it really looks like a movie about the "punks" the places of the industry. cinema see punks. <br /> <br /> Although it's a 90s film, SLC punk paints a much more accurate portrait of the punk-rock scene of the early 1980s.
