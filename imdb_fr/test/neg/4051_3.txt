The film tells a day in the life of a woman who goes crazy. To show that she is mentally ill, she exaggerates a lot and the narrator tells us that she "goes crazy". Along the way, she goes out with a big boy who could be the brother of Orson Welles. He then decapitates the head of a building in one of the only interesting moments of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a strange little movie that is done at a very cheap price - and it shows. The film was shot without sound (probably using 8mm or some other type of cheap film) and featured some sound effects and a dominant narration added later. In fact, the narration was the most unwelcome and unintentionally the most hilarious I have ever heard and it is said in a way as stupid and exaggerated that you would have to hear it to believe it. Because of these cost-cutting measures, it is not surprising that the film is bad, although the idea of ​​trying to make this kind of film is quite original. Moreover, it is VERY difficult to cross the entire film.
