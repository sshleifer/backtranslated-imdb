I remember thinking that because of the cast, the subject and the director, I was going to like this movie. <br /> <br /> Entering the theater and taking my place, I was like a schoolgirl anticipation for the opening stage built. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed by the opening and I felt that I would really like this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the film and feel that anything that lets out scenes can be seen as a spoiler, stop reading. I will not reveal anything important, but it could be perceived as such. This is the warning. <br /> <br /> The spoiler can be included below, beware. <br /> <br /> I think that the first scene that seemed to me quite ridiculous is that of the Russian space station. I mean honestly, fill up a shuttle without warning, then just show the station that it's so fragile that just a small mistake can blow everything up. <br /> <br /> While all this happens it is possible, it seemed to me excessive. I do not know if it was just the situation or whether it was a cheesy acting game, an idiotic vision of Russian technology or just the camerading attitude of the scene itself. <br /> <br /> It only got worse for me after that because we endured what seemed to be 2 hours of super strong and constant explosions in space ... you know, this place where he there is no sound because it is a void. <br /> <br /> But the coup de grace for me, honestly, was the gun scene. (possibility of spoiler) - A little earlier in the film, we see Bruce Willis tearing up their land vehicle (the vehicle they will use to get around once there and help them break through) when told it's what they want to be using. He removes pieces and complains because his contents are heavy and he is not needed for what he does. So while we are wandering on the asteroids, we see that they have chosen to add to the vehicles a massive craft like a gun ... you know, NASA's standard fare is to have heavy weapons when all space missions in case, you know, aliens or something. <br /> <br /> took 2 explosive hours, the stupid Russian refueling station scene, the cheese love scene towards the end, the Bruce Willis character being nothing more than most of his past characters, but Steve Buscemi getting crazy and shooting with the space vehicle's weapon on the spot and causing havoc / damage, although threw the whole thing on top for me. <br /> <br /> Save your money and time and avoid this movie. If you want a good meteorite movie, see Deep Impact, if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects, see Space Cowboys, but avoid what's happening, avoid this movie.
