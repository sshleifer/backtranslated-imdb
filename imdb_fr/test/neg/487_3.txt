I did not expect a classic, but at least a funny movie. There are only a few scenes that make you laugh but nothing more. You fear nothing, it is full of American clich√©s of youth-slasher and you can guess what will happen easily. <br /> <br /> But that says a lot about a high school student in a Turkish high school. The pressure of the Student Selection Examination (SOA) that a 3-hour test determines which university you will go to and think about the exam when a ghost pursues you is not an exaggeration. The film is bad. Do not waste your time looking at it.
