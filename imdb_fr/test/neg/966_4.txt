This 3-hour miniseries dedicated to television returned from Blockbuster this weekend. The production company has clearly spent a lot of money on sets, costumes (Bridget Fonda, in particular) and special effects (including a large Jim Henson speaking polar bear and reindeer). They should have spent a little more money to get a consistent script. The scenario was so vague that he never really got together. We can neglect the Germans with Irish accents, but not the herodic tales. With useless details that included a special appearance of the devil, this one is certainly not meant to be a Christmas classic. Too bad they have wasted the good performances of the two women leaders.
