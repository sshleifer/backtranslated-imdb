Not at all well done, the whole movie was just the Grudge that kills people randomly, out of nowhere. Random people who have nothing to do with history are killed, like the 3 schoolgirls for example. <br /> <br /> The family at the beginning has nothing to do with history either, I believe them random. family who never entered the house and never had anything to do with the Grudge murders. <br /> <br /> Did not impress me, I was not scared, I did not jump to any place, and the whole movie was just a random piece of shit to get more money . Give the Gridge 1 a shitty look too, which was actually a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think The Grudge 2 is like The Grudge 3's flagship film, if they ever made one. They should not have even called it Grudge 2, but rather the Grudge 2 prologue, and you'll see if you look at it, because I'm not going to ruin it. Not that it had anyway. <br /> <br /> 1/10, it's not scary, it's a bad story, and it's totally random.
