The story is derived from "King Lear"; the setting is a farm in Iowa. Here's a test for that sort of thing: if you're wondering, "Why did teltel do this," and the answer is "because that's what happened in" King Lear, " you know that the movie failed, well, that's what's happening here, the father figure in this story does not live his own life, he imitates a life of fiction.But the movie has more disadvantages than this one. <br /> <br /> Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious - much more ambitious than she thinks, trying to take King Lear's story and completely change the setting. The most likely outcome is that the transplanted story will die and no one can really understand why (although there are enough successful transplants, such as "West Side Story", to make it worthwhile But she is also trying a revisionist revision, and in the version of "King Lear" she wants to create, Reagan and Goneril transmit all our sympathy and Cordelia is a bad guy. It is also a task in itself. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to succeed in one or the other of the tasks; to succeed at once is impossible. In fact, to succeed one while trying the other is impossible. If we want to look at the same events from a different moral perspective, the events must be the same - which means there can be no alteration of the pattern. If history is to be transplanted, alive, in a different setting, its moral heart must continue to beat the whole - which means there can be no alteration of the ethical perspective. Moorhouse was doomed not in one but in both projects. And that's what she did. ... Naturally, it is possible to try both tasks, to fail both tasks, but yet, by chance, you come across a work of art that is good for independent reasons. I mention this because I have not read Jane Smiley's novel, which, as far as I know, is good for independent reasons. But the movie is not. If there was nothing else wrong with that, it would still be possible to get around the fact that it's so so completely, incredibly DULL. Cornfields are even more boring than they would be in real life - which is not the case, since I can think of four movies ("The Wizard of Oz", "North by Northwest", "The Straight Story", "Kikujiro") in which cornfields are not boring at all.
