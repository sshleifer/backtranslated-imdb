Really horrible absurd trash. This film does everything wrong except that the reading time is less than an hour. Gore FX defy gravity and logic. There is no fear. The acting is abominable, each seeming to read his lines. There is an unexpected and stupid end where we discover that the things we have seen have never happened. Boy I hate the ends of the cops! They cover this scene with long shots of people doing nothing of interest (like putting on makeup or talking for what seems like an eternity). They have to film a movie of less than an hour? Ridiculous. The story itself is pretty thin. I mean it's just a variant of APRIL FOOL'S DAY, if I remember that movie well, and that movie was not that great either. The only good thing I can say is that it seems to have been well fired. Too bad nothing happens is very exciting.
