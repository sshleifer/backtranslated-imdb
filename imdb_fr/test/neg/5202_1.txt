It's an awful film from almost every point of view. As many things have already been highlighted in previous reviews, let me focus on the "Serbs" and "Delta Force" types in this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) The uniforms worn by the "Serbs" are not Serbian. And the helmets are also wrong. <br /> <br /> 2) The actors who play the "Serbs" do not speak Serbian, not even a language close to Serbian, unlike "Behind the enemy lines" where the Czech actors have done their best. to speak the language and add at least a little credibility to the film. <br /> <br /> 3) The gray-bearded "Serb general" looks and acts like a moron, shooting with his weapon whenever American soldiers call him name: <br /> <br /> - American soldier: "Gravic! Give up!" <br /> <br /> - General weak with gray beard: (draws his AK47) <br /> <br /> - American soldier: "Gravic! Get out!" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (draws his AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic, you are surrounded" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (draws his AK47 ) <br /> <br /> - The guy: "Excuse me, Mr. General weak-bearded, you see, we're out of breath and I sent the boy to buy a little more, but he has not come back yet ... "<br /> <br /> - GBMG: (click) <br /> <br /> 4) Since when does the army send AK47 to the Delta? Strength? I imagine they could not find enough M4 in Bulgaria, but there were a lot of old AK47s and test whites;) They might have had to look for tunes, they are cheaper and would not have in any case not harmed the credibility of the film. .. <br /> <br /> 5) In the scene where a DF officer hangs on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he keeps his finger on the trigger all the time. No sensible person with weapons training or just common sense would do that. I guess the actor understands that his level of freshness increases the longer he holds his weapon. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to common sense ..
