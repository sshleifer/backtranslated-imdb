I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found is a poorly written and misunderstood echo of people I know. <br /> <br /> Great moments between characters ?? including many scenes of Temuera Morrison and Lawrences Makoares together ?? have often been ruined by lengthy and wordy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble. Gorgeous and ill-fitting phrases echoed in Lawrence, especially as if he were the new Maori Messiah at his pulpit chair. <br /> <br /> When I watch a movie with Maori actors, I see that I can always choose half a dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life. With Crooked Earth, I struggled to find a key character who just rang for two hours. More ?? including Wiremu and Peka ?? ended up saying or doing things that I did not understand and could not connect. By the end of the film, the writer had managed to alienate the public where the Maori were not able to understand it and so the Pakeha had permission to dismiss him. My feeling is that the movie message ?? or at least the main of several that has been lobbed to the audience? is important enough to avoid using the extremities of the character. Unfortunately, no one who had read the script before filming it thought they could pass on this advice. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was invasive and, as irritating as the horrible "bing-bong" sound they laced through "Eyes Wide Shut". The audience was not so subtly allowed to laugh, cry, or be angry when the music changed. It reminded me of Darth Vader's input music in Star Wars: obvious and slightly amusing. <br /> <br /> I think there are people who would like this movie. It's funny in places, there is a lot of action and really powerful scenes. Calvin Tuteao and Quentin Hita also landed jobs. Overall though, I did not appreciate the experience as much as I should. Barb Wire, Speed ​​2, Dr. Moreau Island and Crooked Earth seem to be the shitty quartet of Tem.
