-So the weak excuse for a story in generic time loss involves a guy who wants to be a leader but can not get his career off the ground. His super hot wife is more successful and she does not seem to care about knowing he is a loser, but the man is not satisfied with that and wants to get more out of his life. One day, their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life. Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he found the man in the mask, he tries to get it back and that's the whole story. If it sounds exciting to you, someone has to throw you some water to wake you up <br /> <br /> - This movie is terrible. There is really no other way for me to say it and I just can not stretch it enough. The only good thing about all this is the woman who played the wife of Jamie Kennedy, who was sexy, but apart from her, nothing in this film deserves to be watched. I know it's for kids and that's why it's so stupid, but what about adults who have to take their kids to watch this junk? Why should we suffer from this bag of horrible and vomited vomit? The original mask was a very good film that mixed humor and fascinating stories. This is a lame attempt by filmmakers to take advantage of the franchise and, judging by the laughable BO, I guess the franchise will not last longer. <br /> <br /> - The director of photography must be effective beaten severely because the sweet colors of the film will make you want to throw up. If there was music, I was not paying attention because I had already perforated my eardrums to prevent me from hearing the horrible dialogue. Then there is the actor or at least what happens for the actor nowadays. You can watch an ad and see a better role in this one than this movie, but I can not really blame the actors, because it's the director who deserves the blame for not seemingly realizing that the actors had to make another king. ** take. If New Line tries to create a franchise with that, he has to improve his game by recruiting writers who can write and not think that his audience will watch all the shit that comes out. <br /> <br /> - Bottom line If you are a sadomasochist and you like to torture yourself, then please check it because it is painful to watch, but if you are not and that you really like to watch movies that are good, avoid them at all costs
