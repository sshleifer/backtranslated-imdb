I do not generally appreciate light attempts to create humorous stories, which means that "Anita no loses El Tren" can not have a very good score for me. The story is good: a mature but still beautiful woman finds a new love. But the attempts to make this film a romantic comedy sometimes only managed to be somewhat comical. <br /> <br /> Rosa María Sardà has demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in productions such as "Amic / Amat" (qv), "Todo Sobre mi Madre" (qv), "Las Amargas Lágrimas de Petra von Kant "(qv) and" El Embrujo de Shanghai "(qv). However, the powers in place over the years have earned him a lot of trivial things, for film and television. Something similar could be said of José Coronado: perfectly capable of producing serious performances. María Barranco belongs to this group. <br /> <br /> That finally left the feeling that I would be delighted to see a new realization of this film, in a serious tone, that would allow the actors to really show their skills. And the most curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same main actors. Loss of talent on a rather stupid movie that could have been very promising.
