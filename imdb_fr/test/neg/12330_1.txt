There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's put that aside. First, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and underrated movie. Cat was ... good, just horrible. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey was chosen for his casting because he is a brilliant physical comedian and he is committed without fear to extravagant and scandalous characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of mischief. <br /> <br /> Why, why, why Mike Myers ?? The kids do not care and the Austin Powers demographic is not going to spy on this movie. So what was the studio thinking about? <br /> <br /> The cat was apparently also related to Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why a New York accent? That does not quite fit with everything Dr. Seuss wrote. Myers was even allowed to slip into his Scottish shtick. I wonder how many different voices the director and the studio have tried to edit before yielding and saying "as long as you do not say fahklempt", you can keep the accents. "Meyers never seemed to find any comfort, whether with costume, makeup or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Jokes, however rare, were rude and inappropriate." When Myers takes a shovel of garden and book on camera: "dirty ho", it was only missing the shot, and even that would not have helped. <br /> <br /> The same people who created Whoville ', has clearly played a role in the creation of the city and the houses of 'Cat' The sets and props were very attractive, which gave the viewer a well-deserved distraction on the bad writing, the wrong direction and Myers. <br /> <br /> There was fun with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to know that she was participating in a film based on a Dr. Seuss classic and remained true to the genre. Call the SPCA This cat should be neutered and never allowed to reproduce.Please, please, not in a row.
