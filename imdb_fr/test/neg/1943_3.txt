Overall, I would call this a disappointing performance. He tries the old "horror anthology" approach, but fails miserably. The acting was bad, as were the stories. All the skin shown in the film was obviously random, just to attract R-rating for sex. Typical, I suppose, but bad anyway. Take your $ 5 and rent a real movie instead!
