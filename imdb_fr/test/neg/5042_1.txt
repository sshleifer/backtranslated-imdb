The acting was flat (at least none of the actors sounded as if they had just received the script that morning) and the quality of the film and sound made me think of the movie of the week of the 70s in bombs. The only thing that told me that it was indeed not a movie of the week of the 70s was the reference to DNA testing. But for me, being Eastern Orthodox, the most blatant thing about this .... movie ..... was the total romance of religion. Romania is 88% Orthodox, but you'll never know this movie: Father Soren is Irish. And I would have known even if I had not seen the actor play the dungeon of an Irish pub, Michael Sullivan, in the episode "Fairhaven" of Star Trek: Voyager. The bishop wore Roman clothing (and for the record, even Orthodox bishops do not wear their clothes unless they say the liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). The only non-Roman paraphernalia I saw was the three-bar cross on the door of the church, and even then, I had to squint to see it. The first critic stated that the producers had done their research. Well, if it's true, they messed up the religious aspect of the movie.
