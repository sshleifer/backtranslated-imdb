If you've seen this movie, you'll know it's one of the worst Bollywood movies ever made. Bollywood is known for copying Hollywood movies. Who would have known they would copy Terminator 2. The difference between the two film industries is that Hollywood spends millions and Bollywood spends 100 thousand (average). That's the problem with this movie, if you want to make a T2-style movie, then do it right. The director has added a fictional story about a reincarnated snake who finds his long lost daughter (dead at the previous birth) dead by 2 guys, but the blame is raised to 10 people. She suddenly reincarnates as a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people they blame for his death. Not to mention the evil snake or the reincarnated villain, he has a kind of super powers. It can turn into anything, it can fly, disappear, firepower, wind energy, you name it, it has it. He even bazooker and survives the T1000 style. You're probably wondering how he survives. his best not to ask, and his best not to waste time and money on this film. It's better to forget that this movie is even out. I think it's a shame to use a big starcast for this scandalous movie with an absurd story.
