I've loved Milos Forman's movies since I saw "A Cuckoo's Nest Flight" and "Amadeus" (two great masterpieces), but when I saw "Hair", I wondered if it was the same Milos Forman. This film is boring and uninteresting to say the least. OK, the music is pretty good, but on screen, it looks like a bunch of drug addicts dancing (wait a minute ... that's what it really is!). In fact, the only interesting part, and the only one in which the talent of Milos appears, is the last 15 minutes (SPOILER !!) from the moment when Berger takes the place of Claude as a soldier engaged in the Vietnam War . These 15 minutes are moving and well directed, but it is unfortunate that we have to endure so many terrible things before that. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe it's one of those movies you need to be "on the subject" to appreciate (the subject being marijuana, acid and other drugs that the film glorifies). I'm not...
