Be very afraid of anyone who loves this movie. They probably inhaled too many children with splinters of paint. It's so horrible that I refuse to relive a plot. Oh yes, there was not one! This film is a true definition of what Hollywood creates for people who do not want to think about theater. Do the bad guys win? Do good guys win? We do not care!
