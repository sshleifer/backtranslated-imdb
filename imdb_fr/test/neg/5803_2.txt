Call me old-fashioned, but I like movies with intrigues. I thought that "Stoner Comedy" was just a way to more accurately describe a comedy in which a lot of weeds are smoked and that viewers are more inclined to take full advantage of it. "Grandma's Boy", however, decided that it was a full niche and that the stoners were part of the comedy cake to be achieved. Apparently Allen Covert (star and producer) and Happy Madison's gang were right, but that does not make "Grandma's Boy" less boring and less funny. They may be completely defeated - but the characters are mostly half-cooked. <br /> <br /> Alex (Covert, longtime actor Adam Sandler, star of the first appearance) is a professional video game tester over 30 years old. whose roommate expelled them. He could look for a new apartment, but we will not have a movie. After trying a few friends, he ends up living with good old grandmother Lilly (Doris Roberts of "Everybody Loves Raymond"). She wakes him up at 6 am and asks him to do the housework. Soon, he falls asleep on his work. The new video game suite may not be completed before the deadline. <br /> <br /> Like most people, Alex takes care of his frustration and eliminates boredom by playing video games or by getting high, or both. His friends / colleagues all do the same thing. Most of them are virgins who live at home in addition to enjoying video games. They are all clumsy and with the exception of Nick Swardson and Joel Moore (only sometimes), their characters are not funny. It's funny if you're blazed ... of course, I guess, but I can not say from experience. <br /> <br /> Maybe all we are losing is that we guys are playing, playing video games and clumsily embarrassing women with attention to their breasts, but even so , that should not be the driving force of any movie. Older women should also not become strong in accidents (seeing it coming) or as crude sexual jokes - but that's what happens when a movie has nothing to do with it. No conflict occurs before the last 20 minutes, apart from the slight problems of lack of pot, Alex trying to make love to the hot girl (Linda Cardellini) and the guys who are struggling to finish their levels for the game deadline video. <BR /> <br /> Characters can be a valuable asset to these sinister stoner movies, but apart from Doris Roberts, this adorable Swardson is the virgin friend who lives with her parents and calls them her roommates and the Joel Moore's ability to make robot sounds. there is little ingenuity of character. Covert is a commonplace character, without comic dimension, his friend the distributor Dante is an incompetent actor and a waste of time on the screen. Jonah Hill and Kevin Nealon are written on the periphery, whatever. If you like movies about anything and look at them in a state of mind and body that reinforce this nothingness, "Grandma's Boy" will probably be what you are looking for. Those who need a little more talent and wit to embark on a comedy will not be affected. All I can say about "Grandma's Boy" is that he is watchable despite his uselessness. It will not seem like a complete waste of time, but you will want to take medicine to at least make the most of the hour and a half. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com
