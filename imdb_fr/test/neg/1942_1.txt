This is by far the worst and most stupid show I have ever seen on television. It is almost physically painful to see an adult (in his twenties) doing nothing but torturing and mocking his parents, who always seem to have no idea what stunts they are forced to bear by their fool son and his other stupid mates. Of course, I know her parents know about it, but I really hate the way they always act as if they are completely taken by surprise. This seems to be a fake. And I really hate the intro of the series, in which a voice off asks "Bam Margera, what will he think then?!?!" (I think it's like that, anyway), and Bam himself says, "No matter what I want!" - SENSATIONAL! Bam is really a hell breeder - live at home with mom and dad! Of course, the word "f ^ * k" is replaced by a beep of good taste, but we have the message. Bam is the real rebel, at least in his own eyes. Of course, Bam and his group of numb skiffs cater to a teen audience and, of course, it's an MTV show, but please go up a bit. It's painfully predictable and stupid, and therefore anything but boring.
