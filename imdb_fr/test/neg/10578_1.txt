I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. I'm 20 years old and this movie was way too much for me. I could not imagine taking a teenager, a teenager or (especially) a child in this movie. It was brutal and offensive. I was totally misled by his PG-13 rating and the glimpses I had seen for that. Initially, I had already seen clips of this film on Nickelodeon, and I thought it was very pretty (maybe I do not remember the preview correctly). In addition, Drake Bell (the main character of the film) plays the lead role on a Nickelodeon TV show that targets pre-teens and young teens. I really did not think the movie's content would be so risky. I should have done more research on this before going there. However, I hope parents will read this movie before bringing their kids to see it just because it contains Drake Bell. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do NOT take your kids or teenagers to see this movie. The rating should have been R. There are tons of sexual references, references to drugs and disturbing events throughout the film. Examples: Drake Bell is attacked by sexually addicted animals, several scenes involving men clutching a woman's breasts, a lot of profanity, Drake Bell uses a bang to smoke vanilla icing (or something like that) , movie, and an old lady and her dog are shredded. There are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie. It was really humiliating for women in general. The film was made by the people who made the series Scary Movie, so it should tell you something. Remember that watching movies like this can give kids and teens all kinds of misconceptions about sex, drugs and violence. Most children and teenagers can not decipher between parody, comedy and reality. <br /> <br /> I have a sense of humor. I also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its kind. But I find the possibility that children and teenagers go to see this movie HORRIFYING. <br /> <br /> Regarding the overall quality of the film, I did not think it was so original or funny. It was dragged in places and some of the humor was forced and painful. The acting was not too bad, considering the seriousness of the scenario. If you are an adult or an older teen looking for a fun movie, ignore it or rent it.
