First, let me begin by saying that I am a devoted supporter of C Thomas Howell's career since "The Outsiders" and "The Hitcher". He was a rising star in the 1980s - with hits such as "Soul Man" as well. The future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to start from there and really assert himself in Hollywood. In simple terms, Tom Cruise participated a little in "The Outsiders", while Howell was in the lead. Watch cruise today !!! But choosing a material like this will only further denigrate Howell's career - if that were possible. Why does he choose things like that? A small role in a big movie would be more beneficial to him than this garbage. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds here essentially in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone lives in clandestinity where chaos reigns. Howell is a shepherd - protects the flock of various religious leaders by killing all the undesirables. He is a hitman in other words. <br /> <br /> The sets are so bad that they would not seem out of place during an episode of the Thunderbirds. The use of slow motion is repeated unnecessarily in the film, but it is well supported by a bad acting (and bad is a nice word here), no continuity, scenes that are projected without any reason, vehicles that seemed to have been made from a box of Corn Flakes and a director's style that bordered on stupidity. Oh yes, and the scenario was so pathetic. <br /> <br /> I hate writing bad reviews about movies - especially those in which I really like the star - but this movie is so bad that I do not believe for a second that anyone would have could be proud of it. I am neither filmmaker nor director, but I would hide my head in the sand if I had spent the time and money spent on this film. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a monumental waste. of time and energy and I would never recommend anyone to see this movie. He came for free with a DVD player that I bought, but I still turned off the thing halfway because I was embarrassed for Howell. Go C - give yourself some credit and get away from these untouched wonders and try to hit and get a good share - even small. <br /> <br /> 1/10 - and only because there is no adjustment for 0/10.
