Good attempt to address the unconventional topic of romances from May to December. However, the treatment is totally unrealistic. Of course, men of sixty can fall in love with younger women, but they are usually adult women with whom they share common interests, values ​​and points of view ... and not neurotic, immature and almost minor girls. Of course, there are exceptions and they are almost like pedophiles! Sorry RGV, but it is not credible that a sensible and accomplished sexagenarian would throw a comfortable family life and become a joke for his peers ... all for an 18 year old who has no practical thought in his head and behaving like an unstable escape from a psychiatric facility. You do not need a doctorate in psychology to see that Amitabh's character is seduced by sex and that the young woman has unresolved abandonment problems and dad's problems. <br /> <br /> As for the recurring Vijay scene perched on the edge of a cliff, contemplating suicide, it's about as close to wanting to have something in common with Jiah, behaving like a hit teenager. <br /> <br /> On a positive note: the actors did good work and good cinematography.
