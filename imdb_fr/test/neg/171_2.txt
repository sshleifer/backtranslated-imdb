Oh my God! It could be a very interesting film and in fact it is. I would have liked to give him a 5 but I give a 2 for my vote. Why? I saw him in a theater! See this movie on DVD or on TV! The filming is really really POOR !!!!! It's shaking all the time, in a completely tasteless framing! <br /> <br /> It's really painful to see this movie very interesting in a cinema. You quickly get seasick and you have to make a huge effort not to throw up on your neighbor's seat! <br /> <br /> It's a shame, the story is mounted in a non-linear way, which is quite rare (and very good idea!) for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Look at this at home!
