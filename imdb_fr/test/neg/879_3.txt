Here in Australia, Nights in Rodanthe is promoted in the same class as the Notebook. Quite frankly, only rottenness. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like a recipe. On paper, we all have the right ingredients ... Richard Gere is the best of his kind, Diane Lane, a former favorite of "Under Tuscan Sun" and "Infidel", her location on the edge of the ocean, loneliness and yet the film is nil. Yesterday afternoon, during the session, a woman next to my wife fell asleep and halfway through the film, she got up and left! The main problem is that there is no strengthening or credibility of the relationship in the first place. And maybe there are too many long faces and downtime if you like the stories that Gere and Lane's characters tell in the movie. There are balanced hours with perhaps 5 minutes of what we can see ... romance! There is no heat in Gere's character, Lane looks horrible at the beginning of the movie and everything has been washed. So, as a spectator, we can not really connect to the characters. <br /> <br /> Others here say the book is excellent. Whether it's the screenplay, the production or the production, someone here ruined this film. It's as if the scenes and the accumulation were a deck of cards, if it was not instead of being in the right order, they had just been thrown from everywhere. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ... save your money for when it hits the video stores and even then wait for a good deal when it goes to the weekly rate.
