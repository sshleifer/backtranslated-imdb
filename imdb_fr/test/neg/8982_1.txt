This film had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> Everything has been mixed or modified. Most of the movie did not even contain the book. <br /> <br /> This film should never have been viewed. It was a big disappointment for me when I loved the book so much and then to watch how this film ruined everything. <br /> <br /> I would never recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Nora Roberts or JD Robb. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie is not worth watching, because it is really out of the book.
