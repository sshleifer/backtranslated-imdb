I really wanted to love this film because it's refreshing and different from the hordes of clones of horror movies everyday, and I appreciate that filmmakers are looking for something original. Unfortunately, the plot did not work and none of the characters were kind enough for me to really care about them or their fate. <br /> <br /> Visually, The Toybox was rather interesting. The director took a lot of somewhat risky gestures, such as adding small pieces of animation (Flash-like) in parts and really showcasing some of the special effects (like the light of a certain amulet). Sometimes it worked and sometimes not, but he deserved congratulations for his attempt and the cinematography was generally of high quality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this same approach of throwing a lot of things to the wall to see which sticks were applied to the plot, the results are not very good. The film never really finds the tone that suits it, from black comedy to family soap opera to 80s witchcraft movie, from nostalgia for childhood to that of the family of the family. Taken in isolation, each of these elements works well enough, but nothing ever combines into a satisfying whole. In addition, the major parts of the plot are never really explained. I'm not one to like spooning anything and I love movies that let the audience decide, but the games left over from The Toybox just seem like they've run out of money before. they could explain them or they did not really think at first. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the director's next project, because I think a lot of talent is hiding under the surface, but I can not really recommend The Toybox itself.
