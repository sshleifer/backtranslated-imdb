In Los Angeles, alcoholic and lazy Hank Chinaski (Matt Dillon) performs many unqualified functions just to have enough money to drink and play horse racing. Her one and only goal is to write and have sex with dirty women. <br /> <br /> "Factotum" is an uninteresting, useless and extremely boring movie about a drunk irresponsible wanderer who works a few days or weeks just to get enough money to buy mind and play, he is immediately fired because of his irresponsible behavior. According to IMDb, this character would be the fictional alter-ego of the author Charles Bukowski and, based on this story, I will certainly never read any of his novels. Honestly, if the viewer loves this theme of alcoholic couples, it is better to watch Hector Babenco's "Ironweed", moving and heartbreaking, or "Storie di Ordinaria Follia" by Marco Ferreri, based on the life of the same writer. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Factotum" Sem Destino "(" Factotum without destiny ")
