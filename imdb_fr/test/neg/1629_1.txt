Even MST3K could not make this drek painful, long, and ultimately mind-blowing, funny or entertaining. While most bad movies in themselves are hilariously bad, this one is one of those few videos that use the word bad in its literal sense. <br /> <br /> The element that makes this film so painful to watch is not the lack of history, but the fact that SOOOO has a lot of background in the first half-hour is quite ridiculous and more difficult to follow than a highway when driving without a lighthouse. <br /> <br /> The hero of the film Ator, is nothing more than sweets for the eye for this energetic film. Wearing a loincloth and wearing "pecs like melons", as Joel says, he belongs more to a fitness magazine than to here. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this ONLY to hard-hard, and I mean hardcore followers of cheese. If you have an enemy, recommend them this movie. If you succeed, I congratulate you. You should be able to cross anything.
