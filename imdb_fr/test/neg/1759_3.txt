I found the first 90 minutes of this movie very interesting, even if some parts were ridiculous (that is to say the character of Philip Seymour Hoffman). The last 60 minutes were unpleasant and I began to lose interest in the film. The last hour lasted forever, it seems. <br /> <br /> The film is well played and I understand why Rene Zellweger won an Oscar because his character was so interesting. The film is also beautifully filmed and the story is moving. However, I found the message was bad: it was not surprising nowadays in Hollywood. In this story, "Inman" (Jude Law) abandons the Confederate army during the Civil War. His reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him home. He is also disillusioned by the war. (Can you imagine if every soldier in a similar boat deserted the army during the two world wars ?!) <br /> <br /> Yet, in this film, all this is perfectly acceptable. Once again, what liberal filmmaker has he had a good thing to say about the US military? To add to their left-wing orientation, they describe a vigilante-like group attacking deserters as cold-blooded sick killers. Well, in the world of movies, as we know, good is described as bad and evil is good ... and only liberals would portray deserters as heroes.
