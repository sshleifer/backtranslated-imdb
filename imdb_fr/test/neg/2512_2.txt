It's a pretty useless remake. Starting with the opening title of the original was a real mistake, because it reminded the viewer how good it was a great little vintage cooler. The following new version is a redundancy exercise. <br /> <br /> Brian Kerwin plays the role of a "city-dweller" photographer who returns to a semi-deserted desert town populated by many underdeveloped clichés: the sucking lollipop Daby-Doll Lolita, the "old successful parakeet, crippled vet and his Asian wife, etc ... <br /> <br /> Kerwin's character attends the crush of "something" on a hill and soon after the start of strange things happen as pieces of strange blue rock are scattered around. The temperature starts to rise, all the water in the area disappears, people start to behave strangely, things explode. Kerwin's character comes in and out of his car more often than humanly possible in a movie. The film develops no sense of place, no character development, no humor, no tension. Everything that made Jack Arnold's original a classic terrifying paranoia of the Cold War was abandoned. The special effects are not very special. The inside of the boat looks like pieces of plastic film glued around ropes that were then hung in front. from the camera to frame some of the most tasteless and awkward thread jobs ever put on the screen. The script is repetitive - everyone says at least twice, Kerwin can say "get out of here" at least three times during the movie, twice in a scene. Tons of things remain unexplained in the end - why do extraterrestrials need all the heat and water for example? - it is not that those who look at it care; <br /> <br /> The actors' game is enough - better than the script, which sometimes has an underestimated and deserved quality of improvisation. Although often the actors seem to want to solve the problem as quickly as possible - a notable example is the case where Elizabeth Peña records the shortest and most symbolic moment of the "desperate desperate gesture of the hands to face" before following the pouting son Stevie before watching him do "an sulky sulky teenager smashing something from a table" gesture. <br /> <br /> Continuity errors include the sticker (GB) on the back of the Kerwin jeep appearing and disappearing, a double action of the gas in the exploding car, a city dweller simultaneously being two places - once in the Alien Stevie shot immediately after his POV point of view, Elizabeth Peña seeming to close twice the door of a car. You can say I was taken, right? The movie makes the biggest mistake. It's boring.
