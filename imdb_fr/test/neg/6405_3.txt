You might think this game is about a man obsessed with numbers. And of course, this is an interesting subject: can a person become so obsessed with something marginal, like a simple number, that she completely loses touch with reality and becomes desperately delusional and paranoid? <br /> <br /> Well, maybe someone will make a movie about it someday. This one has unfortunately nothing to do with the above, no matter what the trailers (or even the movie itself) would have you believe. I would like to say that this number is just a MacGuffin, but it's not even that. It's useless. A gadget. A hook for an unsuspecting public. <br /> <br /> And what's the movie about? A dog catcher (Carrey) who is obsessed with a black cheese crime book, because he thinks that it reflects somehow his own life. The. Of course, the character of the book - detective Fingerling (sigh) - is obsessed with number 23 and, for some reason, Carrey himself becomes obsessed and starts to see the number everywhere ... but there is only a quilted appearance and totally irrelevant. In fact, you can delete all 23 references and leave the main character or characters obsessed with cheese or something like that, and you will have exactly the same story. It is painfully obvious that all "23" writings were written after the story had already been finished, rejected and sent for "rewriting". <br /> <br /> Which would be OK .. I guess .. if the movie was not dull, dull, dull. Half of the film is told, for chrissakes. You do not watch the movie, you listen to Jim Carrey tell the movie. About a quarter of Carrey starts reading the book and from then on, until the horribly clich√© ends, we are forced to look at "real" scenes of the life of catcher (where nothing happens) interspersed of a narrative book "black and black" "Scenes that will leave you sneering or just depressed.It's like the" city of sin "of a poor man with all the violence cut out, told by Carrey and shown in slow motion Ugh. <br /> <br /> It's a simple case of C filming filmed somehow with a film cast A .. probably because of the hook of "number 23" which, I suppose, seemed quite intriguing on paper to guarantee the premium Hollywood treatment.However, since, as I said before, the movie carries the number 23 as much as cheese production in Switzerland, one can not feel anything from being cheated. br /> <br /> I give "Fingerling - the movie" 3 out of 10, because I guess it does not did not insult my intelligence as much as "Forsaken" made me or plainly made me suicidal like "Battlefield Earth" and the bottom of the ladder must be reserved for abominations like these. But do not worry, it's still a pretty ugly movie.
