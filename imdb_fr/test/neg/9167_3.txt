Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate plan to hijack a casino, like "Ocean's 11", and block it on the Hell's Angels. Bad movement. For a movie with the words Hell's Angels AND number 69 ET featuring the current Hell's Angels, this movie is surprisingly tamed. The Hell's Angels really deserve a better movie to be centered on them. Not this snoorefest. Fortunately, this is one of the DVDs containing Joe Bob Briggs' comments, which considerably lessens the pain of sitting. If you look at it otherwise, let me recommend something to you. DO NOT !! <br /> <br /> My Note: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Commentary by Joe Bob Brigg; Conny Van Dyke's message to her fans (she has more than one?); Photo gallery; Theatrical trailer; and trailers for "Blood Shack", "Hell High", "Samurai Cop" and "The Hollywood Strangler"
