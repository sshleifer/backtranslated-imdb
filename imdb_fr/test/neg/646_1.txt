I was thinking about this film when I was looking at it nash ... why ... because the two films claim to be playing a late robot, this film shot years earlier but probably written by a screenwriter who drank the same biotoxic coffee or something like that. ..Who ... avoid at all costs even to pay tribute to the great and lamented Andy Kaufman is difficult to do here ... find another movie or just watch the reruns of taxis on TV late ... his character de latka gravas is so much more adorable ... TANK YOU BERRY MUCH
