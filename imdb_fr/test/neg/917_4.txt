I'm usually a fan of "art" and "foreign" movies, but when I saw this one, my reaction was "it must be described as experimental because it makes no sense". The "action" is static while bouncing from one place to another. There are not enough titles to specify who is who and what their relationships are. Apparently, the essential thing was to show that in the face of murder, adultery and a generally strange and dissolute behavior, the remedy offered by the powers in place is to banish a totally innocent black man.
