Proof, if it was needed, that Hammer would have left his vampires firmly in the Victorian era. After all, vampirism is a matter of repressed sexuality. The concept is not relevant in London in 1972, with about thirty years posing as teenagers delirium. <br /> <br /> Remember that at that time Hammer was beating very hard. The public was tired of the horror of the salons of the 50s and 60s. The studio has therefore tried everything to bring them back, including abundant nudity (LUST FOR A VAMPIRE, etc.) and an update of their characters - which apparently did not work as a Hammer. rested almost in his grave two years later. Too bad ... <br /> <br /> But I still have a great fondness for the classical period of the hammer from 1957-1965.
