The first two films in this series have excelled for their images of the natural world and ordinary people stuck in the middle of society. This film does not contain any of these natural sequences, which I understand is part of the problem, but it really gives the entire video component of the film the appearance of random images stuck together. skeletons, and so on. Sometimes archive footage is taken advantage of (the nationalism / finance segment around 35:00), but this usually gives the impression that the video lacks meaningful content, and forces you to accept the context of stock photographers rather than that of the director. This is no better than the video displayed on a karaoke machine. Three stars added for the Philip Glass soundtrack.
