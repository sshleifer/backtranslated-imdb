The responsibility for this awful film lies with the director, Martin Campbell. After viewing some of his credits in recent years, this was to be one of his first concerts. He had a more than decent cast, but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. There were scenes that made absolutely no sense. Where was his head ... was he drugged? I was looking forward to this movie because of Oldman & Bacon. It might have been a tight schedule for the shoot and Campbell just had to "hit it". I can not imagine that the story that Campbell directed is even close to the story written by the writer. Oldman & Bacon, along with the rest of the cast, had to slip under their chair if they went to the screening. As a poster pointed out, Karen Young made a very good fight scene with Bacon. She really "let go". It is unfortunate that I have to occupy more space just to stay within the guidelines of what the IMDb requires, because I really have nothing else to say about this uninteresting movie. You do not have to be a "wind bag" when you're criticizing a terrible movie and want the IMDb to change the number of words to complete a review.
