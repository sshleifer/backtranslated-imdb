It is difficult to comment on this film. This is one of the few films that Dimension has not put aside yet (it's hard to find a reason for that) and it has been rushed into an impressive 500 theaters, it's its opening day. Maybe Dimension was worried that people would react to a marsh creature using his tow truck to demolish a house piece by piece. <br /> <br /> Ray Sawyer is just a tow truck driver, until he saves a voodoo priestess a bad car accident, and in return he is attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowns . At the morgue, Ray comes back to life and harasses a group of teenagers who witnessed the terrible accident. <br /> <br /> This film is characterized by very fine characters. I did not care a moment about one of them. In addition, the dialogue was less than ho-hum. In addition, it was very predictable. The characters did the typical things of stupid horror movie characters, like checking for crunching noises, calling people's names and tripping over a rock while they are being chased. I could also choose immediately who would be the last girl. And why did the camera have these quick white flashes every time someone died or the murderer was shown? <br /> <br /> What is good? Well, there's an awesome suspense scene where the murderer walks under the waters of the swamp to reach his victims and a tension sequence where the last girl has to camouflage herself with a lot of other corpses under the murderer's gaze . <br /> <br /> But other than that, it's another disappointment from August / September. I was looking forward to it, but I did not get what we expected.
