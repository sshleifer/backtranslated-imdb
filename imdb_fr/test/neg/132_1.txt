Let me start by saying that 1 in 10 is too good for this movie. It's a pity that IMDb does not have tenths of a star ... I watched the abortion of a movie in the middle of the night because of insomnia, and it was really bad. The plot was horrible. The game was horrible. The movie was completely boring. "malachi" looked like Shadow with Alec Baldwin (The Shadow is infinitely better than this one too) Eve's character was so undeveloped and 2 dimensional that she did not even catch my attention. I did not even know her name was Eve. Don was interesting when he was silent. The "TWIST" (if you can call it that) was laughable and pathetic. When he arrived, the film did such a horrible job of creating suspense or attachment to a character that I simply thought "Who gives an S ***". The only thing that made me raise an eyebrow about this movie was the fact that the med. The teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 (a film also light-years away from this slaughter of motion pictures.) Anyone involved in this film should be ashamed to have lost 90 minutes of his time. No wonder no one in this movie had a successful career. In summary .... This movie is so bad, I feel dirty and I need a shower. Worst film in history, Gigli was better, Prom Night (the remake) was better and I dare to say Saw IV was better ...........
