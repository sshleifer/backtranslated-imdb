The actors were not credible. The story was really weak, total and totally predictable. Really disappointed by Depardieu. It is unfortunate that they have not focused more on the struggle of the Canadian struggle for independence. We have already seen this love story many times before, but with better actors! We had to wait the last 15 minutes for a little feeling of drama! The soundtrack was totally disturbing. The underline hit you on the head with sentimentality. But really too much. The only thing we found satisfying was the fact that they let the Indians speak their language. And we found the cinematography of the Indian village relatively realistic.
