Everything you do in this world should have at least one meaning. Unfortunately, very little "delusion" makes sense. Jennifer Rubin is adequate in her role as the main compress of the hit man Kyle Secor. Secor, meanwhile, exaggerates to the point of annoyance. Jim Metzler, the hijacked yuppie is very amazing as a novice, seeking revenge, opponent. When Jennifer Rubin returns the money that she carefully concealed, all credibility is lost and the weapons that point the final confrontation between Secor and Metzler are beyond ridicule. Avoid "delirium" unless you are delusional enough to believe the wrong positive reviews. - MERK
