I agree with a commentator who says it's really impossible to see Glen or Glenda again? objectively. If this is the case, the film should be considered quite terrible given the hilarious and complicated dialogue, generally mediocre to mediocre roles of the actors as well as zero production values. However, such an evaluation does not reflect the absolutely fascinating experience of seeing this film unfold as it unfolds. The subject of the film is not cross-dressing and it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the fifties. It is not even advocacy for the tolerance of people who adopt alternative life choices that fascinates except as a historical relic. <br /> <br /> No, what's the difference between Glen and Glenda? Another fascinating film after 50 years, Ed Wood unveiled his psyche in the same way that directors such as Hitchcock or Godard, despite their superior talents, never did. In Glen or Glenda, Wood is not afraid to reveal his deeply conflicting feelings of being a transvestite despite advocating for tolerance throughout the film. Indeed, the conclusion of the film suggests that Ed Wood's character, Glen, will be able to "kill" his female counterpart Glenda by transferring Glen's feelings of love and affection for his female counterpart to his future wife, Barbara. The psychiatrist reassures even Glen and Barbara that as soon as Glen makes this psychic transfer, Glenda will disappear. Thus, although Wood could advocate for the tolerance of transvestites in general, he was not so sure of wanting it for himself. <br /> <br /> In addition, Wood was not afraid to throw everything that went through his head. screen. He did it with the archive footage he could get his hands on. If that did not cohesive, so what? What the viewer has seen in Glen or Glenda in particular is Ed Wood's imaginative world in all its fundamental strangeness. <br /> <br /> The only comment I want to add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria mentioned in the first paragraph. The strangely memorable effect of the film despite its technically atrocious qualities can not be evaluated.
