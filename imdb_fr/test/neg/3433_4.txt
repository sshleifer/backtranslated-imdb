I thought this movie was fine. <br /> <br /> On paper, this film contains everything a person may want! Romance, comedy, drama. A bank robbery, a unique cast, good music and stories! <br /> <br /> In reality, this film was mostly embarrassing, and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br /> a) This is my biggest problem: editing. This film has by far the worst editing I have ever seen, except for commercials for local dealers. The editing could have been better done by a deaf patient with Parkinson's who was tapping against iMovie with a dead cat. There are scenes where two characters talk to each other and you can see their lips move and the audio / video is not synchronized because it is clearly doubled. Why was it doubled? I do not know! His English double English! The voices were made in a studio elsewhere in some scenes! Could not they find a boom-mic ?! They are not expensive. Jesus, even I own one! And I do not make movies! <br /> <br /> b) Andrew Keegan's performance was inadequate. He really did not seem to want to be part of this project and his acting was the equivalent of a sketch played by D.A.R.E. for schoolchildren. At least John Krasinksi showed a little enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Yes, John Krasinski is the only reason I rented this movie, and that's the only real reason to watch. He did a good spiritual performance and he was the most three-dimensional character. The character of Dean Edwards was rather thin, just like whats-her-face. <br /> <br /> Word of the end? If you're a fan of John Krasinski, it's worth it. Otherwise, do not even worry. Mounting
