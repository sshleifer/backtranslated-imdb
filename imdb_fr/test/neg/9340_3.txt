I found the film a bit predictable and boring, but I'm 14 years old. <br /> <br /> I was really bored by my little cousin because she was so hyper that day, so I saw a movie on the Disney channel and I put it on and told her about it watch. <br /> <br /> she is 6 years old and she loved the movie. She did not feel like finishing, but I did not understand that it was Eddie, the star of the video. shoot I thought it was Jordan's video ?! but she appreciated. <br /> <br /> I noticed mistakes like, in the end, Jordan did not really play the guitar, but she never did. <br /> <br /> it's really a film for those who are seriously bored or who are under 10 years old. <br /> <br /> it calmed my cousin. <br /> <br /> was singing for the rest of the day then.
