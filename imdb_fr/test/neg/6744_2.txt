For me, it just did not look like GI Joe. When I looked at him child, I did not care. In fact, the part that pleased me the most about it was the opening credits. They change so many facts and reverse the story too. Cobra Commander is supposed to be part of this stupid breed of reptiles in Antarctica or in a frozen place. Although I always thought he was a normal guy, every time you saw his eyes in the series, they were surrounded by a flesh of normal color and not the blue in which his face was here. There is just too much shit in this one to try to make this movie a spectacular movie, but for me, it ruins everything for which I watched the show.
