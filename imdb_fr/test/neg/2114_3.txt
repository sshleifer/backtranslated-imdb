Just after watching first and it's very silly. I have watched an episode of Bones first, then the eleventh hour. The 11th hour should be embarrassed. <br /> <br /> She is so weak. Stewart presents himself as a government scientist. No mention of what kind of scientist comes from general science. In a program on cloning, they bring a guardian, who is paid to eliminate unsuccessful embryos, in a church and kneels in front of the statue of Jesus on the cross to ask forgiveness ... and also tell them where is the bad guy as they can move the plot on. Now it's science at work :( <br /> <br /> There's an idiot, not an idiot, a bit where Picard rages in front of a television that announces a skin scream that makes you look younger , shouting "It's a lie", like her An excited assistant gets fiddled by the local local boiler next door. <br /> <br /> The end of the first episode looks like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady, named after Pinnochios papa, has the mission to advance the clumsy plot She beckons to Picard from the street as she gets in a taxi Picard is a floor above and he looks out the window with an air threatening ... she escapes, he would like to try to crumble ... or maybe call the cops .. ... or maybe take the taxi number and call or maybe something other than ... I waved my hand and got into a taxi and I can not do anything until the end of next week ... mah hahahahah. Too bad, it's so stupid. At one point, a grieving father is convinced by Picard that even if a replica-born son was born, he would never be his son because his son had a soul. these are the good guys. The general scientist opposes cloning by claiming that every soul is unique and sure of the reason why you would like to be cloned. <br /> <br /> Although scientist general Picard finds cloning a little awkward, he is quite willing to do stem cell research and even goes as far as saying that humanity if it is not allowed. He has a rather strident speech about its importance. Of course, he does not mention a single example. This kind of sums up the show. Words in fashion and tawdriness.
