This World War II film, which takes place in Borneo, strives to work on as many levels as it is a pity that it fails all. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte is a fugitive American who attends the executions of his comrades by the Japanese. He wanders in the jungles of Borneo, lost. Cue Nigel Havers, who finds the Nolte adoption tribe. Nolte, who now looks like Robert Plant, has become the new king of his tribe. He defeated a convinced warrior in a bloody battle and had a tattoo on his chest (a dragon). Now, before you go out and you get a painful tattoo and a one-way trip to Borneo, things are not going well in Noltland. Havers needs the help of the tribe to fight the Japanese invading the island. He teaches the natives to use machine guns and starts shooting a lot. As the tribe gains success, they come up against a new squadron of Japanese that does not look like the others. This team cannibalize the villages it conquers to keep its strength (talking about your sushi), and it moves faster in the jungle than the tribe. Since we know the outcome of the war, we know that the tribe triumphs, but with heavy losses. Here comes the spoilers: Havers is wounded and returned to "civilization". He gives the location of the kingdom and Nolte is captured. Havers then tries to free Nolte and the end credits are released. <br /> <br /> Milius's orientation is certainly adequate, but the scenario is rather vague in its motivations. He introduces the story ideas and then abandons them to move on to the next idea. Nolte is awful as the soldier became king and desperately tries to channel the spirit of Colonel Kurtz of Marlon Brando. He talks about the freedom, the beauty of the jungle and the wealth of his people, and you will not believe for a moment the words he utters. He is often unintentionally funny, especially on his first trip into the jungle, and passes the rest of the movie sounding like a hippie. Nigel Havers spends the movie watching Nolte as if he were Raquel Welch. The vague homosexual current that exists between the two goes beyond friendship, not quite sex, and settles into a tacit relationship in which the natives had to speak. <br /> <br /> Havers often stands around and has an internal conflict, driven back to hunting at the head of the tribe, but basking in Nolte's attention. His fellow British soldiers became native faster than the Bounty landing in Tahiti, but all I saw about Borneo is that it is very wet and there is a lot of greenery. <br /> <br /> The decisive betrayal away from Nolte, is completely devoid of reason. No reason has been given to explain why Havers does it, except for the film to continue. I was angry when, by chance, Havers and Nolte found themselves on the same boat heading for the Philippines, the boat ran aground, and Havers ran to the hold to release the freshly mown Nolte. No farewell kiss, but Havers bids farewell to the king and explains the title. <br /> <br /> If you were waging a war and an enemy squadron was eating your allies, would not that make you lose your head? This Japanese elite team is not sufficiently shown, even if their eating habits are so horrible that I would immediately become a conscientious objector. The same type of ghostly enemy was treated much better in "The 13th Warrior". <br /> <br /> Other types of interesting ideas are abandoned. What about the fact that modern technology is killing so many people backward? Why did King Nolte let the British use his subjects without much hesitation? Why does not Hollywood find a decent actor to play General Douglas MacArthur? <br /> <br /> In the end, "Farewell to the King" is a failure that is not anchored in a strong lead and trying to be too much of things without thinking and exploring its options. I can not recommend this one. <br /> <br /> This film is classified (PG13) for strong physical violence, armed violence, some gore, some blasphemies, some sexual references and situations for adults.
