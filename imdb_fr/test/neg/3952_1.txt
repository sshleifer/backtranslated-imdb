A group of young adults opens a plain of escape to Elizabeth Bathory's mind as she recites her poem from a video game meant to represent a session. The only one who dies in the game is Miller (Adam Goldberg) who is also found dead in the same way that he died in the said video game. While the characters of the other players did not die in the video game, the recitation of his poem propelled the video game into reality with CGI characters chasing and killing them, one by one. They must follow certain methods by using a mirror and nails to defeat Bathory and save their skin. <br /> <br /> If this idea seems stupid, it's because it is. The characters are humble rejects from the bad TV shows of the WB, this time allowed to proffer blasphemies. This movie follows the rules of the slasher, but does not show much violence or gore. The PG-13 remains safe, with most deaths occurring off-screen. There is a scene where the real hero and the heroine run behind the video game characters who pursue them. Yes, it's so bad. Nothing to recommend. Beautiful distribution, including Sophia Bush in October.
