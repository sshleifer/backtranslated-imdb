It's boring. <br /> <br /> It's slow. <br /> <br /> Where are the nasty and brutal murders? Where is the tension that is supposed to scare us? It's like watching Sesame Street without the funny characters of Ernie and Bert or Grover. <br /> <br /> It's really bad. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the writing ... maybe the direction ... Maybe the acting, perhaps the editing, maybe the cinematography, maybe special effects, maybe makeup. <br /> <br /> Perhaps all of the above has brought this to something that is barely worth keeping your eyes on. <br /> <br /> I wanted to be scared ... not bored. <br /> <br /> That did not scare me ... it did not even interest me ... I had more fun watching the Microwave instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not bother buying it ... and if you see it on television by an incredible chance, you do not need to calm the sleeping children.
