I love cheese horror movies, I think the undead and the bad taste are good and I think Slumber Party Massacre II (not even related to this movie) is hilarious. But this film is absolutely nauseating, I did not laugh, I did not even enjoy it ... you can see all kinds of mistakes that are not even deceiving. The best shot of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she bangs her head on the edge? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this idea thinking that this is related to the series of massacres of the slumber party. It's awful and I do not even have a clue about distribution. Praise him with a false name and burn him, serve all the others.
