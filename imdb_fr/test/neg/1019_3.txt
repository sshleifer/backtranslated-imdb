This film is really BAD, there is nothing attractive or commentary except beautiful scenery: the Chilean landscape. I know I have to provide four lines as a comment for this movie, but the fact is that it's such a bad movie that I can only say it's actually BAD. Michael Ironside is the only one to have saved money in the film.
