A friend and I went to see this movie when it was released in 1980. It was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people instead. It lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. It was so bad that we laughed until the end. Since then, we have been viewing Kill or Be Killed-based movies as the worst movie of all time. As other commentators have mentioned, it's so bad it's funny. It's not worth taking a look at, that's for sure. I just can not bring myself to give more than a 1 because I do not think that the directors of the film wanted it to be so bad and I can not give credit to an accident. Sorry.
