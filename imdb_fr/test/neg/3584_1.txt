Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! Dull, unimaginative, predictable - and with all the usual suspects. This is exactly the kind of film that the Irish film industry should not do. And with the added benefit of an end covered with molasses. A nauseating example of how talent and originality have been sidelined in favor of near-aggressive mediocrity. Yes, children are nice. Yes, it almost looks like it's done professionally. But it's the making of movies in numbers, a direct hit and a capture of what the director considers a "success" - a film that protects and despises the public. It is quite amazing that Working Title is pouring 3 million pounds into this waste. But then, they paid for the love actually. Do not waste your money.
