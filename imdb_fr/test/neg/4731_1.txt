If you like me to love movies with intrigue and convince the actors then Alien Vs Predator-Requiem is probably not the way to go. In summary, alien land in a typical American city, Predator land in an American city, the two are arguing a bit, the US government explodes the city, some people escape ..... I'm sorry I may have ruined the end. It is easy to criticize someone who is critical. people shout, I bet you could not do better! I bet I could! After making this film, I watched it, then congratulated myself with a pat on the back and a job well done; there had surely been the specter of madness in the room.
