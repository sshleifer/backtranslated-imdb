I can not believe I spent almost three hours of my life watching this. It must be one of the most incredible, predictable, and crazy TV movies I've seen in a long time. I was hoping to have good special effects and action, instead I spent all my time rolling my eyes and shouting "OH COME ON !!!" on the screen. The dialogue is superficial and obvious, the game sometimes constrained and as the story progresses, is not it funny to see how everything happens at the same time ... Not to mention the obvious and nauseating end ... Now, I've seen more than just my share of disaster movies, I'm a big fan and think that often, they can achieve completely unrealistic things as long as it's fun, but it's not is definitely not that. This is just an insult to smart viewers everywhere. What did they think when they made this movie ?????
