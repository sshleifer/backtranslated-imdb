I really wanted to love this film for all kinds of reasons - the subject is inherently interesting and probably the main problem facing the world today. It has sparked fascinating works (for example, from Linda Grant, When I Lived in Modern Times), usually from the Israeli side of the fence. Also, a guy I like told me he thought it was the best movie he saw all year, so with such a recommendation ... <br /> > ALWAYS, I found myself dozing at times! I was tired and the movie seats were comfortable, but I thought it was too hard to try to identify with the characters. Once I told myself it was a series of vignettes, I went there, but it's disappointing, it's like a series of sketches rather than a movie. I liked the idea of ​​a sober, almost silent staging contrasting with these utopian moments - the sexy girl, the red balloon and the Muslim ninja fighter. But personally, I think the film was overexcited. I do not say narrative and the plot is everything (it certainly is not), but even a little more dialogue would have helped.
