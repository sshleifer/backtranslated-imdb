This film is awful, I can not even be bothered to write a review on this trash! All I'm going to say is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And the acting is very bad. The boy who plays the main character really annoys me, he has the same expression on his face throughout the film. I just want to slap him! Basically, 80% of the film is composed of skaters' slow motion boards, strange music and absolute sensations. I will use a few more lines and say that the main character has one of those faces that you just want to slap! <br /> <br /> Meh, I give up ... THIS FILM SUCKS !!!!
