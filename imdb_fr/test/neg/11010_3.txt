I had heard that this Japanese film was annoying, interesting from a creative point of view, a "cool new thang" on the Asian film scene ... maybe even something as innovative as "Ringu" from Hideo Nakata or "Oldboy" of Chan-wook Park, especially the latter. <br /> <br /> You can imagine my disappointment when, instead, I found the film disjointed, both narrative and cinematic (although it was not appreciated by a movie lover) , cliché, even sad in place of funny --- overall, a very bad imitations of the style "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> I stopped watching after 30 minutes, when I gave up on the idea of ​​becoming something more than it is.
