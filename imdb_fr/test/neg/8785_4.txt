Whoa. I mean, whoa. I mean, whoa whoa. <br /> <br /> I saw this film 10 years ago, in 1996. At the time, computer-generated films were rare; and the good ones even more. In addition, at the time, we listened to things called CD players. But I go astray. I loved this movie a long time ago, and until I look at it again, I have fond memories of it. Hey, it's Don Bluth! Anyone who hates "All dogs go to heaven" is clearly a robot. But again, I move away from the subject. <br /> <br /> Then I saw him again. It's really not one of his best, I can say now, eleven years later. I saw a lot more films and I gained a little more knowledge. Now, of course, the dubbing is good, I'll give them that. The story is ... okay. I mean, we see it all the time. A LOT. But it works. The musical numbers are what annoys me. It would have been more comfortable in the eighties, with this kind of musical numbers. In '96, most children's movies had epic numbers, like The Lion King (which came out about a year ago, but it does not matter), or things like that. Here you have shows, vaudeville style. <br /> <br /> The kind of animation hurts too. Sometimes agitated, and sometimes completely changing style and format with the change of shot, it's really hard not to notice. <br /> <br /> I still like "All dogs go to heaven, but it could have been waaay better. <br /> <br /> 4/10
