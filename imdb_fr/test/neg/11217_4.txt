It's the first porn I've ever tried to see again. This requires a different approach from the usual one, since allegory will not reward dissection. "I am American, I am a prude virgin." "We are European, we are cultured and crazy about sex." "It's good when we fuck each other together." Many things to talk about! In fact, it is actually a relative number compared to the average number of shirtless volleyball of the 60s. And the irritating patina of 'class' offers at least clean and detailed compositions. But what is it to say that about a porn? OK then: the only scene I really (rhetorically) played is the first time Brigitte Maier comes in. Efforts are made to integrate a good variety of races and ages while leaving no man close to each other; the only black suffers a premature crisis of coitus editorial. And several taken or not, an indescribable act on IMDb seems to have been partially simulated by a surgical tube. Still, I stayed awake and it was eight o'clock in the morning ... but what does the last shot mean?
