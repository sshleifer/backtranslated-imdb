This film is so imitative, cliché, awkward and laborious that I find it amazing that no one can feel deceived by the experience of sitting. <br /> <br /> Here is a whole range of idiotic clichés, ridiculous psychologizations and simply unachievable stories in this "striking" high school performance: The tough guy is really a homosexual. Student A is unhappy because his father is pushing him and, in one way or another, it makes him commit. A teacher is mean to a student who gets wet in class. A girl who goes out with the boy mentioned above is really in love with him and "just wants a family". <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only thing that saves is student counselor scenes that are vaguely interesting, most of the features in this movie are so sealed that they flout the belief. <br /> <br /> This movie shows me no glimpse of teenagers and I will not be surprised when it bombardes, especially with teenagers. People who like this movie seem to be worried parents for their teenagers, and they bark badly the bad tree if they think this movie will help to "understand" the problems of teenagers. I mean, what is the moral of this movie? "Hey guys, we'll all look at each other and hug each other." GIVE ME A BREAK. Anyone who thinks you can reach a 14 year old with this kind of message needs to think. In the 1980s, we watched Kentucky Fried Movie, Xtro, Porky's, Evil Dead, Terminator, etc. This film will not be deaf. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is in the game with another Australian "indie" movie, "One Perfect Day", which was as bad as a movie turkey. Thank goodness, taxpayers' money was not spent on this money. <br /> <br /> AVOID !!!!
