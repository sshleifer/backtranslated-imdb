And the worst is that it could have been good. But something horribly wrong. First of all, they should not have used Amitabh Bachchan in this film. It is too emblematic to tackle such a delicate and controversial subject, not to mention the role itself. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Ram Gopal Varma should be ashamed to take the classic Lolita story and turn it into a predictable and pathetic path-slut. Her Lolita is called Jia (played by newcomer Jiah Khan) and when we meet her, she is devoid of any idea of ​​stolen innocence or that delicate naivety that would normally be associated with the intricate narrative of the original Lolita which, in the original story, gradually becomes nymphet. Jia, from Varma, is already a bitch who does not lose sight of the price even before the camera meets her. And he does not exercise any chastity in the way he films his main nymphet. From his constant shots from his crotch to his fixations on his vulgar gestures and manners, Mr. Varma makes sure that he has not left anyone in the audience as uncomfortable with his pedophile camera angles. voyeuristic. <br /> <br /> Oh, and let's not talk about the non-existent chemistry between Jia and her so-called friend Ritu (the daughter of Bachchan's character). These girls are supposed to be the best friends but look like worse enemies even before everything goes wrong between them. Nothing they do together is credible until they become enemies. Perhaps Mr. Varma should have worked on this aspect of his scenario rather than trying to destroy any credibility that Amitabh Bachchan could have left as an actor. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the film is perhaps the depiction of the female character of Bachchan. Her role was so defined and ridiculously wooden that it was impossible to feel pity or worry for her. In fact, I wanted to touch the screen to slap her not to react as a normal woman would. Instead, she was content to stay there, looking irritated and helpless, as I imagine a lot of the audience in this movie might feel after watching this wreck-train of a movie. Look at your own risk.
