There are so many problems with this movie that I do not even know where to start. The story is not cohesive at all. I guarantee you that five minutes after the beginning of the film, the average viewer will scratch his head, confused. <br /> <br /> Here's what I remember from the movie before I get bored with unconsciousness: an almost abusive father pursues pre-teenage sisters through a house, but ultimately turns out not so abusive. In the next scene, the girls are around 15 years old. They drive with their parents and hit a deer. The stag had to be explosive because their car explodes, one sister pulls the other from the burning wreck. Then, the girls drift in a boat on a lake and make a huge plan to go to Kentucky (??) and start a new life. In the next scene, girls hitchhike to a military base. And what military base it is. In fact, it looks more like a pig farm turned into a military base with many confused extras playing "soldiers". The base commander's office is particularly impressive, because there are random things like an AK-47 on the wall and a sergeant's hat attached to a plaque (????) so that the public knows that is the office of a soldier. . Then a guy randomly pushing a motorcycle arrives and the base commander orders him to go "downtown" to buy porn magazines and to make sure that the soldiers do not think he is part of the "team". pink". Our character takes a van converted into a military truck "in town" and loads a box of an indescribable "bookstore" with an inflatable doll near the front door. The girls hide in the guy's truck when he stops to refuel, and look through the porn pool to find objects inside like "the anal invader". I guess it's enough of the plot to scare most people. Apart from the plot, the quality of the sound is appalling and the film is teeming with ridiculous attempts at symbolism, like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruits at the scene where the "slutty" sister meets the main character for the first time or the slowness of the cameras Much too much time on some shots to try to transmit a "message". <br /> <br /> If you ever see this for sale or rent or anything else, stay away. It is not worth the money in both cases.
