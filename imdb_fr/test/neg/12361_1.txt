One way or another, I really thought I was going to love this movie because I like images with mountaineering and a big mystery in the plot. I must say that the photography was fantastic and that some scary scenes caught my eye. I thought Nicole Eggert (Diana Pennington), "Thanks, good night," played a very convincing role as a girl who had a tragic loss in her life and who met characters who want her to guide them . on top of the mountain. Marc Singer, "Angel Blade", 02, played a strange guy very unconvincing and played in many scenes with a bad mood that seemed comical. This film was a big disappointment and was not worth watching, unless there is nothing on TV to enjoy !!
