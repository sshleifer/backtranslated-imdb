OK, it's about 30 minutes of gore without any history. There is no spoken dialogue, no subtitles, not even real characters. You see three people in the movie (who are alive) and two are there for very few reasons. The main guy has no emotion and only mutilates corpses for no apparent reason. It's the whole movie. I like to see very bloody movies, especially since in America, true gore is not very common in modern movies. So yes, the gore effects were pretty cool. But it's not really disturbing. Why does everyone think it's so disturbing? There is no character, there are only 3 living people and 3 corpses. Nobody has personality or history. You see three corpses parting and you can not really identify yourself unless you identify yourself with death itself and how that could very well happen (even if the guy loses his job and goes to jail very little time after). The viewer has to care and identify himself, he has to identify with the victim. For example, in a good horror movie, you really should worry about the main character. Here, it's just a guy and a corpse. It's as deep as a puddle made of a single drop of rain. They never give you any reason to worry about anyone in the movie. All this is a guy who hacks some bodies, then he sleeps with a body. Now, with the sex scene, there's a strange thing about it, he makes sure to wear gloves but does not use a condom. So he did not care about catching a weird STD after sleeping with a corpse, but as long as his hands do not get dirty, there's no problem, now it makes sense. I do not really hate the movie, I liked the fact that it was very bloody but when it ends, there's no reason to see it again, no reason to worry about it, and it's not just not a very convincing movie. I say that if you can find it for less than $ 10, you might as well get it, but if it's more than that, it's just not worth it.
