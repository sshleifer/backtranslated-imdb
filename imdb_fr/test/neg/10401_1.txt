Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all time. He may have done more classics than anyone. He may have been a perfectionist. But, man, that was his first attempt! <br /> <br /> Kubrick had good reason to try to make this film disappear from the map: it looks like a film by Ed Wood. It contains a strange narration, low shots, a bad dialogue, a threatening music reminiscent of your sci-fi / horror film from the 50s, and what looks like close to the cast of "Reefer Madness" that goes crazy for no reason. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can see an undeveloped Kubrick. It is a psychological / horror study of the war. The characters have become dehumanized and crazy. There are people who play more than one role. There are constant shots of the faces and facial expressions of different people. And there are some interesting plans in the area. But really, it's a mess. <br /> <br /> Of course, I do not discourage you to watch it. If you get there, you join a small group of myself and a few thousand people around the world who have had access to it.
