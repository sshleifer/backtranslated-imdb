Biopic thirsty for Oscars on the big singer Ray Charles. There is a - exactly one - big scene in * Ray *. This happens during a rollback in Charles' youth, after the boy became completely blind. Running in the sharecropper house he shares with his mother, he stumbles on a chair and spreads himself on the floor. He cries for his mother; she, true to her philosophy that a person must "stand on their own two feet," silently and thoughtfully observes the kitchen, waiting to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources. The boy turns out to be up, using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove, a fire pit nearby, the grass behind a window, cricket across the board. floor. <br /> <br /> The film pauses here; it develops; he breathes - even if it only lasts 40 seconds. The scene is an essential respite from the otherwise noisy Taylor Hackford film. By "loud", I do not refer to music, which is of course excellent. I am referring to the sound effects (big boom, a flashback before) and the inept dialogue ("I'm talking to you like a friend, Ray," etc.). On the visual side, Hackford is just as flashy and useless: sepia color filters on camera lenses during flashbacks; 360 swirling-dervish from the camera crane, etc. etc. All modern facilities. What movie style is displayed in * Ray *! - a style too common in the "important" films of the last decades (Scorsese * 's avatar is very similar to this film in stylistic terms). These gadgets are used to hide the scenario based on snapshots. Some of us will not be fooled. <br /> <br /> Some of us are not ready to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as anything other than a great mimicry. Certainly, Foxx looks strangely like Ray Charles: he walks like Charles, speaks like Charles and even contractions like Charles. The imitation of the singer by Foxx during a concert is technically perfect. I do not reproach Mr. Foxx for his Oscar; he deserved it. Anyway, it was a pretty weak area this year. But one wonders if Foxx really understands Charles. The actor realizes a great moment when he insists on trying the smack that his group companions shoot: he records, if only for a brief moment, a disgust for the injustice of being blind and a life in the darkness. The film seems to dramatize the fight within Charles between the radiant salvation of music and the forgetting of the heroine, with his blindness as a battlefield between these two compulsions. But this bloody movie will simply not take the time: it bounces from triumph to triumph, never really stopping to get a glimpse of the man. You have to stretch to find the dramatic tension; you have to provide the drama FOR the film. In other words, you have to imagine a better movie than this one. <br /> <br /> In his run to a glorious conclusion, * Ray * presents and dodge several great film ideas: his debut the "Chitlin circuit"; his bold musical innovations for the Atlantic label; the problem of heroin addiction; the inevitable artistic compromises associated with resounding success; the importance of man in the struggle for civil rights (evoked in the film for, oh, about 3 minutes of time in front of the screen), and much more. Filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any of these elements. Two and a half hours of watching a man overcome adversity after another can reassure us, but such a film is not necessarily a great work of art. This type of approach certainly does not give a clearer idea of ​​the subject of the film - and should not the idea be the real objective of a film like this? If I had wanted an exhaustive list of Ray Charles's accomplishments, I would have simply searched for it on Google. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars - the 2 extra stars reserved for music.
