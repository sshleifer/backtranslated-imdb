I'm part of the demographic that Zoey 101 is trying to target. So I find that even if it tries to connect with people of my age, the premise is just too ridiculous for an average person. The show revolves around the richest boarding school that exists and the beautiful, incredibly tanned, attractive band of one-sided characters that inhabit it. As is the tradition among the networks of children, the actors are white and skinny children, with of course the symbolic black guy. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Zoey and her group of friends falling on By creating some kind of minor dilemma, such as not wanting to attend a gym class, Zoey devises a ploy to save the day of all his friends. There is usually a B line running around a one-sided guest character, or placing secondary characters in completely unrealistic situations, like having a bee hive in a dorm without anyone noticing. These intrigues often play on stereotypes, for example, any character who gets good grades in mathematics must absolutely miss social skills. The majority of episodes have a continuous and overexploited will - they will not do it - they are dynamic. Chase Zoey. <br /> <br /> The characters, unfortunately, are all incredibly unilateral; there is Zoey, the perfect girl with a solution for literally everything, Chase, the best friend but always endearing, Michael, the symbolic black guy (congratulations to Christopher Massey for the management of really funny one-liners), Lola, the a theater girl (that is, she dies in her hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her dreams of celebrity, even if she never does anything in the theater), Logan, the manic narcissist, Dustin, the scathing little brother, and Quinn, the science geek. The few words I passed on each of these characters sum up each of them completely. <br /> <br /> Zoey 101 sometimes manages to be entertaining, but the serious flaws of the value system it promotes are a major obstacle. Zoey, incarnated as a model and a crusader almost feminist and surface described as flawless, still manages important defects of character. For example, when Lola was introduced for the first time, she was supposed to be a Gothic girl. Zoey tried to use that as an excuse to kick her out of their shared dorm because she was "weird". <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, it's clear that Jamie Lynn Spears won this role because of her name, not because of talent. Although she has improved significantly over time, it is clear that she is not a born actress, which has a significant impact on the quality of the show, because most of the intrigue revolves around her character. The support distribution is surprisingly good, especially considering the material with which they have to work. They offer lots of doubles for comic relief, though the plot has not ventured into the dark yet. <br /> <br /> In the end, Zoey 101 is an imperfect vision of high school life and all passers-by their Too limited years should not expect much.
