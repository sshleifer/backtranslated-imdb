This 1950s screamer is so bad that it's unintentionally funny. Tom Conway describes Dr. Gerard, a scientist who turns natives into a monster using voodoo. His poor wife, portrayed by Mary Ellen Kay, is held captive by her wacko husband who does not have time for her but threatens to kill her if she leaves him. Next is Marla English, an avid murderer who has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle. Her idiot boyfriend, played by Lance Fuller, takes part in the safari. They hire "Touch" Connors, (later renamed Mike Connors, of Mannix's fame) as a guide. English is an appalling actress, but no one else in the cast has performed academically. "Touch" (I'm sorry, I can not even type the name without cracking, I mean, what ...) gave the band's only halfway performance decent and that says a lot. The monster is seen only briefly, and the end is predictable to say the least. I would say that this film falls into the category "it's so bad, it's almost good". It's a rainy night when nothing else is on the tube.
