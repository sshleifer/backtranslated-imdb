*** SLIGHT SPOILERS *** This slice of the Full Moon franchise changes the scenario a bit and implements new elements. First, a new puppet master is established. Second, the puppets turn out well in this sequel. Finally, it also introduces elements of science fiction and fantasy. <br /> <br /> A new tenant of the infamous hotel located at the edge of the bay, his girlfriend, his psychic friend and this psychic boyfriend stumble on Andre Toulon's puppet trunk. They also learn that a demon from another dimension holds Toulon responsible for the theft of the secret of animating the non-living. Then Sutekh (the demon) sends the totems, a group of crazy little creatures that look like earless gremlins. Then it's up to the puppet troupe to deal with the inter-dimensional threat that is trying to kill new friends. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget films, this film is plagued by continuity issues. How were the puppets put back in the trunk? How is it that nobody remembers the last series of murders committed at the hotel? Who bought the hotel? Why an entrepreneur by a building with a history of mass murders? We will never answer all this and many other questions. Never. <br /> <br /> The real surprise of this film is the acting game. It's actually pretty good. The actors take it with unusual enthusiasm, especially for a group of nonames of Full Moon. Teresa Hill was particularly impressive as a shy, nervous and psychic Lauren. Chandra West (Susie) was also a pleasant surprise. Gordon Hill was a tolerable protagonist. But Cameron was far too boring to bear. Thanks to the Nordic god, he dies before halfway. <br /> <br /> The puppets are animated there. With some improvements too. Their emotions (especially those of Jester) are much more human because of the sounds they have been given. Blade whistles, Pinhead grunts and Six-Shooter sneer have all been improved and sound much better. Frame-by-frame animation is only average, at best, especially totems. They just do not seem to move as easily as the previous installment of the series. So Sutekh's costume is absolutely nil. How are we supposed to be afraid of such a humorous creature? <br /> <br /> The story seems a little juvinile for the series. I think Charlie Band was trying to focus on a younger population. The attenuated violence in this film also seems to speak the same thing. Gore fans will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the above is the main problem of this movie, which can not really hold up with a lot of people. There is no violence for gorewhores. The language is a little cleaner. Still, it's too violent and hard for the little ones. This is why the film gets low ratings. I must say that the common criticisms are generally correct.
