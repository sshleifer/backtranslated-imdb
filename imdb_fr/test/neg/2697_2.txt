A former police officer who was beaten for imprudent force (and who could probably beat Chuck Norris in a fight) is engaged as a private bodyguard; his first client is a worthless type of playboy. He needs half the film to get fired in the first place. Many combat choreographies, but the plot is strictly based on numbers, and the acting is as woody as the dialogue. Give this one a miss.
