Do you know they want to escape the moon for real? And in Geneva, there is the project discussed that could lead to the possibility of making the machine travel over time? All I can say about this film that is based on facts about the future film) but real scientific projects. I hope the moon will not exist as in the movie. As for the film itself, I also saw the original film and I also read the book. The book did not please me however, but the film yes.I totally agree with a previous comment that this movie was depressing, unlike the 60s. It was very good with force, this one was only a parallel film future.
