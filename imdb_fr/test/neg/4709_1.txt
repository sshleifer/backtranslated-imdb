There should be some kind of lawsuit to punish producers for funding such stupid scenarios. I have the feeling that some sort of criminalization of the bad film could prevent other such idiotic films from being made. Of course, his cast of characters is interesting, but I do not think I've ever seen a more hard-hitting performance of an entire cast like in this piece of unique shit. This director should be punished for not having at least provoked some sort of performance from these people. Detachment is therefore a theme (no, they will beat you with it), it does not mean that all characters have to recite their lines as if they were on NPR. Did I mention that this movie was nil? Finally, I am not sure of the link that would bind our memories with end-stage bone cancer, but I am reasonably certain that if you were totally brain dead, your cancer would continue to grow anyway. This film is an insult to cancer patients, health professionals and non-backlogged people. Oh, and finally, bumblebees fly because they produce enough elevation for their mass by flapping their wings like any other flying insect. I absolutely despise people who present false knowledge as a fact. Next time, do some research before using a foolish misconception as a premise for a panicked movie. CHILD PLAY BELIEVE IN JESUS!
