It opens - and lasts half an hour - as an educational program on the Old Testament, but not without humor. The film finally begins to grow wings when the biblical cant is abandoned. In a scene of mixed success, Martin Donovan (Jesus) decides not to kick off the Apocalypse and the last quarter of an hour is a kind of humanist "why is everyone talking? " playout, gilded with optimistic conjectures against a long shot (retrospectively, dismally ironic) of the twin towers of the WTC. <br /> <br /> Apart from Donovan's authority, the acting is divided. There is the Thespian melodrama of the rest of the cast: though formally designed for a biblical presentation, it is appropriate for Hartley's modern, paranoid comedy. But I was also pleasantly surprised by the contribution of PJ Harvey (thus credited, and at the risk of existing in the film only as a pop-star entity that she is, no less than in a set stage scene in a record shop and a dangerously uneven soundtrack). which contributes). It has remained cool - a kind of misleading lack of concentration - in the manner of many pop icons that have started filming (I'm thinking of the Jagger of Performance here), but nevertheless maintained a compelling integration with the cast and the project . <Br /> <br /> Finally affirmative, but this bittersweet essay is a bit too much like this and relies more on perseverance than on the imagination of its audience. 4/10
