I could not bear to watch a lot of that shit. It's your usual junk that some boring women love the drama of the English era with lots of costumes and cliché characters that seem to come directly from Oliver Twist or another Dickens novel. This uses the usual clichés of the Victorian era. Some fools really think that all the emotional torture of this repressed culture is fascinating and romantic. It is pure sap and complete and boring when we see the grass grow. As such, it's perfect for women who yearn for some kind of romantic drama in the English countryside in a Victorian setting, but for this man, this movie is nothing but torture and cruel and unusual punishment for looking at a bunch black and boring scenes with miserable characters and false English accent.
