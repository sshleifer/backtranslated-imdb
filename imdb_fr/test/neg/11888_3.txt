Computer expert John Light (as John Elias) moves from dropping out of school in Stanford to the young Dotcom mogul. But Mr. Light's sneering success could be short-lived, with partners like the ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (like Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan used to sleep with Light's girlfriend, Megan Dodds (as Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that occasional heavy drinking and casual sex do not have to end at the university. After reading a naughty sex session on the internet, Mrs. Dodds turns on the light. He also risks losing his Internet empire "Digital Dreams"! Veterans who try unsuccessfully for dramatic drama include Mia Farrow (Anna Simmons), sucker of red lollipops, and Hal Holbrook (as Tom Walker), a draftsman. Mrs. Farrow looks sweet with her lollipops. <br /> <br /> *** Goal (2/21/02) Alan Lazar ~ John Light, Jeffrey Donovan and Mia Farrow
