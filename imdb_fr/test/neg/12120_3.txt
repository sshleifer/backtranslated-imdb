Most of the positive comments posted here are as prolix as the movie! It takes a long time to enjoy a talkative and boring film, it is assumed. Some have simply described the film as "contemplative", that is to say, slow and devoid of intrigue. However, a Dutch critic has put his finger on the finger: it is an important event transformed into a dull film whose tone is given in the very first scene. Here, a real estate agent shows a young couple the apartment of an apartment that, as one might expect, speaks without stopping and without worrying about what is happening. The same goes for all the other characters! <br /> <br /> The only silences on this image are dream sequences - Soviet propaganda excerpts from the 1930s - and these are also its most interesting parts. It tells you something about the quality of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The device for filming most of the very close-up scenes - as if you were looking through a slot in the blinds - is getting old fast.
