Lucille Ball is trying to look 30 years younger than she actually was in that lame excuse for a musical. <br /> <br /> The film presents some of the worst choreography ever, with the constant threat that Lucy might break into a song. his bourbon voice at any moment. Lucy's total lack of talent as a singer and dancer plunges the film before it can begin and, apart from the unconditional fans of Lucy, no one will really want it. Bad costumes and cheesy decorations do not help. One more proof that Lucy was not good at anything except stupid grimaces. <br /> <br /> Directed by Gene Saks.
