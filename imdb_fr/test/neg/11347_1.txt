The first season of Bones takes place in Finland and I can not believe how much bullshit this show puts on - the characters are superficial, misdirected and clumsy. <br /> <br /> It's an ITUC of the poor. Or in reality, CSI without a consistent plot. Although Bones has potential, it fails because of the lack of director who has not been able to extract the essence of the actors. It's actually sad to see an all-out show when it could be a downhill show with just a pinch more. From the beginning, you realize how difficult the game of actors is. <br /> <br /> Long story - do not waste your time in Bones.
