I am an atheist and do not like many aspects of Christian fundamentalism. <br /> <br /> That said, this film is reprehensible, vile and transparent. This only works at the level of the hate motive currently in fashion (and tired) of white American Christian fundamentalism. If this film had been shot about a fundamentalist Jewish or Muslim family, or even a black Christian family, the indignation would have been palpable and the film would have been swept away in all circles. In the current state of things, it is "correct" and "astute" because the white Christian fundamentalists remain one of the last "acceptable" targets for waste like this one. <br /> <br /> And that's really the case with waste. If you want to see a quality movie with similar behavior, search and watch or comment on "Badlands". Nothing good was done in "The King", whereas it had not been done better several decades ago in this masterful film. <br /> <br /> As other critics note, the characters are almost completely underdeveloped in "The King", the lines are a nap, cinematography is dull. We have seen the sociopath's story better done 100 times. This film does not cut it for thoughtful viewers.
