This film enters my file "Worst Films Ever Made". I have a copy of this movie that I watch when I want to laugh, and it's not even a comedy. I am disappointed that such great actors have agreed to be in such a bin. This film is inaccurate (in its depiction of hockey), offensive (for Canadians), and I was not even impressed by the acting. Even the story was a bit weak. If you have never seen this movie, you are in luck. If you have, I'm sorry.
