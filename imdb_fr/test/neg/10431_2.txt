Plodding, maybe that should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered at no turtle. All characters have one dimension except one. Unfortunately, this character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to be part of this two hour drama. Having grown up in the seventies, this film is sorely lacking in details, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, someone who should recognize a sharp dialogue and coherent narration in a script. Cameron Richardson is about the only element that illuminates this film. Robin Trower's music is also a welcome addition.
