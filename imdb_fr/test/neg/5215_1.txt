my friends and I are always looking for Chuck Norris movies to make fun of us. So far, one of our favorites is Lonewolf. I went to a Wal-Mart Christmas store and came across this movie in the 5.99 recycle bin. I had to get it. I had high hopes for this film and although we are sometimes absolutely hilarious, we agreed that the bells of innocence are the worst film we have ever seen, realized, produced, thought, etc ... that devil think it's a good idea. not only is this sometimes confusing, but the acting is hard to watch. The man who plays oren has a role that I can compare to my own vomit, and Chuck plunged into this adventure, he is not the greatest actor, but it was terrible. and what kind of names are oren, conrad and jux ........ jux. go. if you honestly thought this movie was viewable, great for you because it was difficult for me and I had serious head and belly pain after watching it. I tell you now if you have not seen this movie, DO NOT do it. For God's sake, do not submit to 90 minutes of your life.
