Two-thirds of this film are recycled footage from previous films, a fact that is sadly obvious even to someone like me who has not seen the original movies. And in a way, it's a real scam even if I've never seen anything like it. It's like this episode of every TV show where characters sit around a photo album or something like that and you just see recycled images of other episodes. I have seen some producers make long runs of recycled footage, but never more than 5 minutes or so. This film is mainly composed of stuff that has already been seen by the public. So you can mount a case that is one of the biggest scams ever inflicted to the public cinematographic images. <br /> <br /> I have to see it in the theater, in 16mm format, which is pretty good I guess given the rarity of this kind of material on film currently. I give the film a certain merit for its unconvincing gothic atmosphere and unintentional humor, but that's about it. The Aztec mummy monster looks good even with some mobility in the face that is better than most movie monsters of this period. But the robot is pitiful, although it is interesting that they made the human face fully visible. It's a "human robot" or something like that, as they explain a little in the movie. I think it's considered an android. So technically, in terms of science fiction, this film should be called "Android against the Aztec mummy", but I doubt that anyone is too worried about the technical details here for quality. In fact, the film is so badly assembled that the television looks good. Even the dubbing of the Mexican to English is lazy and weak - for example, the hero says, "I might as well start at the beginning ...", what is this kind of translation? Could they not at least say to him "start at the beginning" so that it does not seem repetitive? An editor of a high school newspaper could have corrected the script of this film. This is the quintessence of commercial film making, there is absolutely nothing in this film that does not have to be there for the basic business purpose of the film. They do not make more effort than necessary, and considering the amount of recycled film, I doubt they spent more than a week in the making of this film. <br /> <br /> I will now stop posting my comments on this. the principle that I do not want to spend more energy on the comment process than the creators of the film spent on doing it.
