Science fiction inexpensive and extremely inexpensive without any charm or attraction. Even scenes related to falling asteroids are stolen in other movies with the same plot. It's just a bad scam of "Asteroid" (with Annabela Sciora) and "Deep Impact" (with Morgan Freeman). Mr. Hopper seems to be anxious to get away from this useless and uninteresting science fiction entry. <br /> <br /> I give him a 2 (two). And do not say I'm not a good guy!
