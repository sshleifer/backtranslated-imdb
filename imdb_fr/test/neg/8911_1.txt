Stephen Seagal plays the role of a guy who is convinced to drive an armored car for a bank and get into everything that comes his way. However, the police seem to arrive very quickly on the scene and Seagal feels the rat who has warned the police. The story has many twists and turns and the money from the reserve has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner. Poor Seagal is a little trapped by this obstacle and is naturally looking for the person or persons trying to shelter him for a long time. In this film, Seagal tries to be a good guy but the forces of evil are against him. Unfortunately, it's not a big film and rather boring and too long.
