I was really ready to watch when two of the best movie critics called this movie a "riot of laughter". But the film proved disappointing. <br /> <br /> You will be advised to watch this movie keeping the spirit at home, but you simply can not ignore flaws and flaws. <br /> <br /> 1. The missile scene was total stupidity. <br /> <br /> 2. Katrina Kaif and Govinda look horrible. (He is 49 years old and only 24 years old ... more than double his age) 3. Salman's comedy is less active than comic. <br /> <br /> 4. The songs are good but interrupts the rhythm of the film. <br /> <br /> 5. Some scenes have been deliberately tempted by filmmakers to be funny and 6. A mediocre and imperfect story. <br /> <br /> However, there are few more things 1. Govinda. Great individual performance. <br /> <br /> 2. Some scenes are quite fun. <br /> <br /> 3. Kattrina Kaif. Looks and Acting continues to improve with every film. <br /> <br /> 4. The sequences of Don of Rajpal Yadav. Although underused but hilarious. <br /> <br /> So, 4 good points, 6 bad points .. this one gets 4/10.
