Sensational. As soon as I saw the cover of this movie, I immediately wanted to watch it because it looked so bad. Sometimes I watch Bollywood movies simply because they are so bad that it will be entertaining (eg, Koi Mil Gaya). This film had all the elements of an atrocious film: a "gang of local thugs" completely harmless, a badly made motorcycle scene, a horrible dialouge ("Bravo son, I am very proud to be a bad boy"), actors playing basketball as if they were good, atrocious songs ("me bad, bad, bad bad boy"), unexplained intrigues like "why are the friends of Good Boy and Bad Boy are they ???" And why is the hot girl in love with the nerd? I have never seen a story so poorly constructed with such direct horror. Some scenes actually lasted 30 seconds, like the one where good and bad boys ran inexplicably on the "gang member's" poker game. Congratulations Ashwini Chaudry, you are a bad director. If you want to watch a good movie, look at Guru, if you want to watch a movie so bad that it's really entertaining, then watch Good Boy, Boy.
