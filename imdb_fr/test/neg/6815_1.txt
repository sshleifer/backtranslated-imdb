Like another reviewer, I really wanted to love this movie. I went there with my father, who was the greatest amateur and the greatest lover of classical music, but none of us could stand this movie. I would not even call it a movie. A better description could be a recording of some chamber concert pieces. If I remember correctly, the camera never even moved. Instead, I sat on a tripod for the entirety of each piece. The only attempts at dramatic effect were at the very end of each piece when the film was cut into trees waving in the wind or wavelet on a beach. I'm sure the director would have preferred to use images of very large breaking waves, but the best things he could find were a few inches tall near a nearby lake and the use of a fixed camera. Really pathetic. I can not imagine how anyone could justify this film being more than five. When we went out, my father and I were completely perplexed about the possibility of making such a bad movie. I do not know any good movie about Bach. The world really needs it, but the fact that it does not exist is not a reason to see it. Someone will make one day. Until then, continue watching _Amadeus_.
