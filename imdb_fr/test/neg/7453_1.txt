You know, I was very surprised watching this movie. It was broadcast during the day once when I was sick and, having nothing else to do, I kept looking. This is by far the worst movie ever! But to my surprise, I kept looking. I was sitting there saying, it's terrible, but I have not changed channels yet because I was so amused how bad it was. Maybe it was the guy who looked like Big Tom's survivor or the terrible mustaches and mohawks that these characters had, who kept me watching. However, the girls were not half bad, but if that's what you want, there is much better. Oh, and there is "NINJAS" and "PAJAMA BOYS!" <br /> <br /> So if you like ninjas, bad things, hilarious (and terrible) dialogues and two five-foot-tall twins that kill everything in their sight, then this movie is for you . It's a shame. However, I just had to give it a 1 in 10. I could not put a top 10 with Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> ENJOY !!!!!!!!! :)
