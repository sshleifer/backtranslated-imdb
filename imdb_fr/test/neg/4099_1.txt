This image is a bad copy of Michael Pohl's EXTINCT short film, dating from 1995. Although Michael Pohl's idea is original and perfect for a short film, the plot of SOUND OF THUNDER was poorly adapted to the story. of Pohl and was not suitable for a feature film that could be expected from a large Hollywod studio. The tragic floods that ruined Prague's scenery were just one of the bad links in a long chain of rusty film production. For a studio to release such a product ... it's a shame. Especially for Warner Brothers, a studio that created new effects with series like BABYLON 5 in 1993. On TELEVISION. The visual effects for the pioneering CGI television shows in episodic television in the mid-1990s were much more sophisticated than what is presented on screen in this image. In cases like this, as sad as it may be: can the movie.
