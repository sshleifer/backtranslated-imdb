This is by far the most tasteless, silly, unbelievably stupid show that has ever been broadcast, and it comes from someone who remembers "San Pedro Beach Bums". <br /> <br /> My wife loves to watch reality shows - and there was an episode of this drivel where the aspirants had to develop a "walk". The final result comes from Monty Python's sketch "Ministry of Silly Walks". I could not laugh loud enough. <br /> <br /> And then there is the ubiquitous Mrs. Banks (as if to laugh all the way ...). She must be the most annoying woman on television since Rosie O'Donnell left "The View". As if the model was doing great things for humanity. Please. I have never found her attractive and I do not find her smart now that she has the temerity to open her mouth. <br /> <br /> Someone needs to tell these human hangers to eat well and really look like real women.
