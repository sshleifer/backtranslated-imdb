THE VANISHING's George Sluizer (he created the haunting European original and the Hollywood remake) made CRIMETIME. He should not really be blamed for this confused and poor movie, because all the problems are in Brendan Somers' script. It's badly focused and lazily written. For example, the killer hangs out in a nightclub waiting to find a victim, some victim, and starts talking to a teenager. Cut to the next scene where she says to the villain "I told you everything about me, tell me your life?" Unfortunately, the girl has told her life to the villain off-screen and is a terrible example of the writer's non-power to give life to a character through dialogue. I know how difficult it is, but for a script produced, the writer should have tried harder <br /> <br /> It is difficult to explain the message of the film. At times, you feel like you want to be a British NATURAL BORN KILLERS, satanizing media voyeurism with crime (maybe it even influenced the MANHUNT video game), but the script is not spiritual enough to do it. When you have a sex scene that does not progress in the plot or characters or a hint of subtext, you know that your script is badly written and that CRIMETIME is a badly written script
