I survived the first hour and I came back for the last ten minutes, just to say that I saw the end. If you want a * true * mythology, perfectly executed, look for "The Odyssey" Armand Assante. It is not necessary to refine a good story - the stories are fantastic in themselves. I only hope that Sean Astin needed this money. And Sophocles and Ovid must turn in their graves - wherever they are. <br /> <br /> At least with the version of Sorbo, the tongue pricked relentlessly in the cheeks - we knew it was mostly balderdash, but maybe the interest was enough generated in the to send someone to the library. I am surprised that Halmi can produce something so amusing (the television series) and follow it with something so devoid of quality.
