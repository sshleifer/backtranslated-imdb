Do you remember those terrible war movies that your grandmother forced you to watch about 25 years ago on your old VHS recorder? "The Fallen" is just a poorly executed remake of these movies! The story is terrible, the direction is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible and all together make an unbearable nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's terribly slow! Very slow! I tried to sleep watching the video but I could not do it because I had nightmares. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, please! It's this bad! Ten lines is a lot, so I do not know what else to say. <br /> <br /> Press the eject button NOW and you will not regret it!
