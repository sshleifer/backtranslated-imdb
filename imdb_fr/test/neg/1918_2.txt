Life is too short to waste two hours of Hollywood nonsense like this, unless you're a naive, ignorant, na√Øve girl with no sense of reality and nothing better to do. Dull characters, mediocre actors (artificial emotion), weak history, slowness, and most importantly for this movie have a failing existence - no one cares about the too dramatic relationship.
