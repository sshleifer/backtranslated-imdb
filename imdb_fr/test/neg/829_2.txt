When I went to see this film, let's not say that I had high expectations. But simply that I had a faint hope that this feature would have at least some of the hilarity and wit of the movie "Da Ali G Show" on television. <br /> <br /> But as one might expect, this can not translate to a half-hour TV show or a 90-minute movie. The film had no appeal, and used entirely the toilet and the juvenile sexual humor. Basically, I should have abandoned it midway, but I was silly enough to think that it could improve in the end, how wrong I was. I liked the show but hated the movie. This movie is for those who find fun doggy blowjob ...
