Sometimes I think somewhere in the "Lifetime" office complex there is a room where the writer has a big wheel hanging on the wall, much like the Big Six casinos. They have many places where you even earn money, and less for higher amounts, until there may be a couple who pay more. <br /> <br /> But I imagine that the wheel of the chain has about six different kinds on its wheel, with two of them appearing most often, titled "The Psychotic Neighbor" or "The Wife" with a hidden past or a secret or both. " The movies "for life" have some repetitive stories, and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous. <br /> <br /> The "Spouse ..." category may have a long-standing spouse, but a person appears, or an event occurs, revealing that the good wife was formerly a prostitute, that one of the husband was involved in a harmful act a long time ago, or that something else in one of the backgrounds is different from what is presumed - etc., etc., or, as in this movie, one of them entered the marriage with the most harmful purpose. <br /> <br /> A constant, in all their genres, is that the husband or other men are generally naive, vacant, and slow to have any idea of ​​what is going on in hell to the point culminating or, at best, very late in the procedure (unless the man is the scoundrel). That is not the case here. <br /> <br /> That the miscreant cited in reference is the "neighbor" or, as in this offering, "the woman", it is always fascinating to see how easily, successfully and without effort, they pursue their despicable acts. They manipulate many others, miss them as needed, take different poses and juggle with more disappointments than you can count on - with unfailing success until the end. <br /> <br /> The main actor, like many others The movies in this channel, is an old man. I noticed that another movie he was playing in was titled "The Perfect Neighbor". <br /> <br /> Finally, the "perfect woman" avenger of this film sends those who are on its way with more expertise and more ease than the more experienced. and "expert" of Don Corleone's family could come together. And I could not help but imagine that Jack Nocholson's character, Melvin Udall, from "As Good As It Gets", with his tremendous OCD sorrow, could provide some advice to the anti-heroine for help him deal with the obsession that was at the base of this opus.
