I just can not imagine why Madsen and Hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script. Maybe they made you sing? Or are they so badly in money? The main problem of the film is that it is boring. Conversations between Madsen and Hopper characters are useless, as are bored discussions between two friends while drinking beer on a Saturday night. You never feel for any of the characters (although Madsen's psychotic killer is very likeable, compared to other characters). Hopper has always been a good actor and Madsen does a great job as a serial killer, otherwise the acting is almost laughable. There are about three scenes in the entire movie where something is really happening, each one lasting about three minutes. Although the scenes "talking and thinking about the murder and the nature of the murderers" would have been interesting, if they were in a book. The whole concept would have been interesting for a novel, but a movie just can not understand a story with so much inner reflection and so little action.
