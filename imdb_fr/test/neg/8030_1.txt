This is the film that I almost left and that would have been the case if my friends were not at the cinema with me. Normally, even if I do not like a movie, I think it's worth looking at it all the way. In this way, you can really claim to have given the chances of the latter to redeem himself. But with the Million Dollar Hotel, it was so horrible that I only wanted to finish my experience as quickly as possible. I think I probably would not have been so disappointed if this film was directed by a lesser director, a film I did not like so much. But coming from Wenders, it was all the more shocking to see. I know that Bono de U2, a good friend of Wenders, wrote the screenplay for this awful film, and I wonder why Wenders let him do it, as a boyfriend-boyfriend as the two may have been. "Get to work, Bono" is a phrase that comes easily to mind when you look at this mess. Pretentious, disjointed, a mix of all the stereotypes of contemporary movies possible, a naive and transparent attempt to appear as whimsical and daring, with the most irritating characters I've ever seen, especially Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson , none of those I do not normally like. The happiest outcome I could have wished for was that a nuclear bomb had fallen on their heads so that everything would be finished as quickly as possible. On a positive note, the first five minutes of the film are extremely good, with an extremely moving U2 soundtrack. But the first shots of the film make the rest of the film even more disappointing (which is a spectacular plunge from then on) as it is a film-quality promise that is never delivered , not even close.
