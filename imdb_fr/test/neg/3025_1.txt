Good lord. <br /> <br /> I will immediately say that I only watched 20 minutes of this film. As a hardcore fan of Eraserhead, the "what, you can not watch a bizarre black-and-white movie with little dialogue?" the defense does not apply. I just can not watch TERRIBLE strange black and white movies with little or no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film is what happens when you give an edgy goth kid without talent and without saying a camera. and the budget, and let him / her put as many offensive pictures as possible on the screen. It was clear from the start that this film should have lasted 5 minutes (assuming it should exist at all). The plans that should last a few seconds drag on for a few minutes, because the director has the syndrome "I-Just-Love-The-Sound-Of-My-Own-Voice", and refuses to move to another plane until that the complete sequence was seen. From the moment the masked girl started to masturbate the corpse of "God" (the opening scene of the movie! Joy!), I realized that it was only a matter of time before I close the cassette. After at least 10 minutes of another corpse pulled by a band of mysterious men concealed on a rope, I knew it was time to give up. I rarely give up a movie. I sat through the entire Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows, but not with joy. It did not deserve the 20 minutes I gave you. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Eraserhead, DO NOT let simple comparisons with this movie convince you to rent this amateur trash. Let me refer you to Tetsuo: The Iron Man, for an observable and enjoyable piece of strange incoherent black and white.
