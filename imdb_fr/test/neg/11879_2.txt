What can I say about this? So much prestige production - but ultimately? Time wasted, money wasted. <br /> <br /> This work, a disaster, is historically observed. Some examples only: <br /> <br /> * Auguste is often called 'Gaius' - his first name (Pronomen). But the old Romans do not use this name. The surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or the "Octave", "Caesar", "Augustus" would be correct. <br /> <br /> * Livia has been shown as a tyrannical wife. But this is historically wrong. <br /> <br /> * Iulia was shown as a pretty young woman - but she was not one. Adultery and (perhaps?) Prostitution and arrogant behavior have been the cause of his banishment. <br /> <br /> * She was not in bed with her dying father. She was never allowed to let her ban. And she was then about 50 years old! Not as young as she was shown. In the same year, Augustus died and committed suicide because Tiberius stopped paying him a pension. <br /> <br /> * Augustus was far more scrupulous than in this movie. But the author and the director seem to believe in Auguste's "Res Gestae". <br /> <br /> What's left? Historically extremely questionable, bad behavior, bad builds and bad equipment - 2 out of 10 points - one for Peter O'Toole.
