In fact, I'm too tired to write this review - bad movies always do - but I feel obligated, as if it were my civic duty, to warn anyone who might consider buying or watching. Horrible mess - An image. Please, please, just take my word: it's the one you'll want to stay away from. It's so boring and dull, so insipid and uninspired, such a bad excuse for bringing together a known talent. Burt Reynolds? Spoiled (despite all his efforts). Ice-T is hardly in the film and when it appears on the screen, his performance is so restrained and muffled that it becomes extremely clear that the director, perhaps intimidated by the intense gaze of Ice, did not know what to do with him. Rob Lowe, as the main character, has never displayed so little charisma on the screen. Mario Van Peebles should be ashamed of himself; his performance is, in the saddest sense possible, a joke. Satan himself signed Mario's check for this film. The plot is as weak, half-baked and annoying as all the music involved (the club's completely boring song seems to continue, literally, for the first third of the movie). The look of the film will make you seriously wonder if the director of photography was also forced, like one of the female characters in the film, to smoke crack in a pipe stuck to his mouth. And if you're looking for, at least, stylized, shoot-up-up violence, you'll get none here. This film, I assure you, I promise you, has absolutely no quality that redeems! Please, I beg you, avoid this movie! Do not put it in and let yourself be convinced that its pace will accelerate, that it will get better and that it will evolve towards a decent outcome. It's not right. It's not. It can not! That sucks! Now you have been warned and I can now go to bed (it is 3am - forgive all the errors that this warning might contain), knowing that my conscience is clear because I have fulfilled my civic duty towards my neighbor!
