The legendary pop star, Steve Alaimo ("Do not let the sun surprise you by crying") is a stock-car racer whose career is disappointing and whose career has gone wrong (ah ah) because he's blocking constantly his car (or lamenting). m tired of being crushed by every fat monkey who drives himself. ") He falls into a crowd of Nazi bikers, humbly humble, Nazi, improbably named Jeeter, Banjo, Fats and, uh, Linda. the most friendly of the group, he took a surfboard behind the skull and communicates only through grunts, a kind of leather Harley Davidson. <br /> <br /> Whatever it is either, Steve gets fooled by the cops who want to catch the vile crooks in the middle of one of their bank robberies.The gang only steals the banks for "kicking, man." I guess they give the charity money, Steve is constantly failing, bikers are getting fatter, and all this has never been so daring because it's so boring.It looks like this movie was filmed through a paper towel soaked in grease, not since "Necromantic" has a film that has so much trampled my me. <br /> <br /> The guy who played at Fats went on to make "Deranged", Ed Gein's biopic with Robert Blossom. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in summary: Wild Rebels: Hilarious on MST3K, terrible everywhere else.
