The fundamental issues at stake (God and Satan / Good and Evil) can and must be extremely compelling (as shown by thousands of works of art / music / literature / films). The end of days, unfortunately, is only a cartoon in two dimensions. Byrne's acting abilities contrast so clearly with Arnold's lack of corresponding abilities and are underscored by a conspiracy that contains only stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The only fascinating scene occurs at the very beginning with the character of Gabriel Byrne and his subsequent interaction with his wife? girlfriend? It is both erotically charged and repulsive - modernizing vampire themes, the seductive power of evil.
