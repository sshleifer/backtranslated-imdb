Copy Cats copied this film in a 1974 Hindi film called "Call Girl"! "Call Girl" had an identical story. The way the protagonists fall in love, then rebel and culminate in the same way in these two films! "Call Girl" is better than water, at least from the point of view of history. It was not as slow as the water! Water on the contrary does not progress at all. Maybe the goal is to make the public sympathize with Kalyani forever! Are Indian filmmakers better than the simple copier nowadays? Well, they call it "being inspired". In their language, it is: "to be inspired (without any quote!)"! :)
