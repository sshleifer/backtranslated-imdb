An insult to poker and cinema, this film manages to make the most dynamic, the most brilliant and the most fascinating figure in the history of poker, a total boredom. Another funny movie to make jokes, shots of lame gangster movies of the first half incomprehensible absurdities of this second hour. Hilariously, Stu Ungar wins his three World Series titles without playing a single hand on the screen. His infamous dealer abuse? 1 scene. His habit of coke? 1 scene. His incredible memory? 0 scenes. They could not even have real poker players. What did they cover? Many shots diving from inside a suburban home. Oh, and a montage of Stu who wakes up every day and buys meat that makes no sense. Why do I care so much about this little Sopranos summer camp trying to take advantage of the craze for poker? Because I think there's still a good movie to do on Stu Ungar waiting for someone ready to do it right.
