Needful Things was one of my favorite Stephen King books. But this film is one of the worst books on film adaptations I have ever seen. They have changed so much. It made me sick. Even the concept of the book being a disappointment, things not always what they seem to remember throughout the book have not been shown in the film. Althogh, it was as nice as many of Stephen King's movies, but like many of Stephen King's movies, this one did not follow the book and became a piece of Hollywood trailer. 2/10
