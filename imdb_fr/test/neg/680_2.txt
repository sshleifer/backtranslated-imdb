The director seems to be a good and solid man. His parents have the same problems as us. They have moved away from each other. They loved each other. They misunderstood each other. And the poor public has to spend 90 minutes in front of what is probably the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families on Long Island. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers few interesting choices - music is banal, filming is uninspired, and the story is the same story that took place in every street in Birch, in all the cities of America. I do not want to sound too hard - rarely has a softer, more well-meaning documentary been made. The director is the kind of man you would like to be friends with. You just want him to have had so much trouble presenting the material his parents did for their marriage to be alive.
