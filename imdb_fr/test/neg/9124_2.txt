Like many people, I loved the original. "American Graffiti" was one of the great movies of the 70's. The sequel, "More American Graffiti," is a horrible and depressing film. It was not funny, the wide-eyed and sympathetic characters had become cynical and jaded, and the stories were artificial (as the character of "Laurie" having another brother because Richard Dreyfuss had not done so and " Terry the toad "and" Pharaoh Joe "managed to serve together in Vietnam). They even have a police officer called "Falfa" (the character of Harrison Ford in the original) who makes a "cameo". He does not even look like Harrison Ford, who was too big a star in 1979 to worry about this waste. <br /> <br /> The key word here is "funny". This movie is not even fun. Debbie (Candy Clark) is a stripper mixed with a gang of dope who talks to the hippies and tries to get her boyfriend out of the prison concession; Steve and Laurie (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams), the lovebirds of the original, have two children and have become a boring and bickering couple; Adorable little boy missed Carol (MacKenzie Phillips) became "Rainbow", yet another hippie child. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is a losing race car driver whose fortune was announced at the end of the original. Even Wolfman Jack, whose voice was an integral part of the original and gave him such a bit, is heard only sporadically. <br /> <br /> It was perhaps different writers, a different director and the total lack of A coherent story that makes this movie a dismal failure. <br /> <br /> The episodic charm and genuine nostalgia of the original are nowhere to be found in the sequel. It was a film that was not necessary to do, and it was best to remember what a great movie "American Graffiti" was and avoid the movie with the title "Plus".
