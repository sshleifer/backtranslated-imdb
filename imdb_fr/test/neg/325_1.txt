This thing, it should not be called a movie, is almost worse than "Manos", but you have to see it, it's hilarious. If you see it at the video rental store, if you see the 10th anniversary edition, yes, there is a special edition, buy it for less than $ 10, if your friend borrowed it, just see this. The acting is so bad, and the gore is so wrong. After watching this, you will wonder why did they utter this insult of the art of film? This assumes that your face does not resemble that of the Nazis in "Raiders". If you manage to see this, make sure to vote this movie as 1 (horrible) so that it can make the final run, it really deserves a place there. I'm surprised it's not number 1, for the moment.
