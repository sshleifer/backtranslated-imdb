An excellent distribution, but unfortunately, a lot of undeveloped ideas make the film slip. One does not feel fulfilled in the end after waiting for a conclusion, a closure or at least an ironic twist. <br /> <br /> He had that familiar feeling of "Gourmette" without daring to say it, Larry, boring. polar opposite. The music was there, the scenes of "show of nothing" appear, but without any thread or suspense - they fail as a solo project that lacks budget. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: The title of the movie is about cheese but it prefers rice pudding. Is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding? He prefers any junk food, no matter the date of sale. Maybe I want someone to eat "cheese dogs" or ice cream in pirate costume would have at least linked some scenes. <br /> <br /> Marty: It's just not funny and excessive. People are simply not interested in a "show" in a show. A coffee book table on the coffee books was funnier. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big fan of distribution, save time and eat cheese. It's not even necessary to be with someone.
