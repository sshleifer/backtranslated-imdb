Kidman and Law do not have the chemistry to make this badly written and misdirected romance / melodrama work at a level other than grandiosity. Kidman pouts and <br /> <br /> pins with nostalgia for his absent lover, Law. She just met him as he prepared to fight for the South during the American Civil War. They only exchanged 5 sentences and a kiss, but they are totally in love. The main direction of Law seems to be "Look empty and shocked, but sensitive." Rene Zellweger is pretty much the only spark of this monotonous scenario, but she plays it far too wide and too high, as if she were playing the main role in "Annie Get Your Gun". Yee-hah boy, damn it! Something in his character is more like a drawing of Monty Python - that of 'Holy Grail' where peasants spend all their time wallowing in the mud to make mud pies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay away whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic strip hidden in a Victorian novel. <br /> <br /> Every time the action gets bogged down in total boredom, which is often the case, all the screenwriters shout `` Cue the villain like Simon Legree! 'and Teague (Ray Winstone) gallops out of nowhere to do his ignoble ignoble acts, like killing and torturing God-fearing townspeople, in the name of their loyalty, in the name of the <br /> <br /> confederation to the rapid erosion. All other times, he misses the fight, which is absurd even in this scenario. There is a plethora of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters that Law meets during his journey from Johnny Appleseed from the front lines where he deserted, to the embrace of Kidman in Cold Mountain. In the end, none of these characters matter. The law does not have time for them or their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: the war is gol-durn, and turns a decent Christian people into rabid animals. <br /> <br /> And the scenario is far too predictable, too heavy. Moreover, the pace of the story is terribly slow. You spend the whole movie waiting for the inevitable meeting of Romeo and Juliet, while Kidman wrings his hands and sighs, Law overcoming incredible obstacles and avoiding bullets. And when that finally happens, you do not care anymore. You will watch your watch wondering how much more of this blow you have to bear. <br /> <br /> I give him one in five stars for battle scenes. There is a powerful anti-war message here. The incredible lack of concern for the loss of life suffered by generals on both sides of the conflict is a powerful element. But it's only about 15 minutes to this 150-minute dog.
