Again, like many television shows, there is a certain actress in the limelight, Miranda Cosgrove, who has earned her reputation in previous series / films (including Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider). is now the star of the film). show, sing the soundtrack (which she did not write and she still wins in glory) Wonderful, it creates as much imbalance in popularity as her other co-stars, including Nathan Kress, who is continually pushed into minor roles. In every episode, except iDont Want to Fight, Cosgrove's music would never have met the charts without this show and her singing the main theme (which was not written by her) and other covers such as About You Now and Stay my Baby. do not forget that she also sings her song live. Is that how you create your singer today? <br /> <br /> Back to the show, Cosgrove reveals herself more physically by playing scenes in a bikini, a Hawaiian-style hula bra and bra mentioned many times through. seen in many cases (but not other actresses). The Wedgies are mentioned, the panties were mentioned once. Og do not forget "Oh my God" a sentence came (are there writers / Christian actors?) Admitting that the show is not intended for children, I am surprised at the multitude of mentions of the sub -women's clothing, especially in the first episode, where the phrase "pointed breasts" was mentioned. I do not know if the children would not do so at home / at school later. <br /> <br /> It's not that I'm against the mention or presentation of women's underwear (that the girls will wear), but for a parade Nickelodeon, officials should have realized that children would be exposed to these kinds of things. I doubt that other Nickelodeon shows have such content. <br /> <br /> As mentioned in other reviews, the laughter track is extremely annoying and useless in many ways - for example, when Sam's character is crying, how do the earth make it a moment to to laugh? It prevents people from understanding the joke and is used almost every sentence. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, Cosgrove is the star of the show and gets the greatest notoriety and support from fervent fans, who even scolded a staff member of the hotel when told to lower the noise level (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfUk98U). Jennette McCurdy is the second star in the series, but she faces competition from Cosgrove in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single to that of Cosgrove). As noted, the third co-star, Nathan Kress, is the lowest rated of the lot. He is described as an atypical boy who is intimidated by a girl and other boys, but is somehow a tech wizard. His size in the early episodes make him a cute but unusual actor given his character's crush on Carly / Cosgrove. Beyond that, Kress does not enter the music industry, and as Cosgrove's fame grows with each episode, Kress lags behind. I'll bet he's the least paid of the three actors. <br /> <br /> The content of the show is certainly fictional, but also leaves wondering how it fits into a humorous series at times the laughter track is used) .It also contains several errors of continuity (How can your father and an Air Force colonel on a submarine?) The US Special Forces have their own branches, and the Air Force does not use US submarines - it's for Seals. A unique feature is to allow viewers to submit their own videos to show during or after the episodes, but again, the videos do not respond at all to the theme of comedy. <br /> <br /> Once again, it's a show. which is riddled with men's underwear, skin exposure and overused laughter. It is a series that pushes a teenage actress into the audience so far that her songs and her actions are overly supported by her fans, leaving her behind.
