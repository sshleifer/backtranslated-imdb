Ah, such an original title for a film of very poor quality. The dubbing is hilarious since voices and mouths never seem to match. As a result, I did not know what was happening when I watched this mess unfold. There are flashbacks in flashbacks and no real time takes place until the very end. The Aztec ceremony made me laugh. I rewound it twice and got the best abdominal training ever. The lady singer Aztec is comical and the costumes and dances are fun. A guy has a face full of acid, there's a lot of fighting, you have no idea who's a character (I really do not care), and it's all a black mess. Oh, and the fight has not lasted for a while, so during the movie, do not hesitate to get up, take a nap, take a trip. You will not miss anything exciting.
