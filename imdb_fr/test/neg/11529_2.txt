Well, I left with some friends to see this movie, we went there an hour before the show started to get good places. So, as you can probably imagine, we came out of this movie :). But this excitement quickly turned to horror, this film is a total failure. It's too difficult to be funny, but the script is poorly written and relies on the burden of the actors. <BR /> <br /> The only good actor in the whole film is Stefan C. Schaefer who was great, the plot was weak and even the "funny" scenes felt forced and unnatural, considering that the main actors are some of the best Icelandic comedians it's special ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone because it is too difficult and never really produces.
