I only saw the episode of the minimum wage, but I have no intention of looking at others. How can that be? Morgan begins to complain dramatically about his dire minimum wage situation early in the episode and the complaints never stop. Already. Fortunately for the viewer, his skinny girlfriend is just as annoying as Morgan (if not even more annoying). <br /> <br /> And to top it off, they go to the movies and buy bottles of water for 2.50 euros. and after that, go to the restaurant to eat all the time, they naturally complain about being poor. <br /> <br /> I do not care if other episodes may or may not be better than that. No one should be forced to look at this shit.
