Reba is without a doubt one of the worst series of "comedy" of all time. I wonder how there are people who write good comments on "Reba" ... You look at "Friends", "Married with children", "Fraizer" if you laugh, you can not never laugh at stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer trying to make her way through the comedy and obviously having no chance. The actors / actresses next to Reba are going well, so I feel bad for them to play in a so-called comedy show with the least funny character in the world (Reba). To summarize, I suggest this television show to see how low comedy can be. and appreciate those who can make you laugh
