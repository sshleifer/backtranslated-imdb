Just Desserts was, I must say, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was terrible and even the plot was laughable. I gave him a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because I like to laugh awfully silly movies. My expectations were not high at first, but it turned out to be more complicated than I expected. I thought maybe it was not so bad at first, but as soon as the name of the competition - The Golden Whisk - appeared, I started to change my mind. Everything came down from there. The only thing I liked in this movie, aside from sneering at its absurd intrigue and dialogue, was watching them cook. However, being a film about pastry chefs, there were minimal scenes in which they cooked anything. I would recommend watching the cooking chain instead of this movie. You get more prepared food and you avoid the pathetic one-liners. However, if you like cheesy, sometimes funny love stories, go ahead and watch.
