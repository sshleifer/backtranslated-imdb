Jim Brown plays the lead role and produces a tale in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion. The story goes that the Japanese captured several members of the navy, including divers, who allowed them to recover the gold that MacArthur had thrown into Manila Bay. racism (the film uses Edwin McCain's War in a not so subtle editing). The performances are just sufficient at best. Jim Brown is fine, but he does not show any significance in a performance that just makes him annoyed. The sets are usable but seem rather cheap. The film suffers from many archive sequences including many of the most famous plans of the Japanese attack in Tora! Tora! Torah! The use of such a large budget sequence effectively gives the rest of the movie a positive appearance of anemia; it also reminds you that there are better films that you could watch. For me, the movie seems to have half of a real plot, money recovery, and another plot just to fill the time. None of this is particularly exciting, even with the explosive finale. <br /> <br /> If the choice allowed, I would take a pass.
