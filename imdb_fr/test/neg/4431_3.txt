When I think of Bollywood. I think lite feels good numbers of musical dance, with beautiful outfits for men and women. And catchy tunes. Horror, Thrillers, Mystery and Suspense, it does not come to my mind. And that, in my Western eyes, is like an abstract comedy. <br /> <br /> I think the film would have been better, even shorter, if the writer and the director had made a precise choice. Thriller-Horror, Mystery-Comedy, Supernatural-Suspense or Musical-Romance, instead of an awkward mix of all. <br /> <br /> I must say more than once that the director had to see "I know what you did last summer" and I tried to give it a twist Bollywood. My first film was Bride & Prejudice. What I thought was good. <br /> <br /> It looked like what a Western audience would think of as a cheese party directly on video. <br /> <br /> The acting was extraordinary, sometimes it seemed like they were intentionally trying to parody Western thrillers, but when you saw them try to inject dramatic crying, shouting or afraid, it seemed out of place. <br /> <br /> The viewer wondered when an actor would wink at the camera. More than a few times when the public was supposed to be horrified, we could only giggle at the absurdity. <br /> <br /> I watch a lot of foreign films and, even if I do not know Hindi, I have to say that they have done the subtitling of the film badly. Sometimes it was difficult to read white lettering on the light background. <br /> <br /> The villain was particularly amusing, at least for me, because he came with his own background music. The supposedly surprising twist actually made him feel like a cop. <br /> <br /> The main couples were pretty / pretty, and the music numbers were worth paying my rent. I would suggest it to someone as a musical, but I would tell them to quickly move the rest of the film forward, as it was not worth reading. If you are determined to read a Hindi subtitled movie, then check out the top romantic drama 'Namasteay, London'. <br /> <br /> But I was not scared ... unless it's really what they think is horrible in India. 1 of 10 for what is presented as. 6 out of 10 for his unintentional speed and his ability to illicit a lot of laughs, and his music / dance numbers. Enjoy :)
