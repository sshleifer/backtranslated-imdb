This is just a long advertisement for the movie "The Death Tunnel". Although this is an interesting story about the Waverly Hills Sanatorium, the whole ghost theory depends on your interpretation. Other "ghost orbs" that you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera and "ectoplasmic haze" represent someone's cigarette smoke lit by the flash of the camera. I could not see any "Shadow People" until they drew an outline around the fuzzy distortion of the image. No scientific explanation has been suggested for the phenomenon, only paranormal. These may just be events to believe in, so be sure to plan your visit to the Sanatorium for your next vacation to Louisville, Kentucky.
