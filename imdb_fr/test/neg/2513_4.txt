Based on a story by Ray Bradbury; a professional photographer (Brian Kerwin) returns to his modest home, near a small desert town, where most citizens want to stay. A lonely boy (Jonathan Carrasco) grabs him for his attention; and the two witnesses of the landing of an alien vessel in the rocky desert region. The extraterrestrials are transformed into images of city dwellers. Kerwin must convince the evacuation of the city and fall in love with the boy's mother (Elizabeth Pena). Playing is pretty superficial; the scenario is no worse than some others; this film leaves you feeling that you have been cut short on a decent end. The secondary cast includes: Howard Morris, Dean Norris and Mickey Jones.
