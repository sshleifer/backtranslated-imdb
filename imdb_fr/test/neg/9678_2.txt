Recently, I borrowed a copy of this movie mess that took me three sessions in three days. This is another comment under preparation. <br /> <br /> But what I wanted to comment on first is the carelessness with the particularities of the DVD. It included a memory game that asked the player / spectator to match pairs of animals in order to climb into the ark. However, each time it reveals the chosen animal, the screen prompts the player to find (or congratulate him for finding) "his companion". This is a misspelling because it should be "his companion" as a possessive pronoun, not a contraction because "he is". It's a boring mistake to repeat 16 or more times to complete a game. Of course, it's really an activity for kids, but it teaches them an incorrect spelling. <br /> <br /> And, oh yes, the game never changes. It's the same game with the same locations of the same animals each time. In addition, he does not keep the score, as the number of shots it took to solve the match. So there is no lasting value or challenge. This is simply a feature to list on the package. <br /> <br /> In simple terms, there could have been more thought and attention to this "special" feature, just as it could have been more thoughtful and neat. confused film.
