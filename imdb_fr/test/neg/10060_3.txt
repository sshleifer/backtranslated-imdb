This film is on my list of the worst films ever made. The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is happening or the reason for the actions of the characters. All films must have an internal logic, and this film does not have it, the story makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Seeing Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is lucky because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film. For his part, Donald Sutherland must be an extraordinary actor because he succeeds in having a beautiful appearance despite a bad staging and bad writing. his performance is credible and he manages to stay in the character despite everything. <br /> <br /> If Lady Agatha Christie was alive, she would die laughing! The movie is so bad!
