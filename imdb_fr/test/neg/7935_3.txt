Ok, here is the market. I love action movies and, in general, I have no problem suspending a lot of disbelief in intrigues or other improbable actions. However, this film went well beyond minor flaws and went straight to ridicule. Tell me if I understood correctly. The police sent a notorious gangster and a cop murderer (along with several other prisoners) on a bus with a total of two guards. They are then forced to stop at a police station where precisely two police officers work: one is a day of retirement and the other is exhausted. Apparently, the building was about to be closed. The police therefore decided that all the other inhabitants of the enclosure would be entitled to the night for New Year's Eve. Right. But wait, there is better. Gabriel Byrne introduces himself to hunt Fishburne before he can flirt with him and other dirty policemen. (Although we never know anything about their relationship or relationships). It is interesting to note that the police who launch the assault on the enclosure are in full SWAT outfit with night vision goggles, assault rifles and nine meters. Later, they even bring a helicopter with MORE people in full speed. I'm not a cop, but I'm pretty sure you can not get out of the job with complete equipment without someone asking you what you're doing. And the police helicopter ??? In the so-called terrible winter storm ??? In addition, no one near the enclosure hears nor sees this major seat unfold with flash grenades and gunshots fired? I mean seriously, come on. I know it happens in Detroit, but even there, it would raise suspicions about a supposedly top secret mission. I also like the fact that they find a Tommy pistol in the evidence room and that somehow the gun is still working and that it has bullets that are still intact and usable. <br /> <br /> I could live with some of these problems if there were not any other glaring problems too. On the one hand, the first few minutes of the film are shot very frenetically and hyperactive and I thought it would set the tone for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The rest of the film has no sense of rhythm, tension or drama. The "characters" are in no way related to each other, which is probably due in large part to the fact that they are not particularly interesting. There is not enough interesting action to make this movie a good action movie, or character development / narration to make it a passable thriller / drama. The "relationship" between Hawke / Fishburn is the only thing that the director even tries to make interesting or intense. Oh, by the way, the last scene in the desert? Uh, I thought it was in the middle of a rundown industrial district of Detroit and suddenly we're in the woods ?? The acting is not great in this film, it's just that the staging and writing are atrocious. I really like some movies from Hawkes, Fishburne, Byrne, Dennehy, but this one is terrible.
