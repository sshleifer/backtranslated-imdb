I just saw this movie at the opening night. I read other reviews of users who convinced me to go see him ... I must say that I was not impressed. I am so impressed that I feel the need to write this comment to save some of you money. <br /> <br /> First of all, "The messengers" is very predictable and is not really a thriller. It can be scary for someone under 13, but it did not really help. The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the film was solved. <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting game seemed a little superficial. Some of the emotional disputes between the family were less convincing than the suspense scenes. If you've seen excerpts from this movie, then you've seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot. This film is not worth seeing in theaters.
