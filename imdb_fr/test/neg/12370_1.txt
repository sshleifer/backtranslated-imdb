This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune to see all my life. Take 5 wooden actors who were fired from the theater school because they were so wooden that someone sat on them thinking they were a bench. <br /> <br /> Then add a cheap camcorder. You know the old types of VHS that cost Â£ 20 on eBay. Add a dreadful story without effects and yes you have this movie. What shocking it was. They could not even save him by having a girl fit inside. She was fat and ugly and was the worst of all. In fact, I looked at everything, I could not believe that shit had ever been funded. <br /> <br /> LACKING ALL COSTS
