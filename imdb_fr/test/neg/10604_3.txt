It's an incredibly bad action movie. I would say that his main fault is that it's BORING. Arghh! A brilliant wardrobe, a retro chic scenery and a correct cinematography can not prevent this film from being a rehearsal. The second (major) flaw of the Mod Squad is its lack of character development - underlined by the lack of talent of the actors. I like the work of Claire Danes and I was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this film. Giovanni Ribisi is unfortunately misinformed: how could his gruff and gruff playing style fit into an ACTION film? As for Omar Epps, he needs some drama lessons to learn how to play. The man had the same facial expression for the whole movie! My suggestion is to save you a few dollars and wait to see this turkey on a cable.
