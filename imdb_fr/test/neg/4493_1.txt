The action scenes were pretty good. But for the plot of the film, I would have to give it a score of 1 in 10. It seems that the producers and the director of this film have not thought carefully? Give a lot of value and value to its viewers, except for its violence. The whole story was about revenge. A boy witnessing a rape and a murder. I would even recommend that he be banned. Those who watched it, you just lost money. If you plan to look at it, observe something else. I would ask for a refund if I were in a movie theater. So for you guys and girls who read this article. Please do not waste time.
