It's a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action movie. Billy Dee plays a young man who is tired of racism and decides to take things in hand. It's quite realistic and realistic without exploiting the characters, but it's still not interesting. The character of Billy Dee, abused by white personalities, does not show as nice. He is also affected by his extremely low budget. Nevertheless, it is interesting to watch because it is a good representation of the social problems of the 1970s.
