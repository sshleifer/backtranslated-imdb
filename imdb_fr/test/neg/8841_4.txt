Obabakoak is a lot of news that has only one thing in common: the small town of Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange film because it has any main character (the film spends about 20 minutes in each story) other than the city of Obaba. Any story is very well explained and the fact is that they are very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but hey, that's not saying too much. The only good thing about the movie is the precious scenarios. It is filmed in a very precious valley and it is more pleasant to spend time watching the screenplay rather than being aware of the story.
