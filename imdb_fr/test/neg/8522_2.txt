The Messengers is a bad generic and boring movie. The film has a big problem: it's not scary. The performances and the scenario are totally stupid. He uses old tricks to frighten and all supernatural events I would not say that messengers are a bad movie ... I would say it's an accidental comedy, because it's so bad that it makes you laugh. The only good thing about this movie is that it's short, so this shit will not stay with us There are a lot of horror masterpieces that count on a small budget (like Subject Two , Lucky or May) who are unfortunately ignored, while this shit is quite a success in the box office.So, I do not recommend this film of horror weak and pathetic is called The messengers.
