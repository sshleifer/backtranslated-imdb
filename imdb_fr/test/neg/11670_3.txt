Smart summary, is not it? <br /> <br /> If Mad Max was simple, straightforward, nothing extraordinary but nothing wrong, this movie was totally compensated by its sequel, The Road Warrior. . So, in theory, with a third big film, it would have been an excellent trilogy ... now, it is not the case! <br /> <br /> Such a disappointment was at the rendezvous of Beyond Thunderdome! Its main principle is rather cool, with an "underground world" (imagine a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but all this is not conducted with too much conviction. Add the unpleasant Tina Turner and the bad story of people waiting for a plane, and it's just a huge stink. <br /> <br /> Maybe they can maybe brighten up part 4 again (although this is probably going to be a huge budget explosion problem), because it's not right . <br /> <br /> 3/10.
