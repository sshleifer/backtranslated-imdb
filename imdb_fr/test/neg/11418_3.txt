My mother made me watch this movie with her. She is apparently going to watch anything with a vampire lawyer in it. I have always been bored. <br /> <br /> At different times, Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans recalls Spartacus, Battle For The Planet of the Apes, The Passion of Christ and Mandingo! What reminds me the most are the Italian images of sword and sandal of the 1960s (not the good ones) who spend an inordinate time showing Greek or Roman despots in dress talking and plotting incessantly while you wait impatiently the muscular man hero and his lover, usually the daughter of despots, to do something. <br /> <br /> This film desperately needed color and suspense. The characters were beautifully two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The decorations seemed to be entirely made of pewter! I wonder how many chess games of the Civil War were melted to make this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone who wears fishnet stockings and black lipstick, do not hesitate to click NO.
