I was struck by the acting and the script of this film. All the characters seem motionless by personal problems, a bit like stags in the headlights. They are reluctant to moan and moan about their emotions when decisive action needs to be taken. I found myself screaming on the TV screen trying to wake them up and do something! The plot is implausible. Whenever a main character has to make a key decision, one of the other characters must evoke all the issues related to the obvious decision, such as making the decision even harder. It's a proven melodramatic ploy that you only want to make you moan. Clearly, the scope of the decision is obvious - you do not need to treat the audience as an idiot. Overall, there is too much emotional melodrama throughout the film.
