I'm probably one of the few people to defend and even appreciate "Frisk," the project that put Todd Verow on the map, if that's his case. I appreciated that someone had the courage to tackle Dennis Cooper and did not back down in front of the equipment; Verow rolls enough in it. Judging by what he has done since, he is well suited to this type of material and should probably stick to it. "Vacationland", a so-called "teenage film", is so wrong that it becomes an involuntary comedy, and I am disappointed to report it. <br /> <br /> First of all, our hero, Senior High School "Joe" is way too old in appearance to play at 18. When we later meet a man who is supposed to be Joe's teacher, it's confusing, because the sweaty guy looks much younger than the student he's teaching. Joe's mother looks younger than him and does not act older either. Second, in Joe's opening scenes, he seemed to play or experience mental problems. To his credit, he improved over the film and I realized that he was "playing young", but it just did not work. It was weird. <br /> <br /> There are 15 minutes left before everything is revealed on who, what and where these people are, and why we should care. The second scene of the film is a long story of men's toilets which, given the future of history, is absolutely superfluous; the secondary plot with the teacher is not going anywhere, not even like a "rite of passage" for our "young" hero ... one minute, Joe tries nervously to the sex of the bathroom stall (a scene so erotic that it makes you really crazy, I wonder what everyone sees in practice), the next minute, he is an expert on sexual blackmail and violent double crossing. This is followed by a protracted scene with the character we'll learn later on is "Andrew," and that's about all we learn about him, except that he's apparently gay but not out yet. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of stuff in the time of 1:44 (which is about 20 minutes too much - I can not imagine how it played with Joe's erased, long and useless scenes who is walking); a sub-plot from "Gods And Monsters" with an old boss who throws a rhetoric tone to play nothing played by an actor who obviously does not remember his replies (it is conveniently shipped in the same way that Dickens would could do it a slow week); an almost four-way match-match between the boys and their girlfriends, a gay-bashing tramp, a so-called wise sage in the form of a Queen Nellie (and not Queen Nellie suddenly took over the role of "hooker in the heart of gold" as the most tired stereoscopic type?) that exists only to be degraded; blackmail, theft, murder, alcohol consumption and abuse of loop music software for the recording of soundtracks. <br /> <br /> What you will NOT find in this film is an interior setting up master plans; we expect ourselves to be in an airport, a grocery store, and a classroom, as all the scenes in these locations consist of close-ups and poorly mounted soundscapes that reflect the idea of ​​places that production should not have been able to produce. to offer. One thing they could have found seems to have been a real gay bar; Either it's the worst bar in the world, or there's only about five gay men in Bangor, Maine, because the bar never has a customer base. Another good laugh came when the actors were supposed to shout at a dance music that, of course, did not come from the speakers, but was rather a catchy looping music of the "score". <br /> <br /> Intrigues and characters come and go, emotions are unreadable and the dialogue, clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper, is "film-spoken", which means that no human really talks about this way. Since we do not receive any information about these characters, it is impossible to worry about what happens to them; it's like Joe et al. came out of the ether one day and could simply cease to exist once the credits ended (certainly the character of Joe's sister, Jennifer Wannabee, crazy Bohemia, just seems to "stop", we never know where she is in LA or what's his problem ... but again ... is it important?). Visually, the film sometimes has a very good record, plus a pledge of novelty in high definition video, I guess. The editing is still pretty clumsy (there was a good editing, Joe poses naked and says: "I wanted to play sports, but ..." and we cut into a plan revealing his "buttocks ..." ah, ah). The composition is also sometimes strange (I thought to watch SCTV's parody of "Persona" when the boys chatted together in their bed and it seemed that their nose was glued during the whole scene!). <br /> <br /> We feel that Verow really stops making a "wicked" movie or a bit rougher, as he usually does, and maybe he should not have done it to stop (the foamy fantasy / sex fantasy worked well, I thought, even if the tone was he produced and directed this story "sensitive to the passage to adulthood" much like Herschell Gordon Lewis directed films without gore. .. sex movies without sex I had some involuntary laughter and it was not boring, it was just not very good either.
