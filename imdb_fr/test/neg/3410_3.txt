As a science fiction fan since my early childhood (a long time ago), I have always hated intriguing intrigues. It's unfortunate that most children's science fiction writers do not show this kind of respect to their audience. I always suspected them of thinking, "The kids are stupid to realize, so we do not have to fight." The author of "Science Fiction (2002)" is no exception. The story is about a boy who is encouraged by his new friends to spy on his parents because they think these parents are extraterrestrials. Although the idea seemed intriguing, I was very bored of it. It seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this idea and tried to extend it for an hour and a half by plunging it into a dark, elegant and extremely slow atmosphere. The only thing that kept me in my seat was the question "how do they manage to get out of this incredible garbage"? And then - bang - they did not even try. So, if you are looking for good entertainment for children and parents, look instead for "Klatret√∏sen (2002)".
