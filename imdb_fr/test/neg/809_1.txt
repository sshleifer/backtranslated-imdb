Do not see this movie! It's ... repulsive! The beginning is indeed very good, but in the middle everything falls and I really regret having spent 80 crowns (about 11 dollars) on the ticket! Peter Dalle should consider this as his last chance to win the interest of the people. AWFUL image! The only good thing is the wonderful work of Robert Gustavsson, Lena Nyman and GÃ¶sta Ekman. <br /> <br /> I hope you take my advice ... The photo is nil.
