One of the last big survivors of the horror screen, Conrad Radzoff, dies and his body is placed in a mausoleum with television clips of the great Conrad before death, which greet you during your visit. Unfortunately for him and his captors, Conrad's body is "borrowed" by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge mansion where they drink with him, carry him between them, dance with him, laugh with him and then put him to bed in a coffin that is lying right in a room upstairs. The news of the disappeared body reaches the widow of Radzoff and her friend (who masters perfectly the black arts) and she organizes a kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so that he can, in his own words, get eye, a tooth for a tooth. "Well, Frightmare is an interesting" bad "movie, of course it's cheap, and the scenery seems to have been borrowed (which I'm sure). blood and guts are done liberally and with little credibility.The acting is average to below average with a few exceptions.Jeffrey Combs, Re-Animator fame, is in tow, but it does not really does not play a big part in this rather ungrateful role as a horror-obsessed teenager who has to steal the body of a dead man to hurt himself ... None of the "kids" except the pretty girl who plays Meg n ' Nita Talbot plays "the friend" of the Radzoffs with a diminishing interest. i, look for the big - I mean the big one - who plays the policeman. It's Porky himself from the fame of Porkys. But luckily for all of us, a performance exceeds the material. Ferdy Mayne, a much-overlooked German actor who bore the features of Christopher Lee and played the role of vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers, does a more than commendable job as an aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life. Conrad Radzoff in a poor human being, living only for his own pleasure and we see him kill twice before he is dead (obviously none of the teens who sway at that time). Mayne is able to look very royal, speak with great elegance and easily convey the threat. If for no other reason, we should see Frightmare for his performance. I do; However, believe that when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff, they used images of Christopher Lee (someone has ideas?). Anyway, we can guess what is happening and it is the case: Radzoff goes out and continues the children who troubled him. Once again, the formula is commonplace and overused. The role for the most part is anemic, and the direction is so ridiculous. But Mayne gives a good performance in an ocean of incapacity. Well worth a look. Watching Mayne continue to appear on the screens of her mausoleum brought an ironic smile to my lips every time.
