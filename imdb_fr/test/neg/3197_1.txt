I watch this horrible movie as we speak. it may be one of the worst movies in my house. I am sitting here with 3 friends and they agree. it's not scary. It's not funny. it's not dramatic. it does not contain anything attractive. we are 49 minutes in the film. we only saw 2 creatures. only one person died. this film is a big disappointment. Nothing in this horrible film made me want to watch the rest. I'm going to have a movie hanging. I hope all those who participated in the making of this film die. I do not just talk about actors. I mean the director, the producers, the presidents of the studio that financed this film. it's all, the worst movie of all time. IMDb should do worse than 100 movies of all time. at number 1.
