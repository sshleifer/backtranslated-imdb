Andrew Gurland's "Cheats" is his fictional "true story" about four high school friends who maneuver to cheat on tests. The quartet is composed of: Trevor Fehrman (as beautiful Davis) hating school, his equally attractive friend Matthew Lawrence (as Victor), their boyfriend raising hatred Elden Henson's school (as Sammy) and the twisted g√©kster Martin Starr (in Applebee)). Adults include Mary Tyler Moore, a struggler with North Point, and father Griffin Dunne, the father of pornography, and himself a porn addict. The high jinks start with Mr. Fehrman and Mr. Lawrence supposedly urinating on a teacher's note book. Put it at the bottom of the pile; and be thankful that this is not on anyone's permanent record. <br /> <br /> *** Cheats (2002), Andrew Gurland ~ Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, Elden Henson
