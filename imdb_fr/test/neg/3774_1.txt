I attended a screening of this film. Travolta came for a question period after the end of the film. It was a small screening room at Tribeca. As a courtesy to him, I did not go out, which I wanted to do. It's the shooting of the film at its worst. To start the script was poorly written. The writer writes with one voice. The dialogue was stiched and clich√©. How was this writer / director supported by Scarlet Johansen, John Travolta and Lions Gate Entertainment? This is the only brilliant thing she has accomplished in this fiasco. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all aspiring writers. , directors and filmmakers. Because you are told that you are wasting your time and that you will not be able to achieve your goals. Hi ... Look at that shit and tell yourself ... if they can make that believable. <br /> <br /> PS- Travolta did an excellent Q & A but ... he was comfortable, spoke freely and was a good down to earth guy. The director / scriptwriter stood on the sidelines. When John tried to get her to participate in the conversation, she moved away like a piece of wood and never joined. I looked at her and wondered ... how was this person able to successfully "introduce" agents, studio directors and top talent ... when she can not open the mouth when showing his own movie. The conclusion of a few of us was that she had to have strong family ties in the business. <br /> <br /> After watching her, you should follow her with Guy Ritchie's "star lost" masterpiece "Swept Away" with the largest number of unintentionally funny and worst performance of the Madonna woman . She is so mean and looks so bad in this movie. I guess that was her way of blaming her for all the abuse he takes at home.
