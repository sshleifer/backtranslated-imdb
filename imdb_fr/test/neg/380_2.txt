This one looks like an older 1987 film "Masters of the Universe" based on the cartoon "He-man". Basically, you have a fantastic old world and, for some reason, they have to make sure that almost all the action of the film takes place on the modern Earth. Well, I guess it's not the modern Earth at the moment and it's an old world, a strange strangeness and a good time hangout. Well, I guess I can understand why they actually put almost all the film in modern times in this or that film. To save money on costumes and sets. It is much easier to recreate what is happening in the present than a strange world like Eternia's in He-man or an ancient world with strange cults and pyramids, sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death. This film is forgettable and not very entertaining, your first indication that it will not be the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is one of them. The only thing this one has to go are the animals that are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last one. Marc Singer is back and sad to be in this state, the guy was a pretty good actor reduced to wanting to do a sequel to a movie that did not really need it, and even if it happened five years too late .
