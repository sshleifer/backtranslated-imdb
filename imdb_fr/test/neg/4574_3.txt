The year has three more weeks to go, but unless a really awful turkey comes before that date, Passion of the Mind could be the winner of my worst movie of the year. An interesting idea poorly executed. And, by the way, badly acted. Demi Moore is very good at curling her lips and smoking cigarettes, but is that all she does? And why so many cigarettes. Did Ligitt and Myers or any of the other bad nicotine boys invest some of their illicit profits in this production? It's confusing, silly, and moves in the fast-paced past of an arthritic worm. I gave him a 3. Should have been a 2! <br /> <br />
