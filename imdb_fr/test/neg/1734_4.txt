I rented this movie with my friend to laugh. In fact, the clerk of the video store mocked us because of the dubious tastes of our films. Unfortunately, I do not remember the first half of the movie because all I did was look at the giant metal suspenders Jane was wearing. and I did not hear anything either because of the incomprehensible lisp. The other thing that caught my attention in addition to his metal mouth was his dubious fashion sense. This film was shot in 2005, but it seems that wardrobe people jumped until 2000 for clothes. If you remember the days when Aaron Carter was considered a "popstar" and you like high-waisted jeans, ankle bottoms and knee-length skirts, this little behind-the-scenes journey is perfect for you. .
