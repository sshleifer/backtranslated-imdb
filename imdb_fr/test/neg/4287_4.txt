In this film, Gary Oldman plays the role of a defense lawyer, who was previously a prosecutor. He is a little tormented, but he plays more or less with an ordinary guy rather than a kind of figurative or literal monster. The funny thing is that it does not quite happen. I guess you can not quite get back to normal from there. Kevin Bacon was scary enough. The scene in the park was way too long with far too many false alarms. And the strange sex scene with Oldman and Karen Young seemed to come from a different movie, although the rest of the time, Miss Young went very well. This film suffers astonishment trying to hide the predictability. And fail. Do not bother yourself.
