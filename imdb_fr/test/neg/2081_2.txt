Paul Mazursky has misfires on this film. Writing, direction, casting and acting (with the exception of Victorio Gassman) are all irrelevant. I remember that the critics of over 20 years ago were mediocre, but I thought it was still worthwhile to be consulted. With personalities such as Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia (who exaggerates in most of her scenes) and John Cassavetes, I expected so much more. The music chosen for the film is shocking, the cuts between New York and Greece are disconcerting and the overall pace leaves something to be desired. Why did Paul Mazursky feel the need to update this story, or add his touch, is disconcerting - this story of Prospero and his daughter is of little importance in the play and does not adds little more. The play is not one of Shakespeare's best anyway, and emptying it even more does not seem like a good decision. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend in this movie.
