A few words: it's a good thing that George A Romero is still here, because if he were dead, he would have to leave the grave to vote against the authors of this "political satire". And the sad thing is that I actually agree with the feelings of these people. Yes, there are zombies and they have a good reason to come back from the grave: vote. Oh, and one of them ends The Doctor from Startrek Voyager. It's about as scary as possible, people. If you are looking for a horror movie, I suggest you keep looking. And if you're looking for a spiritual political satire, you're also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called Masters of Horror. But do not let me hold you back: maybe you see something I missed. Although chances are you are wasting your time with everything as I did. Let's say I prefer my zombie movies with zombies in front of the camera.
