The recent death of Stephen Bach, one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE, has raised fears of an at least partial resurrection of the reputation of the accursed film. In addition, the original version, the "long version", was recently shown on TCM, exposing the film, in all likelihood, to its larger audience. <br /> <br /> I saw the film when it was released for the first time during a screening filmed in a cinema on 3rd Avenue in front of Bloomingdales. I think it was published on a Friday and removed the following Wednesday. It may not have been a fair release, but it was and it's a terrible movie. See the full version recently confirmed by this judgment and more than thirty years of experience in reading and writing movies, I am better able to say why. <br /> <br /> There is first of all the dreaded phrase "mise en sc√®ne" whose definition is at once so simple and yet so amorphous that it continues to get upset even after being defined. Basically, it's all that happens in front of a camera, for example, an extra crowd will be given an action, let's just walk on the sidewalk and a starting point, and when the assistant director screams the action, the If there is another take, the extra will come back to the starting point and go back to "action." All the extras do it, and then say a cab goes to the sidewalk and the star goes out and kisses another principal while the extras of the crowd are doing their job.This is the staging.In the theater, this is called blocking, but the cinema is much more multidimensional. <br /> <br The importance of the definition of staging is explained by the fact that When French criticism developed its theory of the author, the opposite of the author was a profession on the stage, even more desperately described as a "traffic policeman". An author is intimately involved in the meaning of a film and, through the corpus of the director's work, one or more discerned themes. The staging was essentially a business man who made a film of what had been handed to him on paper. That's the difference between, for example, John Ford and Sam Wood. <br /> <br /> The second point concerns the way director, Michael Cimino, became director of cinema. Cimino first gained prominence in directing the first $ 1 million television commercial. This represented a Chevrolet floating on the Grand Canal in Venice. This ad is never on the list of the biggest television commercials of all time and is remarkable only because of its cost and exaggeration. The effect is similar to that of a three-year-old girl brought in to entertain a company that gets its biggest reaction when it throws itself on its head. Cute for a child of three, embarrassing for a child of thirty. Cimino was therefore congratulated early on for spending a lot of money on a disproportionate image and learning it. <br /> <br /> His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974) presents a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in the car of a madman who comes and goes, until she leaves the road and that the driver opens the chest full of rabbits he will pull one by one. I felt that if the producer, Eastwood, did not intervene, the scene would have lasted until all the rabbits were killed. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I suppose if you watch the DVD movie in small pieces like in a mini-series, it can be impressive. It's because the scenes are directed with such a dense staging that each scene is like an encyclopedia, it's just exhausting to sit for almost four hours. It's like sex, at one point it just becomes flogging. There is the opening 40 minutes at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed at Oxford, it's a bit of a non-sequitur. Personally, I am in favor of the artistic way of telling a story, as opposed to the most commercial _ "I will now tell you what I am going to tell you" of most movies. However, the preface represents only one line: Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt traveled to Harvard together. Now, twenty years later ?? All this time, money and effort, not to mention all the attention and energy of the public, just to spread this almost useless information. <br /> <br /> Next, there is the scene in the street between Kristofferson and Masur who is constantly going on with a city populated by extras and horse-drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to provide a little bit of exhibition information. It's so exhausting. There is just one scene after another like this one. It's like trying to eat a ten kilo pizza. Then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible and unintelligent dialogues, which are still going on and are exhausting and boring. <br /> <br /> Of course, each extracted scene is brilliant. All in all, it is a rich article on which laudable articles can be made. Seen in pieces with the ability to quickly advance into boring pieces or turn it off if you feel staged whipped, it's basically painless. But do not let anyone tell you it's a good movie. When I saw him in 1980, there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where Kris Kristofferson is on his horse and he turns in one direction then the other and does it about six times. "It's symbolic," he says, "he does not know where to go." It's basically, at its core, the basis of any criticism of Heaven's Gate. <br /> <br /> Look at it, if you must, but be warned, this is not a film whose time has come, it's a stink that will smell for all time. <br /> <br /> HEAVEN'S GATE is historically inaccurate to the extreme. I recommend Asa Mercer's book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS on the Johnson County War.
