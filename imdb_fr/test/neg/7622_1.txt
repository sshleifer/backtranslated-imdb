Interesting subject. Pathetic delivery - scenario and direction. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Miles, thawed and underwent his first life restoration surgery. This is where the fun begins. The underlying problem is that Miles does not have a soul !!! This is used to explain his near-erratic behavior of being indirectly responsible for two deaths (I believe this is the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). <br /> <br /> For his part, Miles prefers the cognac glass, the flamboyant fireplaces and his young cousin in full maturity. The finale does justice to this film. <br /> <br /> Some thoughts: 1. The producer $$$ has been separated to create this tripe. J.D. Feigelson was the scriptwriter and one (or only) producer. It looks like he has not learned the lesson on "how not to give life to an interesting idea" when looking at his other writing credits. This will enhance the credibility of this script. <br /> <br /> 2. Now available on DVD !!! This is really scary. Should be forever "the bottom of the board" in VHS format. <br /> <br /> 3. A reincarnated human without a soul will default to an evil entity. <br /> <br /> 4. The score offers minimal support. Not even a fit Jerry Goldsmith could save him. <br /> <br /> 5. Wished the time slot 0230 on TV and a bit more fun than the infomercials + test patterns with which it was competing at the time of my viewing. <br /> <br /> 6. Fortunately, he did not give birth to a sequel to Wes Craven's "Nightmare" franchise. Too Chiller: The Return Return of Miles, or something. <br /> <br /> Despite my score of 1, I still recommend this film as a great example of how to kill a career as an actor or screenwriter. This should apply to the staging. However, Wes Craven will be eternally exempted because of his only good piece of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984).
