This movie is so sweet! I tried not to expect anything bigger from this movie, but it was still a big disappointment. The basic idea of ​​the story is interesting and potential. It could have been so much better. The characters are really simple, no depth at all. It's a shame that the previously talented artists, Tiina Lymi and Petteri Summanen, have not improved the already poor characters. The director simply does not want the viewer to be emotionally involved at all with this piece of film *. <br /> <br /> And the chase sequence at the end of the film. It's hideous !!! <br /> <br /> Why there must have been such a stupid and old solution for this situation? <br /> <br /> It is an element too used with an even more terrible way of filming it. OH NO!
