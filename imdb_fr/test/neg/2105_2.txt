I would probably give this film a zero if not for the climax, which does not really involve snakes in a train, but rather to train in a snake. The premise was prepared more than likely during a beer night after hearing about Snakes on Plane in production (this, in fact, was released to coincide with the release of this film). The joke is probably not lost for those who will look for it; I do not think there would be a soul out there that would consider this as a serious thriller action (except at an ironic level beyond the capacity for rational thought). This is a Mayan curse inflicted on a woman sentenced by her family to leave with another man. We see it soon disgusted and spitting green lime with, of course, snakes. She and her son are off on a train to Los Angeles, and soon after, more than cliche characters are aware that snakes are catching up with the train - the original woman herself becoming a snake. <br /> <br /> If it's worth listing the movie more, there's not enough time in the day. All that can be said about the quality factor is that it is almost non-existent; there are short films of students with larger budgets. It was perhaps a judicious calculation on the part of the filmmakers, namely that there would be so many copies sold, if only for fun, that they would cut their budget the first weekend. Because looking at the sets (the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a stage!), The actors (if you can call them that, with only one other actor, the one with the very thin hair that strikes the woman throughout the movie - who took advantage of the film produced), FX (also almost nonexistent, giving the effect of Snakes on a Plane to a Star Wars look), and the actual CGI snakes themselves, with the Huge gigantic snake final Something to see in terms of science fiction movie channels. <br /> <br /> All of this means, basically, that laughter is a riot at every stage of the process (especially, as cruel as it may seem, when a little girl becomes "paying attention" to snakes), with the contempt for good taste that works well in his favor. That being said, it is also 100% disposable, like a B-movie lollipop with a tangy scent.
