It's so bad that it will be my contribution to the next bad night in which I'm going to the movies. From the beginning, it was clear that Steve Gutenburg was taking this role seriously ... the other principles were running in their lines. I think they seemed to sense how much it smelled very early and they were looking at the payment requests. Sean Bean "acted" as usual, but did not have to share screen space with any of the principles until the final scene, where it was like an actor heading for a high school scene whose contrast was defined. Some actors do not look well disheveled. Some actors should not regroup for one part. Both of these statements apply to "Police Academy" Steve. Its slovenly appearance is reflected in carpets and needles, and its swelling makes it look bigger. Combine this with one of the worst dialogues in Hollywood history and your BAD movie. I can only guess that all the principles really needed money for remodeling or anything or that their agents signed it before the script was written by the monkeys who had to type it. I would like to know the story of this disaster.
