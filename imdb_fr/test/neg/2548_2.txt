I rented The Matrix Revisited with a friend of mine. We both loved The Matrix and we both loved doing movies. So we wanted to see what was happening behind the scenes of The Matrix. It turns out that The Matrix Revisited tells you almost nothing about the art of cinema or even the making of The Matrix. This is actually a huge advertisement for The Matrix, a movie that the target audience of The Matrix Revisited has already seen! <br /> <br /> If you really want to know more about the process, the problems, the stress and the details To be part of the realization of The Matrix, look no further than the bonus of the original DVD of The Matrix. There are things they show in these documentaries that I did not even realize that it was necessary or was done. The Matrix was such a difficult and difficult film that it deserves more credit than a "documentary" as informative and interesting as an MTV special.
