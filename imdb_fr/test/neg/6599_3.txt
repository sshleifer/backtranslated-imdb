This film is like many biopic television movies I've seen: stereotyped, exaggerated, misinterpreted and, above all, happening too early. <br /> <br /> What I mean by that is that the film was shot and, for that matter, aired prior to Michael Jackson's acquittal of his pedophilia charges, which I think , has been one of the most important periods in Jackson's life and career so far. That would probably have finished this docu-drama. However, this film already excites much more than it can chew, engulfing too much detail in this project too ambitious. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that Michael Jackson has led the most interesting life to date for any musician, let alone the pop star of modern times, to this day, and his story would undoubtedly take six special Behind The Music programs to be told with precision. This film tried to say too much in three hours, and it goes without saying that it failed. <br /> <br /> Flex Alexander did all he could while playing in Jackson, but it was more like a caricature of the SNL. Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler. It would certainly be quite difficult to find someone who accurately portrays Jackson without meeting the king of pop himself and studying his methods of madness. On a small budget, however, one can only rely on what they see in the tabloids, and these do not necessarily give an accurate representation. <br /> <br /> In addition, the director's efforts to give Alexander the appearance of Jackson are completely foolish. The Caucasian make-up on Alexander's face makes him look more like an inverted minstrel show, and anyone who has stayed in a grocery store knows that Jackson's nose is not as big as Alexander's. I also find it amazing that the film shows that Jackson is under the knife for surgery, but in the next scene, Alexander still has the same nose. This kind of suspension of incredulity that the director expects can not withstand the viewers of the twenty-first century. <br /> <br /> It was even more distracting when the video of the real Michael Jackson (ie when he was a toddler on a balcony in Germany) was scattered in the movie in real time. It was a good try, but it simply did not work. <br /> <br /> If the film as such was shown in cinemas, it would only make a profit because of its viscous nature. It is even ridiculous compared to "Mommie Dearest", and that says a lot. First and foremost, it was probably a film that needed to be rushed, like many TV movies that are not shown on HBO. It could have been much better if he had just talked about one aspect of Jackson's life. Even if it only covered the allegations of pedophilia, it would probably have been much better and would have been even more intriguing.
