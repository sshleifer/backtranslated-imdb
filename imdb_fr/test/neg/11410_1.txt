I have seen this film about 6 or 7 times, and it gets really much more fun every time. What I like most is perhaps the paradigms of tired characters that the film offers us: the dark male American protagonist, his blonde girlfriend, the nerd of the spectacle theater, a brunette girl, the antagonist jock and the dark girl # 2. However, two magician martial arts experts with mules driving a convertible are then introduced to us. If anyone can explain that, please contact me. Other highlights include the portrait of jock character, Dell, by Bobby Johnston, and his trademark line, "That's why I keep it close to me". Looking at Johnston's performance, it is not surprising that his career quickly fell into the realm of soft-core porn. (SPOILER) Moreover, after several views, I still have absolutely no idea what this big demon at the end says at some point. it's just noises smothered electronically. Oh well, it's probably for the best. And finally, why are all demons so slippery? Is wet skin scary? It certainly did not help in this movie.
