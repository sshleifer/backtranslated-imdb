Very bad quality and the acting is just as bad. This film is an excellent example of current England and its state of mind. There is no mention of Jesus in this film, any more than the film contains any type of Scripture, Christianity, as most people know. <br /> <br /> I'm also very surprised because this film is a BBC show and the BBC is known for its quality of programming, but it seems that the BBC's attempt to compete with psycho Hollywood drama fails completely. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, poor plot, poor culture that seems to be without religion. I would not even bother to buy this, but I'd better try to rent this one or buy it when it goes to the 2 dollar cashier.
