I took my 14 years to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely horrible! This film should be rated R at least. I'm not so strict with the movies but it was too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain a comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be raw, but it was way beyond rawness. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really took me) and I could not believe how grossly sexual it was. I could not believe it would be acceptable for a 13 year old to read and see this content. I do not understand how the rating system works.
