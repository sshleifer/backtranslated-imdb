This film has the spirit of a university project on it, which wants to make a blair project that meets the theme of the saw. But it is not successful. The cinematography is mediocre and the acting game even more. The characters, in my opinion, are not credible at all. Editing the movie does not really work out as planned either. There are a lot of mediocre effects, which are, I believe, put in place to try to add a horrible effect. But for me, it gives me a sense of indifference. <br /> <br /> I would stay away from this film, unless you are a movie lover, who likes to watch "different" movies and independent "horror" movies. However, I believe that this film is not worth seeing, for the average citizen. You will not enjoy the mediocre effects and the handycam feel that this film gives to the viewers.
