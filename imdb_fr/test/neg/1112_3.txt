Wicked Little Things has an excellent synopsis: an empty house next to an abandoned mine in woods with a tragic past; the family settles in the house and strange things begin to happen; scary little kids start popping up here and there doing scary things-grandchildren. But that's where the intelligence and the potential pleasure come to an end. This group of children had been sealed in the mine several decades earlier and now seem to wander in the woods (mediocre makeup) with weapons looking for flesh to eat. Oh, I understand, it's a movie of zombies and ghosts. Hmmm .... although I can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre, it simply did not work. What was the motivation of children to want to eat flesh? Why did they need weapons? Has anyone else imagined that the filmmakers all gathered around the daily shootings because they thought it would be a cool / scary movie? After thirty minutes, I realized that I felt resigned by the familiar resignation and that I had just wasted my time in another modern shit celebration. Although the game has been good and the frame / cinematography are of good quality as well, the script itself has suffered from what appears to be a lack of knowledge about the kind of supernatural horror. A group of children walking in the mall is more frightening than this group of badly disguised rodents. <br /> <br /> This film is not afraid, and although I can appreciate the story, I would have perhaps even enjoyed it if I had read it. instead of looking, I still have to say that Wicked Little Things is more specifically called Wicked Little Turd.
