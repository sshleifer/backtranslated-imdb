Ugh. This movie has so many incredible plot machinations that they did what could have been a good movie a hideous mess. The story is half decent, but the holes in the plot make the performance literally laughable. We are supposed to believe that the secret services would go against common sense and allow the President of the United States to be put at risk. If this is an indication of the type of thinking that inspires the discernment of the protectors of the president, we all have problems. As president, Roy Scheider performs well, but is sadly outweighed by the really disgusting play of Patrick Muldoon (who continues to land a job in Hollywood solely on the basis of his beauty and paltry talent. if the script calls for a sly smile). Maybe someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from their place of departure - or maybe someone will see it and say, "Hey, s' they can get a movie as bad, maybe I can too! "
