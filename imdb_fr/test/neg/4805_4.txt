It was already the second year of the Academy, but they already voted politically - the brilliant performance of Jeanne Eagels in this start of fearful conversation had to be compensated by a name Oscar and the statuette was the worst performance to win - Mary Pickford at COQUETTE. The only existing copy was a working copy without music or final editing, but wherever it is shown, Eagels stuns and captivates with its powerful, alluring performance. She is so convincing on the witness stand that even though we know that she is lying (we still saw her SEE killing the man), we find ourselves in the audience, at the like jurors, believing in his innocence before we suddenly take ourselves. THIS IS GREAT ACTION. The film must be available on video so that the whole world can once again enjoy this fantastic performance. (Jeanne's silence exists in the archives - MAN, WOMAN AND SIN - and her only other talkie, JEALOUSY, is "lost", so it's the only document we have from her. was released from the archives to be shown in New York in the early 70's, the Village Voice printed a full-page review, venerating the Eagels show).
