This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I have ever seen! I give too much credit to this movie! My best guess as to why this movie is that someone wanted to show someone else's martial arts abilities, but realized that you can not just shoot a guy fighting another guy and people are watching him. So he put a story behind the fight ... and people still did not look at him. <br /> <br /> The story of this film was very fine. This game was clumsy and stereotyped of any Kung Fu movie. The dubbing was literally the worst I have ever heard of. It seemed that if you played a small role in this movie, like the big guy or the two guys who are trying to catch the main character with a net, it does not matter who made your voice heard. It could have been a dyslexic with a stuttering stutter and no one would have said anything. But next to all this, the film catches up with scenes of rather impressive fights. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were what this movie was. But the instigations of the fighting were totally absurd! In most cases, a guy comes out of the tall grass or glances at the main character from a distance and then attacks. But once the fighting starts, things are balanced. There were only two things that really prevented the fighting, though. These constant "wooshing" sound effects that were added to every punch, foot or sword, and the mediocre editing that made 25% of the fights VERY nervous and agitated. Someone would be in the middle of a back-flip, then suddenly on the floor, then immediately back on his feet, blocking a punch. But if the copy-and-paste editing was more of a nuisance than anything else, it did not really affect the movie in general. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was not a good movie, but I was not. is waiting for a good movie. A good movie is not what you should expect when you see a box cover like this. All I saw in this movie was a way to spend an hour and a half of boredom. I rarely say that, but it's just one of those movies for which you have no practical use, so watch it every time you have free time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Good day gentlemen. <br /> <br /> -Scott-
