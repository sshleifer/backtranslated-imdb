After watching this movie, I thought, they really covered the life of Errol Flynn! The film is really a treat for the eyes. They really have the Hollywood atmosphere of the 1930s and 1940s. The costumes were great. All the women looked glamorous and all the men were handsome and good-natured. <br /> <br /> Is this a serious film about Errol Flynn's life? Nah! It's a funny movie based on all the scandalous things he's done in his life. <br /> <br /> Why do I criticize this film? It's a promising film but it has failed. Duncan Reagher was really good like Errol Flynn. He was not as handsome as the original, but he made you believe that Flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously, but a man who, although endowed with a great talent, was rather disturbed and unhappy inside. Flynn's love life was a disaster considering the number of failed marriages. He has also lost many good friends during his life. He also suffered from an unrequited love for the elegant Olivia DeHavilland. The last scene in the film showed that Errol was asking Olivia to stay with him and that she was going instead. He is shown in his tuxedo, looking really empty and slowly walks around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool. It was a sad way to finish the film, but in a way, because everyone now knows how he ended up getting rid of his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle. This film could have been much deeper, was better written. Of course, they showed all the scandals but they never showed the human center of Errol Flynn. Surprisingly, Duncan Reagher was able to give Errol Flynn an emotional depth even though the writing of the film did not put much depth into it. <br /> <br /> I will probably never see this movie again but I can still remember after watching this movie, "My God, it could have been so much more .....!" I give a D + to this film.
