I would have liked to put 0.5 but unfortunately I can not. Who can write scripts so bad (I saw the movie five seconds and I knew that the "bad boy" would be Sutherland - he had to pay his taxes, when we see how good he was in the movie "Ordinary people from Redford and others! <br /> <br /> Although I do not like it, but I had no choice, I saw the film in French, but I know that hearing the real voices of Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton n would not have changed things, What makes me sick is that people make a living making this ugly thing (I forgot to talk about Mr. Waterson, far from Woody Allen's movies he had used to play in). <br /> <br /> We had another movie on another French channel: a James Bond idiot with Brosnan (I'm not talking about real bonds with Connery (please, it's the end of the holidays , wake up!).
