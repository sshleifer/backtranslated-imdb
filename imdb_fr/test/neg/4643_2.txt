I know that Full Moon, or any other movie studio, could never find the fun and upbeat feeling of sci-fi that was behind the "Trancers". And with the last two entries in the series having Jack Deth in medieval times instead of futuristic Los Angeles, it became quite obvious that there was really little hope of reviving the Trancers series. Giving a new breath to a movie is one thing, but taking our main character out of their element and plunging it back into the past, well, it did not work! So now, with Trancers 6, Full Moon has brought so much newness to the series that we are not even dealing with Jack Deth anymore. We are now dealing with his daughter, Jo. Jack is in his body and must go into the past and fight the Trancers again. <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILER: FIRST READED SCENE SCENE * <br /> <br /> To prove how much in this movie, you only have to watch the first two minutes of the film when the original Jack Deth appears on the screen. But it's not really Tim Thomerson. These are excerpts from him and related sound clips (believe me, you can say they're connected) horribly to provide the viewer the last of Jack Deth's true mood. And from that moment, things just go down. Having this girl, Jo Deth, as our main character while Jack Deth is supposed to be in his body, is the worst idea in the world. To make this pretty young woman play the role of a hard and hard man is not at all the right way! It does not work and it's really stupid. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to get into the special effects and make-up aspects, because most readers of this article know what Full Moon has become: really, really, low-budget business. I do not know what to say about this movie, but I really wish that Full Moon looks like it was at the time of Demonic Toys, Puppet Master and Trancers 1. At that time, the special effects were not great. the narration was. They have made serious B-movies for big B-movie and horror fans, which is not happening today with the new Full Moon studios. I long the good old days and sincerely hope that Full Moon can get out of this horrible crisis in which they are currently. <br /> <br /> Trancers 6 gets a 2 out of 10.
