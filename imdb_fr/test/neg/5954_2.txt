This film contains so many things. Prehistoric society, adventure, romance, true fraternity, violence, sex, religion; all described abundantly..without one pronounced word !!! And why does it suck so badly? This film will make you rethink the origin of humanity. If this were the product of anthropology, you would rather defy Darwinian theory and Hegelian synthesis. You can not stand watching that even with your brain shut. And now, you think, "I have to see that." I warned you. I take no responsibility if you regret spending more than an hour watching this artwork. Well, I warned you. This should be forgotten and buried forever.
