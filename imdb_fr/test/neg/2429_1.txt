It hurts me to see a great movie turn into a lame, repetitive, and lazy series. It is filled with holes and the plot is confusing, in a bad way. The authors who decided to turn such a fantastic film into a trash should have done some research instead of filling them with dubbing and new hollow characters, and the classic jokes of the first movie OVER AND AND AND AND AND OVER. Of course, they become a little creative, but it's like seeing the same episode with a little twist. It's a bit like listening to Creed or Nickleback. Kuzco must stop himself from failing, Yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to go for the easiest way to save time and use a potion, someone questions the monkey and the virus, Bucky appears to in the background, Kuzco flirts with Malina, she dissects him without looking like a bitch, Yzma disguises herself as "Principal Amzy" and she calls Kronk, and he forgets that she is Yzma. I admit, this show has its moments. Another problem is the fact that Yzma looks younger and that Pacha looks ... weird. In addition, no one can replace David Spade and John Goodman! They are the ones who made Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry, but I give this show two thumbs down.
