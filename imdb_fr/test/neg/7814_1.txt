This film must be one of the worst I have ever seen. The humor was brutal, barely funny and already heard a million times. The beginning was special and the situation got worse. I found myself about half way and could not look at it anymore. Fortunately, I was only watching TV, which cost nothing, but I strongly recommend you not to waste your time or money. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie was new. The characters were not developed at all. In fact, I think it would have been better as a little children's movie in that it was full of stupid and unrealistic "funny" events ... it's like what happens at home alone or something of the kind. Do not imply that the house alone was in no way as terrible as that.
