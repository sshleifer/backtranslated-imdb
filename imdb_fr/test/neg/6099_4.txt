The Three Stooges are without a doubt the biggest comedy team in the history of cinema. For this reason alone, they deserved a much better end to Columbia than they had received with this short film. <br /> <br /> "Sappy Bullfighters" is just not good. Certainly, not everything is the fault of Joe Besser. Personally, I feel that some of his short films are quite funny, simply because of the departure of the usual Stooges fanfare, and the fact that Larry is sometimes more exposed. However, this court just will not do the trick. And the fact that we know that this is their last short film ever seen, which only adds to the general disgust. <br /> <br /> This film illustrates the brevity of the subjects in their last death during this period. and how little effort was needed to make them. This court is so sloppy. It's a simple redesign of a Curly short film, "What's the Matador?", Filmed years ago. As if that were not enough, the studio actually added images of Moe and Larry from the original (filmed almost 20 years ago). Are not these things obvious? Risible or sad? Your turn to judge. <br /> <br /> Another part of this short film that makes him unhappy is the fact that it is actually a showcase of Joe Besser, showing him everything he is (at least in this movie) is a Curly-wants-to-be-completely-fake! Moe and Larry have little to do in this short film. As a fan of Larry, I must also say that I find it a little shameful that Besser takes advantage of the joke that Larry had popularized in the short film "Ants In The Pantry". To see Besser say "I can not see, I can not see!" and that Larry says the simple "Why do not you see?", while Besser manages to shout "I close my eyes", is wrong at all levels. <br /> <br /> The two brave soldiers who stuck Howard and Fine have so little to do in this short film. There are almost no fun pieces with them. The only thing that matters is that Larry is hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, trying to be his dog "Pepe". <br /> <br /> We can not blame the dynamic duo. Larry and Moe give everything. No matter how ridiculous things might be (and I'm sure they had their opinions at this point in their career), Howard and Fine never gave less than their best. Their efforts do not fade from 1934 to 1959. <br /> <br /> I often take advantage of many short films that some will describe as horrible. I am all for their more "experimental" shorts. At least those that contain new ideas. However, I think everyone can agree that this short film is not good. <br /> <br /> Thank God, TV later discovered the boys after the closing of the short film department. If they had been forced out of this way, well, that would have been a blatant injustice for all the years spent making the audience laugh.
