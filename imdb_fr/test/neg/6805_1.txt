For anyone who cares to know something about the real Diane Arbus or who values ​​psychological veracity, this film is catastrophic. Arbus was a brilliant, talented, agitated and troubled person, but this film describes her as being completely involved in herself, and really weird in her tastes and judgment. Kidman describes her as a vague and vague image, while she was someone who upset people with her charisma. The totally fictitious relationship at the heart of the film is incredible, and Robert Downey is really boring in his mocking portrait of someone who seems to think himself superior to the rest of the world simply because of his affliction. The film describes this encounter as the source of Arbus' interest in "freaks", which is a truly banal explanation of the inspiration of some of the greatest photographs of the twentieth century. The mystery to me is why people of talent and intelligence have chosen to participate in any way in this film.
