Flying is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen, seem to want to get away with it. I did not even see this movie, but not only do I know it's nil, but the fact that it derives the story from another movie, or 2 movies from elsewhere, is such a shit ( and if IMDb allowed a lot more blasphemies than I feel invaded by rage and feel as if I just had to throw myself out the window and finish everything ... Ok that's a bit much but flying is worse. <br /> < br /> Have you ever seen Pontypool? It was this awesome little zombie movie made in 2008, this radio host goes to work, then this zombie attack happens.We only see what happens to the inside the radio station and the only estimate we can have of what's going on outside are the casual calls from their eye to the sky, Ken Loney (by far the funniest moment of the movie in my head) and the BBC, calling for an update on the situation, all the criticisms I read and the conversation I had with my friend (who saw this film and Pontypool), this film was exactly what it was in the story, with some minor adjustments here and there. So throw the originality and creativity out the window. As for the Zombies, or the infected, as you want to call them. They are exactly the same, the mere fact that they have been infected does not change the fact that they wander without thinking and that they have an endless temper for the flesh. These are zombies. ZOMBIES !! <br /> <br /> ZOMBIES !!! Good one to many, but back to this shitty movie. The Zombies of what I heard are very similar to those of 28 Days Later, another better movie, with their crazy rage and their crazier flesh tempers. This is where the zombie movies are defined, the story does not matter in a zombie movie (as long as you do not take the idea of ​​another movie). Of course, a zombie movie can be improved by history, as is the case with Pontypool, but zombies must be, in a way, original. 28 days later started the furious zombie mad. Pontypool, I can not even begin to explain these guys without ruining the movie. The Evil Dead, I think all I have to do is just hit the name again because, come on, it's The Evil Dead. Romero is the master. He went through all sorts of zombies, from zombies with painted faces from Dawn of the Dead to the raging zombies of Diary of the Dead, and he made them all with his own style. <br /> <So, after talking about other great zombie movies, I think it's time to explain why I hate this movie without even seeing it. This film on the bottom right steals the original story to Pontypool, which I call plagiarism and which is illegal in this country. Many people get fired from school for doing this. Yet, in Hollywood, it's allowed and apparently approved. This is not the only film that takes the main lines of another film and simply tries to say it differently. The '90s are like the worst period of all time for movies. Certainly, there were some jewels, but what a decade does not have, and that's because all the movies were exactly the same. My favorite, the crime movie with a twist so big that you'll never guess it before the end. They force you to feed a suspect, make it seem impossible that it's not something else than him, then, all this time, it was this guy, it was enough to watch the scenes where he does not was not there and when he would show it mysteriously out of the blue, say "Hey guys, what did I miss?" OH! DO NOT SEE THAT COMING YA! Well, I'll leave a cliché as the final statement. It's a movie you'll want to miss.
