I saw the Mogul VHS video of that. This is another of these old distributors of the 80s which I would like to have the catalog! <br /> <br /> This film was rather mediocre. Although renamed "Do not look in the attic", the main warning that repeats itself is "Do not go to the villa". Going to the villa's grounds is a bad idea. A character enters the attic after an hour of cinema and should have done so earlier because of his knowledge. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Turin, in the 1950s. Two men fight and a woman tells them that the villa makes them do it. One man kills the other, then regrets it and the woman removes the knife and stabs it. She runs away from the villa and, once left, a chair moves by itself (what is the purpose of that?), But when in the garden a hand passes through the ground and drags it into the ground. <br /> <br /> From here, it's today, thirty years later. There is a session that suddenly appears and seems to have nothing to do with the film. The children of the prologue woman inherit the house. The main girl is played by the same actress as her mother. At least one of the two men in the prologue seems to be another character again. She is haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa, but they all do, because if they do not use it, they lose it. People are dying. A lawyer who has won all his lawsuits tries to investigate a little. The end is poor enough. Why was the family cursed? A film unfortunately boring. <br /> <br /> The back of the video box contains an amusing, small-print warning that says: "The scenes depicted on this package may give the impression of an artist and not necessarily represent real scenes from movie, movie. " In this case, the cover of the box is an illustration that describes more or less precisely the underground scene of the aforementioned woman, although there are two hands and the woman is different. That's right, sometimes the cover has nothing to do with the movie. I also remember seeing a critic who had a bad film prediction scale, in which movies with illustrations on the cover instead of pictures had at least one point for that.
