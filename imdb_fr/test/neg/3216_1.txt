A few moments ago, I came across this DVD while I was browsing Netflix and, with such an impressive cast, I decided to try it. <br /> <br /> I had never seen a movie before trying to be a new version of an existing big movie (Scarface) and spectacular chess. <br /> <br /> The main issue seems to be a total misunderstanding of what history should be. In Scarface, Tony Montana was the self-proclaimed "villain". His spectacular rise and possible fall is not sad, it's a great (and the only logical end) for someone who leads such a life. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, as a director, scriptwriter and lead actor, sees Kilo as a kind of hero, or at least a complicated guy. However, he does not want to do the hard work of creating a realistic and likeable character. He was raised by a white mother, except for the six months of his childhood when his father, himself a gangster, showed him his life. For reasons never fully explained or even really mentioned, he decides that he wants to become a drug dealer and that he goes by car to the wrong part of the city, contacts two dealers and says: "Hey, I would like to buy drugs. " He abandons his father's name and, apparently, they are not only rich, but the two types who provide it are submitted to him for reasons he never explained. <br /> <br /> Chapa wants you to feel bad when her character is sentenced to prison when a police informant is lying about her. However, since he has already consumed large quantities of drugs, why should he be sympathetic to the fact that he goes to prison this time? The most obvious case of Chapa who wants to be the good guy is in the execution in prison of a white supremacist / rapist played by Gary Busey. In Scarface, Tony Montana kills a person in prison because he has to do it to rise, it's done, he moves on to something else. But in this case, they must make Busey not only a rapist / pedophile but also a white supremacist. A little exaggerated, do not you think? I will not go into more detail in this regard, but their desperate message of "Please, love me! I am a complicated gangster!" fails at all levels. Despite their best efforts, I did not feel bad, conflicted or friendly when his friends were killed (following a shootout), his wife was also killed (shortly after she called him a lousy father , and during an escape attempt when he decided that it would be OK to ride right next to a car full of armed men while his wife was in the car), and of his eventual death. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that his acting can be fairly well summed up as ugly, his only achievement bringing the term "wood" to new starry peaks. Busey should be credited for really putting the effort into his ridiculous role. Tiny Lister did well. Stacy Keach plays her guardian in the role of Prison Break. Robert Wagner is looking for a paycheck. Faye Dunaway, although a bit dramatic, is still performing better than she deserved. Brad Dourif is in the movie for about two minutes and does what he can. And to give credit to the film, it's a little better Scarface: Jennifer Tilly now has the title of "most ridiculous attempt of Hispanic accent". (Sorry, Robert Loggia.) In summary, this film had an interesting principle, but a mediocre story, unpleasant characters and random performances. I would advise Mr. Chapa to appease sympathy next time. In reality, we do not need to love your character, we just need to be interested. More luck next time.
