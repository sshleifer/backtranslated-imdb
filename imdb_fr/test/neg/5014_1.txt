This film was a waste of my money. it was disgusting and disturbing. Honestly, I would never recommend this movie to anyone. who's thinking about a movie where a girl is blowing her dog ?? seriously ... it was a waste of time. I continued watching the movie, hoping it would improve and a plot would emerge, but it never happened. I would call the film F-. This film should have been rated R for its disturbing nature. I would never let children of any age see this movie. this film is nil. this movie is horrible. this film was a waste of time. I could have spent the night doing my best instead of renting this movie. this film was a waste of money, money to go to the store and certainly a waste of two dollars to watch it. roughly, no one should watch this movie. this film should be banned and etched.
