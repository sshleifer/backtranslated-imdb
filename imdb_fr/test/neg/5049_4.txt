A ridiculous thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their nasty and neurotic teacher (Mirren) just to stop him from acting. An interesting premise could make a good movie, but this one is lame and far-fetched. Boring with an embarrassing end, to say the least. Mrs. Mirren tries to give some dignity to this fire but, even a good actress, no doubt about it, could save this garbage. I give him a 4 (four).
