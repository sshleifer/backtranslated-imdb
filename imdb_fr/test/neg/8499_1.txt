I would not have given this film a score so low (2) if its average was not ridiculously high, but someone had to bring it back to something more reasonable. I watched most of this film, watching scenes of labeling and shoplifting. No dialogue, just branding and shoplifting. Finally the two taggers kissed each other. Something has happened. But let's go back to branding and shoplifting. I left the projection. I recommend this film only to those who are impressed by pretentious movies. I did not like the director's previous film (a perverse defense of man-boy love), but at least that film had a story, interesting characters, a dialogue. The graffiti artist had only scene after scene of marking and shoplifting. I want more than one movie.
