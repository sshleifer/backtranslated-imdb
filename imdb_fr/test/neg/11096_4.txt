If you thought it was French The Mummy and if you were hoping for another "Vidocq" ... then look elsewhere. He has the same kind of story as The Mummy about this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces scattered in the Louvre. I found the film slightly entertaining, boring for the most part. The special effects are not bad, but it's not spectacular, I was expecting big explosions and maybe the eiffel tower that collapsed until I realized that this kind of scenes was happening in The Mummy and it's Belhpegor. Apparently based on a French cult television series, Belphegor could have been so much better. I voted this film 4/10 only for the beautiful Sophie Marceau ... she must be almost 40 years old and she looks breathtaking!
