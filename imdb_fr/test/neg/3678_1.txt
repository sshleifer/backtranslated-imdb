I do not remember the worst film I've ever seen. A total waste of actors and hearing time. If you prefer to sit next to your TV and think about the end of the movie, then it's the right one film for you.It is possible that this film is recorded to make people believe that Moscow has a mystical past. But I must say that I expect nothing more from Rade Serbedzija, but I'm expecting more from Vincent Gallo. The film lacks intrigue, character, development, denouement. The film on underground tunnels is about the mystic just there is a certain effect of camera but even that is too poor. More and more are the same images. Total loss of time.
