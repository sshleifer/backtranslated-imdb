Stay Alive has a story very similar to some Asian horror movies that include technology. Some of these Asian horror movies are One Missed Call, Ringu and Pulse. The idea of ​​Stay Alive is therefore very clichéd and obvious, but the filmmakers he did not know how to put something new or interesting in the shots of Stay Alive.This film is totally crap. But a very big shit .All the elements of Stay Alive belong to the worst class of horror movies: superficial characters, nothing suspenseful, stupid '' horror '' that makes you laugh and lights up a violence.It is easy to see that the '' director '' is unable to create anything original or disturbing.I do not want to waste more time writing about this pathetic film.I just gave you some advice: do not see this movie.I really hated it.
