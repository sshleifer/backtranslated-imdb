I was looking for ATTACK on Precinct 13. There, the movie is THIS memorable. Who is the star of this? Ethan Hawke or Matt Dillon (I do not know who the main actor is, it's a big problem against the movie there) Gabriel Byrne (who could have needed this money as badly as possible?) Drea De Matteo is stunning but only because of her incredible body. It took me centuries to finally understand that she is the sister of Joey and "Friends". I agree that the so-called SWAT people who attack the station are pretty shitty, as far as tactics are concerned. We even learned better basic skills than this as part of the basic training of the RAF. <br /> <br /> Avoid that, even the snow does not want to fall on a bus full of prisoners! Very bad continuity indeed. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague!
