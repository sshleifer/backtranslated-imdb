All the great horror movies of the 70s, 80s and even the early 90s, from Psycho to Texas Chainsaw Masacre (The original movie does not heat up as much as shit), to Silence of the Lambs. The characters in these films were based on Ed Gein's crimes. The writers and directors have drawn on the true story to find the inspiration to create some of the greatest * fiction * movie killers of all time. <br /> <br /> The old horror movies were excellent, because even though the crimes were vaguely based on the facts of the Ed Gein case, they were really fictional and far from the real story. <br /> <br /> In the case of this film, they created a fictional horror movie in which they tried to capitalize on the true story in order to sell a cheap, mischievous love story, between two characters that no one really cares. In fact, in a * good * horror movie, these two characters would have been excellent victims. <br /> <br /> End of the conference ... <br /> <br /> In short, this film resembled a fluffy garment. underwear on a cold afternoon sipping a good cup of ice-cold vomit.
