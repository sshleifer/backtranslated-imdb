Being from Australia and in love with the show, I did not expect much from the American version of Kath and Kim, but I thought I would watch the first episode to see if it was really so bad. <br /> <br /> Well, what to say there. She is nothing special. Selma Blair is not a problem, she has some good aftershocks. Molly Shannon is not a good Kath. The good thing about Jane Turner's Kath is that when she speaks with all her fun accents (like when she says Yumor or Noice), it sounds like her natural way of talking, but when Shannon tries to accent, it's clear that she's acting and trying to be the same as Turner. And Sharon or someone else really lacks laughter in the show, because the Kal and Craig characters in this version are really not funny. <br /> <br /> So far, only the first episode has been broadcast. is clearly not up to Australian standards, although if it is an independent TV show with a different name, it may not be compared to the Australian version, it may be to be considered a little better. But if there is nothing else to do on a Sunday night (or a Thursday night in America), you can not do a lot of trouble watching it, or better, put some of the Australian version if you have some.
