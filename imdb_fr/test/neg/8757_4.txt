Well, I did not know what to expect from 555. In fact, I had never heard of it before a few months ago. But, being a collector of just about every kind of horror, I figured I'd catch that 80s darkener. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story is about a murderer who kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. What the third 5 in the title means ... nobody knows it. Anyway, the killings begin as the killer looks for young teenagers in dark places. He decapitates the men and brutally kills the woman. After that, he proceeds to the rape of the corpse. The police think they have a track about the murders but have no idea what's going on. How will they find the killer? Does anyone care? <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with some of the worst actors I have ever seen. No wonder none of these actors did anything else, literally. The three main actors are composed of two detectives and a "sexy" journalist. I am sarcastic when I say sexy, she is as sexy as possible. The two detectives are like watching tweedle dee and tweedle dum. One of them subcontracts his role and the other may have gone to the Shatner School of Acting. The acting is so painful that it almost makes you lose interest in the movie, almost falling asleep. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps this terrible film together is some decent gore scenes. For a film on this budget, filmmakers must have put all their money into special effects, which are still not that interesting. <br /> <br /> Unless you are like me and must own all the horror movies out there, I would suggest avoiding this movie. 4/10
