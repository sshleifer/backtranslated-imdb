Peter Segal created a monster as part of a miserable attempt to make a quick investment in Hollywood of one of the greatest masterpieces of television. Out of context, if we did not know the work of Brooks before being watched, the film would be a lame film with big budget that does not know if he wants to be a big joke and a stupid comedy, or just a movie ordinary action without anything to do. pass. However, as a young generation that has just spent two months obsessing over the five seasons of Get Smart, the 60's TV show, this movie hurt me from the moment I walked in and saw Steve Carell break the house. The stories, Agent 99 undergoing plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was previously morbidly obese, shame the complexity of the initial duo and make it a flat and boring reevaluation. It seems that the writers, unable to be really funny in the dialogue and the situation, have fallen back on the lame settings of the famous lines of Don Adams, flashbacks on the big camp, references to Carell's share in the office under the interview-style shooting angles they have, and a female chauvinism that falls flat. <br /> <br /> For those who saw the original, the writers of this film thought they could include memories. They mention Herbie, Fang (now a tiny furry dog ​​that Carell covets), the shoe phone, the cone of silence, and her classic red car as well as the doors and phone that introduced the show. Classical music is back, but now everything is updated, usually for the worse. Cone of Silence is now a strange blue telekinetic force field. The control headquarters is right under a museum that preserves Control's past. The film lacks creative and random technology, and replaces it with Swiss knife crossbows. Carrel injures or injures another character, whether they spend two minutes shooting themselves in the crossbow, being hit by security guards, or vomiting on planes. In the original, Smart would insult a great enemy, attack him without success and try to attend him before being sprayed. In this one, he attacks without success and is bludgeoned. It seems that the writers did not understand that humor was established with dialogue and not useless violence. It's as if they had taken the names of the show and eliminated everything that made it good. <br /> <br /> The poster hides Carell's face beyond Hathaway's. Similarly, the film avoids anything that could make it good. They mix classical music with dramatic action and romantic music in big budget movies. While the original feeds on a camper sensation, it replaces quality with massive doses of CG explosions and sound effects. I was looking forward to that, because I had just finished the original series just two months ago and was among my top five shows of all time. However, it was a massive disappointment. The credits indicate that they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in all the things I read on the Internet, they were largely left out of the writing process. In conclusion, if you want to waste your money with a cash-in with little value and not respecting his name, go for it. But expect that the ride is not what you remember. <br /> <br /> PS: I almost forgot about George Bush's humor. They mention "Nuculor", falling asleep at the fine arts, the president working for their vice president and appreciating the solutions to solving real problems. If you want to hear the same jokes you heard 3-4 years ago as a big budget movie, throw your money here.
