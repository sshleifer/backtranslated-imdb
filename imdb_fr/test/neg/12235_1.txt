This film is a terrible attempt at parody. His attempts to parody various sports films are half-cooked and not at all funny. <br /> <br /> Even things that should be funny - like the Indian bodysuit that always wears a traditional outfit over her uniform - are not very funny. The fact that the football team studies and gets good grades, which makes the coach crazy does not laugh either. <br /> <br /> The intrigue of a traditional loser still has a chance to win by training a losing footballer in high school The team really had potential as a parody. It is a classic and banal sporting theme. But alas, the scenario was too weak for ALL the cast can achieve. And this distribution is no exception. <br /> <br /> The free use of women in bikinis and underwear is not a bad thing in this respect. <br /> <br /> But Animal House or Talladega Nights, it's not.
