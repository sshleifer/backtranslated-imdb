The Vindicator opens on the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage, attacking a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. This random act of violence has sold it to me and I am happy to say that the rest of Vindicator has offered a real treat of cheese. <br /> <br /> The Vindicator talks about a scientist (David McIlwraith) who nearly killed an explosion in his lab, whose ragged remains are placed inside an experimental body suit / armor. For some unfathomable reason, he is equipped with a rabies response activator, a device plugged into his brain that will make him homicide if he comes into physical contact with another person. They give some explanation of how this is a necessary defense mechanism, but I do not see the logic of installing such a device unless you want a raging cyborg killing machine. This is particularly ridiculous when it is stated that the suit that Carl wears is actually an experimental space suit. What need could there be for an astronaut to turn into an incredible hulk during a mission? As expected, he walks out of the lab and faces the wacky scientists who put him in costume, as well as the Ninja Hunter assassin played by Pam Grier (no, really). <br /> <br /> The Vindicator himself is pretty damn awkward. He's basically a guy in a mutilated gold leaf suit. He also has a puzzled look in his eyes, which does not inspire fear or even compassion. I guess you can not blame him for that, most people who watch the movie will have the same look. <br /> <br /> The acting is really bad, on stilts, "I do not know what the character's emotions or thoughts are just that, so I'm going to take a kitty and start my dialogue on a tone of random voice while trying not to watch the acting of the camera.The actor playing the awesome black scientist is fighting even with this last part. <br /> <br /> It is after this death accidentally initial Vindicator attacks scientists Oddly, all activist Rage Response activator "touches me and I will kill you" does not play a role as important as one would expect when Carl attacks to his old colleges in a reasonably detached way.There was a scene where he brutally killed street punks who push him in every direction.I know it is de rigueur that street gangs assail at chance the main characters in the movies of the fourties re-twenty, but one of them surely realized that it might be a bad idea to attack the powerful cyborg, even if it looks like C3PO's delayed cousin. As it stands, they do not even seem surprised to see a mutilated golden cyborg strolling down the street, as if it were a daily occurrence. The only other time this activator of rabies intervenes in the film is when the old Carl can not kiss his wife. When Hunter tries to thwart him by throwing him into him so that he must kill her, he casually notices that he has reprogrammed himself (off-screen, of course) so that it does not happen. They could have left the whole story of Rage Response Activator and settle for a revenge story without a fight, it would not have made a huge difference in the movie. <br /> <br /> There's a fun sequence in the Grier Sewers and his henchmen hunt down the Vindicator. Because of its armored skin, they are all armed with weapons that "spray vaporized acid". For bizarre reasons, when these weapons fire, they are represented on the screen by drawn red lines going to their targets in the manner of Ghostbusters. The Vindicator defends himself by tearing a pipe of gas from the wall and incinerating all the Grier's idiots in a huge trail of flames. The resulting fireball is so huge and powerful that it comes out of the sewers of a manhole and explodes the van to which some scientists belong. Oddly enough, Grier escapes by throwing herself into deep water while she is close to the Vindicator. This is one of many fake fire explosions in the movie, including the death of a brilliant black scientist when the vindicator sends his pickup truck off a cliff. (That's after they captured The Vindicator by trapping him in a giant block of gello-no, seriously). <br /> <br /> There is also a troubling, long and misplaced sequence, in which Carl's treacherous overweight friend, who looks like Ned Beatty, a poor man, reveals his infatuation with Carl's wife and tries to to rape her. It lasts about 5 to 10 minutes and is full of disturbing clich√©s showing the guy drooling on the woman's face, girting on her and trying to remove her dress. It is to say the least disgusting and seems really out of sync with the rest of the film that is a little caricature and larger than life in its violence. <br /> <br /> The finale of the film involves the vindicator struggling with many other guys in battle suits. For some reason, all these other guys are less scared than Carl, some of them being sent by their wives just by snatching a tube protruding into the side. Fortunately for Carl, the costume he wears lacks this crucial design flaw. The only truly memorable part towards the end is Grier's death. Doing something I had never seen a villain doing in a movie before, in the middle of his confrontation with the Vindicator, she decides that she really has no chance against him and that she is hurting her brains. with his pistol.
