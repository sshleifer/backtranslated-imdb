THE BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Osborne Holmes, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Really disappointing adaptation of Richard Matheson's "Button, Button" opponent, legendary of the genre, of Richard Kelly, the dazzling filmmaker who truly extends a small, well-designed piece into a 'WTF'-a-thon' handbag! Langella, a mysterious man (and ridiculously mutilated!), Offers a million dollar offer to the "troubled" couple, Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla-haired!): A box with a strange red button in the world (!) Of course, ropes are attached, but is it really important here? What explains why, in the name of God, Kelly uses such an abundant trowel (nosebleeds, aqueous transport systems ?: Watery.Transport.Systems) while the tension must be as tense as possible (oh possibilities). If this sounds like a bad episode of TWILIGHT ZONE, you're right (the reboot of the 80s television made a decent adaptation on the small screen, rent it instead!) One of the worst movies of the year.
