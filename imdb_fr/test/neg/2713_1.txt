It must be one of the, if not the worst movie I have ever seen. After watching this piece of film, I figured I should write to Madonna and ask for compensation for my time, but now I have the feeling that I should write Madonna and demand a good 80's album (given that she can not save a good save her life anymore) in exchange for this disaster. <br /> <br /> Let's go to the movie itself, which can be summed up as follows: <br /> <br /> It's about Madonna jumping around playing like a spoiled teenage girl. She tries to impress this absolute aversion of an actor who plays "the lawyer" in the film. But the best was the end. I was speechless in front of the television while the credits rolled thinking about myself, "That's all, it's the end? What a piece of shit!" If Madonna was not a pop icon at the time of this movie, this film alone would have destroyed her career. And the funny thing about this situation is that I just watched movie to see where they placed the song "Who's That Girl". Well, guess where they put it? ............................ .......at the end!
