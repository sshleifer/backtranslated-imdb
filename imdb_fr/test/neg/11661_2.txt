The Hindi remake of Ms. Doubtfire performed by Kamal Hassan is a rather mediocre version, and not up to expectations. <br /> <br /> Kamal Hassan clearly struggles with Hindi dialogues, even after all these years, and can not handle even a scene without effort. The guy has aged and should give him some rest. Hassan brings nothing new to the role or character, like Tootsie's Dustin Hoffman, or the Marathi actor, Macchindranath Kambli, to the character of Mavshi (his aunt) in "Moruchi Mavshi" (Moru's Auntie, comedy). <Br /> <br /> What was the child playing with firecrackers when it was not Diwali? Most of Chachi's romantic "cross-relationships" - Amrish Vs, Paresh and Johny Walker seem redundant for the main storyline. The bath scene of Tabu was useless. The family is North Indian but the night of Karva Chauth must be recalled by a "Maharashtrian" chachi. Yes, it's true. <br /> <br /> The acting talents of not one but four actors, namely Tabu, Om Puri, the late Amrish Puri and Paresh Rawal were lost in this film. <br /> <br /> Look at the original version of Mrs Doubtfire - clean, clean and fun, unlike the Chachi 420.
