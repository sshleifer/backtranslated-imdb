It's hard to know exactly what to say about this dull and dull little movie. The story is predictable when it is not completely laughable. These are "conscientious actions" that, as presented here, have absolutely no conviction. Yes, MGM's "production values" are beautiful, and yes, Mrs. Lamarr was exquisitely beautiful, but she and the great Spencer Tracy have absolutely no "chemistry" together. all effective ... I understand that this film received bad reviews at its initial release; the passage of time has not improved it.
