Every film that Quentin Tarantino made was progressively worse. I would like to believe that most people would agree with this statement, but since "Inglourious (sic) Basterds (sic)" has a score of 8.5 / 10 out of more than 100,000 votes, it does not seem that the cinema public is going nowhere. Even his best job, Reservoir Dogs, was not a "masterpiece". The problem is that asserting that you love Tarantino's work has become fashionable. As soon as this happens, you get boats filled with people ready and willing to get on another train running. They will ignore the ridiculously terrible game, and a totally self-indulgent writing, just to be part of the exclusive club called "everyone". This movie is so terrible that I swear it must be some sort of twisted joke from Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and praise again. As another critic has already said, "Tarantino's previous films were from a man who was in love with other films and is a man in love with his own writing." I could not agree more. This film is nothing more than a complicated and pleasant writing, accompanied by an ability of interpretation, drawn from a play in high school. But, thanks to the generalization of the film, I am sure it will remain one of the best films ever made. Bravo Tarantino. You have achieved one of the best practical jokes of all time.
