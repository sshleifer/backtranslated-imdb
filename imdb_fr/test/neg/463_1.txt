How can someone even begin to love this movie really exceed me? <br /> <br /> The idea? There are not any. "A guy has collapsed." This is the idea. Sensational. An environment is slowly killing him ... now it's original and worth the detour. <br /> <br /> This is the first Fasbinder movie I've seen ... I've heard that he's a staging genius, but I've seen movies of students with more attention, inspiration, ideas and crafts than that ... that ... that, nothing. He has nothing! <br /> <br /> Every shot is too long. There is so much emptiness in them ... The acting is horrible. You can see that the actors had no preparation, no understanding of their roles, not even an attempt to show emotions ... it's so ... superficial ... The lines are so explanatory that you could delete them 90% and I still have the same crappy movie. Tempo? Who cares. Atmosphere, dynamic, it's for the pussies! One person per scene, 80% of the time, people look unrealistic, not knowing how to represent the emotions and the importance of the moment in addition to looking down at the camera or others ... Edit? All the rules of assembly have been ignored without any financial benefit ... Photography? Half of the shots have glare and shit lighting without any stylization. Shadows, shadows ... who needs them? We need a guy who pisses, drinks, hits his wife as if he were ... as if he was acting. We need a lot of close-ups of a woman not so beautiful ... we need an amateur climax of her capture by an unconvincing Arab torturer ... This film has so much wrong that it It's not worth it without a budget Frankly, I have not seen a movie as bad since American Pie 5. Yeah. It's bad. <br /> <br /> I've just started watching his movie "Veronica Foss", which looks a lot better, based on the first 15 minutes (because he has a hint of staging and artistic idea, unlike to this shit), so I will not argue that Fasbinder is clueless .... but that .... this movie sucks!
