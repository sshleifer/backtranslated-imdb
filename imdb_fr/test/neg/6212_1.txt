This film is widely recognized as a copy of Will Smith's film Hitch. This film was dull. <br /> <br /> This film is not as dull as it is unbearable. Govinda has exceeded its peak. He is not at the best of his role in this kind of role. He is just as unconvincing as his performance in Deewana Mastana. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is at his best "best" eye. And it's in the few scenes where he remembers putting on clothes. It is only through nepotism that scenes of eye injuries have been saved from the trash of cinemas. <br /> <br /> Another case of Bollywood that gets bogged down with its shameless cloning. Another case where the majority of the Bollywood audience is embarrassed by making a success.
