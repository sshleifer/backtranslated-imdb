This movie was a bad movie. The plot was poor and the comedy they "tried" to deliver remained mediocre. The accidents seem artificial and predictable. I thought the actors had tried to a certain extent, but with this movie, it was so bad that it can only go very far. One of the worst movies I've seen and I do not recommend to anyone. Mr. Accident's only accident was his release.
