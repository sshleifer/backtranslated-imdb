Nico Mastorakis' banned film was quite disappointing in my opinion. The film is about a couple who (apparently) goes to a Greek island to kill all the perverts. You know you have something pretty sick when one of the first scenes includes a guy sleeping with a goat and then killing him. <br /> <br /> But things only get worse, from then on all the scenes are very much alike. They meet people, so either they kill or have sex with them (preferably both). <br /> <br /> The end is OK all is well when the couple turns brother and sister and let it rot somewhere but overall, we could have expected more. No substance here, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
