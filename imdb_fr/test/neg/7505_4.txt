Zombie Planet seems to be an example of good ideas and a worthy ambition exceeding the budget. I thought that the explanation of the zombies was really original and thorny, and I loved the dog nibbling on the stage of the exhibition. The rest of the gore was effective with a modest budget, but too spaced throughout the film. The problem was that it was too long and anti-climatic. Of course, they had a plot intrigue, if derived, and a similar but cool decor, but a low-budget zombie movie must really be goretastic to make a good impression and the moments of red are not enough for me. I think there was a surplus of inexpensive and bloodless fight scenes, especially given the generally minimal crane. In addition, for a two hour movie, there is very little closing at the end, and although it makes me want to hunt down Zombie Planet 2, I felt a little cheated. So, probably the most interesting to look for both of them.
