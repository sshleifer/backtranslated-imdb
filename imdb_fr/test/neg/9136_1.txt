PLEASE?! If it's about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves, I think I completely missed him. Because I left, I had the impression that Reggio was relying on Cold War era space exploration images, and that I had nothing new to add to the dialogue on the fears of technology. Trails of 1 and 0, indicating technology and mathematics and science - FACT that. Has anyone seen The Matrix? And movement studies of people in motion? Ever heard of Edward Muybridge? At least he uses accurate excerpts from photographs of human movement studies done by Muybridge. <br /> <br /> This film is derived, and the score is just enough so that Philip Glass sounds like ALL he has done in the last 10 years ... Avoid this movie at all costs !!
