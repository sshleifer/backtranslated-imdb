I see a model here. If you see a movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000, chances are you'll go to IMDb.com and there will be hordes of movie lovers. Yet he was chosen for this TV show because it was too bad. I'm sorry, but I read a lot about Rocketship X-M as a sci-fi film that focused on realism. Well, if that's the case, I could write several paragraphs on the fact that even with the knowledge of the 50s, this movie is quite flawed. Gravity could be the first obvious observation, or as MST3K did it as a skit "selective gravity", what about the fact that they are plunged into death and that they are just there, looking through the window, the boat would not be upside down effect this scene? I would like to think that they started with good intentions and that their budget was exceeded, but I think this film was just cheese like in the genre. Compare that to "When Worlds Collide", published in 1951 to know the real place where this film ranks, there is no comparison possible. The movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 alone, it's not even funny to watch alone. This is a 5 or 6 year old MST3K episode because there is no action or a lot of things to make fun of, just bad, bad, bad, oh I mentioned, it's bad.
