As a science fiction fan that I am, I have always been curious about this movie. So I was looking forward to finally seeing the hidden side of the sun finally on an affordable DVD (the previous print reported $ 100 on eBay - I'm sure these people would like to have their money paid back - but you'll know more about it in One second). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie (just like "The Parallel" of Twilight Zone) is that there is an undiscovered planet resembling the Earth of "the other side of the sun" . This planet is of course exactly like ours, except that it is reversed. It basically means that their letters are reversed and that people are driving on the wrong side of the road. <br /> <br /> Does this intrigue you? Well, that's all there is in this movie. The first hour is spent preparing for the journey to this other planet. These are just tedious scenes of sunken switches, a banal dialogue, and so on. It does not mean anything. Gerry Anderson has managed to find the most boring British actors in film history to interpret most of the roles. I am really surprised that the crew was able to stay awake to finish the film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, once the crew has finally landed on the planet (after an endless sequence of sitting astronauts and Roy Thinnes notices that the copy is fully back on a bottle of cologne and comes back on another boat to tell people what he has discovered.Oops, he never gets to do it as he crashes, lands and dies.The end! Wait, there's a bonus scene showing one of the space managers rushing into a mirror in his wheelchair at the end, I suppose he also wanted to get out of this movie. <br /> < I am really surprised that a film like this one can be shot even in the 60s. Rent if you have to, DO NOT BUY.
