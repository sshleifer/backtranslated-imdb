I would not recommend it to anyone except film buffs who like to laugh at a movie, not with it. <br /> <br /> This is a very promising place and all the actors get worse after a film that ends with perhaps the worst end ever seen in a movie. I will not spoil it, but at the base, the most overused movie clich√©s are hurting themselves and half for the last five most disappointing minutes of any movie, ever. <br /> <br /> The most exciting scene of all time, the chemistry attempt on the screen between the two main roles when we are presented with a close-up of Angela Jolie stroking Denzel Washington's finger with love . Maybe that's the only thing he could move, but I do not understand why the viewer sees a zoom on Washington's finger being caressed in the middle of the kind of dim lights and the appropriate music for a scene of sex is beyond me. I laughed aloud and shook my head. <br /> <br /> The orientation of the plot borrows a lot from Se7en, but it is executed here in a much simpler and much too obvious way. It would be an understatement, it's really just a movie made for television and even Jolie's and Washington's efforts can not convince it's a box office movie.
