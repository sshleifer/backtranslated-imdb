I have seen a lot of movies over the years and I am a big fan of comedies. <br /> <br /> But this so-called comedy almost made me cry. This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen, the worst. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing about this movie from a friend and I decided to watch it. If I could, I could go back in time, I would do it. I will regret as long as I live, the time I have lost looking at this garbage. <br /> <br /> The story is so crazy; it makes no sense and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish crowd and a German headhunter who are after Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish crowd after $ 50,000 and the Germans after his head. <br /> <br /> takes the form of many disguises. But by doing so, we are witnessing some of the most annoying, the worst, the most insane acts, dialogues and sounds in the history of cinema. This film made me so angry; in the end I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I had lost so much time watching a movie that would surely lead people who were depressed to an almost certain suicide. How can there be hope when a film like this can be licensed? <br /> <br /> I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people really love it. . Why? What is funny about a man who is annoying from the first to the last minute? A man who can not act? Who has an annoying voice and a confused face? <br /> <br /> I sat through it, thinking that the movie would be better, that would surely be the case. He does not have. Usually, you want the good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans or the Scottish crowd to find and kill The Pest, anything that could get me out of my misery. There is nothing fun, interesting or normal in this movie, it's just annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead even before they are told. I'm sorry for the cameramen who have no say in how the film is shot, but who actually film this driv. I would not be surprised if they receive advice. <br /> <br /> If you want to stay sane and part of society, my advice is to never watch this movie. I would prefer to lock myself in my room for 5 weeks without food or water rather than watching this movie again! <br /> <br /> I do not think I'll ever hate anything else.
