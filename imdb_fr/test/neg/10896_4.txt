There is something going on in this movie made by X-Files scribe John Shiban that has escaped me. As the film progresses, you get the impression that everything is not what it seems, but I have the impression that the film does not leave you enough so that you can really worry about it. It's a question of perception. There are characters that the heroine Nicole (Jaimie Alexander) meets in the film, she talks about it and disappears. It may sound like a spoiler, but it's something that really does not get much from the filmmakers. They seem to make fun of us while we are curious to know whether to trust what Nicole sees or not. This never gives a correct answer and, for my part, I was not at all aware. There is a moment in a film where ambiguity can be frustrating, because the viewer is guided in a wild goose chase that ends in a dead end with little explanation about what we have just seen . It is ultimately an exhausting rather than exciting exercise. psycho-drama. There is nothing wrong with the ambiguity itself, but give us something to stick to otherwise you will escape. That's what I felt when I watched "Rest Stop Stop". This film is about a young woman named Nicole who decides to go to California with her lover Jesse (Joey Mendicino) to succeed in Hollywood. They do what is supposed to be a slight detour to a rest stop so that Nicole can pee, but it deeply terrorizes her when she discovers that Jesse is completely missing. Someone in a crusty and dusty yellow truck is a job that seems to be causing a lot of trouble for Nicole, and we soon realize that he's causing Jesse's disappearance when things start to happen, signs will be given to him if you want, she will find it a way out of a very difficult situation. Nicole is far from any existing city and has limited resources to defend herself against a maniac who provides him with strong evidence of the harm he may have. <br /> <br /> This is the easy part. When a female character comes on the scene, the film makes a really strange jump in logic because we do not know where it comes from, or how it arrived there, and especially where it goes when Nicole will try to free herself from his alleged prison. in the bathroom toilet cabinet. She meets another, a police officer in the area (Joey Lawrence), who may appear to be his savior, but when he is also a victim of the surprising truck driver, there are still things that ask him if he was ever even there to start. The driver of the truck is committing torture to Nicole (like throwing her in the toilet and trying to untie a thread that the killer has wrapped around the door lock, she gets a nasty bite from him). He then sets the toilet on fire, leaving it without sustainable refuge for the beast. <br /> <br /> This is the moment when the driver of the truck attacks the moment that awaits him. Maybe he just likes to torment her, but it seems appropriate in some situations where Nicole has time to escape or get ready. It does not make much sense, its motivations, that propel the film into an illogical idea. Why is it so obvious? Why does he allow him to prepare? It seems, and I'm going too far here, that he likes to make believe in his career that she can find a way to escape just to escape this hope in his next macabre attack. Yet why does Shiban decide to play with the viewer by involving Nicole in strange encounters with people who do not exist? What does Shiban and the editorial team try to say? And to top off the uncontrolled strangeness of the film, there is a family in a VR. They play a small role in the order of things as religious bigots themselves, but the film does not do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this movie.
