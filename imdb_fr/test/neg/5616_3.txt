For my part, I was expecting the film to be pretty good, maybe my expectations were a little too high, but the fact is that I love Judd Nelson. In fact, it's the only reason this movie deserves to be watched and its role is not really great. The main highlights of this film are hot sex scenes and boring dialogues. If these are the highlights, I'm sure you'll have a pretty good idea of ​​what kind of film it is. There is certainly a reason for this film to be made for television. See it only if you have nothing better to do on Friday night or if you just like to waste money on video rentals. Save time and rent the Breakfast Club!
