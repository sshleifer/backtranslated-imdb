Guys, what can I tell you? I am Bulgarian. I do not remember how many times I spoke to Americans and not to mention that they did not know where Bulgaria was at all, but they said things like, "There is a war there. , not true?" or "I never imagined that, in a place like Bulgaria, people have Internet" Go to look at "The man with the cried brain" of Bruce Campbell. I was curious about this movie, because 1) I'm a fan of Bruce Campbell - the "Evil Dead" trilogy and "The Brisco County Jr. Adventures." 2) The film was shot entirely in Bulgaria, the second after "Alien Apocalypse", which is also almost unassailable. 3) I appreciate the good movies B <br /> <br /> Well ... The film presents our country as an endless Gypsy city where they attack your car, wave illegal weapons and can kill you at any time . And Bruce's line "Bull $ h1t Bulgaria" is more than shocking. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach form a great team, Bruce does his special - fight and that's it. Nothing more to see here. <br /> <br /> Peoeple gives this movie to 10 just because of Bruce's cult status, but he does not deserve more than 3. Wastage movie.
