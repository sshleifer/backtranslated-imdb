This film beats everything. It depends on what you are looking for ... it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. This film is in a category apart. I do not think a movie can get close to it. I'm not sure what the director wanted to do as ... thriller or comedy. If he thought he was doing a thriller, then, by a stroke of luck, he created one of the best Bollywood comedies of all time. You have to see it to believe it .. a matrix + terminator + a host of other movies, as well as a scenario going back to the hindi movies of the 1980s, with an icchadhari naag (a mythical snake that can turn into a human) . <br /> <br /> It's an ideal movie if you're sitting with a group of friends with alcohol on their side and you intend to laugh at the movie! I do not know whether to give him a 1 or a 10 .. On the basis of throwing a coin, I decided to give him a 1!
