As a fan of hospitals and medical salons, I found this one striking and sometimes funny (especially the scenes with Dr. Whitman) which brings a slight relief. However, I waited impatiently for the last episode because I was expecting the bad ones to be punished and the good ones to be reinstated. Instead, the management of the hospital is becoming more and more ridiculous and worse for the good ones. You can not help but wonder what the unions do or Rob, Donna and Maria do not know what the unions are for? In addition, never see the outside, the trees, the grass, the sun is a bit oppressive. Someone understood what were the last words? That is, Rob Lake's answer to Mrs. Strawberry's children: "Why are you telling us all this?" It was very frustrating not being able to understand it.
