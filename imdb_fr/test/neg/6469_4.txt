this movie was not good. I thought it would be a nice Disney movie, just like the original. false. it was embarrassing for christina ricci, to whom I expect much more than that, it's just to watch. I think doug e. Doug did his best. sit in front of children ages 5 and up, and they could start falling asleep.
