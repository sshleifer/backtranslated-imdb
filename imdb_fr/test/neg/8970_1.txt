I will never forget, ever, watching this show around the age of 13. Even at a young age, I remember thinking: "It's a Baywatch scam show without the only thing that makes it tolerable." Girls in swimsuits. Nevertheless, I was too small at the time to hold the remote control at home. The highlight of Pacific Blue was an episode in which two dishonest gangsters hit someone with machine guns ... on a bike !!! At thirteen, I never laughed so much about something that needed to be taken seriously. Even me, I knew that going out and acquiring Uzis (for murder) is a task that should never be accomplished until you have borrowed someone's car for the day. This had been the defining moment of this show. Simple crimes and custom situations using written writings to be treated by the unsung hero of the world of crime, The Bike Cop. Do not get much Dumber.
