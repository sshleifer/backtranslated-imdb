The sound in this film is a nightmare. That's the best I can say for this film. Any chance of a good story is lost once the movie starts. The premise of the film sounds good. A playboy who is reconciled with his entourage. The plot is predictable and very dull. The wet t-shirt contest is perhaps the worst scene I've ever seen and almost deserves to be viewed as part of a Mystery Science transaction. The sound is sometimes difficult to hear and the main actor seems to be unable to speak clearly. His accent makes it very difficult to understand. The only brilliant sport is Penelope Ann Miller's acting. Her role is underdeveloped but she plays it well. In short, do not waste your time.
