This film, directed by the sensational French Patrick Sebastien, is worse than all the turkeys you've seen. Forget the Independence Day, Kazaam, The Patriot, etc. ... you get the picture, this one is the pit. Sebastian is a TV celebrity in France (if you need an equivalent, let's say he's Jerry Springer with a I.Q of 13), this is his first film, let's hope he's the last one. I hope that Troma or someone will distribute this film in the United States, so that you can enjoy the worst smell of the French. Short Coupons, this is S ** t's masterpiece.
