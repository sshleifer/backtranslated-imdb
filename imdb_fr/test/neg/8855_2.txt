Dramatic drama? Emotionally powerful? BLA bla! The BBC has lost a lot of time in front of masterly productions such as The Wire, Sopranos and Carnivale from HBO. Okay, the budget may be much smaller, but last night The Street was bad, predictable, unrealistic, stereotyped, insensitive, and wasted a lot of time. Television (British television) is not as good as it was and it falls further and further behind the American productions. <br /> <br /> There was no brutal violence on the part of the "local gangster". There was no indication that this man was "crazy" enough to hit a man he had respected for so long. There was no remorse when he did it and it should not be the kind of character that would be overthrown when Bob Hoskins called his son a pansy, in a demonstration of "courage". <br /> <br /> I wish I was more eloquent to express my disdain for this show, but I am not so and although I can not prove it well enough, believe me when I say that c was nil, shock TV, that he does not give a true inner perspective of life. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
