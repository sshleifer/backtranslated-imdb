Susan inadvertently falls on a network of drug trafficking while her real estate agent is thrown off a wheel by driving her home. The leader of this group of drug addicts, Mongo (who only has one week before retiring) thinks she knows much more than this bubbly blonde is trying to make sure she will not say anything to nobody. I sat there. <br /> <br /> All actors in this film can not really play in the least. Susan makes a pretty ineffective hero for most of the movie (she would never escape several times except that apparently everyone in the movie wants to make love to her) and she does not take it offensive than the last 20 minutes of the film. When she does, she launches a generic word "I'm fed up", preach on sister, that same thought crossed my mind several times when I watched this <br /> <br /> My note: D -
