After watching "Still Life", a short film directed by Jon Knautz, I was really excited about his first film, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer. "Still Life" captured the essence and feel of an episode of "The Twilight Zone" and I could not wait to see what Knautz could do by tackling the genre of horror comedy. The campy nature of the name and promotional material suggested something like "Evil Dead" or "Army of Darkness"; a fun and bloody 1980s horror movie with lots of monsters. Although this is what Knautz was looking for, he fails to capture the fun or entertaining value of these films. <br /> <br /> The problem of "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is that he is totally lacking in understanding. what made these comedies of horror, which he tries to evoke, so great in the first place. Two-thirds of the race time is focused on the film's hero Jack Brooks, a plumber and student, as he goes to class and tries to cope with his uncontrollable outbursts. There is virtually no monster in sight for most of the film, barely a drop of blood or the slightest attempt of horror. Even if "Evil Dead" or "Dead Alive" had been eliminated later, they would still be entertaining. "Jack Brooks" is not. It's just boring, which is the worst thing a movie of this nature can be. Jack Brooks himself is not very interesting, at least not enough to justify the time he spends on the screen. All you need to know about him is revealed in the first ten minutes of the film. From that moment on, every time he does not hit a monster's mouth (and he rarely does), he's not worth watching. The film goes nowhere, follows him in psychiatric sessions and argues with his classmates. <br /> <br /> Finally, things start again. Jack Brooks fights against some monsters, some heads are crushed, some humans are slaughtered, then it's over. Just like that. All in the space of about fifteen minutes. It's fifteen good minutes. The monsters are all quite inventive (and completely in camera) and there are some excellent gore gags (the best being a crushed zombie head), but after spending at least seventy-five minutes of pure boredom, fifteen minutes just do not cut it. <br /> <br /> That's all there is to it. I could talk about acting well enough (especially the horror icon Robert Englund in a non-traditional role) and the fact that creature prosthetics are a nice step back, at the time where the movies did not use CGI, but it really does not work. It does not matter. "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is quite boring and although Jon Knautz obviously has the talent to create a good movie (again, the last fifteen minutes are murderers and "Still Life" was amazing? Watch it) , "Jack Brooks" completely misses the target. It has its successes (acting, makeup), but these do not change the fact that it's not very fun at all. The screening I attended had the presence of the director and the cast. One information that I retained is that a sequel was in development and that this time, it would be more focused on the fight against the monsters than on "the creation of a hero". My advice: skip this one and wait for the rest.
