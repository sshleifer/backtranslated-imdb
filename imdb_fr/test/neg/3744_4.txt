There is potential in there with "do not tell anyone". A curious and intriguing plot, and a French takes a very American history. But for me, opportunities have not been exercised here. <br /> <br /> Although I liked some aspects of this film, there were three notable failures that brought it down to four out of ten. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a mystery of stupid murder and clich√©. A particularly artificial murder She wrote or Bergerac. Being French does not eliminate this problem - it's just silly and French at the same time. It's full of incredible coincidences. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the passage from the United States to France seems to have failed chronically. This French doctor hangs out in the "streets" of a French city with his new "buddies" and their blingis SUVs ... and then there are car chases ... <br /> <br /> But third and especially, it's too long. For me, a movie needs a good reason to be well above 90 minutes, and more than two hours requires serious justification. This time he did not have it.
