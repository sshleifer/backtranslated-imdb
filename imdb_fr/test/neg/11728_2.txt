Movie totally forgettable but an incredible soundtrack: I would give it (soundtrack) a 9 out of 10. I have the CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is superb! I saw the movie years ago and had to check with IMDb to find out what it was. I'm obsessed with getting the soundtrack and have since had to replace it. It goes from blues / soul / ballad to a dose of gospel. All songs are written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren, the "other" lead guitarist alongside Steve Van Zandt of E Street Band. This guy can play! The voices are managed by Nils (he can not sing very well, too rough), Bonnie Sheridan (a great singer) and Tom Lepson.
