I once rented this movie with my sister in the hope of seeing a good, fun, entertaining film, but my expectations were disappointed. This film was beyond disgusting and disgusting for a PG-13 movie, it should have been rated R for the many mature references that were cited in this movie. I would not recommend a 13 year old to see this. <br /> <br /> Even if no one under the age of 17 is watching this movie, beware of a really stupid movie, there is no humor in the movie, just a bunch of sexual references disgusting including a touch of pedophilia, something that should not even be joking. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what happened to the PG-13 movies, which were really safe for a 13 year old? It's beyond a deplorable film and should be re-evaluated.
