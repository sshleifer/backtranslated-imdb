Looks like some of the previous reviews have seen another movie than I saw earlier tonight ... In fact, this movie is why I signed up for IMDb. Of course, Bobbie Phillips can "fight" and for that I give a 2, but the rest of this movie is just pure shit ... The acting is bad, the plot is bad, the angles are camera are bad, and the effects are bad. Of course, the actors are in good physical shape, but they can not act! Sometimes I like to watch bad movies for laughs, but this film has no charm and after watching this movie, I had a lot of regrets to see it. Of course, if you want to see mediocre battles with nothing else, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, stay away from this movie! PS: Sorry for the misspelling ... I'm just tired as the cause of this movie!
