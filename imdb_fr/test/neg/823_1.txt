Bean, Kevin & Perry, British television creations who have made their transition to the big screen. Now it's Ali G's turn and I'm afraid to say he's not one of them! <br /> <br /> Ali has always been obscene, but funny with that. This movie was extremely sick and not funny at all. Scenes of bestiality, gay sex and pedophilia should not be portrayed in the name of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Ali G In Da House is bad and deserves to make very little money. <br /> 1/10
