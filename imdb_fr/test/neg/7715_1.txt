I was working in a video store. I saw this title in the horror section and brought it home as a free rental one night. <br /> <br /> This movie was really horrible, it has no redeeming quality, because it is a respected subgenre of the movie and just about to destroy it. If the first film was not small enough budget, then this film really takes the biscuit, being housed (mainly) inside and at night ... thus avoiding the scenic setting of the costs of the first film In the first 5 minutes of this movie, a college A speaker runs comically on an attractive student. Rather than being mortified, the speaker apologizes in half, and the girl mentions that despite being ejected on the hood of the car (he accelerated as he approached her) there was nothing more to fear ... kill her! If this is not strange enough, he wants to perform an experiment on her, bringing her back from the dead ... and feels the need to take off her clothes to do it. <br /> <br /> Soft core female nudity (and pubic hair) is ubiquitous throughout the film and is, to be honest, the only thing to remember to interest the average male viewer ... as the scene of swimming in the first movie ... but that says the film goes from bad to worse with its bad character, its crappy dialogues and its absurd intrigues ... why introduce a pivotal character who survived 29 days of a zombies and who kills him within 10 minutes ... very bad movie
