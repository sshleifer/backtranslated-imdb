Well, they re-made a new movie with a pumpkin head, the first movie with a pumpkin head was perfect for his time, a silent monster movie, gore and cliche. So here's how it goes, someone loses their loved one, goes to the witch's house in the woods, makes her raise the pumpkin head and kill everyone responsible. Unfortunately, the filmmakers felt it was superfluous to try to do anything else, for the fourth release of the film, judging that it was much more appropriate to add a lame subplot of Romeo and Juliet, involving a silly family feud ( on a car !!!!) and surprise, surprise, some bloody murders of pumpkin heads, hitherto well calculated, but it does not stop there, the talent in this film is terrible ... oh, too bad , half of them can not even keep a southern accent without slipping into their native accents and often posher. Lance Henrikssen is on board. It will surely bring some gravity to the unfolding of the film ... but no spear is just scrolling on the screen, the words fall without emotion or apparent direction, and go back, I honestly think it comes He went the money, then went in his caravan to get drunk and reminisce aliens. <br /> <br /> this film is absolutely void, there is no other feature that redeems the end credits that signal everywhere. <br /> <br /> despite the failures of ph: bf ... if you want some evidence that will make you laugh for all the wrong reasons, look at it. <br /> <br /> if you want something with a little more meat and originality to avoid.
