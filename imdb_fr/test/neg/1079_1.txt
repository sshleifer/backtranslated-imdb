I must admit that I was against this film from the beginning, but I really did my best to be impartial, but the very idea of ​​redoing a sophisticated, witty, fun and original British classic must be dubious. <br /> <br /> In my home, people were watching this, so I swallowed my pride and thought that I had to be a professional with the movies (I studied them in Uni after all). <br /> <br /> As expected for such an American film, the film began with a chase that was not bad. Indeed, many action sequences are credible and that alone raises the mark. <br /> <br /> However, the characterization was abysmal, the editing parts could very easily have been dissociated from any American blockbuster that you could have had. woe to look at and lacked any character. <br /> <br /> Seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial flight, the American version makes the thing predictable and introduces an emotional factor with Donald's death. Sutherland's character. This offers our American cousins ​​plenty of opportunities for sycophant revenge with dew-covered eyes against the "criminals" they drag in producing predictable excesses. This is never more evident than in the scenes starring Charlize Theron (Oh pretty! Oh so pretty! Look at her pretty wounded eyes of Bambi, everyone!) That were completely nauseating. His entrance scene, in particular, looked like something from Resident Evil or Tomb Raider that were both a) more entertaining and b) had better debuts, as they could not miss a game as they could with British cinema that was already packed. spark, people for whom you really feel something and moments of inspiration. But I move away from the subject, the inclusion of a pretty girl seems to be the most difficult maneuver I have ever seen and exposes the cynical desire of Hollywood blockbuster for what it is. <br /> <br /> If you like one of these actors, by the way, and you agree with any of the comments above, do not go see this movie! Had I had the opportunity to watch "Fight Club" or "American History X" after seeing Ed Norton in this movie, I would have refused. Likewise, Jason Statham with 'Lock Stock' (and I guess 'The Transporter' is acceptable if you like that kind of thing). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all the sets are designed in the most transparent way possible to make you think, 'Wow! He is intelligent! He's cool! ',' Hey! What a tough thing! Then there is the "funny guy" who has a "comic relief" splashed on his forehead but whose content in humor can be anticipated two minutes in advance. To be honest, if you've seen one or two films like this, you can easily confuse the two as clones of the Jerry Bruckheimer stable. By the way, Jerry is not irreparably horrible, but he uses clichés to excess, as everyone knows (or should do). <br /> <br /> This is where I have to be honest. I have not managed to go all the way, so I can not even say if the brilliant ending of Michael Caine's version was winning, but, I'm sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare films who, if I 'After seeing it in the cinema, I would have gone out and organized a small demonstration outside. Ocean's 14 or something else (Ocean's Eleven is fine, but do not worry about the rest!) With all the glitz, glamor, faux sass and pantomime heroics of such a movie but I could not recognize anything from the original. <br /> <br /> So, if you expect 'THE Italian JOB' and not 'OCEAN'S 14', although poorly written with a cast and characters less well established, misleading elements and writing of cut cardboard scenario then DO NOT WATCH! It does not bother me that people like to have a little fun without thinking, but it's a criminal job that does not deserve in any way to be known as a classic. Seriously, show some pride! I felt perfectly justified in my outraged and disgusted reaction when I first learned that the film would be shot. To avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> P.S. Some action sequences are not bad at all, so add an extra "1" to the brand if you like that kind of thing.
