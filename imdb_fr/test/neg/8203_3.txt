A group of seven people fear being the only survivors of an H-bomb explosion in the near world. Not only do they fear radiation, but also mutants in the surrounding hill. One of the group members is already infected, but does not represent any real threat to others. The sub-plot only survives the rubs of matching personalities. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is about to play a tough guy. Lori Nelson is the girl destined to populate a new world. Not one of the best directors Roger Corman. It's predictable sci-fi in black and white.
