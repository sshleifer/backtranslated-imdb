Although there is much to recommend about Maetel Legend, both in the concept and in the finished product, it's a bad movie. In summary, it is a tale of Maetel's youth, which is generally not clear; at the same time, writers take advantage of it to tell the story of the machine empire. And as Leiji Matsumoto has trouble not including his other work, we get a starting point for his sister Emeraldas, his mother: the queen of La Metalle and a bit of Galaxy Express 999 to flesh out the film. <br /> <br /> In short, Maetel is a princess of the planet La Metalle, a planet with an irregular orbit, which means that her cycle around the nearest sun reaches a cold stage and her artificial sun is dying. The planet is becoming colder throughout history, increasing the feeling of unhappiness. In order to protect her subjects and her family, the queen decides that mechanization is the only way to ensure the survival of the people of La Metalle. Enter Lord Hardgear, a robot / cyborg that provides the means for the job. Through the film, the characters are left to the question of mechanization, will they still be human? Can we trust Hardgear? Do souls and hearts remain? So, for a fan of the work of Matsumoto, there are many things to savor, questions to solve, themes still relevant, except that it is obvious that the film is an introduction and a curiosity of the fans. The negatives, in the forefront of animation, while Galaxy Express 999, a television series that is more than 20 years old, has a mediocre animation and a sometimes sketchy character drawing, Maetel Legend has all the worst features of animation modern and gives a respectable air to Galaxy. Express 999. The drawing is very detailed, but unfortunately the animation has suffered, leaving well-drawn characters that "slide", as when moving the background or zoom of the camera, a means of animation quick. However, few well-animated scenes are reused in dream sequences, rehearsals, and extra scenes. Anyone who seems to have the film will wonder how often Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of wine. <br /> <br /> Following the story, although everything sounds good in theory, the finished product is actually a series of conversations of a plot that repeats itself over and over again with little effect, the number of times the characters encounter the same problems and learn the same things is practically insulting to the audience and characters, who seem to seem much more articulate in previous incarnations. Add to that a dreadful character design, which seems lifeless, too exaggerated, and the public is left with a film so badly managed that it could just as easily be rewritten as a different film, at least the newcomers would not not be puzzled. <br /> <br /> And yet, he really has his moments, the end of the least is surprising. The critical situation of the citizens of La Metalle was very touching and rightly disturbing; I think I find this whole human-machine theme painful. It is difficult to know who to recommend to Maetel Legend, because it is not well animated, written or executed, and creates confusion once the obligatory cross-referencing of Leiji Matsumoto is introduced. However, I can not help but cheer up when the magnificent entrance of Three-Nine occurs, it is now a good cinema. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars out of 5, 2 if you're a fan.
