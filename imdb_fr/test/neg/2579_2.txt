Steven Seagal's intention is to be commended, and his role in this film is equal to that of many others, if you ignore the fact that he is supposed to portray a brilliant scientist. The problem I had was with two elements of the plot, which extended my suspension of disbelief beyond breaking point. <br /> <br /> First of all, how is it that a carefully crafted variation on a bad germ, whose antidote must be just as carefully studied and developed by a large laboratory, is he healed while drinking tea from a flower growing high in the mountains? and this grandfather's family seems to be pretty much the only person who knows about this? <br /> <br /> Second, and this one really takes the cake: Having gathered enough remedies to repair an entire city, I would not want you to expect the army to drop the helicopter and is starting to send bags of flowers to every house in this small town? No, instead, they decide to water the flowers all over the city and force the sick to go out and pick them up again. Quite stupid, unless, according to Aboriginal belief, the power of the drug depends on the person who went for the flowers themselves. <br /> <br /> Add to this the hard character of the bad guys and the unsuitability of the title, and you might think that my vote on this movie is high.
