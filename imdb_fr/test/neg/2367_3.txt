no issue in 2007 was really bad and if it's the road of struggle, they would choose the wrong road. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit and the hardy boys of MVP & Minn: in my opinion, it was the best match of the night some good struggles here but not much. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Open Cruiser Championship (won by Guerrero Chavo): awful, not at all a thief, really fast and boring. 3/10 <br /> <br /> little bastard & Finlay def little bogueman & the bogueman: it was more a comedy than a fight, a few laughs. Kane def King Booker: a decent effort of these two, but they could do better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> The wwe tag team championship Paul London and Brian Kendrick have defeated their opponents: another boring game, no big flight from the champions. 4/10 <br /> <br /> World title ecw Mr. Kennedy def Bobby Lashley (disquilification): For me, the worst game of the night. really horrible.I thought the ecw was not a rule, I was wrong 2/10 <br /> <br /> john cena and Shawn Michaels defeated Batista and the gasman: a decent match but could have been much better 6/10 <br /> <br /> all in all, it was bulls * it gave me a 3/10
