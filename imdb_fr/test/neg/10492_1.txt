Imagine what it must have been for John Agar. One of the handsome Hollywood executives. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He finds himself making movies like this one. I remember him in "Tarantula" where he was not so bad. Unfortunately, nothing recommends this movie. The monster is mute uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. Teens are boring. The plot is stupid. People are running everywhere. There are events that do nothing to advance the plot. There is dancing going on, and then there is no attack. There is a silly love triangle that no one can care less about. It's not even camper or scandalous. It's just that it's worthless. Agar could just as easily have been a post. He did not give anything to do.
