Although the design, the locations and the photography are important assets in this film It is the affair of the use of the music of the soundtrack: a mixture of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber which plays constantly and strong. , and would have made Max Steiner wince because of its excessive use, because it tells the public how difficult it is; how ecstatic; as he is tortured to be an artist. And then it really counts the story elides the details in the end. <br /> <br /> This increased and kitschy exploitation of emotions was once ridiculed by Peter Ackroyd about a book by Yukio Mishima: It's not written, it's Barbara Cartland. One can make exactly the same criticism of this film: a deceptive and mawkish vanity project.
