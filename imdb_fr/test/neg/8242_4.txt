I've always loved Carry On movies, with their two-way sexual innuendo dialogues and zany comedy moments, but I understand why critics think it's two stars. Basically, many Britons get together on a bus to Spain on an island called Elsbels at the Palace Hotel. What they did not know is that the building is not completely built and they have to share the same bathroom with their neighbors, they have bullshit draws, and many other complications and complaints about the owner Pepe (Peter Butterworth, putting a fun enough accent). for example, peace is like the bad word P). With Sid James in Vic Flange, Kenneth Williams in Stuart Farquhar, Charles Hawtrey in Eustace Tuttle, Joan Sims in Cora Flange, Barbara Windsor in Sadie Tomkins, Kenneth Connor in Stanley Blunt, a shit apparently (I do not remember who he is ) Jimmy Logan as Bert Conway, June Whitfield as Evelyn Blunt, Hattie Jacques as Floella (a ridiculous character, not as memorable as his usual matron), Bernard Bresslaw as brother Bernard, Sally Geeson as Lily, Carol Hawkins as Marge, Jack Douglas as Harry and Patsy Rowlands as Miss Dobbs. I admit it's not great, but there's just enough gags of dialogue, and of course Babs in the shower, and going to his ass with this iconic whistle, and later a quick tear of his bra. Okay!
