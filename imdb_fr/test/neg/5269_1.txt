"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is somehow based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, who was already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film "The General". Cahill had a rough education in a slum and went from petty crime to armed robbery with honors. He justified his criminal career by emphasizing each time he had the trouble. This is a common excuse for criminals who easily forget the thousands of slum dwellers who do not try to rob post offices and sell guns to make ends meet. Cahill mocked the police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which earned him the status of "folk hero" and also earned him many enemies. However, he was basically an amoral and selfish thief. <br /> <br /> My main problem with "ODC" is that the protagonist is made to be an adorable Irish thug. Kevin Spacey does a good job portraying Michael Lynch with a mixture of oily charm and silent threat, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be perceived as a kind of hero, even an anti-hero. <br /> <br /> The film is well shot and well played by a beautiful cast, but what escapes is the scenario. The writer Gerard Stembridge can not decide; Does he write an Irish "Stock Lock" or a harsher treatment of Martin Cahill's thief career? This is the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. <br /> <br /> It is also unfortunate that "ODC" followed the film release of John Boorman's "The General", which more accurately represents the story of Martin Cahill. Cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity. It is therefore not surprising that his exploits were treated like movies. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that a studio was prepared to take Cahill's story and give it a happy ending to Hollywood. Kevin Spacey's charismatic-bigamist-scintillating thief, Michael Lynch, manages to remain anonymous on his bike in "ODC". In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA simply to prove that no one is making fun of the obsolete, sectarian and corrupt para-military organization and is getting away with it. <br /> <br /> The real Cahill would never have left his notoriety, because it reinforced his self-image "Man of the people". Asking Michael Lynch to give up everything to avoid death in "ODC" is a reversal that results in a weak, superficial film.
