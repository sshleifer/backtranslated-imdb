I bought this DVD for my young son who loves ToyStory movies. I did not expect it to be in the same league as the Toystory movies, but what I got was just another lazy cartoon from Disney, far below what I expected from Disney / Pixar. The story is not original, the characters are sad and two-dimensional, the animation is below average, even Buzz is not so good. The film could have been so much better. I particularly hated the painting by numbers script. I know it's for kids, but even kids know that something stinks at this level of lameness. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed some aspects of the film, I really liked the first part of the movie, with the mutant monster slag, it just went downhill from there.
