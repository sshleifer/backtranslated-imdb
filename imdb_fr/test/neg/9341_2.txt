I grew up in the 90s; Therefore, you must understand that I have witnessed first-hand the prime ministers of the larger DCOMs. I was there when Brink! appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc., These films constitute my childhood. When these films are aired, not only myself, but those with whom I watch them would remain completely amazed for an hour and a half; talk about it for the week ahead and pick it up the next weekend. I do not think words can express the excitement of Zoog Disney. <br /> <br /> Even when I look at them now, the dialogue does not seem so bad (so effective in fact that I actually remember parts of conversations word by word, taken from films I saw there is more than ten years old). The characters are credible, funny, a bit stereotypical, but that's what makes Disney so charming ... <br /> <br /> I sit my little brother in front of the Disney channel to try to transmit him and to make him understand my feelings. for DCOMs. Enter stuck in the suburbs ... my brother looked at me slightly perplexed, wondering if I had always been gay. I feel more disappointed and betrayed now than, how could I compare that ?, when Han Solo discovered that Lando had sold it to Vader ... <br /> <br /> Half of the movie, and I do not exaggerate, is flashbacks. There is no talent in these young actors (some of whom are older than me). The plot is ridiculous; it seems like a group of old disintegrating companies at Disney sat around a table and wondered, "How can we look hip for these kids?" OK, maybe all DCOMs were like that, but they at least made a little effort not to let us realize that they think we are complete idiots. <br /> <br /> And apparently, this type of movie works ... Stuck in the Suburbs is almost as qualified as Zenon or Airborne. How is it possible? DCOMs have even more taste and people prefer them now? (Although apparently lack of cursed words is enough to give 10/10 to some people) Christ is a completely different generation.
