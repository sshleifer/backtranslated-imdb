Apparently, the writer and director of this DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday the 13th and other summer camp slashers. This film has it all - a group of teens who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned holiday camp called "Camp Blood", the old man who tells them not to go; and of course, the mad machete killer who continues to hit teenagers for no reason ... It could have worked if it had been shot on 35mm film with acceptable special effects. But on the contrary, the special effects are poorly made. The killer walks around as if he was out on Sunday afternoon, and the only benefit of this movie is the acting of the talented lead actress and the early sex scene. Other than that - dull and forgettable. Jasper P. Morgan
