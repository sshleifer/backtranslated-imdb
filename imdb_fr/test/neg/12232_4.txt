When I saw The Comebacks trailer for the first time, it looked absolutely horrible and I had no interest in seeing it, but when it came out on DVD today, I thought that nothing else interested me, I praised it and gave it a blow. I watched it and it was really not so bad. I think it was sometimes immature and stupid, but there were some fun moments that made me laugh. I do not watch a lot of movies about sports, so I was wondering if I could see more, maybe this movie would make more sense to me, but that's good, it did not bother me so much to watch The Comebacks . I admit that these "stupid parodic" movies are lame, but what harm is there to do in a stupid joke from time to time? The Comebacks is not that bad if you give it a chance. <br /> <br /> Fields coach fails in life, family and career, but when offered a chance to bring his career back to life if he can bring a looser football team into the championship. But the team is really terrible, beyond terrible. But with a little work and team effort, they try to give everything, even if it could turn into something sadder. <br /> <br /> The Comebacks is not the worst film I've seen, I think it's good for a couple laughs and laughs. I knew it was stupid, but I could not help laughing when the coach came in the middle of a fight in the locker room and he hit the nerd's head against the locker, just him and the nerd in general were so funny together. If you have an open mind and do not take this film too seriously, I think you'll have fun watching it, if you watch it wait for it like an Oscar-winning film, this movie is not made for you. <Br /> <br /> 4/10
