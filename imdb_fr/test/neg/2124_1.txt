There is really not much to say about it. It's really, really bad. The acting is bad, the script is bad and editing is probably one of the worst tasks of all time. It's so sloppy and hectic that it only serves to confuse the public. There is no real plot we can talk about, it's mostly a monster fish that looks like a fake that attacks Europeans trying to pretend to be Americans. Pass on this one.
