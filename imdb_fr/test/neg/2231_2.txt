I rented this movie, knowing it would be bad (I only saw one good suite at Disney and it was the story of toy 2), but it went well beyond my expectations . I am a fan of Disney and I just do not believe in Disney movie suites. For someone who has not grown up with the classics (either look at them when they are out, or rent them since your birth), it's a cute story. I just have the impression that the plot was too dragged and that it was too predictable. What bothered me most was the voices of the lady and hobo girls. They were too sharp. Although most critics say it's not that bad, I think if you're a real fan of Disney, you should not waste your time with this one. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that Disney will not do as many more sequels to any of the other classics from time to time.
