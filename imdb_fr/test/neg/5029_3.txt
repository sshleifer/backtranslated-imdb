The film is nothing more than an exhibition of nudity. Has anyone noticed that the three main female characters appear naked? It seems that the only winning bet for Portuguese filmmakers is to include a little (if not a lot) of the nudity of local stars, as well as the slang that, in the current Portuguese society, is repulsed with horror. If you watch Portuguese TV commercials on Portuguese TV, they have all included a "hot" scene from the movie. I do not say absolutely that Portuguese society is alienated; just that the film industry does not seem able to find other ways to succeed. To return to the film ... There is nothing left of the spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece. The film could have been good if it had been stressed the true idea of ​​the book (news at any time) and not the strictly erotic part. There were almost all the ingredients ... but the "chef" was awful ...
