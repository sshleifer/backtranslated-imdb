Let's see ... a dozen gags by Gary Larson, as well as his illustrative style, a wholesale appropriation eventually legally difficult of a character of Aardman, a more than generous token of the artistic direction of various Pixar films , positively villains of the Lion King in what amounts to a cemetery of elephants IN THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY OF THE FARM, oh, and to a stinking joke Riverdance ten years after all possible relevance. The kids (three and five) enjoyed it, but damn it was a blow to dad. Just another weak attempt by Nickelodean Films to focus on the explosion of animation. I really would have liked them to spend a little more money on character design, for rendering, for a screenplay, for a director.
