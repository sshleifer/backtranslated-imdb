In fact, I went into this film with certain expectations, not because I thought the film sounded particularly good, but because I'm a fan of Italian exploitation films and that the cast shows Franco Nero and Telly Savalas to Oliver Twist's sides, I figured I had to be interesting at least. Well ... RedNeck has one or two positive things, but most of the time; It's a dull and lifeless film, as ridiculous as it is useless. The plot simply focuses on two criminals (Nero and Savalas) who kidnap a young child (Oliver). The problem is that the child realizes that he will have more fun if he is accepted into the "gang". Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors who have proven that they can wear a film themselves on many occasions. They lived memorable moments in this film, although it was for the wrong reasons. Savalas in particular gives an idiotic image of the "bad" criminal. The plot does not unfold badly, but as nothing interesting happens, it is not really a positive point and it does not prevent the film from being mediocre. Overall, I can not recommend this movie. it may appeal to some for its cult value but it did not do anything to me.
