What annoys me with such "scientific" programs is that they are presented as if it was a fact that dinosaurs lived millions of years ago. First, no one can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that Earth has millions / billions of years. It is a superficial theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with enormous assumptions advanced in the pot of evolution. <br /> <br /> Secondly, no one can prove that the evolution took place. All the missing links of Darwin are always MISSING! If you look at all the fossils, whether on or in the ground, they are complete animals of a certain type, for example: a dog or a cat. Nobody has ever found the skeleton of a dog turning into a cat or the example presented in this series, a dinosaur turning into a bird. <br /> <br /> It's hogwash. There is more evidence of Santa's existence than of any animal converted to another type of animal. <br /> <br /> All the ideas presented in this series attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and its content have been created. <br /> <br /> This series is NOT SCIENCE. It is a religious vision of the world that hides under the banner of science. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you see here is SCIENCE FICTION. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a science fiction show that has the decency to admit it's a sci-fi show, look instead at Star Trek or Star Wars.
