Let's see. What irritated me the most? The very long dance scene at first, watching people turn so much around me that I felt dizzy ... Without even showing where the music came from ... It's all part of a university graduation that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Or maybe it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than necessary. What a drag this movie is. And the most annoying thing is that the bad guys are so mean, so horribly evocative that it seems that the director is making this film for the sophomores. "These people are mean ... These people are good." Whenever a movie has its agenda-heart on its sleeve, I'm out of me. There is a scene in a skating rink that seems totally out of place. Long love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute who looks more like a rock star and her sexy groupie. The character of John Hurt, who is part of the scene that starts early, drinks and disagrees with the exaggerated villains. His scene of death could very well be the most stupid in history. And I hear everyone, even the enemies of this film, talk about the beauty of cinematography. I think it looks faded. Watch "Days of Heaven" if you want to see beautiful backyards. This movie is even worse than the anti-hype. It's useless. The epilogue, showing the main character of a yacht, was almost as dumb as the prologue. Battle scenes are tedious and dizzying. This movie is really bad. Avoid it unless you like bad movies because it's the king of them.
