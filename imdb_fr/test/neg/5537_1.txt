How, in the name of decency, was this film ever made? <br /> <br /> Suppose the subtitles are content to say "awful" on every frame of this really lamentable effort. <br /> <br /> A dramatic game, a lamentable dialogue and the lack of talent of all those involved. nightmare make atrocious 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall impression? <br /> <br /> A group of exciting drama students were lucky with a lottery grant and proceeded to make one of the most painful films ever made. <br /> <br /> This gives Hammer Horror's television series an air of Oscar material. <br /> <br /> And do not believe for a second that this falls into the category "so bad that it's good". It's not even so bad. <br /> <br /> But the lighting scene with fart is probably worth another look.
