Margaret Mitchell turns in her grave every time someone looks at this mess! The elaborate costumes and sets can not even begin to overwhelm the mediocre performances of Joanne Whalley (as main character) and Timothy Dalton (as Rhett). Even worse than the acting game - and perhaps partially explaining it - is the scenario, which is surprisingly clich√© and predictable. Add to this diabolical scenario a score that will make you crack, and you get a disaster that I would not want to see any spectator. SCARLETT is incredibly ugly, and I can not imagine how it was done, let alone video.
