As a serious horror fan, some marketing ploys are used to sell movies, especially the very bad ones. So, I would not call that naivety that I assumed it was a softcore horror that was tearing the Cannibal / Zombie / Jungle Holocaust. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong because it's very hardcore. I should have realized that when I saw the strange warning "No real or identifiable minor was used". Notice the identifiable part as if it defies us to catch it? A group of scientists, half of whom are pretty women in bikinis, are led by a marine captain, leaning for 69 on the beach, looking for a mutinous villager who kills. Due to the explosion of a nuclear bomb on an island supposedly evacuated, radiation has turned the latter man into a rapist / murderer. <br /> <br /> Writer / actor George Eastman is the only one to hit the scene and manages to keep his clothes. The sex scenes are destroyed. The women walk naked, bloodless with a strange overconfidence, and one of them even asks for rape when her husband refuses it. Well, two slapping girls naturally turn into a lesbian scene because women are horndogs. I saw the girl throwing another babe salad and a finger herself. <br /> <br /> If there is anything you should know about this movie, that's it. Because the rest of this senseless movie is exactly the same. Oh, who am I kidding? There are many other things to tell here. Like the white "Duchess" who pays 2 blacks to accompany him in a living room. Or the "Duchess" who takes off her top to use as a bandage when the captain cuts himself off. When he refuses his advances, she begins to cry. So being the good gentleman he is, he lets her reluctantly make him happy in front of the other members of the crew. I was honestly waiting for the pizza delivery man and the "duchess" who asked him if there was another way to pay him. <br /> <br /> And all this happens before they leave for the island search. Wait, I thought it was a zombie movie? But the zombie does not enter before the 73 minute mark, but by then all the others have been "numerous". I found myself moving quickly a few scenes or more. This is my first porn movie splashing and I do not think it does justice to everyone. I guess it's the woman in me who talks when I say I'd like more sex and less sweaty, slobbery, hairy sex. The funny thing is that it could have worked like a decent horror movie as the idea of ​​atomic bombing to turn a bitter man into a man and kill his family was a good idea. Even the Eastman character shakes his head and walks away from a copulating couple. I wonder if it's the character or the writer himself who was disgusted. <br /> <br /> I do not want to get into the quality of the sound or movie because you already guessed it was bad. This production was shot in parallel with 3 other films, including Erotic Nights of the Living Dead, which presents most of the actors. Eastman said it was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a salary. No matter, I want to talk about the sound suddenly. The sound was strange during the sex scenes because, while the actors were speaking Italian, it seems that they recorded voiceovers in English and that they played this during their dialogue. So, while 2 people are boning, I can clearly hear someone in the background saying, "No, yes, wonderful! Wait!" There was a slightly amusing Italian score that could not save this movie. The SFX was at best minimal and consisted of a little blood in only a few scenes. And I would like to point out that there have been no violent rape scenes as indicated by the brilliant warning label on the DVD cover (ahem, another marketing ploy), so do not be afraid. Do not be afraid of the bad movie. <br /> <br /> Presented in Widescreen 1.85: 1 format. I watched the 113 min Region 1 Not Rated version released in 2005 by Exploitation Digital. There is apparently a XXX version of Alfa Digital, which has the same runtime, so I doubt everything is different. Prices vary, but you should not pay more than $ 25.00 for a copy. Or, as I would recommend, pay nothing and pretend it did not exist. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quote: Shipmate, "Civilians are bad luck, women are bad luck, they are scientists, they really must be monsters." DVD Extras: Original trailer with plans and hardcore scenes to make the movie more interesting, trailers from SS Hell Camp, Emmanuelle and ENOTLD, and very informative interview with Eastman. <br /> <br /> Blade porn, but still weaker than a horror movie. Either real porn or look real horror. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 by Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com
