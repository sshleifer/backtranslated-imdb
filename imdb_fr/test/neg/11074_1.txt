The person who wrote the summary and the rave reviews of this film is either an idiot or a big fan of shitty movies. From the beginning, it was about the cheap scam of "The Descent", a much superior movie that certainly does not start slowly. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of "The Cavern", I was amazed at how bad, uninspired and unoriginal it was, how poorly written, misunderstood and misdirected. This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life, and that says a lot, whereas I recently suffered from "Pulse". I can not believe that this trash has been rewarded, which proves that the quality of marijuana and other illicit drugs is much better in Australia and other countries than in the United States. <br /> <br /> The scenes where the group fleeing the "creature" are misdirected, especially the delayed "camera upside down", intended to show disorientation, but only occurring as a cheap effect that a student in first-year cinema would be properly revered teacher. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this "director" will probably make other films, probably of the same mediocre quality as this "film", because I'm sure he did not learn his mistakes, which on this picture were excessive. <br /> <br /> If I could manage, all the players and team members would be sent to the river for life without the possibility of parole. This film is a crime against humanity.
