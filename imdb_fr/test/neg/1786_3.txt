This movie begins as every movie should begin, with a group of hot girls in a dorm that wander in underwear and / or topless. Two of them take a shower. I love it so far! Unfortunately, we then meet some main characters. They are not particularly friendly. Usually, in these movies, the actresses do not really play, they give very "natural" performances, and they are rather friendly, fun and friendly. Not here. They do not have a lot of personality and I did not like them very much. <br /> <br /> Some girls go camping at school. Along the way, they stop at a gas station and meet a group of bikers. The biker gang really should have been left out of the movie - it was nerdy before, but now it's just stupid. The chief biker looks like a middle-aged guy disguised as John Bon Jovi for Halloween. The girls go to the woods and later the group of bikers follows them. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what happens next. There is a lot about the end of the world because it's the end of the millennium, so some bikers are killed by a mysterious Indian guy who continues to disappear. Someone gets eaten by a Lock Ness monster cheese thing while swimming on a lake. A stupid-looking guy is apparently a druid, and he has to sacrifice some of the girls to prevent the end of the world. Or maybe because of the end of the world, I'm afraid not to be very careful. He first dresses girls with lingerie skin animal. <br /> <br /> It could have been a fun movie, but the biker gang spoiled the atmosphere and the plot was so scattered that it did not live up to my expectations of class Z schlock . They really should have eliminated half of the plot elements and focused on one or two points. Instead, it's everywhere. All in all, if you're looking for the late 80s, I guess you could do worse. If you really tried. There is a lot of nudity at the beginning, but the characters are rather shabby and the plot is too absurd to be a bit unsatisfactory.
