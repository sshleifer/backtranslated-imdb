What a casting ... and what a waste. Seriously, when a film contains Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone, quality is expected. The film is however a big mess with an improbable story that does not seem to stop spinning. Yes, I think they thought they were really smart with all that. <br /> <br /> The story is not only messy and improbable, it is not entirely original either. It uses older and much better movie elements based on poker games. But for me, that's really what happened in the movie with the many unnecessary twists. It made the story so unlikely to look. On top of that, the script remains filled with holes, stupid mistakes in poker games and things that simply do not make much sense. Why would people first want to play a card player who is known as the best cheater in the game? This is the subject of the film, but never seemed logical to me. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film has an excellent distribution, we always have the impression that most of the actors were miscast in their roles. I do not know what it's all about at Stuart Townsend. He's a good actor, but in most roles he always feels out of place. Maybe it's his looks, I did not know it. This is also why he was replaced in "The Lord of the Rings: The Ring Community". In addition, Thandie Newton is not very good and actually quite annoying in his female role "strong". And what was the point of having Melanie Griffith in all this? Oh, I guess I could go on talking about the cast of his movie and I might complain even more about the short time that Jamie Foxx's character goes on screen, but I guess you understand now. <br /> <br /> Damian Nieman is simply not an original writer / director and, in addition, he does not manage his own material very well. The scenes are often disjointed, we try to put too many characters and everything about the film is superficial and predictable. In addition to this, the film sometimes has mounting problems, which does not help to give this film the appearance of a homogeneous whole. The film was also a major box office bomb and it was no wonder Damian Nieman still did not shoot a movie. <br /> <br /> A mess too big for you to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
