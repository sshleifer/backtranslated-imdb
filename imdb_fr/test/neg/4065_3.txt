I saw three other worse films than this one, "Plan 9 of Outerspace", "Side Hackers" and the dreaded "Blair Witch Project". There are so many technical errors in this movie that, despite a decent plot, the movie This is not believable. <br /> <br /> Let's start with an AMTRAK train without skirts or handrails between cars. The killer walks behind her victim as she drives from car to car and pushes her off the train. <br /> <br /> In a scene, a murderer intrudes into a woman's apartment. He wants to sneak the woman to kill her, so what does he do? He turns his stereo! If I suddenly hear my stereo getting stronger, I would be worried. He kills women by throwing an electric curler into the bathtub. I was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a 5 meter cord could be tossed around and stay connected. In addition, the apartment seemed modern enough to have ground in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted. <br /> <br /> The Boeing 747 is one of the most famous airliners on the planet, it is for this part that I was amazed. First, the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and secondly, it was not on the top deck of the aircraft. I watched in amazement as the pilot and co-pilot (where was the flight engineer?) Crossed the spiral staircase and headed for the nose of the plane. <br /> <br /> I was also amazed that the bullets would not enter an aluminum utility cart (which is good for our hero) nor in the bathroom doors, but would penetrate the ceiling, causing a leak of fuel escaping through a small hole in the fuselage. Huh? Watching three guys lengthen a 100-meter track in less than a week was also incredible. <br /> <br /> I did not check, was it a movie of the week or something? It was terrible.
