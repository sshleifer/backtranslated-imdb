ASTROESQUE (2 stars out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the title is supposed to be ... even less of what it is supposed to be in this movie half the time. .. for now, it always kept me interested. It's a low-budget film, like "El Mariachi", shot in 16mm ... and, for what it's worth, the shots are very well composed and visually stylish. Directed, written by and performed by writer / comic artist Michael Allred ... I guess it's not surprising that the film looks good. Unfortunately, the game of actors goes beyond evil ... and the rest is at best competent. Allred himself is the best ... but only because he does not speak much. Most of the time, he's pretending to be cool ... or running away from crazy hicks trying to kill him. The sound is also pretty bad ... almost as if it were unfinished in places ... maybe they could not afford to pay for the music they had planned to use? A strange vaguely sci-fi plot ... similar to that of "The man who fell on Earth" ... but most of the movie comes down to a race-from-the-bad guys and kill them before - Are you kidding me? In the end, too oblique to succeed, but not without interest for adventurous cinema lovers.
