Just in case the title does not give in - this movie is hogwash. <br /> <br /> Short comment? Yes. <br /> <br /> I decided to spend so much time writing this article that Hollywood probably decided to put in the script. I doubt if it's published because of my poor quality, but if it's the case and everyone reads it, stick with it to cherish Sandlot's first movie. He completely surpasses his predecessors in every way. The suites are never worth buying or watching, and anyone who makes them should be ashamed to have ruined what must be one of the most classic and original films of our childhood.
