I went to see this because of snipes / statham, but honestly, the chaos is terrible. This film has absolutely nothing to envy - it should not have been done. <br /> <br /> Do not read this review if you do not want to read the spoilers, because I will talk about it a lot here. <br /> <br /> First, the opening scene. It was the big event that made the two semi-headed characters turn (Statham and Snipes). But it's boring and banal. Only in the end, we can see what really happened and when you will not care anymore. Moreover, this whole event, where a villain and his hostage are killed, is hardly important enough to fill hundreds of newspaper articles, as mentioned in the film. <br /> <br /> Then work in the bank - it does not work. Do not take off for a second. The bank robber makes some useless references to chaos theory (which has NOTHING to do with the whole story, by the way). The way Statham is summoned is very 'Die Hard With a Vengeance', but more boring. Then, things that happen in the bank are strange and useless. -What is with the safe. There seems to be a plot going on there, but then it is not. -Why have the trouble to tie two people when it does not lead to anything? It takes a lot of preparation and is useless at all! -Why does the SWAT leader not listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to withdraw? <br /> <br /> And these are only the first 10 minutes. It keeps getting worse. <br /> <br /> - The story of all the romantic / amorous interest (with the remark "he was not just a better policeman, he was a better man") is painful to watch. It's simply useless. Why would the Statham character indicate the camera's position change in the footage viewed from the bank? This essentially leads to finding the "virus" that will bring him all the money. -Why have the trouble of forging a guy's signature and killing him, but DO NOT kill anyone who can identify you. <br /> <br /> I could go on for years (really), but it's as if this movie was ... useless. The whole script is a mess. The "intelligent" references to chaos theory are really laughable and rather pathetic. The "twists" of the plot can be seen for several miles and the main characters seem to make mistakes all the time. It's really painful to watch a movie like this, where the public is taken for granted as a stupid and crunchy popcorn, whose director hopes he will not see all the holes in the plot and the storyline ridiculous. The "scene of explanation" at the end only adds to the insult. It really is not really a good movie. Never. <br /> <br /> People who come to see an action movie do not get what they want. People who come to see a movie of friends do not understand it. People who come to see a smart thriller do not understand that. In essence, everyone has the same treatment: a huge disappointment, a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
