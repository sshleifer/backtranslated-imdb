All this seemed very promising. A presidential advisor in the making is accused of a series of murders, as he was warned that a plot was taking place at the White House. It features the excellent Donald Sutherland among several talented actors. Yet, very few people have a say in this. <br /> <br /> The whole thing really needs depth. You can understand that the president is too leftist with his ideas and that some members of the government want him to be killed so that these ideas do not materialize. Conrad seems to simply want the country to be governed as he wishes, rather than as the elected leader. <br /> <br /> However, the action scenes had some logical flaws: the sewers and lifts already mentioned and the rather random assassination methods - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely devoid of inspiration. His "hijacking" of the president was "ridiculous" - this would make the president about 10 hours when it would happen. Even worse was his last predictable scene with Bishop. <br /> <br /> They could have done a stimulating and inventive political thriller, but he bottled or failed. They could have gone to town with special effects, but the good ones were wasted. They could have done a lot more in general. It was worth the Â£ 1 it cost me.
