Wow, I've just witnessed one of the greatest poker tragedies and I'm not talking about the ungared death of the big ungar stu. I'm sorry to say that this movie was terrible. Absolutely terrible. A real tragedy in the history of cinema. Well, maybe I'm a bit stern, but unless you're interested in the student's life, do not even consider getting close to it. And those who are interested in his life will realize that most of the pieces have been trivialized and become big scenes of novelty. I watched it because of Stu UNgar but I almost wanted to finish myself like he did while watching this 4 star movie for the effort but unpleasantly painful
