This last installment of the "Airport" franchise was so horrible that it took me a moment to realize that it was not a crazy comedy, like "Airplane". George Kennedy was firing a flare through an open window to hijack missiles in search of heat was comical. What would happen to your hand if you held it by a window at a two-speed speed? You would lose your grip on the gun and you would have a broken arm. The passengers were involuntarily hilarious, as was the interior of the plane. The sophisticated Frenchwoman who was involved in George Kennedy's business was like Jackie Kennedy, who was turning to Ernest Borgnine. It will not arrive. Susan Blakely, a talented and little appreciated actress, did not get any points on her resume for this one. Robert Wagner either. This movie was so ugly that it seemed surreal.
