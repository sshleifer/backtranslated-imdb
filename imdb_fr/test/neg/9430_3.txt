This may be the case, even if there are two or three left. This film builds an interesting nocturnal urban landscape, reminiscent of so many hazy scenes from Sherlock Holmes' films, and fills it with sinister Kafka-esque characters. In the middle of them, the film drops Mia Farrow, who seems to always play Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be reproducing his neo-lesbian role of Play It Again Sam. Are we supposed to laugh his stammering and his efforts? I guess I would, if the rest of the movie was clearly a comedy, but that's not the case. At least I do not think so.
