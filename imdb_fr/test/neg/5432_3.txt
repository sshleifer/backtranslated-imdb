Before it was released, it was a very popular movie, but it turned out to be a failure. I have never spoken to anyone who has ever liked this movie. I agree: I did not like it either. Perhaps one of the main reasons why it was not a box office success was that it only had unattractive characters in the story. <br /> <br /> For a moment - I do not know if this is always true - I did not have any movie in which Laura Linney or Dylan Walsh played anything but boring characters. <br /> <br /> This, and a stupid story, make this movie a big disappointment, especially considering this big buildup. Did the filmmakers, with this silly dialogue, really think it was going to be a success?
