The master of the Italian horror Dario Argento is called many bad things by non-fans. And deserves absolutely nothing from the reaction. In fact, every time I hear something bad about Argento, I think they really talk about Michele Soavi. He just does not get the same attention because his films have never been so successful in theaters. In fact, his best film - Cemetery Man - from 1994 - was probably his least successful. Or just did not get the attention he deserved, because after that, he left the film and directed the television. He never came back. So, people really do not know how much his other films are inferior, because by the time they saw them, they are already fans of the Italian horror aesthetic. Which means you have to accept the fact that they have almost no meaning and are usually very unattractive movies. This is where the Church stands out from the pack. Because visually, it's so cheap and old-fashioned, you can smell the dust. But it also has its charms, although they are few. The work of the camera is really striking and the score is extremely elaborate and grandiose. <br /> <br /> Since Argento is the reason why people have seen Soavi's work, I do not know anyone who captured The Church before Argento Suspiria and deep red. Soavi is a bit of a hack. A bit like an Italian Mick Garris - the best example of a director preferring style to substance. The defects of the Church are constant and numerous. The film begins with a somewhat interesting prologue showing knights on white horses crossing a peasant village, similar to the ones you see in any Robin Hood adaptation a long time ago. These scenes are quite intense, energetic and go straight to the point. Then we cut to the present, where the style of the film takes over. Yes, the movie is good to watch. And for about 35 minutes or so in the present, in the 1980s, anywhere in Italy, the film is just interesting enough to make us understand the elements of horror that unfold slowly. We now know that the purpose of the film is the construction of its horror. And it's a decent construction, for the most part. But as we approach the half of the film, we realize that the film is running and ... nothing is happening. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. I think. Two people working in a church, one as a cataloguer of books and the other as a restorer of the building's mural works, discover a parchment / writing that the man thinks can lead them to some sort of buried treasure or priceless artifact that he can sell and get rich. So, he only follows his "map" to discover a force under the church that makes him hallucinate, while he slowly becomes a demon that will make all others hallucinate. So, while doing his demon work, someone to whom he has entrusted the force is killing himself in a way that traps everyone in the church while the demon 'contagen' is spreading over everyone , leaving a black preacher and the little girl sneaking every night, a church to go to nightclub, being the only 2 people who can prevent the plague from spreading beyond the walls of the church. It seems likely full of action and Soavi's style is much more lethargic than Argento. But never before have I seen such a terrifying surreal film attempt. I am not joking. Absolutely nothing happens in the whole movie! I've already seen Expressionist films (or impressionists, but I'm not a super-graduate from film school), but most of them show events (John Carpenter's Halloween, for example). <br /> <br /> It follows closely. in the footsteps of the films Demons de Lamberto Bava (co-produced by Argento). We are headed to a place where a group of people gather, one turns into a demon, all the others are isolated, this person infects everyone except a couple of survivors, then the demons spread - infect the world or the survivors get out when the demons die. This film puts all these elements in place. Except that unlike Argento's work, nothing happens. Ok, there are a few things going on. But only one weird sequence has the panache of much more fun movies from Lamberto's Demons. A demon impales a woman's neck at random using a fence section that he pulls out of the ground. What's odd about it, are you wondering? This is happening in front of twenty people. What are they doing? Nothing. She dies, her head is streaming with blood in close-up. But all these people do not even notice, although it is going well and at least 8 feet away from them. Maybe 4 people notice that the demon is rushing to stab who he is as he walks toward her, so they steal away. She is dead and in the act after her death, everyone sits, remains silent while a boy plays the saxophone. I am not joking. That's what's happening It's more than logically incoherent: it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> The scene suggests that the woman simply disappears and no one has seen her die. They are all ready and forget that. And this 15-second film is absolutely the only event that takes place in the film. I'm not saying it's the only violence, gore or murder we see. It's not. It's just the only thing we can say is happening. For example, in a scene, a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror that is both old and ugly. She begins to scratch the skin on her face, but when she reappears a few minutes later, no scratches. People eat fish and their faces are crushed by subway cars. But later, they appear as completely unharmed members of a cult-owned cult, in a scene that commits the ultimate horror heresy - copying a famous scene from Roman Polanski's 1968 masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, the biggest horror movie ever shot. Even if Argento did that, I would be furious!
