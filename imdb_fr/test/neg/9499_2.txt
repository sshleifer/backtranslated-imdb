I do not know where to start. Maybe the idea of ​​this film was just an imminent disaster. An abduction is not slightly humorous. I do not know what was more offensive - the subject or the "performance" of David Arquette. It was like watching a bull get his penis cut, although I think the bull felt better afterwards. Filmmakers should find something about Sinatra other than the kidnapping of his son to show (like, I do not know, his talent as a singer !!!!). His family should not have to relive this horror. Thank God, this has just been shown on HBO and not released in theaters. Please do not look at this if you have a self respect.
