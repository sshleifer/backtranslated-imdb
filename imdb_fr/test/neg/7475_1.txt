When the first shot is given to US Marines who seriously lack respect for the American flag, a film has a difficult road ahead of him, but unfortunately it was downhill. There is a credited military adviser, who is also apparently a retired US Navy, which makes it even more puzzling that this incredible violation of the protocol and the law went unnoticed. Even more disconcerting is the way they simply ignored the way a Marine is declared KIA, and then buried, in a very short time, without any explanation as to how they identified the body, or even if There had been a body. The US government still finds the missing from the Second World War and it takes months to identify the remains. The slaughtered servicemen remain MIA for months or years and are only declared KIA when the remains have been identified, or after years of paperwork. Here, we expect this to happen in a matter of days or even weeks. This may be happening in Denmark, but not in the United States. It is clear that none of the people involved have ever been involved or respected by the US military. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, there are a number of other laughable moments where characters come out of nowhere with zingers. There must have been really prolonged meetings between the author and the actors, who had trouble finding the motivation that pushed them to engage in such a crap. Having a script that worked might have helped, but this one seems to have been created on the spot, from Cliffs Notes. There is no way of knowing if the scenario was so horrible at the beginning, or if it was the author or the children of the middle management of the studio who bear the responsibility. Anyway, it's a horrible movie that should never have been done.
