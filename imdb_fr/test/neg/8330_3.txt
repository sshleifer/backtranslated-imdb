Well, it was my first IMAX experience, so I was pretty impressed by that, mostly; although in hindsight, I can not help but wish it was another film (less monochrome). <br /> <br /> Magnificent Desolation did much feel the "School Program" for the way he lists all the astronauts and it made a LOT like reading National Geographic magazine in 3D. Oddly, there was actually a very two-dimensional quality that operated only rarely in reality and often, it seemed like a PowerPoint presentation. There was a moment in the film when an unseen abyss opened; apparently you think it was a WOW factor, but to be honest, it might have more to do with the fact that I am a virgin IMAX. <br /> <br /> The comment provided by Tom Hanks, I personally found it (which is a good way to say it?) "nationalist" who did not spent too much in the center of London, judging by the remarks heard when we left. <br /> <br /> Overall I loved the IMAX experience, but I really wish there was another movie that day. The moon is not a particularly colorful subject and, to be honest, many 3D effects have been lost in the monochrome landscape. All this would have been good without the documentary inserts and distractions like interviews with American schoolchildren who spoiled it a bit.
