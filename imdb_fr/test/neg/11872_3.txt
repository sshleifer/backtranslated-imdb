The Detonator is in Bucharest, where a former CIA government agent, Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes), has found a weapons trafficker named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch). Things go bad, but Dimitru discovers that Sonni is working for the US government. . After a large shooting, most of Dimitru's men were killed by Sonni, which displeased the local Romanian police. Flint (Michael Brandon), a prominent man, decides to send Sonni back to the United States and simultaneously protect a woman named Nadia Cominski (Silvia Colloca) who is also sent back to the United States. However, it turns out that Nadia is wanted by Dimitru and her boss, the club owner Jozef football club (Tim Dutton), who need her to reach an agreement for a nerve gas bomb they have the intention to trigger in Washington, killing millions of people ... <br /> <br /> This American and Romanian co-production was made by Po-Chih Leong & The Detonator confirms without a shadow of a doubt that Wesely Snipes has joined the club of stars of the dilapidated action cinema who are relegated to the manufacture of generic action films in Eastern European countries, yes, Snipes joined personalities such as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren, Rutger Hauer and Chuck Norris. I give Snipes a bit of credit because it takes a little longer than the rest with the excellent Blade: Trinity (2004) always fresh in the minds of moviegoers (each film he has since made is directly on DVD ) but that was to happen sooner or later, like many of the names I mentioned, Snipes lived off the reputation of some great movies and, if you look at his career, he made more bad movies than good ones. Like the recent JCVD ​​& Seagal movies, The Detonator is rather awful. Martin Wheeler's script is as predictable, boring and beyond numbers as anything. The Detonator is the kind of movie you expect to see on an obscure cable TV channel broadcast at 2am. The detonator is full of clichés, Snipes is obliged to protect a woman and at first they hate each other, but in the end, they are in love, his closest friend of the CIA turns out to be a traitor then the odious by the boss of the book that no one likes turns out to be a pretty decent guy, the Snipes character is allowed to run around Bucharest to shoot, kill and blow people up as if nothing had happened and he's never stopped, the action is boring and forgettable, the villain has a football club, so there are a lot of awkward terminologies on the football and there is not even a cockpit. <br /> <br /> Leong director does nothing to enliven things The Detonator seems cheap with a car chase in which both cars never seem to exceed the 30 mph mark. OK, the action scenes are relatively well staged, but they are rare and quite forgotten in a "nasty shoot at Snipes", in return, Snipes shoots a villain and kills him. There is a car accident and a half-decent explosion, but very little else. It seems that part of the Detonator was shot in a Romanian football stadium. I think I would have preferred to watch the game for 90 minutes rather than this movie. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 15,000,000, the Detonator is reasonably well done but not much is happening. Shot and shot in Bucharest, Romania. The acting is not that great, Snipes just does not seem interested and feels he's just there for the money I do not blame him at all. <br /> <br /> The Detonator is still a poor A cliche action movie starring an actor and is happening in Eastern Europe. Why Sony continues to do these things? Not recommended, there is a lot of better action price there.
