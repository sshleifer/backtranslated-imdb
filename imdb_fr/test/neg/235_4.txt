First of all, I did not know who the movie was for - it was a children's story but there were things kids would not understand and would not be boring about. There was not much to do, Bruce Willis was not an actor at all. He looked a lot on the side with his half-smile - unless you're a big fan of him, I would not mind bothering you. And if it's the story that interests you (a guy who seems to have everything but lacks emotion is taught the lessons of a child), I'd go see About a Boy. He has all that is missing from this film, humor, sadness and reality.
