I just lost my Saturday night watching this shit! I saw the names of Chris Noth (Mr. Big, from "Sex & the City"), Robert Patrick (from "X-Files"), Decadent Elliot Gould, Colm Meaney and Mercedes Ruehl on credit ; a very reasonable IMDb rating (5.6); and a lot of good reviews in IMDb. For my biggest surprise, the film is horrible: the characters are poorly constructed; the story is trying to be funny, but it's totally stupid; Mercedes Ruehl's character is surprisingly stupid for a Princeton teacher. So I decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews, and I found that most of them were made by IMDb users with only one criticism, so relatives or friends of the distribution and team or persons hired to promote this waste. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sem Retorno" ("Without Return")
