I read several critics who ask the question "Why was this movie done"? I myself found this question in my head as the hour and twenty-minute feature seemed to be dragging in the middle only to give the impression that it was growing in the end, when in fact he was not doing anything of the sort. So, "Why was this film shot?" I think it's a great question for those who watch Heftig og begeistret to ask themselves. This reviewer is proud of director Knut Erik Jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope, brotherhood and inspiration with this all-male choir, but I do not think Jensen has done enough to tell a compelling story. Let me ask you the following question: "Do audience members need more in a documentary than a simple story to maintain interest"? My answer is yes, and that's where Jensen failed. Heftig og begeistret was a good documentary, but it was far from brilliant. Jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects. It was great to hear the songs, but over time, those songs seemed boring, overwhelming and a bit early. From the opening scene where our men were singing their hearts in blinding snow, I knew I was hooked, but over the movie, I lost interest. Why? Jensen, members of the audience, never took us to a higher level. He maintained the level of the playing field and ultimately detracted from the overall tone of the film. Was it a movie about the music or the men of the choir? The world may never know it. <br /> <br /> Again, I would like to say that Jensen did a phenomenal job in finding an interesting story about this group of men who have gone through difficult times and how they overcame these difficulties. the music, but it was as if the all-male choir was a group of the most boring men ever created. Jensen gave us the music beautifully, but it's the characters, the subjects, of which I did not know anything at the end of the film. In the mix, we had a 97-year-old man who still had his driver's license, a tall man in a tub that sang classic American songs, older men who had a broken heart in their youth, we had tensions between the young people of the choir and the veteran singers, and we even had an ex-addict who was only clean for eleven years. Did Jensen develop these interesting stories? No, he left them on the table. It was obvious that these singers were willing to talk about it longer (see the politician who had missed his political days), but Jensen seemed to deviate from these sincere moments and return directly to interesting places where he could blackmail the choral. For me, the music was set at the beginning of the film, I wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these men. They were all captivating, but Jensen seemed to ignore them completely. <br /> <br /> By ignoring the main topics of this documentary, Jensen has not managed to create any kind of tension towards the end. Without giving an end, I felt as if Jensen was coloring the lines. Instead of being bold outside the lines, he chose not to create any moment of sympathy, emotion, nervousness or sadness. Jensen brought our subjects from point A to point B to point C without asking us to participate in any way whatsoever. I can see how the national feeling made this movie a huge success in Norway, but for everyone watching (ie ME), more was needed. I wanted to feel for these guys. I wanted to know if they would be successful in their trip or if they were simply loved in their own city. There was no story, mainly in part to no development of subjects. When you watch modern documentaries (curiously, this film was shot in 2001), you want it to be similar to any Hollywood feature film. You want suspense, realism and drama, alas, with Heftig og begeistret, you receive nothing of the sort. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to ask again the question "Why was this film shot?" My last answer, Alex, is that Jensen wanted to show how much a troubled time and a changing economy could always bring happiness, even in the coldest places on Earth. I think Jensen wanted to show his human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population. That said, Jensen showed it perfectly in this film, but he did not create a good documentary. When you make a film of this nature, I feel that you have to look within the group, examine the participants in the choir and hear each of their stories to come to an end that will take your heart. The only thing this film has captured is my attention span as he tried to leave the room at the speed of the rocket. Again, I do not want to sound negative about this movie because the music was great and the singing men aroused a sense of honesty, but I needed more. As documentaries become an essential part of the film community, we are waiting for a little more than Heftig og begeistret. I want to see reality and people, not just another song and a dance routine! <br /> <br /> Grade: ** on *****
