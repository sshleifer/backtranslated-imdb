Feeling Minnesota is not really a road movie, but it's the best categorization I can generate. A road movie does not depend primarily on a great story, and since the plot of this film is really pathetic, it fulfills this description. To be interesting, such a film must rest entirely on moving and intriguing characters, as well as on the chemistry that unites them. Unfortunately, the Feeling Minnesota staff absolutely does not produce this enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The initial presentation of the characters is neither satisfying nor disconcerting; For example, I can not know if Jjaks (Keanu Reeves) grew up in the house of his mother and brother or not. According to his mother (Tuesday Weld), he has to live with his father, but nothing in the film indicates that this ever happens. The same goes for the rest of the characters - I never know them. They seem irrational and no real explanation explains why they do it. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I leave the film without feeling any feelings for the characters, if not the monotony and maybe a little bit of attraction for the cute Cameron Diaz .
