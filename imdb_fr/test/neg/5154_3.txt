My mother took me to this film at the drive-in when I was about seven, thirty years ago. She had no idea that a family film would be so violent. My clearest memory was that of the painful face of the boy's father when he was stabbed in the stomach and killed. This image haunted me for weeks. I had learned that I lived in a world where a person could stab my father at any time. How could I stop them? How could my father protect himself? You must understand that this aggression is not a fantasy for a seven-year-old child. It's as real as attending a real event and has no place in the innocent mind of a child. It is unfortunate that we still do not understand the impact of violence on the lives of our children, both for our children and for our society. If only parents protect their children from violent images with the same vigor, they would protect them from images of nudity and sex.
