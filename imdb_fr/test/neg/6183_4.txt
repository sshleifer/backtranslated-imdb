I have read all the free articles about this confused semi-black and I am puzzled by the high esteem of what seems, in the cruel light of 2007, to be a product of a very late late assembly line. All these endless documentary sequences about fish, waves, fish, waves have very little to do with the central conflict and only shorten the duration. The editing is downright negligent: the scenes end and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. The dialogue bears the leaning traces of the origins of the Odets: stolen metaphors that could never have come from the limited imagination of these people today. But what is truly surprising is how much the triangle is terribly overworked on all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she scolds, contorts, and goes wild - an undisciplined performance several notches below her level. Douglas, who plays too much to be kind, then goes on to a so-called deadly murder and is also a martyr, like Ryan, grumbling and shouting unnaturally. The second less interesting pair provides at least one recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is a kind of Neanderthal by today's standards, is nevertheless sweet and persuasive as Stanwyck's brother (much younger, presumes), and Marilyn Monroe , like his girlfriend, is natural and unaffected. On the wind-swept coast of Monterey (and all of its sequences, although largely irrelevant, is interesting as a document of what the city looked like), amidst all the overheated hysteria these two islands are islands of mental health. One last point and a spoiler: Maybe the Breen desk has mandated him, but does anyone believe in the happy ending a second? Stanwyck may have temporarily regressed to become an obedient woman, but I give a month to the wedding.
