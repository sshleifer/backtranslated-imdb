Oh Gawd. I want to travel back in time to Monogram Studios and strangle someone in their 2-room reception desk for this sloppy musical. It's a watt over the flat surface for 60 of its 61 minutes and then shows (for a minute, spread out in milliseconds over an hour) that there are real talents that are poorly photographed. see the point of making a film that could easily be energetic and really funny and let lethargy be the most visible thing. The strange scenario shows the creepy vaudeville troupe, Grace Hayes, describing her way to a university where her son is a rich clown. She will solve her playboy problems no matter what happens. His real-life son (weird) Peter Hays plays his son on the screen. His real wife plays his secretary. Talk about nepotism. I suspect that this package of talents was almost the reason for Monogram's financing of this musical produced by the extraordinary Sam Katzman, a schlockmeister in residence. As with other Monogram musicals, it sounds more like a reason to film new purchases of furniture and lighting to show other studios that Monogram Pictures is "sumptuous" in its B-style. Take a frightening look at SWING PARADE OF 1946 to find an obvious proof: they have just built this gigantic club of discotheques, then found an excuse for the actors and the musicians who went through it. Story? No. Anyway, ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM. Where were Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when Monogram really needed it? Probably standing at the PRC Pictures boarding gate, wondering if it was safe to enter. Jive Hepster, Roland Dupree, begins playing music around two shaky dance acts, especially during the "big show" finale in the new expanded ensemble of club / malt club. The usual crumpled curtains are loosely hanging on the back wall, and the mismatched drapery decor includes even a dark main rag that is moved back and forth as each amateur sequence passes the previous one. The choir girls and their very sober partners in this finale look like borrowed Monogram office staff (typing and carpentry) for the morning shoot. They have absolutely no dancing talent and are so ordinary on the screen ... ALL the girls look like Joyce. There is even a calamity of costume where they wear hot-pants gathered ... on one leg only. It's all so horrible and so shabby ... and actually annoying when an extra focus from everyone involved would give ZIS a really fun look. The strangely interesting thing is the communication dialogue between Grace and her son-in-law: she is delivered so casually that she works despite the script and the logic. She has a life very similar to the presence that is the only thing that makes the ridiculous story to be slightly convincing. The kid Dupree is the real star. In fact, he can do something ... although he looks like a tuber Liberace teenager who dances taps ...
