A couple is separated on vacation. The first scenes let us believe that Barney, the character of Jeff Bridges, kidnapped the girl in an unexplained but premeditated kidnapping. The film is played a few years later where, despite a new love interest, Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) is determined to resolve his disappearance. <br /> <br /> The story is really intriguing, but very bad decisions were made during the making of this film, resulting in a nice job of poor quality. <br /> <br /> OK let's go. On the scene of kidnappings - apart from two major errors of continuity, Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are led to perform a small ritual of love signed with a pet, drowned in an excessive feeling up to nausea. We know they are in love. the speech "I solemnly swear never to leave you", a few moments ago, was thankful. The robot focus of Jeff Bridges is another example. That is why? Starman is back and after a decade on the planet, he seems to have become mean. The entire plot can then be solved by the introduction of a useless character who, by a rather happy spell, has a rather miraculous power of observation. The climate sequence itself has mostly been done before, but much, much better. It is riddled with extra trouble and another blinding continuity error. I could go on, but we have to say something positive. Kiefer Sutherland is the only one to have saved the face with a pretty decent performance. <br /> <br /> The original of the same name of 1988 (changed from the Dutch title "Spoorloos" for an English-speaking public) was recommended for me, only for an online rental company to send me this later version from Hollywood by mistake. I was surprised to find that both were directed by George Sluizer and I would be interested to know his motivation for the remake. I am reliable and thankfully informed that it is of a much higher quality in all areas, including the plot. Horah for that, but it does not require much.
