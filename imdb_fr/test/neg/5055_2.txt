I heard that this movie was bad? They even warned me it was terrible, but for some reason (probably Katie Holmes), I watched it again when it was on national television. Watching Kevin Williamson's movies is torturing! His scenarios are not funny, certainly not scary and not in the least creative. Teaching Ms. Tingle exudes the same irritating atmosphere as her brainless "Dawson's Creek" series, which is probably aimed at the same target group as well. Even before the credits started, 5 people already wanted a hug and they said that "I love you". This is not better because the soundtrack is full of annoying pop / rock and the scenario is ultra-thin. Three students on the verge of graduation get caught cheating by the school's meanest teacher. Every school has a teacher like that, you know ?? To save their skin, they try to convince Ms. Tingle that it was not their intention to cheat, but that this attempt went wrong. The typical high school humor is completely lost for me, the overdose of feeling is pathetic and the acting of the actors (with the exception of Helen Mirren) is abominable. I'm sure Katie Holmes can act ?? it is a fact proven by its role in `the Gift '?? but she must urgently stop accepting unclean girl roles. As said before, the only positive comments go to Helen Mirren's brilliant cast as a shrew. It's like Kathleen Turner in `Serial Mom '! The role suits him perfectly and you can not imagine anyone else playing it. Other than that, it's preventable nonsense teenage girls.
