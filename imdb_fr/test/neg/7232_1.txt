A flesh-eating octopus, where does this guy Boaz come from (what is ...?) Davidson keeps getting inspired? Anyway, even for the low and the low of the two giant marine animals that kill people-kind and me, this one is just beyond horrible. he just found himself in the aer River (ahum) because Sea World was fed up with him. The actors often help the octopus to smother them. The group of idiots, so he will never learn! You want all the other giants Killer octopuses (that's the correct plural, by the way) to make fun of him? Meanies. <br /> <br /> To stop the octopus, there is wind, razors hard to handle and a special agent of the sea, Nick Hartfield, and his partner, who will retire in a week, but must first be eaten by the octopus.Haour, the octopus won the fight! Two more and it will evolve (the scars in my mind remain) .Nick of course try to help him by doing nothing (he does not have a gun or something else?) But no, it does not magically not help either. <br /> <br /> Okay, enter the love affair of the sea policeman, Rachel Starbird. Anyway, together they try to stop the octopus by walking around the park. They hope this will help, because we are on July 4th in a few days and the octopus could join the party. And you do not know what he looks like when he's drunk. Rachel then gets a school bus from nowhere to make sure this movie does not end while Nick feeds the octopus with even more cops out of the sea. <br /> <br /> But all that sucks, Nick managed to blow up the octopus several times, and a group of children there were rejoicing and laughing. You know, belly vision would probably give a R.In In real life, I would say all ages, but I like a little all ages. My final idea is therefore: Suitable for absolutely nobody. There is no sex, no gore, no nothing. Now, forget that this movie has ever existed. Go to the club.
