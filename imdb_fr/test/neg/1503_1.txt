I love low budget movies. Including those who are intentionally or not funny, excessive false gore, violence, etc. <br /> <br /> This, however, is more than stupid. Once you see the end, you say, what was the purpose of all these murder scenes without anyone (except a couple) to witness? The whole story is far enough for those who are stupid enough to watch this. Granny is like a psychic Jason. First, she is in front of the window with a body and 15 seconds later, she knits in the living room. All is a configuration for a newcomer. They perform graphic killing scenes, knitting needles in their eyes, that only Chris Angel Mind Freak could remove. And again, the end was pre-posterior. 56 min of time loss. I saw one of the directors of other films and it was almost as bad. Give me $ 20,000 and I could do better. It really deserves a big 0.
