When A Killer Calls must be the biggest scam published by Asylum so far. This is a sexy babysitter guard who receives spooky calls from a scary voice that repeatedly asks her: "Have you checked the girl?" Of course, she calls after the cops (after having to do some unnecessary things - hang up when "he" calls, wait ten seconds and dial * 57). Sounds familiar? Yeah, that's why I rented it too. <br /> <br /> Well, that should. And I hate to say it, but it could have been more fun than the big-screen crapfest that was released around the same time if not for a fatal mistake - Rather than rejoicing in the glory of the movie scam B, he tried to do something original. He was trying to make the main character nice rather than having fun cliche and campy with her. Mind you, it could have worked with a talented actress. But she was not. Of course, she looked good and she screamed and cried, but. . . oh well, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Then it was the terrible end. Not horrible in the sense that it was horrible, horrible that it was BORING. Until then (about an hour), the preparations were clear and fun. Then he moves in another direction, and he moves away from another silent and fun movie with a sexy "teenager" cast and comes in the form of a hostel-esquire gore / borefest. <br /> <br /> I guess it falls in the "Oh well, no matter the" category. "The main actress missed a line? Oh well, whatever, I do not want to take it back We forgot to motivate the killer Oh well, whatever, I do not want to rewrite it.The rhythm changes completely halfway? Oh well, whatever, I do not want to lose fifteen minutes Continuity errors? Oh well, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie (stupid, nerdy, predictable movie, with sexy scenes), then everything will be fine until the end. The end is stupid, it's not fun, it's not scary, it's neither camper, nor nerdy, nor rhythmic.In fact, there was almost exactly five minutes of the character who was just leagued (and it's not a spoiler because it's on the back of the DVD) and look around him in the room, then scream ... no matter.
