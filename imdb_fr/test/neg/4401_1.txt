<br /> <br /> It will not be long. The first half hour was one of the most boring I had to face since watching movies. The story has not progressed, nothing has been explained about any of the characters. It was like a non-movie. (Many people had already left the audience at that time.) <br /> <br /> Many scenes were totally unjustified and unexplained. <br /> <br /> The director should have studied the cinema a little more than knowing that each sequence, each scene, must advance the story. He never did it. <br /> <br /> The supposedly amusing moments were artificial and only a few people laughed (people with a weird sense of humor, I guess). <br /> <br /> Jury at Cannes 2002 ..... I do not know what the jury thought .... probably "the politically correct effect". <br /> <br /> I would have liked to love it, so the disappointment was even greater. <br /> <br /> You have to see it to believe it. But wait for the video.
