Despite the good performances of Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film fails to ignite the viewer. <br /> <br /> By the way, what happened to Mrs. Driver? She had such potential in the film industry. <br /> <br /> For me, it looked almost like an 1850 version of Yentl without the musical fanfare. When her father died, Driver assumed the role of governess to a Christian family, hiding her Jewish identity. <br /> <br /> I realize it's a time of peace but it's terribly dull, even for 1850 England. and in Scotland. <br /> <br /> The mistress of the house is particularly irritated by her singing voice. I was expecting her to refer to Driver as expensive at all times. What kind of name is Mary Blackchurch? I know that Driver is trying to pretend to be a Christian, but does that name mean to the end? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Mary finds love with the young man's father (Wilkinson) and his emotional imbalance. his son. <br /> <br /> In the end, the only thing we see accomplished is that Mary has found the job of providing her family with photography. Had we really had to experience what was going on throughout the movie? <br /> <br /> The first scenes of Judaism practiced in the 19th century in England and the cholera epidemic in the end could have been more staged. The Wilkinson family has an underlying sense of anti-Semitism, but it is never allowed to manifest itself.
