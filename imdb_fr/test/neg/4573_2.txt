I like oddball animation, I like a lot of Asian movies, but I did not like this product from Japan. The Fuccons are supposed to be an American family (they are all models) who moved to Japan, and are sort of a 50s sitcom family, with slightly more modern sensibilities at the same time. The DVD contains several very short episodes (about less than 5 minutes each?) And I did not find it funny or entertaining, not even strangely. I'm not sure what the call is for that. I came across a satire here and there, my God, who would not want to, but satire is usually somewhat humorous, is not it? And nothing I saw or heard noticed even a smirk. I used it usually and it certainly seemed appealing, but I guess we miss the point or it's just LAME. The box even states that it's hilarious Fuccon, right in front, but please delay. 2 out of 10
