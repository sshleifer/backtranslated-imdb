In the first 5 minutes of this movie, I knew I had to be part of one of those "pick at the faults" movies. The game was terrible, the scenario was even worse. Those who have already let these people write these crapes for a film must feed themselves the Komodo. Russian Mi jet planes pretending to be American Air Force jet planes and guns that can fire a quick 50 to 60 rounds without recharging are a poor detail for a story. In one scene, komodo kill Special Forces troops at night, while in another, they explain how komodos and cobras are cold-blooded and do not go out at night !!!! Plus, with the fantastic special effects available in the current film industry, they were only average, even for this low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> That said, I watched it until the end, curious to know what other wonders are a bad film doing could produce. Shame Shame Shame, for producing such a rot !!! <br /> <br /> This film should have been left on the floor of the editing room !!!
