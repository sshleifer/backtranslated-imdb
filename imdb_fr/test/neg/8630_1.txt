Dude, what a horrible movie. Like in many terrible movies, the structure of its horror lies in the scenario. It's such a pathetic attempt at psychological thriller that it gives a bad name to the whole genre. Ok, here is a major problem: the character of Sandra Bullock is removed by Jeff Bridges in his car in a busy convenience store in broad daylight. In one way or another, her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland can not find a single witness to this act and eventually passes most of the film completely unaware of where she is. Come on! Personally, I find this completely insulting, even for the darkest audience. Yet we are forced to accept this nonsense. The poorly explained motive of Jeff Bridges' actions is equally frustrating. His character is a little eccentric academic, certainly, but far from the sociopath who would do these things. He spends about ten minutes, spilling his beans at Sutherland, to explain why he did his cruel actions. But the explanation itself lacks even the most basic sense of logic. Therefore, no member of the intelligent audience can really believe in the possibility of his harm. And if you subtract this element from the story, everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> Another subject of major concern: -Jeff Bridges using a strange accent and pseudo-French without reason. <br /> <br /> - All the boring subplot involving Nancy Travis, especially her way of saving the situation by turning the tables on Bridges. <br /> <br /> - The crazy woman who manages to remember the number plate of Jeff Bridges despite his reflections that the leprechaun of Lucky Charms is real. <br /> <br /> - The name of Sandra Bullock's character, Diane Shaver, is again blurred to form the word "disappeared". Are you kidding me? The logistical impossibility of drugging, removing and burying (in a very distant place) a human being in the space of forty minutes (as Bridges says so well). <br /> This is a movie that made me understand remember the fictional character, incredibly stupid (and yet very successful) Donald Kaufman in Adaptation. Many screenwriters are brilliant and inspired artists. Some are just bozos who convince the fools who run the studios to do their drivel. This particular script is so stunned that Donald Kaufman himself would have managed to sell it. Unfortunately for all of us in the real world, Todd Graff did it.
