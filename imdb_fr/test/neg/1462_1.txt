This movie was pretentious, phantasmagoric and just not funny. The shooting technique reminded me of MTV. I'm a fan of Hartley. But what was he thinking? Much more thought could have been done in this film, given the subject. It could have been a real theoretical battle between good and bad, but Hartley seems to have used the support technique to distract the viewer.
