This film resembled excerpts from deleted scenes from a high school movie class experience. It did not make sense! It was well played, but I felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slop. The extraterrestrial machines were created with Pentium I technology and without any creativity, they were crabs! The extraterrestrial under-lit and barely seen were Frisbees with legs. Where were the tripods? The editing, directed by the director / writer / producer / makeup artist / gripper Latt, jumps everywhere, some scenes being repeated several times. Most of it seems to have been shot in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The next time Latt wants to make a movie, someone has to slap him. In 2005 alone, he produced 11 films! This does not include credits for writing, editing, making or visual effects on other films. If others are like that, then he makes fun of us. It was a scam of Spielberg's movie, nothing more. I'm looking forward to Latt's "BackBroke Ridge", "X-Man IIV", "The Hillocks Have Eyes".
