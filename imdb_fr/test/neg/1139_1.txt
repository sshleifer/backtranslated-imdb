Absolutely the worst experience I have ever experienced. I think my eyes started bleeding. In fact, I got sick at night after watching this. I do not even consider it a movie. The films are supposed to be interesting and entertaining. It fails horribly. I could not go through the entire movie, so since the end could be the biggest phenomenon in the film's story, it gives a 1 for that little chance. Otherwise, it would be a 0. <br /> <br /> I do not see how National Lampoon, let alone an organization, would sponsor this atrocity. Renting this DVD is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life. Watch this only if you want to make sure that any other movie you watch will never look great. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, this is the worst film I have ever seen.
