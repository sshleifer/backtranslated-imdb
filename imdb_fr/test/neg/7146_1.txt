This film made me angry for the simple fact that it was made only because Shepherd was gay. The men who murdered him are clearly bad. What happened to the poor man was really horrible and a tragedy. However, where was Hollywood when four white and religious children were executed, after being forced to commit a series of sexual acts on their killers and the other by two evil black men in Wichita just two years ago? Celebrities only lament for the camera when it serves a political purpose. Laramie is also misinterpreted by this pseudo-documentary, which is of course not surprising, since it is the backward scammers who must be educated by enlightened and omniscient Californians. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Laura Linney.
