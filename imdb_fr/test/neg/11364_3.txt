An obvious gain on the gimmick * Insert the monster here * in an airplane, Flight Of The Living Dead describes what you expect from him. <br /> <br /> The film has little or no plot, that's what you expect from a movie of this type. Although it's fun in places, I must say. Zombie action is particularly entertaining. Once the film has started, it never stops; the rhythm is solid. <br /> <br /> Practical special effects are pretty good, but the CGI is terrible and distracting. <br /> <br /> The end seems to leave the film open to a sequel. Hope this does not materialize. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the zombie subgenre of horror movies, I recommend it. it's worth at least a watch. However, if you are a big fan of the genre, leave it on the shelves. <br /> <br /> 3/10
