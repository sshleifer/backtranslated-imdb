Most of the comments on this forum revolve around the debate on the validity of a comparison with R DOGS made on the DVD cover. Forget all that ... This movie-- um - the movie at home is absolutely horrible. How can someone with a hint of credibility claim to be 10/10 ??? There is no conspiracy, no. I could not believe that I had spent money on praising this (more on that later) and that I was mistaken in thinking that this (based on the art of the cover and some sort of reward from film festival) had potential. The only thing I really remember is that incredibly, one of the boring main characters was supposed to have been shot in the head ... and he eventually survives the injury and reaches the final credits. Sensational. And you see, killers has a sequel. Double wow. <br /> <br /> True story: I had so much denied the fact that I had wasted my money and my life force on this rental that I kept the videotape for six months. I kept telling myself that it never happened. The video above the television was an illusion - a mental symbol of my abominable self. After someone told them it was real and I had to pull myself together, I decided that I could not leave him there. I thought, "How many other people have I denied the suffering of sitting around watching this masterpiece by accumulating Killers for myself?" I had to do what was right and send him back to hell from where he came from. <br /> <br /> Then, as I imagine, most IMDb people would do the same in a similar situation, I gathered all my courage to go to the video store ... at 2 o'clock morning. After making sure there was no one around me, I got out of my car (still working), slipped the film into the slot and reserved hell to never go back again. <br /> <br /> I guess I was expecting people from Hollywood Video Corporate to pick me up (the bill should have cost about $ 1,238.67 at that time), so I moved away from the area. However, as luck would have it, like the Killers scenario, nothing has ever happened.
