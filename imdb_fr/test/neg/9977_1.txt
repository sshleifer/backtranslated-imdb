I am almost embarrassed to admit having seen CALIGULA twice. Production problems are almost too numerous to mention. The script is below the standard (it is easy to understand why Vidal tried to deny it). The direction is worse. Most of the film consists of long shots interspersed with close-ups interspersed with mostly non-erotic cross-cuts of porn (more widespread obviously in the "uncut" version). Cinematography is particularly poor, giving the entire production an inexpensive faded look that undermines some of the elaborate decors. The film should have been much better. The general concept of placing leading actors in what would have been an X rated film (Guccione calls it "paganography") fades within an hour after the release of Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud. Bob Guccione obviously spent a lot of money on this project, but it all seems like a huge mess. If you want to better understand the Roman Empire in the first century, look instead at the production of I, CLAUDIUS of the BBC in the mid-79s ... and if you want porn, Jeeze-Louise, look elsewhere.
