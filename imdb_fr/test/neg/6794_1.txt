The fact that this raw series can spark dozens of comments (even fewer hundreds of "votes") speaks volumes about the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization. <br /> <br /> Lis Proust, morons! ! Or at least the anthologies of Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris. Consider the fact that to write or write on this series, you must have spent minutes or hours ... watching this poor grass walking on the boards and spitting lines with less emotional impact than the kid who used to call the exact time on your local service. <br /> <br /> PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW !! SAVE YOUR SOME BRAIN CELLS!
