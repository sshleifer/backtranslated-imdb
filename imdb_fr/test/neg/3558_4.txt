A beautifully evoked decor from the 1930s arouses a lot of interest for a spectator at the beginning of the 21st century; Unfortunately, "London Belongs to Me" has nothing else to recommend, apart from quaint English charm. All the problems are related to the deeply blurred story. The main plot concerns the actions of the young boy Richard Attenborough, the problems in which he finds himself and how the community in which he lives unites to save him from the laws of society. Or something. The main problem here is that the Attenborough character has everything for him and he is honestly guilty of almost all the charges against him. It is therefore disconcerting that the film (and all characters) have as much sympathy for him. He is treated as a victim of circumstance when he really is not. Moreover, it has not been shown that he felt much remorse for his actions, he only wanted to get away from things he did not want to do. Alastair Sim spends a lot of time on screen in a sub-plot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main line of the plot and you wonder what he's doing here (although Sim is, as always , superb). You know there is a problem with the structure when the main parcel has a constant impact on the sub-parcel, but not the other way around. And, after a serene pace and cautious construction, the plot collapses completely in the last 20 minutes with a deeply unsatisfactory and unexplained conclusion that does not even tell us if Attenborough's character has developed from the previous procedure. The film does not end, it simply stops. <br /> <br /> We can welcome the acting, the staging and the general atmosphere of the film, but unfortunately, the history and structure of the play are constant. One last point of question: Alec Guinness based his performance in the very superior movie "The Ladykillers" on the performance of Alastair Sim in this film, even if the two characters have first scenes almost identical.
