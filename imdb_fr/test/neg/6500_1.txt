If you plan to program your program for a film festival, do not be misled by the content of the brochure. It's a waste of time and total energy. I looked at Bunuel, I saw Dali and I admired them; but it's not surrealism, it's not supposed to be at all. Have they never thought of the reputation of the human race by taking this picture? Once extinguished by global warming, they will be the vestiges of our civilization. What if strangers sampled this as an example of our intellectual capital? With all due respect to the effort, it may be wise to remove all copies of this film - or anything else.
