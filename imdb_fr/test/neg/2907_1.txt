A montage prologue, made obviously by blessed maniacs who actually chose to distribute this thing, tries to convince us that the comic impact of this piece of surprisingly incompetent nothing is quite deliberate. Do not believe it: this is for Lloyd Kaufman, as is Andy Warhol for Herschel Gordon Lewis. He is so thorough in his project of torturing his hypothetical audience that he looks like a kind of misanthropic and negationist art installation, except that it is impossible because it is so completely devoid of self-awareness. As odious and ugly as "Things" or "Frozen Scream", she manages to climb the ladder by recycling herself with an exuberant and bald insistence that you have to see to believe her. A hitchcock-like analysis of, for example, the attack against the cardio girls could give twenty montages and maybe three minutes of film - only the sequence lasts ten minutes! YOU WANT to believe that it started in life as a short subject that was slightly more bearable, except that if you removed the repetition, there would be a lot less fascinating stuff: for example. when the "demon" enters the room, it inspires only extended looks, very apathetic and totally virgin of its imminent victims (off screen). Repeat this scenario about four times, in little varied settings; fill these with perhaps thirty lines of total dialogue; offer actors even more hateful and lethargic than those of the classics mentioned above; and adorn us with a monster made up of Spock's gauze, ketchup and yellow ear, and you have a movie too staggering to refuse, a bad work definition. I am proud to own it!
