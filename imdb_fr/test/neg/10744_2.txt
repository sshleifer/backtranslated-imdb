I can understand a satire that goes against my own ideas, but it must be spiritual and well placed. This film is ... how can I possibly explain it? He does not make the slightest attempt at subtlety, let alone intelligence. In fact, it's not even a horror. Dead soldiers come alive but are not interested in brains, but only in booths. Why? It's a never-ending stream of silly, mundane and swollen delusions of "bad president, bad conservatives, bad Republicans". It was a piece of pork manure complacent and complacent. <br /> <br /> Even if they agree with the "points" of this episode, only the most stupid liberals would say they liked to watch it. Again, assigning a degree of stupidity to the crazy, angry, hostile, anti-social and anti-anything-at-half-normal liberal spectrum is a huge task in itself. <br /> <br /> Avoid as a liberal convention.
