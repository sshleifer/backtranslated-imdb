This one and the one before "Toulon's Revenge", as well as the following, seem to be completely different from the first two films where the puppets were not so nice. It's basically about choosing your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets like killers, while the next three are a series of good guys. This one plays like a TV episode to be as good as the third part and I never really wanted to try to watch the fifth part of the series. Basically, a child recovers the puppets while a strange black lord or something sends his diabolical puppets to kill, this black lord looks like some kind of enemy of one of those Japanese shows such as Ultraman. The film is finished before you know it, so he must be credited with not having inflicted a very painful movie to watch. Just a lot of conspiracy holes and things in there for this to be considered a good movie. You have the chance to see the guy who played Toulon in the last movie, while you have a very anti-climatic battle and the movie is over before it really starts.
