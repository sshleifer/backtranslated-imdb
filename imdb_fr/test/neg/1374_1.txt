It does not take bullets to make fun of the retarded. Having to listen to Mencia insist that he is brave to make "delayed" jokes is intolerable. In addition, it does not take bullets to bite the spectacle of the chapel. Racially televised games, the Olympics, it seems like a lot of skits are simply reworked skits from Chapel Show, which are simply less funny. <br /> <br /> But the most embarrassing thing in the series is his insistence that he just walks to the beat of his own drum, as he walks to the rhythm of many overworked and overworked drums that have been beaten several times. <br /> <br /> I hate this show. I hate it as a voice for Latin America. <br /> <br /> And no, Carlos, I'm not trying to censor you. If people like it, then keep going. But personally, I think it's a bad show.
