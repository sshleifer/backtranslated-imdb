The two most remarkable things about "I Wont not Play" are: he won an Academy Award as best two-reel short film of 1944; and he was led by the leading man of the silent era Crane Wilbur. The plot of this banal short film is inconsequential, the dialogue lacks spark, while the acting is neither better nor worse than that found in most Hollywood films on the theme of 1940s war (in other words, it's awful). Certainly, there are times when "I will not play" is funny - the completely artificial look of Janis Paige and the delivery of lines are precious - but we laugh at the picture, not with her.
