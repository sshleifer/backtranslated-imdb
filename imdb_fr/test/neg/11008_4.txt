Although I found excellent performance and beautiful cinematography, I was extremely disappointed with the adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the important parts of the story is that Ethan and Mattie decide to commit suicide instead of continuing. This is never presented in the film, they show it as if it were a sled accident. <br /> <br /> The character changes in Mattie and Zenna are almost non-existent. While, in the short story, they change almost space, at the end of this adaptation, they appear as if they were both invalid. <br /> <br /> Finally, the fact that Mattie and Ethan consumed their relationship completely destroys the power and liveliness of the finale. . <br /> <br /> The change of narrator as a preacher was an effective change. <br /> <br /> Neeson and Arquette are superb in their representations. Joan Allen was also great, but her character was much less related to Whartons news. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the movies to accurately portray novels, but this one has gone too far and almost destroyed the story. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not recommend watching this movie unless you've read the book, because you'll come out confused and disappointed.
