The only reason I rented this movie is that Val Kilmer rarely plays in a bad movie. There is of course a first time for everything. In many ways, this film proves that lawyers are not as easy to manufacture as we think, especially by foreign directors. The only one who had escaped was probably Sergio Leone, but even his films lacked something infinitely innate to our American psyche and panache. American actors Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda helped. I can now see why they changed the original title of "Summer Love" to "Dead Man's Bounty". That even tells me that the producers and the director had no basic understanding of a western other than these classic shoot'em up scenes and violent themes. I suppose we can say the same about American directors trying to make a Polish film while failing miserably in the process.
