I just took "The Rain People" on Turner Classic Movies late at night. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight plays Natalie, a Long Island housewife who - for unknown reasons - leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip, not knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also pregnant, which complicates things. On the way, she takes a former football player "Jimmy" (James Caan), who suffered brain damage and was fired from school and hitchhiking. There's a lot of twists between the two, Natalie struggling to take care of Jimmy and she's starting to realize that he's mentally limited and can not take care of himself. She goes through her own struggles, needless to say, and is not in a position to take care of him. Natalie seems to be a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown at times; she makes some strange phone calls to her husband, who begs her to go home. Natalie tries to throw Jimmy several times, only to get him back into his life because of the circumstances. A young Robert Duvall plays a strange and troubled policeman who befriends Natalie. You always have the feeling that this movie will end badly, and it does. This film is certainly sometimes irregular and the script is somewhat lacking. Francis Ford Coppola directed this film and of course, he will soon become immensely famous for directing "The Godfather". The actors are good, needless to say, because they would all have a future ahead of them in the film. Shirley Knight is the least known of the three, though she is also underrated as an actress. James Caan is particularly effective here and he seems to inhabit this character. This film is just a curiosity now, probably because it's one of Coppola's first films, and I admit I never heard of it. So, God bless Turner Classic Movies for bringing him to a new audience.
