I was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as Frontline or "Fog of War" (by Errol Morris). Instead, I was appalled by this superficial and naive story of a very complex and troubling man and his regime: Alberto Fujimori. This film should be called "The return of Fujimori". The director presumes that she made a "perfect" film because it alienates the pro and anti-Fujimori factions when in reality it is a very biased and unprofessional work. <br /> <br /> The film has some essential facts wrong: <br /> <br /> 1) It uses the so-called "landslide election" of 1995 in which Fujimori was reelected with 65% of the votes . as an example of Fujimori's massive popular support. But we all know now that it is the result of highly organized electoral fraud. <br /> <br /> 2) The film claims that Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) killed 60,000 people. In fact, the final report of the Truth Commission indicates that there were 69,280 deaths due to political violence in Peru. 33% of those caused by SL. That leaves the other 67% in the hands of the police, the army and other groups. The fact that it uses the same misleading information that Fujimori has been using for 10 years is another example of the seriousness of this film. <br /> <br /> For anyone with knowledge of Peruvian politics and history, Fujimori is clearly an accomplished manipulator, a delusional character and a ruthless selfish person. His regime was very far from being democratic. He is still a threat to the Peruvians. Despite these facts, the director lets Fujimori tell the story. Not only about how he wants the camera to be positioned, but the narrative and direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda. He always seems to have the last word. There are no journalistic cojones, just soft questions and unchallenged remarks. Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her? The director, interviewed after the screening, did not hide that she was deeply impressed by Fujimori, her charm and intelligence. Yes, she was definitely seduced by him, and you can see him watching this movie. It is obvious that she has a hard time digesting the multitude of facts that suggest that her responsibility is related to corruption, murder and deceit. She assured the audience that her audience was upset that Fujimori was truly a "patriot" while one of the leading Peruvian journalists was very adamant when he told us that Fujimori was primarily a "traitor". She went on to say that despite all the accusations, no "dollar" was found on a bank account bearing her name, etc., etc. It was like we were seeing the same gang of ruthless thugs who had ruled the country for ten years under control. It was a sad moment for journalism. <br /> <br /> This film is an injustice for history. It is an insult to hundreds of people who are dead, missing or unjustly imprisoned by the Fujimori regime. No wonder she later confessed that all the Peruvian intellectuals with whom she had bonded while filming felt betrayed by it. Impartial? The words "opportunistic", "naive" and "denial" come to mind.
