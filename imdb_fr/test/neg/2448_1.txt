Unbelievable. I have never seen anything like this. All is bad; really bad. Photography (many scenes without focus!) At the acting game (the young woman is terrible). And what can we say about these helicopters made with Paint Brush ...? Really amazing B, I mean, Z movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is bad, cliche and bad writing. The basic amenities of the scenario seem to work. I can not even think of a young film student doing this movie. Nothing justifies it. <br /> <br /> I recommend you do not even think about seeing this movie. Sleeping or playing alone are the best choices. ;) <br /> <br /> xxx
