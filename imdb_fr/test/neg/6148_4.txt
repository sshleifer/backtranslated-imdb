My general feeling about this film is that it was a slow, long, unstructured wander through some of the truly unfortunate situations in the world, with a little redemption and an obvious message. The film is mainly composed of uninteresting video footage of the countries he visits with bad reconstructions, all slow in slow motion, at the rate of a snail and covered with depressing music. Some documents and interviews may contain fascinating stories, but contrary to what the description on the back suggests, it is not so much the story of the victim that is told as that of the director, Mr. Ripper, who does not tell the story. 'is good. This film could have included longer and better interviews with the people themselves, allowing them to tell their stories. Instead, Mr. Ripper indiscriminately draws the story for himself, which makes it a kind of personal journey, but unfortunately it is unfortunately not a big part. I never really had the feeling of growth as he explored the subject, and he never specified how the subject attracted him. He just dragged us from one place to another, slightly erasing the situation and the characters, dropping everywhere, showing too many images in slow motion with no movement of people walking in the streets, and then heading to his next destination. He does it again and again, and again and again without real development. I thought this film could have been reduced to 45 minutes, but it lasted nearly two hours, very slow. We feel morally compelled to be concerned about the issue, but the way the director indulges himself, with its meanders and uninspired, numbs you after a while.
