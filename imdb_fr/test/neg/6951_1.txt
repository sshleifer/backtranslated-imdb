Wrong. Personal opinion? The people who did it? They knew it when they did it. In my opinion, to play in this film, again, you had to meet three criteria ... # 1: You had to own your own clothes and gothic jewelry. Makes the wardrobe both easier and cheaper. # 2: You must be able to remember and repeat your lines with memory cards. Note that I did not say you had to do it well. Save time and paper. # 3: You had to be ready to be naked. Gives a R rating and thus boosts sales. Do you want to watch a better movie? Easy. Get yourself a camera and some of your friends and do it yourself. Believe me, you will not do worse. As vampire movies go, well, this one is nil. And a hint here for people like me who like to look for weird little things in movies ... Consider the link between vampires and crosses. Now take a look at the symbols and names on the tombstones of the cemetery. Parts of this thing were filmed. Ed Wood could not have planned this kind of accident better.
