Ru Paul plays a secret agent called Starrbooty. She teams up with another drag queen agent to fight the evil Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne) and get her niece kidnapped ... or something. Seriously, I had trouble concentrating on the plot! The film is apparently directed by someone with severe ADD - quick cuts in cameras that prevent focus. The dialogue is sometimes incomprehensible and when you hear it, you want it to be incomprehensible! The acting is actually pretty good except for Ru Paul who exaggerates to an embarrassing degree. Also, the movie is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just outrageous and not even funny. After 30 minutes, I had to leave because I was bored, I was sick and I could not stand it anymore. I am proud to be sitting through anything, but it has far exceeded my limits! People compare this to the early work of John Waters. I do not agree. Waters' work is sick but hey - it's just sick. To avoid.
