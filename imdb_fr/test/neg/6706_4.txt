CORRIDORS OF BLOOD <br /> <br /> Format: 1.66: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and white) <br /> <br /> London , 1840: While trying to formulate an anesthetic solution, a specialized surgeon (Boris Karloff) becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodyguards. <br /> <br /> The recent success of Hammer's THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1957), Robert Day's CORRIDORS OF BLOOD is a strange blend of historical drama and Grand Guignol theater. Producer Richard Gordon drew Karloff away from Hollywood - where his film career was stuck in a rut of movie B (VOODOO ISLAND, FRANKENSTEIN 1970, etc.) - for a couple of cheats in which men of value are upset by circumstances beyond their control. . In GRIP OF THE STRANGLER (1958), he plays the role of a novelist who discovers a horrible secret while searching for a series of murders of recent history, while in CORRIDORS OF BLOOD, he is a drug addict surgeon victim of a gang of criminals. by the owner of the East End pub, Francis de Wolff. Less a horror film than a melodrama with macabre adornment, the film covers its commercial bets including a number of thrills (a sliced ​​leg, a face destroyed by acid, etc.), but the story is mainly motivated by Karloff's altruistic pursuit of anesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during a surgical procedure. <br /> <br /> Produced under the title "The Doctor of Seven Dials", the finished film remained unpublished until 1962 because of the indifference of distributors MGM, The co-star of his time, Christopher Lee, had won a major screen credit, despite the modest but important role of "Resurrection Joe," a sinister Cockney thug who kills carefully selected customers of De Wolff's sordid pub and sells the remains to local doctors. . Lee filmed this glorified cameo before THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN catapulted him to the international stage, which explains his limited time on the screen, although his intense performance is one of the highlights of the film. Adrienne Corri (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) stands out as a criminal partner of De Wolff, and there is a feast of familiar faces in secondary roles, including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS), Betta St. John (THE CITY DEATH), Finlay Currie and Nigel Green. Superb artistic direction (by Anthony Masters) and cinematography (Geoffrey Faithful).
