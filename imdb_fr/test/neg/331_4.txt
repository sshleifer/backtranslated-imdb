I bought it out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) figure in a film made in 1995? Thanks to the miracle of unused films, the movie sequences that probably stayed on a shelf somewhere for ten years, that's how! You may know this because the film stock used to shoot their scenes does not match the film used for the filming of "Jack-O". The curse of Ed Wood continues to live. The good thing for both Carradine and Mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you expect to find in their two filmographies. Ditto for Scream Queens, Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith. <br /> <br /> The decor is set on Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween. The result: a corpulent killer with a fake and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! He seeks the revenge of the healthy Kelly family (and kills others who get in his way). The father opens a haunted garage for neighborhood children. The son (Ryan Latshaw, son of the director) has a continuous and perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and a hilarious dramatic scene poorly performed in a grave. At least he's a kid. The mother's eyes escape her as she tries to read her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who introduces herself to explain things and seems to be trying to pronounce the entire dialogue in a phonetic way. <br /> <br /> And the name of actor? You see Stevens, Wildsmith and Mitchell briefly on a television screen (they are used to indicate the time). Linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter and she does exactly what she can with. His enthusiastic performance helps a little. There's also an extravagant laugh when an ultra-conservative couple watching Rush Limbaugh's clone on television talks about it. The woman slips on a rug and stabs a toaster with a knife. It is electrocuted and the end result looks like a Muppet grilled with flame. <br /> <br /> All in all, nice fun things! I was not bored!
