I usually like movies about animals or reptiles who turn against the bad old men who threaten their environment, but I must say that Snake Island was a major failure. <br /> <br /> The principle is interesting, a group of people, including a writer whose singer William Katt plays beautifully, goes to an island called "duh", you guessed it "island of snakes, "and ask yourself what the island carries to its name. That's one thing I'm going to give to this film, there are snakes, MUCH and LOTS of snakes of all sizes and all kinds. So, this part of the film in all honesty is aptly named, but the writing, the acting and the staging are so lame that it's almost painful to sit down. <br /> <br /> The characters are so unfriendly that I begged the snakes to complete these horrible people and put us all out of our misery. There are some scenes so surreal and ridiculous that we can see them believing - snakes girant to a really horrible disco music, two women dancing a seminar together and a scene with a snake holding a senseless dialogue with one of the actors. is beyond the absurd. I think the writer was trying to be funny, but it was like a strange trip to LSD ... <br /> <br /> I remember William Katt a few years ago when he was playing in "Carrie "What a piece it was! ..not that he has ever been a major star, but to be reduced to these crap, I feel good for him. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague, unless you really like movies that feature really horrible snakes and humans.
