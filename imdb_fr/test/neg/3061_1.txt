Is this film as bad as some people claim? In my opinion, yes it is. I was not going to comment, noting that a lot of comments had already been made, ranging from "horrible" to "not so bad ...". However, I can not resist. <br /> <br /> What do you do with a movie that has, on the DVD jacket. the phrase "the true story of" My BArker and his boys ... ", and the standard" any similarity with real people ... "disclaimer in the credits? I'm not naive, but in this case, it's is a pretty nice comment about this movie. <br /> <br /> Several comments hit the performers: they are rather awful, Roberts, Russell, Milano and Stallone have something like 315 movies and TV shows to the list They can play less well. <br /> <br /> However ... the dialogue is not to my taste, and it can seem funny to laugh sometimes The arcs of the story seemed to be only the minimum necessary to chain scenes of violence and melodrama together. <br /> <br /> We must reproach the writing of the screen: Amyrillis laughs after seeing the violent temper of Ma Barker and ends with "Take The Girl! The actress abilities of Alyssa ... a writer wrote this line or this the reaction, and / or a director filmed it, and said: 'OK, it's good enough, no I think it's credible ...' A footnote: I got my copy for $ 1.99 or $ 2.99 in a grocery discount basket; run time is reported as 91 minutes, and I note that the run time is listed on IMDb as 95 minutes. I do not know what I miss 4 minutes, but I recognize that if these 4 minutes were the right kind of person in the right kind of situation, my rating could skyrocket to 3 or 4 out of 10. As I I saw that, 1/10 is what I have to vote.
