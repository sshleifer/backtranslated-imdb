Simply horrible. I'm including a spoiler warning here only because I've included one of the movie's jokes - there's nothing else to spoil because it's already rotten. These slags were manufactured during what was to be one of the seller's "For a few dollars more" periods, when he was participating in a shit for a few dollars. I had already seen this in 1972 at the age of 15, so I hated it. No need to watch it again; After 35 years, I remember it was one of the five worst movies I saw in my childhood. If I remember correctly, Sellers had more of a current role than cameo, but even his presence could not improve obsolete jokes, lame plot and infantile sharing. A recurring theme is Sellers' use of his fingers: in a scene, he raises his hand open to a group of doctors and, folding his fingers, lists the groups for which a hospital exists - interns, nurses, directors, etc. - until only the middle finger remains, after which he says "... and the patients!" Har Har. In another scene, to avoid expensive laboratory tests, he dipped a finger in a urine sample and put it in his mouth to look for sugar, then urged the interns gathered around him to do the same, 'they do. He then informs them that he has placed his middle finger in the urine, but that he has sucked the index finger and warns them to pay attention. Eh eh. (The only reason I remember this and this movie, and the writing of this review, is that a friend told me an even duller version of this "joke" today). If you do, you will love. Otherwise, see "Hospital" with George C. Scott (released the same year 1972) for an authentic and wonderful black medical humor. Better still, read Samuel Shem's "The House of God," and if you can, look at his film version, which has never been made public (please make a copy and send it to me, I would like to see finally well).
