I was prepared for a bad movie, and it's a bad movie, so I guess I should not complain. Twentysomething Tom (Robert Stadlober, gay poster) has so many problems that he does not know if he will come or not. I would not have stayed there except for the pretty girls: Serious Mavie (Anna Brüggemann); non-absurd Angie (Emma Daubas); Sarah Baumann as star of the film in the film. And then there is Tom's soul mate, Margarete (Jana Pallaske) with wild eyes. She reminds me of Beatrice Dalle and Gina Gershon. If you have to remember, these are good memories. It looks great even in the most ridiculous outfits, and I mean ridiculous, even by Berlin standards. I wonder if I would have liked this movie when I was old enough characters. I guess I would not do it. Beware of the indie idols Oli Schulz and Max Schröder of "Der Hund Marie" who perform as street musicians without feeling any pain.
