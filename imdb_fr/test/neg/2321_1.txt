Absolutely stupid movie starring Abbott and Costello. Even our young children would be more and more bored by this complete mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> Abbott as Dinklepuss. What a look he had on his face. Of course, he had to be part of that dreadful movie. <br /> <br /> Did anyone notice that Costello's mother in the movie looked like Fay Bainter? Fortunately, for Ms. Bainter, she was not in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is really no excitement to hear for children. The jokes, if any, are pretty bland. Some songs are well done but the lyrics are ridiculous.
