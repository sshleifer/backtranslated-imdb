It's a very boring and uninteresting action movie, and without Chuck Norris it would have been unbearable! Some of the fights were good, but the story is laughable and there is no threatening villain. The dialogue was laughable. I had a hard time finishing this movie, but Chuck Norris made it a little bearable. I really have nothing to say, since I was only half the attention, because it was incredibly boring, but it took a little bit at the end. The direction is terrible. Don Hulette does a terrible job here, with ugly photos, a dreadful pace, and overall, the movie looked dull! There is no gore. The game was terrible. Chuck Norris is very good here, he kicks ass and he made the film almost bearable (Chuck reigns!). George Murdock, is terrible as the main villain, and very unconvincing. Terry O'Connor is decent here and has worked well with Chuck. Michael Augenstein is decent as Chuck's brother. Overall, it's easy enough to avoid! * Out of 5 (Chuck records it from the BOMB note).
