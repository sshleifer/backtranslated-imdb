** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The main character, a noble named Fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and murderous that it might have been better to drown himself. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced "dee-SAYd") speaks to his own hallucinations and regards all intruders on the island as invading pirates. He regularly beats the mute servant Anne and tortures her reluctant guests in the dungeon. The laughs inadvertently are provided by the giant "Mantis", a "Nubian" slave who speaks with a deep South accent and helps Sade hunt down intruders in the style of the most dangerous game. De Sade's mad woman, ravaged by leprosy, provides really frightening moments as she prowls around the dungeon and kisses a helpless prisoner. (This scene was watched on television late at night by many children who took away memory in adulthood.) The near-normal person in sight is Cassandra, who depreciates for a science. ("I was a nurse, now I do not do much anymore.") She and Fallon plan their escape and meet an enemy more formidable than those of Sade and Mantis together. <br /> <br /> This film was shot in San Antonio and directed by a man more competent to draw horror comics than to make horror movies. (I'll say as much to Mr. Boyette - he's showing off his fixation with contagion, as he did in his comics.) It's a bit like Andy Milligan's melodrama minus the meat cleaver. The period wardrobe, library music, abuse of the disabled and general misanthropy make one wonder if Andy was not called as a consultant. However, Milligan makes better costumes and writes better dialogues. Technical gaffs are too numerous to list here, but you know this film is a problem when you see the sinking aperture, which seems to have been shot down in an aquarium. In addition, a film shot in Texas should have had real spiders and snakes rather than rubbers. Glorious Eastmancolor gives this melodrama the screaming look it deserves so richly. The first encounter of Fallon with the leprous countess is really horrible, as is the last shot of the film. If the rest had been twice as painful, THE DUNGEON OF HARROW would have been a classic of terrorism. Instead, it's a funny piece of schlock that trash-mends will love, for all the wrong reasons.
