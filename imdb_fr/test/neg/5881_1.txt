This film is awful. He absolutely has zero laughs. A Hebrew hammer (Adam Goldberg) tries to save Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a pretty promising base for a plot, in reality, the film does not progress beyond this principle. Although there are some (far and faint) friendly touches and the plot is relatively consistent, it is laborious, ridiculed and ultimately boring. This despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick and Greer (Hammer's customer / interest in love) all have a considerable presence on the screen. Despite being played for what could be described as wacky gags, this film is still middle-class bourgeois mud. Do not waste 85 minutes of your life on this. (note- the music was good ..!)
