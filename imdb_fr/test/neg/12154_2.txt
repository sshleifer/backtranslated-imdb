I'm really surprised it gives 88% on rotten tomatoes and a nomination for the best foreign film at the Oscars. The rating of 7.3 on IMDb ... it's not really a surprise, considering the way IMDb users voted recently. I simply can not get into a movie in which the facts about his main character have clearly been distorted, and not at all to make the film artistic, but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring. Which, it turns out, makes it really boring for anyone to expect a serious and credible interpretation of Genghis Khan's life. The far-fetched and over-dramatized Mongol often echoes film 300, a film that could not be happier if it is ridiculously inaccurate; but unlike 300, Mongol takes himself seriously. It's the stoic seriousness, mixed with obvious inaccuracies, that makes this film the most boring I've seen this year. probably the most biopic or action movie I have ever seen. The characters were pathetically written. Honestly, I doubt Genghis Khan is as boring and passive as this movie shows. Which is funny to me, because if there is something that, in my opinion, should be changed for theatrical reasons, it is to make a boring person an interesting person. The romance between Khan and Borte is just as boring, simple and stupid. Moreover, without revealing anything, Mongol contains the most stupid scene I've seen for a long time - where there should be 20 good minutes of plot development, the film goes on without explanation. It sounded like something from a Saturday Night Live skit that parodies epic action movies with a horrible rhythm. (Did I mention how seriously Mongol takes you?) In the meantime, it's like no movie I've ever seen before. Even now, I could swear it was three hours long. About 45 minutes later, I checked the time, being pretty sure it was almost over. In addition to some beautiful scenery and the quality of Asano (naturally), Mongol is honestly a disaster. Anyway, he missed me completely to have fun or to enlighten me. I would never give a second chance to this movie. And do not appear racist or patriotic, it does not matter, but give me a trashy and senseless American epic about Mongol every day. At least, I know what I get, unlike Mongol, where reviews and ratings led me to believe that it was really interesting to see. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about my hatred for the Mongol is that I have friends who, I know, would just like it.
