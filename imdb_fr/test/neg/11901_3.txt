What did Irene Dunne think when she accepted the role of this unpleasant story of a woman with negotiable morals? Irene Dunne of the 1940s, whose reputation as a faithful Catholic, publicly abhorrent coal, and who fled all film scenarios or Hollywood society, could even be interpreted remotely as a corruption of public morality - would never be associated to such a society. a dubious project like this. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Cardinal Spellman of New York, in his private audience with her, gave him a good overview of this role? We will probably never know, as she has never talked about it in the years to come, although she denounced her (1933) morally suspicious (though very successful) film, "Back Street" as " trash can". <br /> <br /> Certainly when she received the prestigious St. Robert Bellarmine Award in 1965 for her exemplary public Catholicism, "Ann Vickers" was no longer recalled by the general public. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that "Ann Vickers" does not work as entertainment or social commentary. <br /> <br /> The role of Miss Dunne as an adulterous social worker, who sleeps all day (between reforming prisons and writing a bestseller on penitentiary rehabilitation) does not match her temperament or the screen, and we continue to suspect that all this is a kind of gossip (what more can we think when we attend a montage of the benevolent gaze of Miss Dunne superimposed on the picture of a prisoner being Flagellate?) At the end of her films, she gave up on career-oriented marriage, (to condemn Walter Huston to crisp panties - and what kind of folly would he ever imagine marrying those two in a romantic way?) br /> <br /> Irene Dunne completes will no doubt want to see this curiosity, if only for the opportunity to hear her promise to rehabilitate a cocaine under his responsibility: "I'll get you out of the turkey cold and snowy !!! <br /> <br /> Well, if nothing like that happens, put it light years away from its usual middle of opera trills, chiffon and strawberry phosphates - the addiction to Cocaine is not the first subject that we associate with the irreproachable Miss Dunne.
