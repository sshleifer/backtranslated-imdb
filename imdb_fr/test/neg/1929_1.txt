Dear Mr. Seitzman, or whoever I can hold responsible, Mr. Seitzman having not faced his legitimate fate of being eaten alive by enraged Wolverines; <br /> <br /> I do not know you, so I can not comment on your character; As far as I know, you donate to charities and help old ladies cross the street. Nevertheless, I must insist, for the common good, that you never write another scenario as long as you live. Put the pen down, stay away from the laptop! <br /> <br /> If you refuse to consider the pleadings of the injured brains, I watched a movie or two of my life and I think that my advice will be useful to you: <br /> <br /> 1. Do not include love scenes in which overworked teenagers name their friend's body parts after the United States. If you have to write such a scene, please do not name the breasts "New York" and "New Jersey"; this provokes useless speculations about the cities that occupy the nipples. In addition, he is almost incomprehensibly stupid and annoying. <br /> <br /> 2. Do not rely solely on John Hughes's films to reinforce class distinctions. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not mock the audience on the head with exhausted clich√©s. Yes, yes, Kelley and Sam stand out in the rain and it cleans them. We understood. Yes, the roses continue to bloom in the greenhouse of Kelley's dead mother, even though all the other plants have started to rot. It's a symbol of their love. It is also very painful when applied to the back of the head by blunt trauma. For God's sake, Mr. Seitzman, we get it. We get it all across the country. The Amish, the hard of hearing, the unborn - we all have it. <br /> <br /> 4. Do not ask actors to perform mime sequences. Already. No never. <br /> <br /> 5. Did I mention that you should forget the banal symbolism? Because the public can draw a parallel between the reconstruction of the restaurant and the construction of the relationship between Kelley and Sam without any help. Really. We have it. <br /> <br /> 6. Go through your script and select the following lines, as well as all the lines that look like them: "I do not know what we are anymore." "I do not want to lose you." "He's like the rest of them!" (And its corollary: "Dad, you do not even know him!") <br /> <br /> 7. Yes, yes, she is in paradise, she is running in a field. We have it. <br /> <br /> 8. And in other news, we get it. <br /> <br /> I have seen dozens of terrible movies in my life; I did not expect your art to suffer and I had just left the theater, but an elephant with the words "DOOMED LOVE" painted on the side fell from the sky and pressed me against my seat. <br /> <br /> In closing, your writing bites, you owe me ten dollars and I hate you.
