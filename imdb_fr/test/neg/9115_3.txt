The configuration of "Nature of the Beast" is ingeniously simple and full of unlimited suspense potential: the seller harassed Jack (a very domestic Lance Henriksen) raises problems in the form of the hitchhiker Adrian (Eric Roberts) , who appears to have incriminating information against Jack. Oh, and over a million dollars were stolen from a casino and someone called "Hatchet Man" is dismembering people in the desert. Sounds good, does not it? A bit like "The Hitcher" meets "Psycho". One or both of these men have a secret and nothing is as it seems! Well, unfortunately, screenwriter-director Victor Salva (of "Jeepers Creepers" and "Powder") does not have enough ideas to move the film forward, the screenplay does not create any tension or suspense (a poison for this which is supposed to be a "thriller"), and the inclusion of an underlying homo-erotic tone seems out of place. Henriksen refers to a character quite unusual and not too connected to the Earth (even with a large intestine), but Roberts is as threatening and scary as an extra in "Death Wish 3"; we are never so much trapped as to worry about what is happening, and the conclusion slips into an unlikely territory (I always thought it would be a "wrestling club" again, but I was wrong). Pity. "Nature of the Beast" could have been something else ... instead of nothing else.
