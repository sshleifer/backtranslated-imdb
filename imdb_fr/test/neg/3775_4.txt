Veber is not renowned for his outstanding leadership skills. In fact, no one cares so much that they have a laugh, a good number here to be honest, scattered throughout the process, thanks to Depardieu's semi-spiritual characterization and the dialogue that Veber puts in his mouth . <br /> <br /> But that's not enough to make a good comedy since there's no movie outside of Veber's usual premise: a tough guy is doomed to team up with a very naive character. At L'Emmerdeur, La Chèvre or Les Compères, a real story unfolded over the course of the fire / water debates. The Diner of Cons, although it is a play, managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe that would cause Pinon. In Silence, the story of revenge is both redundant and too weak to arouse our interest. In addition, heavy vehicles are void both on the screen and in the script. <br /> <br /> Now, what's wrong? Veber sums it up by creating no action, no rhythm. Instead, he systematically uses and uses ellipses (perhaps he met William Goldman in Hollywood) and the "music" really highlights this lack of nerve and spine in the story. <br /> <br /> So you have to be happy with Depardieu's performance.
