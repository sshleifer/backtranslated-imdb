The reason I gave a 4 to this film was for two reasons, but this movie was not so bad. First, the editing that I found too poor sometimes, the scenario (or what they had) was not very good, and if it was not for Nunzio La Bianca, the game of actors would have summer of shit. but all that apart (ha ha I know it's like in the movie) it's not bad for an extremely low ind. , low budget movie. If they would have had more money, a little better actors (but these were intimidating, so it was good) and a scenario a little more detailed, this film would be great. Someone has to tell me that this guy was much influenced by Walter Hill's warriors. I mean, this movie is exactly like that. anyone who has seen these two films will agree with me.
