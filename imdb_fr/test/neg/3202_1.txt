Did not the author of this film see the other three? I liked the original, I thought 2 was the best, I tolerated 3 (it was OK, nothing special). But I hated this one. Who dare they kill UG? It was certainly not the Ug that almost looked like Charlie's brother in number 2. Do you remember his speech? Charlie said, "You would not just leave me on Earth, do you want to?" Ug replied, "Charlie, Bounty Hunter," saying he was now one of them. How do writers dare to ignore that special bond that unites them and turns them into a villain who gets killed by Charlie (in a particularly embarrassing scene) just because they realized that the movie was getting boring? In fact, for the first 20 minutes, we have a new cast and have to wait so long to find out what happened to Charlie, who was the hero we were waiting to see. I kept saying, "Come on, when will Charlie be here?" Angela Basset must do her best to deny having ever been to this Turkey. Moving it to the future eliminates the possibility of seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our day. I think the writers decided that their film would be the last and that they could do what they wanted. This film is totally out of sync with the first two. And it did not even seem like it was written by the same people who did 3. 3 at least had humor and could easily be seen from younger children. 4 is just ugly and petty (Eric DaRe) is particularly cruel and useless. I hated this movie. Hated, hated, hated. I hated the fact that everyone could like it and I hated the fact that it ruined what was one of my favorite camp classics. I just start with this because IMDb.com will not let me go.
