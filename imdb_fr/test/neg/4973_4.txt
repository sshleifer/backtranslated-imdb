Now we are in 2008 and we are really interested in a guy like DB Sweeney. Even then, he was not a big problem. <br /> <br /> Two Tickets to Paradise is a true story well described where three friends take the road in each of their personal circumstances. Once again, a proven plot. The problem with this film, apart from its title "so bad that its title is irresistible", lies in the scenario. <br /> <br /> Cliché after cliché, three guys do the same things you saw in every other road movie ... and blow up Vanna White's house. <br /> <br /> The job of John C. McGinley is superb, especially when compared to the late DB Sweeney. (His career is dead, hence the delay, although I learn that he is on television, so much the better for him). John C is probably the least horrible character in the movie. <br /> <br /> The score is so generic that you really feel like watching a third-class movie from 1993, or Jeff Anderson's film, Now You Know (It also took me a few years back, but at least it was more entertaining.) I mean, yes, I guess I enjoyed some of its parts. But the nerdy guy is boring, DB is trying to be that failed guitarist (with some raw influences, like some of the worst in classic rock) who has a strange relationship with a stripper, and John C is a gambler The kid leaves him after the death of his father, as well as the visit of one of his own bookmaker. <br /> <br /> I continue to look for ways to improve this film. But I think burning the script would have been a good start. <br /> <br /> But, as I suggested, this is not the worst movie of all time. And if I have to see McGinley in a lead role, I'll take it. Hope he starts having better projects.
