35 years after its creation, Castro still reigns. Unfortunately, we find ourselves scratching our heads and wondering how the stupid maniac played by Jack Palance, the landscape singer, was as effective as until 1960. I came across this case recently and had fun to notice the incomparable Sid Haig and "B". favorite movie Paul (Untouchables) Picerni among the rebels. Fleischer had visibly surpassed his climax when he had directed this stupidity. Some of the lines are classic in a "Does he really say that sort of thing?" The other thing I just noticed is that the score and the sound (NOT the dialogue) are really excellent - the only first-rate elements of all the production. So do not look at this to learn more about story or acting. if you want to look at it like a goof, bring the beers and have fun.
