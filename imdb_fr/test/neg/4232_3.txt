A trio sits at a restaurant table and looks silently in space. Later, they lean on a rail and look at England on the other side of the Channel. A man works the hoe repeatedly in his garden, only the head and upper torso are visible on the screen. A man and a woman look at another man pissing against a stone wall. Each of these silent shots lasts about a minute. Absolutely no information is transmitted that could not be given to us in about a quarter of the time. The publisher must be half asleep. I know I was. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a striking shot of the raw vagina of a body obviously dead. A throat rises. But then, the policeman (Schotte) exchanges a few words with a neighboring couple and begins to follow after them. The affair is forgotten for half an hour while Schotte and his friends exchange insult without grace between them and with strangers. Finally, the thread of the case is resumed, but moves slowly, almost aimlessly, following the stylistic model already established. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, in such films, the shot offers a kind of atmosphere that compensates for the boredom of the story, but not here. The houses of the French village are contiguous to each other. The facades of the houses directly adjoin the sidewalk, without steps. The facades show virtually no decoration and are virtually indistinguishable. The flat farmlands are peculiar. What could have been one of the most interesting episodes - visiting a stone fort on the coast - bored the trio until they began to behave like brat and were asked to go. <br /> <br /> The acting is minimal. . Nobody seems particularly anxious to say anything. No joke is made. Nothing fun is happening. The policeman has a face almost as interesting as that of Randy Quaid. The girl, a tall, fat blonde, looks like the kind of weight thrower on the steroids that the East Germans used to present at the Olympics. <br /> <br /> I sat for more than an hour before giving it up. . Maybe I'll try my luck again. Unless I miss something or turn it into an unhealthy Monty Python routine towards the end, I do not think you'll benefit greatly from praising it.
