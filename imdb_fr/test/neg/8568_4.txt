I am a big fan of horror, especially Spanish horror. This film had so many possibilities to be good. It's a wonderful idea, a ghost nun, like the essence of what has come out of Jaume Balangueró's mind. The visual and sound effects were also very good. But everything was shamefully spoiled by a bad direction, a terrible casting and a painfully bad scenario (exhibition, exhibition!). Pity. Maybe Balangueró should write and make a remake himself ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I do not really understand why it must be spoken in English by actors who do not really speak English (and when they do, they do it so badly that their performance is even more false). If you watch contemporary Spanish horror movies like El Orfanato or Rec, the performances are perfectly in tune with this type of stylish ghost story - and that's realistic, believable as someone like us, like real people because this is the only way horror achieved its purpose. Unfortunately, everything failed at La Monja.
