Nothing special to see here, the animation has been outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This film has an original story, but if it does not have intrigue or original characters, then in my opinion, it is not worth to be seen. I'm not saying that the movie was bad, it was just a typical anime story and I thought I watched it a thousand times. So, if you are looking for something original, see something else.
