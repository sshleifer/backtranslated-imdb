Ruggero Deodato is often credited for inventing the cannibal subgenre with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in 1975. But director Umberto Lenzi, generally recognized as a Deodato scam, directed THE MAN DE DE RIVER 3 years earlier in 1972. Is this a commendable start for the genre? Well .... not really ..... <br /> <br /> A photographer accidentally kills a man in self-defense and, while retreating into the jungle of an Asian country, is captured by an aboriginal tribe who holds him captive, force him to slavery and end up accepting him when he marries the chief's daughter. Throughout the movie, I never thought it was a horror movie. It was more like a drama, like A MAN CALLED HORSE, that I liked better. Ivan Rassimov is very good as a photographer, but it's Me Me Lai as the chef's daughter who is memorable and great. I have always been a fan of Me Me Lai since her breathtaking performance in JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and she is never credited with her acting career because she barely speaks in her films. She is always very talented and charming. Many real animal mutilations are the thing about DEEP RIVER that could make it a horror movie, but even that does not work well. <br /> <br /> DEEP RIVER's MAN is good to see for those who want it. to see what started the cannibal subgenre, but as an entry into the genre, is easily overshadowed by Deodato entries and even by subsequent Lenzi entries. Recommended only for finalists and fans of Me Me Lai.
