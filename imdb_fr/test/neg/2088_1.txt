This film is bad, yes, but if the producers had used a REAL KANGAROO, he would have killed the actor with whom he was boxing. I am an Australian and I have seen two men seven feet tall fight, it is not beautiful to see, the object being that one or the other kills his opponent, (it is there a how to secure the flock of females) and there are cases where someone has boxed a kangaroo, was injured or killed, so when you see a kangaroo on television or in the cinema, it is likely that it will act of a woman, or an animation, because it is a good idea not to hurt actors (they might be annoyed to lose the ability to breathe). There is a strange idea that Australian animals are cute and cuddly, that's wrong, many are dangerous (10 of the 12 deadliest snakes live here) and most are simply ugly (koalas are as sweet as wool ). So, if you come to Australia, BE CAREFUL !!!
