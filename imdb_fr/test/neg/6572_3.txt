The trip here is a search for God, the big guy in the sky, the big cheese with a beard. Skilfully disguised as thirst for ultimate knowledge. Captain Tiberius William Shatner Kirk succeeds Leonard Nimoy as Director. Shatner and his co-authors have tried to mix the fun and nerdy aspects of the series with histrionic science fiction [really, consultant?]. Where is the danger? where is the spirit of the brothers-in-arms? in fact, where is our team badly subscribed? The humor of Star Trek is a wonderful thing, when it's in the right place and done with a straight lace, as it suits what was before The Final Frontier. Some light moments exist, but they do not make up for the lack of serious moments. So do we really need another revelation from Spock? really?. <br /> <br /> Some beautiful scenery and some knowingly aside moments of Trek, The Final Frontier is just a bad cinematic experience. 3/10
