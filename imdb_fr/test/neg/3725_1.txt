I want to find the 99 minutes of my life that were lost with this pathetic excuse for a movie. The acting game was horrible! I was a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I will never look at them again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not a surprise. Everyone knows that they will never be able to act. Fortunately, only Dan tried an accent. His accent was a disaster as expected. I think he was either confused about the location of the film, or had never spoken to anyone in Minnesota. I hope this advice will help anyone who does not know what to do with their precious time. The only reason I could watch the whole movie was because I was stuck somewhere with nothing better to watch or read.
