the boys were the most attractive things in the whole movie. the girls were lame and pathetic, I mean, how can they own their own clothes, dolls, movies, production studios and not feel that bomb from afar? to get some kind of responsibility that I do not really see the meaning in the punishment ..., they are sent to Paris, very far from home to live with the so-called strict grandfather who occupies an important position with Paris. I do not really remember who he was, so who really cares? the detail is useless, the girls are sent to Paris to learn something. So, what exactly do they learn when they meet two French boys and are able to manipulate the guy who is supposed to watch them to meet them on scooters? the typical pre-adolescent film, having all the pre-teens who wish to behave badly and be able to afford the trip to Paris or a distant country far from his parents? Anyway, I do not really like olsens, they could never really get rid of Michelle's image, in full ... in case you do not see it, then you were lucky as soon as you beginning. (F F-)
