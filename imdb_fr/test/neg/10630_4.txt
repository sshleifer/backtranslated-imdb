I have been a big fan of Amy Adams for many years. I am also a big fan of musicals. That said, it's not a good movie at all levels. It's pretty dull and the acting is very, very poor. Amy Adams is awkward to watch Scott G. Anderson play because of the fact that she is in another league when it comes to acting. All performances are very amateurish. The musical performances are nice, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Scott G. Anderson is just a bad actor! I assumed he was placed in this movie because he had a great voice, but that's just not the case. He has a medium voice and sings on the keyboard, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> I guess I can understand why Amy Adams made this movie with the singing element that I just do not want to have. I could complain about other poor elements of this movie, but I'll leave it there.
