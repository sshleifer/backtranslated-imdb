OK - let's say some colleges in Southern California have a filmmaking class. And some guys were only registered to shoot girls and gave them a camera. And then they were drunk / stoned / or just too stupid to actually use a camera, and they did that for their rank. AND FAILED. <br /> <br /> This is my only explanation for this thing. God, they left the date and time counter on for a game. The image started in a new scene well before the sound, and forget the plot. Apparently, there was one and they had to tell you all about it once the 3 hour introductory sequence was over. But I'm glad they did it because I never would have seen it. <br /> <br /> KEEP AWAY from that.
