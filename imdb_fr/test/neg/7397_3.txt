It's one of those films with great potential. Bright actors, debut of a very interesting director and haunted plot of "Survivor". <br /> <br /> But that does not work at all. <br /> <br /> Start with the good thing: Cinematography is beautiful. The beauty of the Namib desert is a ruthless environment, including the photos. And then there is the acting game. Pretty good. Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better. Bruce Davison also seems to have developed his character from Altman's "Short Cuts". <br /> <br /> Next, the disappointments: Janet McTeer. Romane Bohringer. And the plot. Why did Levring choose "Lear" for their game? The very idea of ​​letting Shakespeare express his despair and inner aspirations does not work. It looks like a facade. And it is clear that the tragedies take place because of the choice of "Lear". They just need to fit into the screenplay of Levring and Anders Thomas Jensen, winner of an Academy Award. <br /> <br /> And sex. It takes about three days, then more or less all the characters are sexually frustrated. Dahh !! Sex is always the easy way when you need a crisis in a plot. The part of Janet McTeer collapses totally, mainly because of this ridiculous idea. Sex quickly drops the plot on the floor. Instead, they could have focused on dialogue. There must have been a conversation between all the characters, but we mostly see them speaking in small groups. Their conversation is as dead as "Lear" and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The King is alive" is not yet the worst Danish film of the year 1995. But comparing it to the most recent 1995 dogma films, "Italiensk for begyndere" by Lone Scherfig, this one fails badly. It's not a good movie. It's a bad one. But it's beautiful.
