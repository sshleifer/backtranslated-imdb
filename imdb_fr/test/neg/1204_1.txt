A teenager, who is not part of the army and did not train to become a jet pilot, goes to a foreign country to rescue his father. If that is not ridiculous enough, he asks an Air Force Colonel to help him get his hands on a jet [wow!]. To make the picture even more absurd, the colonel puts his career in danger by giving help to the boy. Not only do they no longer make colonels like that, they've never done it. This nerdy movie must be thrown in the air and carried away by a MIG.
