I started watching this because I was looking for a nice background comedy for my Sunday morning. Then I noticed that it would be a road movie and I decided to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes were terrible, but I wanted to give it a chance because I never judge a film. without looking at it thoroughly. Then things started to go a little better. It looked like a nice road movie about friendship. But the film started to become horrible and unpredictable. Once the film was finished, it left you with the feeling that you had wasted your time. Does this have something to say? Why did they even make a movie like this? And I was not expecting a modern Kane Citizen, but I still have several ideas for improving this movie. <br /> <br /> Then take my advice; leave it alone and go watch a real road movie. There are many. I will not make the directors of these films appear by putting their names on this criticism. <br /> <br /> 1/10
