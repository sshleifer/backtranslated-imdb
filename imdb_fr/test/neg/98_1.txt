<br /> <br /> Never take a movie just for its nice title. <br /> <br /> Although everything starts well, the film suffers from the same imperfections as those seen in B-movies. It's as if at one point the writer did not know how to finish the film, so he finished it in a way that no one would suspect him of thinking that he is ingenious. <br /> <br /> A film to be classified over the list of waste. <br /> <br />
