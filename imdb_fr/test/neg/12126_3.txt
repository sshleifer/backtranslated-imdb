The plot of "Open Graves" is very simple: it's a board game called Mamba, in which players die in real life the same way they die in the game. I liked Eliza Dushku in "Wrong Turn", but she is completely lost and immutable here. The climax with CGI-witch coming from the sea is utterly ridiculous and stupid. The only reason to see "Open Graves" are some interesting camera angles, as well as the sexy Eliza Dushku.If such films are the future of horror, I give up seriously. shit.A generous 3 out of 10.
