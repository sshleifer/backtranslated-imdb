Once again, Woody Allen seems totally devoid of inspiration other than to retrain himself. Here, we have a fake documentary (like Zelig), the structure of the film is a series of anecdotes (Radio Days, Broadway, Danny Rose) taking place in the 30s (Zelig, Purple Rose, Bullets over Broadway) about 'a weak life Harry) who thinks he is a genius absolves him from being a fool (idem). Given this film and Deconstructing Harry, one wonders if this is Allen's justification for his own actions with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter; yes, I was a fool, but I am a genius so you must love me. <br /> <br /> Allen has only produced two good films in the last ten years; the fine but surpassed balls on Broadway and the excellent but largely ignored Manhattan Murder Mystery. His other efforts range from trifles (New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite) to annoying but experimental (husbands and wives), to pure drek (Alice, Scenes from a mall, Shadows and Fog, Celebrity, Deconstruct Harry). His films do not even try to have a narrative arc any more, and his humor seems to want to be fun fun, not funny. After deconstructing Harry, I stopped seeing his films in theaters. after Sweet and Lowdown, I can also stop renting them.
