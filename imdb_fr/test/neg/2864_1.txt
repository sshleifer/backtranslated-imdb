About a bit above a movie about Olsen's twins, there's really no surprise except the repugnance of Depardieu, bouncy and hunchbacked, who walks on the beach without a shirt. This guy was supposed to be a kind of heart. Quasimodo hubba hubba? Well, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is an excellent actress, whose career in recent years has shown her full potential as a comic and dramatic actress, but this film has definitely not done anything to offer him a role of escape. Her tasteless character has no trace of personality or self esteem, spending her vacation breaking a cute boy she thinks to be the world's tallest guy at the time (mostly because he's a cute boy ), but she can not be honest with him. for two seconds. Ladies, let me tell you something. if a guy is really in you, he is not going to crack because you have tried to pass your father as your boyfriend. It may be a bit confusing as to why you would do something so stupid, artificial and uh ... incestuous, but in the end it will be something you will laugh at together. <br /> <br /> Intrigue and dialogue strike every bell at the right moment. No originality or wit ... but it's rilly, rilly SWEET and Ben's rilly, cute rilly, so the viewers who think Titanic is the greatest movie ever made will say of course this movie is great because they will not notice that this is not the case. to have a brain in his head. A star.
