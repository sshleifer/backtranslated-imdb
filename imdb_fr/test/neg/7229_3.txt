As if the world did not already have enough cheap Jaws imitations, the writer Boaz Davidson decided to make the sequel to Octopus, his creature character, a creature as pleasant as it is reasonable, a real scam of the classic of Spielberg. A cop that no one believes in, and a mayor more worried about his July 4th celebrations than about people's lives. <br /> <br /> Even in the hands of an extremely skilled director, it is unlikely that this garbage was anything other than B-movie garbage, but with Yossi Wein (yes LE Yossi Wein!) Making plans behind the camera, a man with a fraction of Mr.Spielberg's talent (I estimate about 1 / 10,000th), Octopus 2 is guaranteed to be as bad as one might imagine! <br /> <br /> The predictable and extremely clich√©d plot is not worthy of being described in detail (replaces Amity Island of Jaws with New York, and Bruce the Shark with a giant octopus gum and you'll have the main thing), although several points about the film ar It is certainly worth mentioning them, simply because they are so funny: all octopus attacks involve actors who have trouble giving their giant tentacles a appearance of fake dummy, which is hilarious to watch; Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, unconvincingly replaces New York, and the overuse of stored archive images makes the illusion even less compelling. Best of all, a silly dream sequence that sees the rubber octopus attacking our hero at the top of the Statue of Liberty, is not only stupid but stupid but also has some really awesome special effects. <br /> <br /> Davidson's script do not know when to stop: there are several moments in this movie where it could have (and probably should have ended), but the action continues over and over, the octopus survived several explosions and caused the collapse of a tunnel (capturing the love of the film and a group of children), before the hero marvels. <br /> <br /> Sometimes very ridiculous, always so technically horrible, but never really scary, this stinker STV is likely to find fans among those who are actively looking for cinematic garbage. Most normal people, however, would be well advised to go.
