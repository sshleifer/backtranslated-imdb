I rented this movie at my local movie store, without really expecting anything. As it was a category "B" film, made with a very tight budget. The opening scenes of the film were rather original, as was the plot and that's what prompted me to rent the movie. However, the film becomes very boring and frustrating in points. There were many holes in the story, and acting was also disappointing. At the end of the film, I prayed for a higher power to overthrow me to the place where I went to bed because I was extremely bored but mostly frustrated. with the way the story turned out. I still do not understand what really happened and I do not care about it. In conclusion, the devil would cry with disgust to know that hell (his domain) had served as the basis for such a crappy film.
