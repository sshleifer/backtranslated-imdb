Mmmm, a previous summary said "if you like aliens and predators, you will enjoy this film", I can only agree on this fact, this film does not respect its weighty lineage and has reduced to a little more than two of the most popular science fiction sci-fi horror films, it has none of the tensions and omens present in previous extraterrestrial or predatory films and there is no discernible main character, I did not really care about any of the characters and I wanted to see the stereotyped casting die as much as possible in the vain hope that something better would replace them, it really takes human incompetence to have two of the most fearsome creatures ever invented positively, but not being able to make an exciting movie, but only look at it if you want to see how NOT to do it. .
