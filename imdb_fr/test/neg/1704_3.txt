This film, if it had been done correctly, has SO much potential. Parody movies are always funny, and people tend to love them because they are light, stupid and stupid but fun. This movie was funny in some parts, but it could have been a lot more funny. The role play was acceptable to all actors, but ... I was not satisfied. It seemed a bit empty, and my summary title says it all about effects. Adequate green screens were not used for this film ... backgrounds were added, after which everything seemed horrible. No wonder this movie went straight to DVD lol. It was not ALL a total loss, it's funny and it will make you laugh a lot (AT it, not WITH most of the time).
