It may be the worst movie I have ever seen - it does not have good features. <br /> <br /> It looked like it had been shot in about 20 minutes, the other time being full of title graphics. /> <br /> The main man turned from the door of the dead into superman - huh what? <br /> <br /> Other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting. <br /> <br /> I left the cinema feeling cheated. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I could not send this film to anyone
