A story / a great place for a story. The action is respectable. Children are annoying and their motivation is unclear. The leading villain was a good change but could have been better. "I love you" was more exaggerated than "you complete me" but at least Van Damme had the opportunity to show a little tenderness. One of the best films of Van Damme.
