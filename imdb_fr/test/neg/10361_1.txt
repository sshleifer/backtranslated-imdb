I mean, nothing happens, 5 stupid kids go to Oklahoma to find a magic marijuana forest ... it could have been fun, without the 5 worst players in the world. And the dialogues were not even amusing. The only thing I almost showed up was when the idiot cops stopped Oklahoma or Kansas teenagers ... The plot could have been fun without a lamentable interpretation. If you even think of watching this shitty movie, do not do it. How stupid, that the guy gets away from the cops by telling them he's gay, just like his friend did (just he was not pretending ...) and there's this joke silly about the different meanings of the word "gay" "I laugh my hair ....... NOT ....... anyway ... the worst movie I've ever seen! !
