This film did not do it for me, a fan of SNL for 14 years. Jamie Gertz's performance was correct, but there was something so confusing about the movie itself. The facts presented in the film are totally biased. But Merv Griffin produced it, so that would explain a lot. He has never been on SNL and has never had anything to do with it. The moments in her life when she was on SNL are upside down. When we see her for the first time on SNL, walking around the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall dates from 1988-1989 and not from 1975. And let's talk about distribution - who is he ?? I have never heard of one of them. Really unsatisfactory. This film shows why television movies are just that, TV movies.
