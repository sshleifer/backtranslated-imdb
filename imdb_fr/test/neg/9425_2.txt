First of all, let me say that I like airplanes, and that all films with them are worth watching - and I have seen some shocking ones. However, it is not the same for this film. James Stewart is an excellent actor, but he is lost in this promotional film of Strategic Air Command. The acting is mediocre and the direction is weak. I had to stop looking at those horrible garbage halfway. Despite some very good photographs, even the best, of aerial photographs. The problem is that even for an aviation enthusiast like me, creating something from the shocking plane presented (B-36 and B-47) is just too annoying. It's a shame that the film was not shot at the exit of the B-52, so the superlatives used for the aircraft in this film would have been valid. Then maybe I could have gone through it. Maybe I miss the goal of the film, namely the anguish felt by loved ones while they are on duty. In any case, it could have been done much better. Recommendation? It's worth it to miss.
