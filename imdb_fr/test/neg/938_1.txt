Seeing this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they had better films than that, because this film did not give any hope that the public could have aroused, the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt to simpler wishes, such as a decent game, a consistent direction. , character development or actual production values. In the midst of movie school effects such as freeze-frame to show moments of emotional distress and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this film has failed at almost every level to engage the public. After the first twenty minutes of hard-working testing to take it seriously, the audience raised their hands together and began to appreciate the sadness inherent in the film. I could be sorry to have paid nine dollars to see it, and it's been two hours that I'll never come back, but on the other hand, it was two hours of fun that I will never find again. It would have been a classic episode of Mystery Science 3000.
