This film is a waste of time. I expect an action movie that there are more than 2 explosions and some shots. The game of Van Damme is awful. He has never been an actor, but here it is worse. He was definitely better in his first films. His scenario part for the entire movie was probably no more than a dumb dubbed page. The dialogue in the film is a disaster, like the plot. The title "The Shepherd" does not make sense. Why did not they just call it "Border Patrol"? The fight scenes could have been better, but either they do not have the means to buy them, or the choreographer of the fighting lacks ideas. It's a type of inexpensive and inexpensive action cinema.
