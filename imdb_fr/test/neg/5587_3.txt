I'm sorry, ELO fans, but I was disappointed with this concert at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The music is decent, but the presentation is just boring. Most of the songs sound the same and singer-songwriter Jeff Lynne is about as busy as a store model. He has a nice voice, but he does not have much to look at. He stands in the same place and sings for an hour and 40 minutes. The songs all sound like bubblegum pieces from the 1970s to the 1980s: pleasant but not exciting. <br /> <br /> Lynn is accompanied by a very pretty woman, Rosie Vela, but she is not too animated either. The only song - out of 23 - that provokes enthusiasm is the last one: "Roll Over Beethoven". Now, if only some of the other 22 songs had this excitement, it could have been a much better concert DVD.
