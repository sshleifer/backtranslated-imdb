Al Pacino was once an actor capable of playing a role without recourse to a constant coat of arms. In other words, when he could play, he did not have to talk like a street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he also became the promoter of the word "F". It may be the kind of society they live in, but most of us have the common decency to look at what we say in a mixed company. I do not remember the exact words used by a professor to explain the constant use of blasphemy, but it was pretty much like that. "This shows a lack of intelligence, weak language skills and a lack of respect for all who need to listen." Maybe it's time for Al to return to acting lessons to sharpen his talent. Oh yes, the movie ... Probably the worst thing that McConaughey played. Hope his next role will be in the company of more talented people. Rene Russo was always hot.
