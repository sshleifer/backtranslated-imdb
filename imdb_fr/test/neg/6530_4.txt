With Tomas Milian and Manny Perez ?? 'Washington Heights' is a low-budget drama set in a Latin Quarter of New York. <br /> <br /> A young cartoonist (Manny Perez) wants to escape his Latino neighborhood. When his father is disabled by a robber's shot, the young man is forced to run the family bodega. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in a budget (low resolution video and mediocre sound) with discrete actors. <br /> The plot went well for 85 minutes but the last 5 minutes were terrible. We do not know for sure if Perez and his girlfriend stayed together and if Angel ended up in jail for filming. <br /> <br /> 4/10
