Mr. Kennedy should stop playing with bad movie scripts. What was he thinking? It's a film that should not have gone to the stage "hey, I have an idea, let's do a sequel". If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it, but I guess I'll settle for a 1. It seems that these days, if there is a dollar to be won, the filmmakers will unearth a old tube and launch it by a set of writers and see what happens. (Hey, I said "Hit and Run"! A little describes what I felt when this movie ended!) How THIS trash saw the light of day overtakes me. It's filled with unpleasant humor, strange animations and jokes that do not really take you anywhere else but in a state of confusion. If you're dragged into this movie and someone pays you ... well ... but it's still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead. However, if you plan to pay your own hard-earned money, look for a better alternative.
