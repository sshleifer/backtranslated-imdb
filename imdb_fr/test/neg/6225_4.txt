Incessant as one of those noisy action movies. The whole distribution seems to be on speed. I did not quite understand the intentions of the director, if any. I wonder if she has ever seen a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, please! It's a hell of a mess and I loved Abba. Costumes unflattering photography - unflattering for the actors but loving for the places) One thing that makes all this bearable is the view of Meryl Streep ridiculing. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the movie Altman and you will understand what I was hoping for. Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth particularly embarrassed me. The audience, however, seemed to like it, so it's probably just me.
