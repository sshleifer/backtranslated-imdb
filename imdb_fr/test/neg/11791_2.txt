I guess for 1961, this movie was supposed to be "cool", but looking back now (45 years), its charm was as ridiculous as its entertainment value! Admittedly, the special effects go well on T.V. with the series that started in 1964, but for the big screen ?? I already had an aquarium as exciting! I have to agree on the Octopus scene towards the end where she got attached to the sea view. Obviously not well staged ... or trained! All in all, it's pretty bad to act with special effects of poor quality and I always recommend it - for fun. It was probably one of Irwin Allen's greatest films and I think there was a lot of thought. Barabara Eden then played "Genie" on T.V. Micheal Ansara was her husband. Here is an interesting part of this movie! I always liked seeing the real life of husband and wife teams playing in the same movie. Cared for !
