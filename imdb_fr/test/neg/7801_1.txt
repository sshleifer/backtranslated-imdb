This one is a real trap. <br /> <br /> The story simply does not live up to most other episodes of TZ. It's pretty boring, but it's funny to see Peter Falk made up like a Fidel Castro lookalike. <br /> <br /> When Twilight Zone airs at an unannounced time in my hometown, I grab a sandwich and a drink and settle down for quality entertainment. 9 times out of 10, it's finally this episode! Strange thing? It happened often to my mother (another TZ fan like me). There were so many times that one of us said to the other, "I was ready to watch _The Twilight Zone_ and guess which episode was airing? The episode of the Cuban dictator!" Obviously, some people like this episode because it gets a rating of 6.7 ... how it went, I have no idea - but that would be a great story for Twilight Zone!
