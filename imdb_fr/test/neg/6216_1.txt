I do not remember, at least for the past ten years, a film that I liked less than Mama Mia. From the non-existent act to the excruciating song, I began to tremble at least once a minute. I do not even think I can remember a brief segment that I tolerated. I know I will never look at this disaster again. I can not believe that with such high expectations because of talent - Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, a movie could be such a failure. But to see the lack of acting skills, the dance apparently induced by drugs, and then, horror horror, to hear the song of Pierce Brosnan (!), I do not see how this film would fail to become a hall of shame. . Decidedly, a film that should never have been made, and in case you missed it the first time, a movie that I will never watch again.
