I live and work in Lexington, Kentucky, the city where Zombie Planet was filmed. I had heard about the film a long time ago by various people who claimed to be an essential part of the production. Then, for several years, I heard absolutely nothing. Imagine my surprise when I found her sitting alone in the local video store, looking for a rental. Cinephile, so I decided to give a shot to these local filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. <br /> <br /> Zombie Planet is too long, boring, badly played and badly shot. - and it's just the right things. I did my best to take advantage of this, including removing my brain and placing it on the table so as not to interfere with the horrific unfolding of the story. Alas, nothing worked. Zombie Planet is so bad that it's pathetic. And the very idea that they are considering a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have not listened to any of the criticisms they have surely heard about. Move on, guys. Please. In fact, refrain from doing everything. Or attend some classes on rhythm, narration and, of course, basic direction. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, hang it for God's sake.
