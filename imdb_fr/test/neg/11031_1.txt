This film is an example of inefficient star casting, low budget and mediocre entertainment. This type of film is made for commercial breaks and not for entertaining fans of Bollywood movies. I went to this movie because I thought the first gangster was tolerable, so that's it too. The only thing that I appreciate the way the new actress has invested herself in the film in a very daring way, she looks a lot like the Bollywood actress, Nandita Das. she is good, sexy and plays well. she is definitely getting into her career. our mithunda was always good in his work. At least he's good at the movie. I did not like Imraan because his role is to advise him to improve now, because he made a lot of films as a new actor and he was seen as an established actor.
