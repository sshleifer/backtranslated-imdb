All my friends and colleagues think this show is really great. First I hate this show !!!!!!! I think I could be the only living woman !!! I only watched it because my best friend adores her and imagines herself to be Charlotte's character! <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot (if you can call it that) concerns about four Superslut women Samantha (Kim Cattrall) who probably have all available STDs and mossy, brown and green genitals , considering that she is tri-sexual (she will try anything). <br /> <br /> Samantha is not like most women in her 40s, even in New York, would have any kind of entertainment since Samantha (with some good New York scenery) is the only reason to watch and these are not sufficient reasons. <br /> <br /> Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a high-class New York classy fool who still believes in the myth of Charming Clamp! As nice and pretty as she is, do not be fooled, she spreads often enough. <br /> <br /> Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is an angry but feminist stereotypical woman. I think in one episode, she's supposed to be a lesbian, but apparently she's not ... Too bad she's almost interesting. <br /> <br /> Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), the most boring character. I swear I thought I was watching Twisted Sister's actor, Dee Snider, more virile, disguise himself, sissy boy, brother! It's a girl looking who can not live without your love .... Have you heard of a puppy? <br /> <br /> This show is stupid and I love to make fun of it because I hear how nice it is to wake up again for women. It's simply sad if you are looking to look at slutty, pathetic and addictive people in expensive clothes that drink cosmopolitan and look like a boring 15-year-old cocaine teenager that a show for you .. ......... .just use protection.
