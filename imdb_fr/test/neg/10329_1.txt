This movie is # 1 in the list of the worst movies I've ever seen, with "Lessons for a Assassin" instead. <br /> <br /> The acting game is ugly the performance was horrible!), the score could have come from a bad film rated x and the story was downright ridiculous. This had something in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one-syllable words. But unlike the average action movie, there was no real action in this one. Boring. <br /> <br /> The only reason I continued to watch it was in the hope that there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie ... <br /> <br /> this one.
