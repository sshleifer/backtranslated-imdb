Some may remember, after seeing the movie Juno, a scene in which Ellen Page rents a moment to praise Suspiria, her favorite horror film, by Dario Argento. The character of Jason Bateman then asks if she has already seen a Herschel film Gordon Lewis, and so he has a copy of a movie (I do not know which movie for now) and shows it to him. At the time I saw Juno, I had seen Suspiria and some Argento films, but not Lewis. Now, I can see that this is not just another culture of Diablo Cody's "pop culture," but rather an indicator of the characters' tastes and, perhaps more subjectively, about how to judge them according to their tastes. In other words, the reputation of Herschel Gordon Lewis is maintained several years after the end of his gore films - and it is that of a schlock-Meister, neither more nor less. In fact, less. <br /> <br /> It is therefore interesting to take Argento as a basis for comparison, because the two filmmakers approach, at least in the case of Gore Gore Girls and, thus, any given image of Argento, material similar. Where Argento is extraordinarily conscious of his craft, taking the audience into a little story through the power of camera movement, music and style, Lewis chooses the easiest way to reach an audience, with an immature storyline. and (by putting it lightly) dull direction. The Gore Gore Girls reveals a filmmaker who does not wish to entertain his audience convincingly as a horror film, but rather as a side show or as a brothel. He can not direct worthy actors, he lights up like a porn movie, and for every potentially intelligent or funny movie, there are ten that are either stinky, half too smart, or not smart enough. <BR /> <br /> That said, it may be the best thing to say about The Gore Gore Girls, a mysterious movie about a detective (a Sherlock Holmes guy played by Frank Kress, a pretty funny character) and a reporter (the fashion model Amy Farrell)) investigating a series of killings of go-go dancers is that she serves as a model for countless Troma-style images. It may be a praise, though, and the best thing to say is that Henny Youngman - "Take my wife, please!" - a few scenes and steals each of them without having to do a lot of tests. It's sad because it could be the kind of image that could entertain at a very bad level. But even on this point, we risk laughing more out of embarrassment for the production than by certain actors (that is to say, the guy who plays the cop, my God) than by a pleasure of guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Even the gore itself is a little disappointing. In the beginning, it is thought that Lewis accomplishes at least this goal, showing that these women are murdered in a crazy, vicious and exaggerated way. But with the murders, everything goes longer than necessary; I do not mean that in terms of shock value, because it's okay. But there has to be something else for it to really stick, showing faces of dissected women and misplaced eyes is fine if you are 12 years old and see this as one of your first "horror" movies. It becomes, I dare say, boring. Dangerously boring for a so-called "daring" film. <br /> <br /> This was the last film of Lewis. Thirty years later, a song apparently worthy of a swan accompanied the sequel of a film he had done before. his film retreat and his work writing books on how to succeed in business. However, whatever experience he has experienced up to this one, it does not show. It's not a failure, but it could have been the case and it's just ... schlock. Take it or leave it.
