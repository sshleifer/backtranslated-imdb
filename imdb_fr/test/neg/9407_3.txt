I'll let my bettors, uh, those here, gape in front of this wonderful and wonderful movie, and just say I thought it smelled bad. The great thing about this site is that you always get a variety of points of view and that you look for them, by all means. Do not say with what you will leave the movie. For me, those who have seen through the simplicities and shenanigans of it have my money. There was one, dead on perfect when he emphasized the two great moments of the thing, which belong to Pacino. The meeting and the airport. Otherwise, what a waste of time! Totally. Pacino is doing just the same thing over and over, he would have been better served by reducing the performance by about five notches to about his protégé. Everyone always says, but this movie could have been so much better. Of course, they could all have been. But in reality, most of them should never have been made. Including this one.
