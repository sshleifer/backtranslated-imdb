OK, if you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and you like to make fun of movies, then you'll have a lot of fun with it. Otherwise, it could be TOO painful to see. <br /> <br /> Intrigue: An obsessed cryptozoologist installs a huge crate containing a Chupacabra on a cruise ship (apparently, he does not have to declare it at the customs, or even report it brings on board of a live animal - "no, it is research equipment, ventilation holes are just an accident"). Some strips that he hired to open the box, thinking he was paying heaps of money, there may be something to steal. Once the WOOD CRATE is open, the Chupacabra crosses the steel bars inside and breaks loose. <br /> <br /> Yeah, whatever. <br /> <br /> By a stroke of pure coincidence, a Marshall (I guess an American Marshall, since he was in the Gulf War, not just a guy named Marshall) is on board, investigating money that has disappeared from the ship's safe. He masquerades as an insurance salesman ("Madam, I am your best insurance ..."). Other glittering characters include the captain (John Rhys-Davies, whose dignity is the first victim of the film), his tae-bo instructor daughter (snicker - Tae-bo), an annoying old lady with a small dog that should be fed to a cat (guess WHAT he eats ...?) and an incredibly unpleasant gigolo that could have been credible in a movie made in 1964, not in something newer. Most of the game was really bad and the characters were there to let you laugh hysterically when they died. <br /> <br /> Overall - THAT is bad. Bad on many levels. WRONG BAD. What??? The bullets do not even shudder Chupacabra, but the bimbo Tae-bo can hit him and scare him ???? Hey Sci-Fi Channel, are you desperate for scripts or what?
