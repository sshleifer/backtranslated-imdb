When I heard that this was the case, I was pleased to see that the first film was pretty good, even if it was a bit short. <br /> <br /> But I remembered some of the disasters Disney I had already seen (I look at you the little mermaid 2). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I looked at it and unfortunately I was very disappointed. The best thing about this is the animation is superb. It really has that special polish that the "good" Disney movies have. <br /> <br /> Apart from that ... the rest is disappointing. The plot is seriously everywhere. One moment is about something, then changes completely into another scenario, then another completely different scenario. It reminded me how much the movie Family Guy looked like 3 separate episodes, turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> I may have laughed up to once. Kronk was very funny in the original movie but in this film he's just not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie unless someone loan it to you for free. <br /> <br /> 4/10
