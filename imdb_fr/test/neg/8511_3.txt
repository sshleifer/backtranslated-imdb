When I was a photographer, I worked in Europe the summer when Jim Salter shot the film Three. <br /> <br /> I made him some swell pictures, one of which taught me that he would become the poster of the film. I only saw the film years later. I thought it was bad. Too bad, because the elements that were entered were convincing. Robie Porter's girlfriend was almost as beautiful as Rampling herself. Salter asked me if I would stay around and I would be an extra cameraman for not having to film everything twice. I said of course, but I had to go back to New York, promising to come back. Alas, I never came back. One of the unknown melodies of life. <br /> <br /> I wish I could post the pictures I made somewhere. <br /> <br /> Rowland Scherman
