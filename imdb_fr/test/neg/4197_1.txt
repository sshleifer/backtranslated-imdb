It's absolutely the most stupid movie ever produced in front of a camera. I can not believe I was gullible enough to rent this piece of junk. I have seen bad movies in my time, but it takes the cake ... Ice Cream, ,,, and Too Chips. Omg, I still can not understand how bad this thing was. The acting was a joke .... The plot was nonexistent ... and the camera work had to be done by a 3 year old. I have never seen a movie take so long to go anywhere. I mean, the whole film could have been shot in less than 30 minutes. I guess this guy had extra time ... (like 3 hours) And $ 60 more in his wallet, and decided one night ... (Hey ... let's go make the most stupid movie ever made .) And that's what they did. Give me a break. I'm going back to the video store right now to get my money back. Anyone who has looked at this trash should do the same.
