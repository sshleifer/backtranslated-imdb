I went out of my way to get this movie and I was lucky to have it on VHS. Being a big fan of Gloria Grahame, it was a great addition to my collection. Apart from that, I really can not say much to recommend this picture. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is to watch Sterling Hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department. Miss Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like it, like me), but the dubbing of her song hurts a lot to this image. She works diving, so let her use her own voice. This can only lend to the atmosphere. I must agree with a previous reviewer. the end borrows a lot from THE BIG HEAT. To the point of harming the end. I have seen worse movies with Ms. Grahame (MACAO), but I will never let the opportunity to see her on screen. If you have a movie night and are looking for a second feature film, this is your movie. Enjoy the picture.
