It was my very first movie "Bollywood" and I found it like many other recent viewers - through "Ghost World". Having done some reading on the Bollywood film industry this week, I understand a little bit about why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers, novels and comedies in a horror movie. But "Something for everyone" is not always a coherent product. <br /> <br /> The ultra-groovy musical dance number "Jaan Pehechaan Ho" captivated the world in a way he probably could not have done. in 1965. Everything is on the Internet now, and a lot of people are scrambling for a good English translation. Laxmi Chhaya does an amazing job, dance after dime, giving a fresh, new and fun look, even when a normal person would be exhausted! She reigns! <br /> <br /> On the beach, with Miss Kitty, it's a light and funny look that contrasts with the horror scenario. Still, I find myself singing in Hindi a week later. I found an approximate translation: <br /> <br /> if you want to live in this life, listen to what I say, leave your sorrows behind and join the party follow my advice <br /> <br /> those who want to live live with laughter and singing, let go and relax the people of this world, what do you know? come to me and I will explain to you <br /> <br /> The one who will see me will stop worrying in this world. Fish swim freely here and there <br /> <br /> My second favorite figure in the movie is the butler's dream where Mehmood is fascinated by Miss Kitty's dance. Electric idols resembling tiki are simply beautiful, as is the whole of this issue. Online, I had seen it described as what would happen if "Liberace vomited" !! It's funny. <br /> <br /> Gumnaam is not a good movie as a whole. That's why I gave it a rating of 3. It's actually a real shabby movie with fun and kitschy music numbers that have nothing to do with the murder plot.
