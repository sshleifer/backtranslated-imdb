I was disappointed with the third movie in the "Death Wish" series and I would not recommend it unless you really like Bronson. He is his usual in this one, perhaps a little lighter than in others; the rest of the cast is good if you watch a movie of the week on TV - all the movie has the production value of a bad episode of the A-Team and I like the escape pleasure of a show like that of the A-Team but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that does not pretend to be sophisticated. It takes a while before the film starts and when it finally does, it becomes out of control to the point of becoming ridiculous. The plot is out of the fire of an episode of "Highway to Heaven" and Bronson looks like a fish out of the water with the majority troop and the gun game is so out of control that Bronson's revenge does not satisfy you . the villains. Skip this and go to the 4th installment that I highly recommend.
