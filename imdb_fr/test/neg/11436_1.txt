I can not understand what Jon Voight would have POSSIBLY thought of doing when he was involved in this tenth-rate, incoherent, pretentious and stultifying slump. He helped write the so-called "script" himself, and he should be ashamed of it. The film (I can not call it a "movie" because it hardly moves) is an embarrassing and pretentious riddle - a bit like a really bad show by Oprah Winfrey, but worse. That makes senseless meanders from medieval times in Los Angeles today, with Voight as a television producer who thinks he's the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the realm from the machinations of his evil brother and who, in one way or another, is transferred to modern times where Voight must save the country from the evil machinations of an oil company leader. If the weird cast (Wilfrid Brimley, Frankie Valli (!), Kaye Ballard and Armand Assante, among others) is not enough to kill him, the direction stupidly inept, the photograph faded (it looks like she was shot with camera 16 mm really cheap), the almost total lack of editing (the scenes endlessly go on or are cut in the middle of a sentence), and the seemingly embarrassing and seemingly vague "play" of Voight is enough to bury it, this which is exactly what should have been done with her. A breathtaking experience. Avoid this dog at all costs.
