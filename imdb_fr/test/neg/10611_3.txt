I must precede this comment with a kind of confession: I guess I have a soft spot for the original television series of the 60s and 70s. I think the filmmakers misunderstood it from the start: in a supposed remake, the audience was looking for the reflections of the athletic hip Linc (Clarence Williams III), or the cool, with Michael Cole, and so on. Instead, we find Giovanni Ribisi in the form of a poor little rich and white boy, who is just pathetic, as in all his roles (in the office where I worked, I had fun once creating a fake movie poster, representing various actors as office staff, guess who I have the idiotic son of the president of the company?). Danes has the status of new Julie, but none of the characters has much to do, because the story remained there, frozen in the conventions. So it's completely forgettable. What was I talking about?
