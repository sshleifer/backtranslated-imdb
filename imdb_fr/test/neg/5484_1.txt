Do you remember when Rick Mercer was funny? 22 minutes was a great show when Rick Mercer participated and Made In Canada was also a great show. Talking to Americans was also a funny special. But as my friend said, "Rick Mercer woke up one day and was no longer funny". I think that day was when Rick Mercer Report was released. What is the purpose of this show? Rick Mercer reads fake wacky headlines, shows pictures of bad cabins that people send in the mail, and then spends about 20 minutes of the 30-minute show going somewhere and talking to people hoping to say something witty or clever to go on TV and even someone somewhere to laugh. We are supposed to be interested in seeing Rick Mercer visit a gym team and then try to do some of their movements, then suck it on purpose, desperately trying to be "funny". Rick Mercer has aged or just lost interest or is no longer funny. Even his classic rants have lost all their bite and humor. You can say that about CBC comedy in general, though, because how many years do they stick Air Farce on television to deliver the same kind of useless jokes?
