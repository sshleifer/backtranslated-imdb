Oh what a disappointment this movie is. I can not believe it was done by Wajda. There is virtually no plot and 90% of the film is made up of several people coming in and out of the screen, weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part is at the end, but at that moment I stopped taking care of myself trying to quell my yawns. <br /> <br /> Almost all of the film is filmed with a hand held camera, supposed to convey the feeling of "personal immediacy" but there is nothing personal or immediate about most of the film. Instead, the constant jerks of the camera made me seasick. To be honest, there are also some great pictures (no pun intended), but nothing makes you say "Wow!". <br /> <br /> If you are not aware of the Katyn massacre, the movie will go off you scratch your head. If you are familiar, you will scratch your head too, perhaps for different reasons. Basically, the film claims and repeats that it was the Soviets who murdered thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point is hammered repeatedly, as if someone in the audience needed to be convinced of this historical fact fundamental. However, the film never tries to explain WHY they were killed. After all, tens of thousands of Polish soldiers in other Soviet POW camps were uninjured and were released in 1941. You never know either HOW MANY people died, although the figure of 20 000 has been thrown several times. <Br /> <br /> The acting is satisfying, only Komorowska (old woman) and Chyra (Lieutenant Jerzy) give outstanding performances, but they can play for about 10-15 minutes in total. Certainly not enough to wear the entire movie. Many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their morning appearance than for their acting abilities, but I will not mention their names. Suffice to say that this is certainly not the material of the Oscars, any claim that this film was "stolen" Oscars is simply laughable. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film is also wrong. On the one hand, it is a precise historical drama, on the other hand, it resorts to an inexpensive anti-Soviet propaganda, consisting for example in showing a Russian soldier the Polish flag and using it to clean his boots. Then there are confusing scenes that have absolutely no impact on the plot, such as a couple climbing on a roof or the liquidation of the University of Krakow. <br /> <br /> There are many missed opportunities to make this movie more interesting. for example by adding a political angle to the story, showing the German discovery of the tombs, or even describing Anna's journey from the Soviet-occupied part of the occupied German city of Krakow. All of these aspects could have made up most of the film, but they have been reduced to a few minutes. In the end, we have a collection of approximately confused, confusing and boring scenes about the Poles' reaction to one of their greatest WWII tragedies. Not very convincing and not worthy of Wajda at all.
