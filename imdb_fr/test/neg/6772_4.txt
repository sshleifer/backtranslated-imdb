Danny is more than sorry. <br /> <br /> He keeps making the same mistakes and is no longer interesting to watch. At first I could feel for him, as an addict myself. My heart turned to him at first and somewhere he crossed the line. It's almost as if he continues this behavior to maintain the show, while endangering his life and the well-being of his family, especially his children. It is difficult even to have pity on the poor boy. I think he needs to watch this show, maybe he may have a chance to save this wedding. I do not understand how Gretchen stays with him, and I'm always wondering how much is fair for the show and how much is love. Danny, earn a living - a new one! ... and do not get me started on Dr. Gary. What is there with him and his face? It looks like his skin is stretched to the maximum. On top of that, looks do not mean anything, yet he does not seem particularly impartial. I think he too sticks to that for his own financial gain and often not in the best interest of Gretchen or Danny. These people are not very confused and make me think of a dog chasing his tail. Sad very sad. Go get yourself together.
