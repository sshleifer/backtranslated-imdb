6 out of 8 comments on this topic have been attributed to this film. Let me turn the scales. <br /> <br /> If this is the best that independent British filmmakers have to offer, they have to put their stuff on their cameras right now and find jobs in another area. Unfortunately for me, it's been 82 minutes that I will never see again and I hope to avoid some of you losing 82 minutes of your time. <br /> <br /> Although the idea behind the film is interesting, it is not developed enough for the viewer to remain attached. The student characters are bland and uninteresting and, frankly, you will not care what happens to them. The soldiers are almost caricatures of all the villains ever seen in the film, I always waited for Captain Markovic to spin an imaginary mustache. Some of the effects were good enough and showed a little imagination, but they were marred by the shocking game, the mediocre scenario and the irregular work of the camera. The budget might have been better spent by sending the "actors" (and I use this term vaguely) to drama classes or the Thomas Brothers to a film school or perhaps to a spell checker because the sub- titles were misspelled. The fact that spelling errors have not been identified and corrected speaks volumes about the immaturity of the entire production. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the positive comments are staged by the filmmakers, whether they were watching a completely different movie. I implore the Thomas Brothers to never give up their daily work because if they continued in this area, they would starve.
