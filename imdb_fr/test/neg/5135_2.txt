Yes, I made it all the way to the end. It was still quite difficult. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wondered if there was even a director on the set. The acting game ... well, I do not even know what to say. I thought the girl playing Emily was doing her best with the annoying, sometimes far-fetched and sometimes predictable dialogue. <br /> <br /> I know it was a small budget, but the hollow sound and lighting unfortunately made it look like a 100-minute audition cassette. <br /> <br /> I will not even talk about the end ... <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie was the music. <br /> <br /> This being said, I do not recommend this film to anyone. Even for lesbians who do not have a lot of movies to watch in general, it does not waste your time. If you're looking for a lesbian-themed movie, take a look at The Children's Hour, Lost and Delirious or High Art. These will leave you all depressed and gloomy, but you will not have to suffer the hell of cinema in the process.
