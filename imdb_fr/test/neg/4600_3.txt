does not mean that this movie is good. I was really frustrated with this on many levels. It's a bit of the hat of Bukowski's hat. Hey, I read this guy in college - see what Matt Dillon does with him. and I like mat dillon. I thought he looked a little like hank, but especially red cheeks. I have to worry about a character, though, and there was not much to worry about here. I think the time can be cruel for bukowski, and it bothers me a lot because the writing was solid in a kind of post-culture time. Hard to sit, scenes that go nowhere and a soundtrack that made me want to throw up. I ask very little, I have less.
