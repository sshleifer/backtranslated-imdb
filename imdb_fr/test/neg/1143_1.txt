I loved the original, I look at it every year. but the second is a waste that should never have been made. The second could have worked if there was another place. The son was not an original or did not even act like one of Eddie's children. Third was too smart for Eddie, which downplayed his father's role. None of the other children were there. It could have been much better. I do not know why they even tried to make this movie. There was no continuity of the first film. I will pretend that this one does not even exist. It is unfortunate that the actors did not even see that they ridiculed themselves. A very bad movie. I just think I lost an hour or more on a bad movie and I really like all the national films.
