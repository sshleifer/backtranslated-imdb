The monster will look very familiar to you. The same goes for the rest of the movie, if you have seen half a dozen of these teenage movies trapped. Okay, so they're not teenagers this time, but they might as well be. Three couples decide that it might be a good idea to visit an almost abandoned ghost town, hoping to find the gold that people were killed just a century and a half ago. One would think that with a title like "Miner's Massacre", interesting events could happen. They do not do it. In fact, only 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. I had imagined teams of terrified miners who lived in the caves of their workplace, praying for the black lung disease to catch them before The Grim Reaper exerts its appalling revenge, but instead, I had twenty-one years of land for milking - and one case, defecating - in the woods, a bunch of morons with a collective IQ would have a hard time getting a plastic ring out of a box of Cracker Jacks, let alone a treasure buried in an abandoned mine. No suspense, no fear and some embarrassing performance. Someone forgot to tell the writers that "Fool's Gold" refers to the authenticity of gold, not to the people who are looking for it. 3/10
