ALL GROWN UP is basically a spin-off and not much else of the original Nickalodeon RUGRATS comic book featuring babies Tommy Pickles, Chucky Finster, Lil and Phil DeVille, Angelica, Susie and (later) Kimi ( the sister of the Chuckies) and Dill (Tommy's brother)). I grew up with RUGRATS and thought it was an excellent cartoon. There was excellent humor, beautiful stories and the creators of the series, Klasky & Csupo, were obviously very original and creative with the concept of baby adventures. The new ALL GROWN UP series tries to find the magic of the original cartoon. I was disappointed when I saw it. I found Chuckie "all grown up" just boring and all of the "acting-mature pre-teens / trying to be popular" that applied (unfortunately) * to all * the characters, dull and faded. There are still some funny scenes and jokes in the new series and it was interesting to see how the artists would give the whole gang of RUGRATS babies a ten-year look from the original series. All in all, this show is "fair" and is only visible if a) you are a hardcore of the RUGRATS, b) have never seen the original show, c) you are a pre-teenager who does not has nothing to do, or d) you are so annoyed that you are forced to see this show. This show is not so good. This does not compare to the older episodes of RUGRATS in terms of quality, humor and everything else.
