The most troubling thing about this film is not that it's a bogus load (the CPUSA has never been as threatening to spying as the film suggests). The troubling aspect is how he whitens the totally unpleasant tactics of the FBI and the Committee on American Activities. Secret informants, gossip turned into accusations, warrantless searches - these are the kinds of things that thugs in the secret police like the KGB did, and probably what the good American patriots were doing. Yet the FBI did them and did not blink. This is the only realistic part of this film, and they present it without any sense of shame. Add to that the constitution itself by ensuring that only Communists invoke the Bill of Rights. The film also makes thinly veiled accusations that the black civil rights movement was communist-inspired, another bundle of lies. It is extremely difficult today to excuse such outrageous propaganda, even understanding the paranoia of the times, when one realizes how damaging it was for real people at the time.
