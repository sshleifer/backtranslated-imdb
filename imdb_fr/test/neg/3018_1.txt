Although it hurts me to a certain extent to take the time to baptize the comment table for this new series - mainly because I would not like to give the false impression that there is actually a semblance of public interest - I feel obliged to give up my chips on this one. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, I never felt so persuaded to look for a quick and merciless cancellation for a TV show based solely on the merit of its promotional commercials. And, in case you're wondering, I'm a guy. <br /> <br /> Listen, Comedy Network: although your existing original programming is already, we will say politely, of "dubious" quality (I'm watching you, "Girls Will Be Girls") you're are really surpassed on this one. Anyone who set the green in this area could not be further from what is cool right now. <br /> <br /> Good luck.
