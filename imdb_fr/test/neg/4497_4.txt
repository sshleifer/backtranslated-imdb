The photography is done, the acting is pretty good, but in almost every other department, the Greek tyrant is sad. Drawing inspiration from the true love affair between Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, the film is an icy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on television all day long. Viewers who embrace the entire "celebrity magazine culture" (paparazzi photographs and gossip stories about the rich and celebrities) will undoubtedly find much to be desired here. But those who prefer movies with a little more stuff, crafts and quirks will find that the 107-minute duration is a numbing slogan. US President James Cassidy (James Franciscus) and his beautiful wife Liz Bisset) are in Greece for official business. Theo Tomasis (Anthony Quinn), a ridiculously rich Greek shipping magnate, sees Liz at a party in his elegant mansion. Although they are both married, there is an immediate attraction between them. Later, at a private party aboard her yacht, Tomasis makes her wishes known to Liz. Some time later, President Cassidy was assassinated while he was walking on a beach. Liz is shocked and saddened by her death, but she does not take long to seek comfort in the arms of her Greek lover, Tomasis. Finally, they are married and their love story becomes a favorite subject for newspapers, magazines, photographers and magazines around the world. <br /> <br /> It is amusing to note the vigor with which the producers of this film denied that it was a dramatization of the Kennedy-Onassis story. They wanted the film to be seen as an original story rooted in fiction. But whoever has a brain can see where the film comes from. Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew that The Greek Tycoon was tantamount to a love life like Hollywood treatment (according to rumors, he would have actually endorsed Anthony Quinn's role in Tomasis!). the right kind of director for this type of movie ?? it is better suited to forages like The Guns Of Navarone and Ice Cold In Alex ?? but he directs the debates with uninspired professional adequacy. Quinn is very observable like Tomasis; Bisset looks charming as the object of his desires; Franciscus uses his grin and an honest facade to create a credible politician. Their performances are good on the surface, but the actors have little to do on a deeper level. Similarly, Tony Richmond's photographs give the film an elegant and brilliant surface when moving from one exotic place to another, but the slightest scratch proves that there is nothing behind the glossy surface of the film.
