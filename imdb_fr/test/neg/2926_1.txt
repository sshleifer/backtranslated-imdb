I just went to the cinema in downtown Prague to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not because of the poster that I found the very old-fashioned heroic style of Holywood <br /> <br />. This is not due to the high level of stars that remind me that most of the <br /> <br /> French films in this category are usually pathetic. But just <br /> <br /> because there are not many films in French mother tongue in a city <br /> <br /> like Prague. And because I love Cyrano, Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau <br /> <br /> Then I decided to write this little comment because I think I really do not agree with the main thread comments on this movie on imdb. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The film looks like the poster. The characters <br /> <br /> are as stupid as they look. For a moment, I thought Adjani would be like a caricature - a funny character, you can laugh about it. No she is not! For example, when she decides to say to <br /> <br /> Depardieu that she is the one who murdered the fat death that she killed at the beginning of the film, the violins then arrive in a big big pathetic <br> <br /> <br /> a music that should make you cry and realize that the character of Adajani is a deeper person <br /> <br /> to which she looks like. Maybe it was humor on the 10th level <br /> <br /> but I regret that my sense of humor is not so high! If I want to <br /> <br /> see a funny French movie about the Second World War, I'm watching La Grande <br /> <br /> Mop again! It's definitely more fun! I also read on imdb <br /> <br /> that Lemoine achieved an excellent performance in this film. I must <br /> <br /> say that I have never seen such bad acting! (Well, I've never seen any film from Ed <br /> <br /> Wood). Nevertheless, the film is well filmed with many good scenes <br /> (very expensive) like the one with the morning Pantheon <br /> <br /> when the German army arrives in Paris or when the refugees settle down on a bridge in Bordeaux <br /> <br /> I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker but <br /> <br /> he does better with a good script. It was easy with Cyrano. <br /> <br /> He should not write dialogues! <br /> <br /> I give 1/10.
