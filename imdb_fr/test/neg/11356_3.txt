This criticism contains revelations. <br /> <br /> I was looking for DVDs of horror movies on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. I already knew from the name that it was going to be terribly boring and most likely a Snakes On A Plane scam, but since it was selling all new at 69p, I thought I did not have much to lose . <BR/> <br /> The music of the opening credits did not suit me at all, although I liked the song itself, a pop-rock song is not really suitable for appearing on the original soundtrack. a zombie horror movie. It started surprisingly well, the first scenes were not so bad, some actors were a bit crazy, but not as bad as I thought at first. <br /> <br /> All goes well until Laura Cayouette (Kill Bill Rocket: Vol 2) enters the scene. She is supposed to play a scientist. If she is, she is not very bright. Fortunately, she was eliminated fairly quickly. <br /> <br /> In fact, I burst out laughing when the camera tilted over the plane's passengers during turbulence. There was a nun. Have you ever flown with a nun? I was surprised she did not cling to a crucifix. <br /> <br /> Finally, after 35 minutes, we take action for zombies and use the word 'action' loosely. The special effects are pretty much below the norm, but expect a movie with this budget. Being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a zombie, it looks rather fun. The use of slow motion does not work particularly well either. I think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much story. Trying to spread the problem as a variant of the "malaria virus" was not particularly sensible, as malaria is not a virus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film unfolds like any other. another zombie movie. Most of the characters are killed and finally a handful of people are fighting to stay alive. The worst part of Flight Of The Living Dead is perhaps the end absolutely inconceivable. I know it's a movie about people coming back to life and enjoying themselves alive, but the end was just ridiculous. Rating: ★★
