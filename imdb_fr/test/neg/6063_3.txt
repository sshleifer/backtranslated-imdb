After the suicide of his father, Charlie 'Kid' Davis (Ray `Boom Boom 'Mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend Tiny (Michael Chiklis) and goes to Las Vegas with him to try to become a boxer. On the road, they meet Gina (Jennifer Beals) hitchhiking, they take care of her and she becomes Charlie's girlfriend. Johnny Ticotin (Rod Steiger) is convinced by Tiny to be Charlie's couch, and the powerful agent Alex Dumas (Joe Mantegna), after seeing him fight, becomes his manager, promoting Charlie's career. This film is so boring that it does not deserve to spend a lot of time writing about it. I do not like boxing, but sometimes I watch an interesting movie on this theme. But this one is horrible! Predictable, full of clich√©s, having a terrible actor, a waste of time. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Corpo e Alma" ("Body and soul")
