I notice that I am less and less enthusiastic about the Disney movies. Yes, I understand that the budget for direct filming is not the same, but these films do not even try. Some examples are Hunchback II and Tarzan and Jane. If anyone has seen the glimpses of Stitch-The Movie, you'll see what I mean. But I move away from the subject, this film reaffirms my point. The animation is sloppy, the stories are like Saturday morning cartoons and not all the original voices are there. I was very disappointed not to hear the voice of Michael J. Fox. It was so obvious that the person who was doing Milo's voice was trying to look like Fox, but could not succeed. <br /> <br /> If that says anything, my 10 and 6 year olds did not even sit around the movie.
