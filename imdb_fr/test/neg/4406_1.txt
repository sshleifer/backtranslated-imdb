It was one of the most dishonest, meaningless and non-peaceful films I have ever seen. The representation of the other, the Israelis, was racist, backward and unjust. For its part, the song broadcast on the car of the radio E.S when it intervened alongside an Israeli driver of very right was "I cast you a spell" of Natacha Atlas. The style of the song is quite Arabic, but it was published on an Israeli compilation CD, and I even heard it on the radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, food and slang) are influenced by Arab culture, and there is no reason for an Israeli Jew to be offended or irritated by a nearby car playing this song. The way E.S. seems so calm and collected with his sunglasses and his cold gaze, via a long motionless shot, is intended to compel the viewer to see the Jew as haggard and racist, and noble and temperate E.S. <br /> <br /> I have traveled all over Israel and I have never seen an IDF recruitment poster, because the meaning is obligatory. But in the film, not only is there a recruitment poster, but it portrays a stereotypical image of an Arab terrorist and the words "want to shoot?" This is an extremely inaccurate representation of the mentality of the majority of Israelis and Israeli soldiers, and such "publicity" would not even exist on a random Israeli road. By including it, the director wants to convince the public that Israel is an anti-Arab racist society that is keen on murder. <br /> <br /> The ninja scene was gratuitous and unnecessarily violent. A Hollywood-themed action scene in which Israeli soldiers are shooting at Palestinians would be just as undesirable in a film made by Israel as the ninja scene should have been. But for some reason, images of an unrealistic, non-comical and violent scenario manage to arouse the applause of the audience since the director has so much dirtied the Israeli side in advance that any shooting of Israeli soldiers by train to be killed would be welcome. The director shows no attempt to build bridges, to portray the other as a human being or to work for peace; violence is meant to be the only solution. This is reinforced by scenes of tank explosions, falling guard towers and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends serves in the Israeli army, and targets in the shooting ranges are never Arab women dressed in black, nor any other quasi-civilian on canvas. Soldiers at checkpoints have been ordered not to shoot an approaching Palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; the method, according to my friend, is to throw a warning cry, to shoot in the air or around the area, then, if all else fails, shoot in the leg, then interrogate and hospitalize. To arbitrarily target a woman's head, as the film shows, is not the right procedure. <br /> <br /> In addition to these inaccuracies, the style of realization was also mediocre. Repetition has become repetitive and no longer captivating. Symbols, such as the balloon on which Arafat is drawn, are forced out of any parcel structure or effective integration into the frame; the balloon is Palestine entering and returning to Jerusalem and is being created for no reason by ES The ambulance controlled by Israeli soldiers to obtain the permits, followed by the following Israeli ambulances flying over the checkpoint, is an overtly overt assertion of double Israeli standard of the director. The director's attempt to portray life in Nazareth as bleak and useless is excessive. constantly showing the routines of random people, even with a slight change each time, and emphasizing that no cast member ever smiles and that the minimalist dialogue almost cries out the purpose of such scenes, the sadness of life, without leaving much room for personal interpretation. By comparing a "section" of the film, the daily life in Nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel, the director subtly blames this gloom on Israel, but never provides any direct proof of why such a mistake can be properly I spent hours trying to understand why the music stopped abruptly and started abruptly, and why many modern pieces, resembling fashion shows and metal games, were included in the score . I still can not find an answer. I felt that music was out of place in this movie; the contrast between quieter scenes and intense scenes was really annoying and did not affect or provoke reflection. I can understand if the director wanted the music to make some scenes comic, but I found that there was nothing comical about Israeli soldiers firing at targets or fighting a ninja, or woman who was to undergo another walk. a checkpoint, albeit with defiance. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes and annoyed by the lack of score during quiet scenes. Whatever the director's intention, the film only provoked auditory discontent throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This film contains no legitimate political message, because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other and neglects to solve all the problems. It is a propaganda film, because the director intends to use various symbols, styles and scenes to attract sympathy on the Palestinian side, while displaying the Israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception; The vibrant atmosphere of an action-packed Hollywood scene or intense music is present in every act of violence perpetrated by Palestinians against Israelis, so that the almost inevitably positive and delighted feelings that music and cinematography arouse the public are directed aside. There is no thought, reflection or deepening of the public's understanding of the conflict; The emotions are simply set aside and kept there, in a clich√© "good versus bad" scenario. I believe this film lacked the depth, quality and power of other Palestinian films, such as "Paradise Now" and "Wedding in the Galilee".
