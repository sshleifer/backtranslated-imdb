It is difficult to criticize a film whose title is 'Deathbed: The bed that eats' and which involves a ghost narrator trapped behind a two-way painting he drew and a bed that snores and ?? if I'm not mistaken, masturbates. (Now, it's up to his fellow humans!) In addition, he foams (in orange, whatever the reason) to absorb the food covering his surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and, of course, the people. Again, just say that you do not expect too much when you see what I suppose to be stomach acid ?? the final rest of all that orange mousse takes ?? dissolve only certain things. It'll drink the wine, but the bottle is fine and it's gnawing on the chicken bone, but the bucket is fine. Heck, the bed replaces even unused containers. Hilariously, he falls at some point on Pepto-Bismol. I had to laugh at that one. I do not think they really wanted you to take this seriously. It's a small budget, and it's extremely easy to see where they are cutting costs and saving a lot of money. I thought that in a world where there could be a murderous "Lift" and a "blood beach", this "death bed" could be fun to watch. For reasons that can lead to costs, 90% of the film is doubled, no one screams or shows extremely weak signs of fear / confusion as to why a bed was going to attack (I can think of a "children who have jumped on the bed) and you will have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief. (A victim loses all flesh on his hands while barely saying "I'm fine".) One scene, which lasted too long, was extremely tense ?? a woman tries to move away to be dragged back with a sheet. Where are the guys from MST3k?
