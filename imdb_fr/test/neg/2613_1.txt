You know, I'm sure the boys were sitting around the desk one day and said, "HOW CAN WE MAKE MORE MONEY?" They had made all possible variants of toys with their current characters. So they decide, let's steal the idea of ​​Star Wars, PREQUEL, and we can create all the new characters and sell them as toys. Incidentally, something they did in puppeteer 3, but who cares? Anyway, they choose a moment before the first movie, when Toulon is still alive, he and the puppets are sitting around. A wooden head rolls on the ground and the puppets want to know if it is a deceased family member or something like that. has no importance. Thus begins the story of the ancestry of the puppet master. It's long, it's boring, nobody cares. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that they tell the origin of these new characters in the film, but give no indication of their fate. SO GUESS WHAT, once the income generated by the new toys has been depreciated, they can finance a new sequel (called 4th rotten suite), titled "PUPPET MASTER 8: THE SEQUEL TO THE PREQUIN OF THE DEATH OF DEATH RETRO PUPPETS " hold your breath!
