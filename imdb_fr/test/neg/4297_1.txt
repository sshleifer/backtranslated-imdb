As a film and flight buff, this ranks at the bottom of my list. This is historically completely inaccurate and the actors sound and act as if they had just come out of a play in high school. The acting, the script, the direction, the standards of production and the casting are waste. The only thing that saves is some of the flight sequences. If the people they describe were fictitious, I might say a 2, but if there's one thing that bothers me more than anything in the cinema, it's like it's history and it's is the great people they were trying to be, did that! It's almost as if they were trying to write as many of the notable personalities of the First World War as possible. There are many good films about the First World War and it's NOT one of them.
