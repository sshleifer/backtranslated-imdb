What is the purpose of this film? It starts like a movie, then changes tracks, deceiving us of one resolution of this film and ends with another film that is nothing but a pale pale imitation of so many other horror movies that you have seen. The general impression is confusion in all respects and a lot of pride. Scenario of Tarantino, under the direction of Rodriguez, two guys who have already shown talent but who now seem to believe in their own hype and who assume that everything they do must be good just because they do it did. But it does not work that way. You are only good while you continue to do good things. There are so many questions to ask: what exactly do George Clooney and Harvey Keitel do to engage in such a useless sinking? Clooney first makes an intriguing villain ?? quite ruthless and effective ?? and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. But of course we never do it. And the Clooney of the vampire movie turns into a completely different character. It's neither intelligent nor spiritual, it's just bad work. Keitel looks completely uncomfortable, and no wonder. Did not anyone in the studio have a look at the script before this project was approved? Tarantino is quite unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why, as a writer, did he assume that we would find the rape, the gruesome murder and the massacre of a harmless hostage funny). At all levels ?? except the technique ?? this film stinks. To avoid.
