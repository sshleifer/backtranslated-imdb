It would be a good term to describe this film. But as this film does not deserve to be said good, I will use the term "awful". <br /> <br /> Focusing on the adventures of a group of eco-warriors investigating the evil deeds of the military on a semi-tropical island, the lack of budget appears quickly. Michael Par√© (a real actor, only in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy ...) guides the group of fools through a series of scenes of monster victims chasing and engulfing. There is a vague attempt at pseudo-science to explain the presence of giant reptiles, but it convinces the viewer as much as playing. <br /> <br /> As if that did not insult the viewer enough, the film also includes what I will call "endless ammunition rifles". I have never seen Mickey Parrot or his female side kick clips change once throughout the film, but I can positively say that they have completed at least 40 shots in each of the scenes where they are forced to shoot with their weapon. Forty turns may not seem so many, but we are talking about standard handguns. I figure 15 round clip, vertices. And remember, they never change staple and do not even seem to carry extra ammo. <br /> <br /> That's how that's how movies entrust films to the eternal fires of celluloid hell, and rightly so. The third class CGI does little to help things and it is better to make fun of the game, otherwise you will start crying. Why does SciFi Channel run this porridge a few times? Everyone will guess it. <br /> <br /> My advice: give it a large place ... a very wide!
