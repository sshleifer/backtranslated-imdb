I was expecting a lot of this film, but alas, I feel abandoned. I bought it for $ 5 from a used VHS store, and the version I bought was the dubbed version. The dubbing is awful, so beware. "Lola" was just not as good in this film as in "Run Lola Run", and the villain just came out of nowhere. And "Lola" begins to understand what happens the second she arrives at the university. It seems unrealistic to me. I also wondered if in the original version there were American songs in the soundtrack ... they seemed extremely out of place. Too bad for this movie, I really thought it was going to rock.
