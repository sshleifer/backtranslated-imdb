The film is a pathetic attempt to redo Ingmar Bergman's (1978) "Autumn Sonata" with Ingrid Bergman, Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson. It did not take me more than 5 minutes to understand it. <br /> <br /> It's time for journalists like Khalid Mohammad to take the time to be creative. It makes me sad when talented filmmakers ruin their talents by making non-standard remakes of Hollywood and European films. <br /> <br /> But you have to give something to the director. The film he chose for the copy is one of Bergman's classics, and easily one of the finest examples of the representation of a strained human relationship in European cinema.
