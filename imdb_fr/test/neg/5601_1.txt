Honestly, I do not know what legal or illegal stuff they used when writers wrote this horrible piece of guts! <br /> <br /> The casting - sucks The plot - sucking The editing - sucking The whole place of the movie is that a girl with psychic / telekinetic powers meets a sorority of lesbian vampires, you must be completely crazy about your head to watch even a minute of this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I had to watch - it was on here! network as part of a purchase of two images and the film that appeared after it was the real movie that I wanted to see. I made a quick advance through the entire movie and was amazed at the stupidity of this double-speed movie! <br /> <br /> Do not rent, buy or watch this movie .... the vampires of the movie do not do it sucks as much as the whole movie and the production! <br /> <br /> If you want a good lesbian vampire movie - The Hunger with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon and Katharine Deneuve - great movie to watch / own / rent instead of this piece of pure sh * t
