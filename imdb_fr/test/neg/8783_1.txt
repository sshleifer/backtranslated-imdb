This film is totally bad !!! Do not rent it! You will hate him! The plot did not make sense, the characters were nil and why did this penguin try to get the pebble anyway? If this penguin loved him only because he had a pretty pebble, his relationship would not be based on love, but only on money! This film displeased me a lot (hate is such a strong word!). And the penguins can not fly! Even if they believe they can do it, they can not. p.s. I am not who you think I am!
