Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the last 10 years. The script of James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's companion, is about as pathetically written as Wesley Crusher in Star Trek TNG, and is played with about as much conviction. <br /> <br /> In this show, people do not react as people react to things in real life - everyone is polarized - everyone is either a good guy or a bad guy (unless that Walker himself has a 2-minute conversation with them and that they change instantly). That's not how life works, that's not how people are. This show does not take place in this reality. <br /> <br /> The plot is about as realistic as Murder She Wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can go to people's homes without getting upset, she can demand that the police do this she wants and they go out of their way for her. With Walker, all the actors in the series, including the "bad guys", act as if he were the kind of hero whose myths and fairy tales are made, and that time itself is his fantasy. The lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are more than ridiculous. It's as if the scriptwriter for the role of Wesley Crusher (for the "serious" parts) and the screenwriter for the funniest videos of Bob Saget (for the "humor" parts) have come together and written all the scripts of this issue. <Br /> <br /> This show is for people who think that good always wins over evil. It's for the elderly. It's for godly thinkers. This is for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending. It's for people who want to get lost in oblivion. It's for people whose TV is the drug of choice. <br /> <br /> I grind my teeth every time I see an advertisement for this show. My opinion is that it's the worst TV show of the last 10 years. <br /> <br /> I liked Chuck Norris, but this show has always altered it. I can not even watch his old movies without thinking about this show.
