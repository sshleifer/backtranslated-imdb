First of all, I am surprised to see that this movie got a score of 7 on this site. At first, I figured maybe it was people in the industry who were connecting to IMDb and picking up the note. but after looking at rotten tomatoes and finding that this movie has an approval rating of 76%, it seems like people may have just been fooled again to confuse with pretentious shit depth. I mean, this movie is just horrible. the acting is simply terrible, but the rest of the movie is worse. at least the actor provides some laughs (unintentional). <br /> <br /> The plot involves a teen skateboarder who is interviewed with his friends for a murder committed in a park where they skate. And that's about it. the rest of the film is made up of the terrible acting game mentioned above, the terrible dialogue, slow-motion shots of people walking, faces, people skating, often put on music that does not fit the stage. maybe that was done to be "cool" or experimental or hip. or maybe it was done in the hope of deceiving people into believing it's somehow deep, but it does not work. nothing in this movie works. it's a pretentious bin. I can not recommend it enough.
