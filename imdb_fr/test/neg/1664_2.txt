Linda Arvidson (as Jennie) and Harry Solter (as Frank) enjoy a romantic date when her father Charles Inslee walks around; furious, he drives Mr. Solter out of the house. Unshakeable, he goes to his balcony and begs her to flee. Ms. Arvidson agrees and will pack. Then, the burglar George Gebhardt manages to steal the place. Although he does not get much loot, thief Gebhardt manages to use the Arvidson trunk to escape the police. <br /> <br /> An artificial comedy. Note that during the balcony scene, Solter goes into sleep mode so that the burglar Gebhardt can enter the house undetected. And, Arvidson travels very light, because it seems that there is nothing in his heavy trunk; maybe she just wanted to improve beautiful Solter? Director D. W. Griffith, Robert Harron and Florence Lawrence are illustrious extras. <br /> <br /> ** A calamitous fugitive (8/7/08) D.W. Griffith ~ George Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson, Harry Solter
