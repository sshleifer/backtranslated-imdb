I will admit that I did not pay much attention to everything that happens in this movie, but to be honest, I do not think it would have mattered. Local Councilor Sidney Fiddler (Sid James) persuades Firecombe's incompetent Mayor Frederick Bumble (Kenneth Connor) to hold a beauty contest to improve the image of the city. They face the opposition of feminist activist Augusta Prodworthy (June Whitfield), who is trying to sabotage the competition, but she also has advertising agent Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslaw) and the owner of the hotel Palace, Connie Philpotts (Joan Sims). Soon, young and beautiful models will appear, including Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor), Paula Perkins (Valerie Leon), Dawn Brakes (Margaret Nolan of Goldfinger), Debra (Sally Geeson) and Ida Downs (Wendy Richard of EastEnders). When the girls have catfights, it keeps the usual residents away, but after a while of not-so-funny walkers and William (Jack Douglas) having excessive contractions, he finally reaches the competition, and it's just after could not be bothered. Patsy Rowlands, Mildred Bumble, Peter Butterworth, Admiral, Joan Hickson, Ms. Dukes, David Lodge, Police Inspector, Angela Grant, Miss Bangor, Arnold Ridley, Councilor Pratt, Robin Askwith, Larry, Patricia Franklin, Rosemary, Jimmy Logan and Rosemary As the chief of Cecil Gaybody's fire brigade Billingwee and dad's army, Charles Hawtrey had obviously left the Carry Ons, but where is Kenneth Williams? I guess seeing Babs and Pauline Fowler's beautiful young beauty in a bikini, but when it comes to the value of comedy, it fails miserably, and the misuse of the Swanny whistle does not scare you. Pretty poor!
