I used to think that it could not be worse than "Army of the Dead" but this load of shit gives this film the same aspect as "The Godfather" !! Special effects are HORRIBLE (Gives Nintendo's original design the look of HDTV). When it comes to playing, tell me, I went to a play with my 6 year old niece and she gave a performance worthy of an Oscar, compared to these D-List (and that's nice about it) actors and actresses. So, basically, if I had a weapon in my head and head between choosing to watch this movie again or cut my arm with a dull knife, it's a tough choice !! You know what, who needs two arms anyway ??
