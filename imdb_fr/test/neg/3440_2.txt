I love how everyone treats this show as if it's the next big American sitcom. I watched five episodes of this abomination, and the only person who approached a real teacher was the old man who loved and hated his work. The rest of them were just pretty people who were trying to read the lines written by people who had never entered a real classroom. I loved how each episode consisted of two idiots (one who got fucked and the other who did not) who found themselves in a form of wacky trouble that indirectly involved their students. The British girl who thought she had found a nice quality in the main idiot, was finally shocked to find that he turned out to be a fool. The hot girl who was there for the particular purpose of being hot, and the director and her lackey who served to advance the conspiracy almost nonexistent. I loved the fact that almost all the teachers on this show were very young, but I ask you to think back to your years in high school and to remember the teachers you had. . . did they look like this? Or did you go to high school where middle-aged people taught? This is the high school that everyone else has attended. The show lacked any form of research on what goes on in schools. In public schools, principals do not have the power to eliminate teachers and dismiss teachers, unlike the school council, but at every episode I saw the principal threatening to fire her teachers. Think back to your history class. . . . . or think of a history class, have you ever seen an incredibly hot British chick teach an American history course? Have you ever seen a teacher lounge so big that you can play basketball? No. <br /> <br /> The teachers could have been a great show if they had been based on a form of reality. What makes learning fun is the stories you receive through student interactions, and teachers find it fun because they deal with students day in and day out. The excessive emphasis on their life outside of teaching has simply made another four-camera sitcom with unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines, and I'm sorry, I just have not purchased. The show could have been inspired by other sitcoms that were already successful and use a single-camera format. It should have been more focused on the teacher's relationship with his students and not between them. <br /> <br /> He gets a star to try and a star for the hot girl (she was really hot). <br /> <br /> Finally, it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a hacking attempt to understand a trade. I only hope that if they form another teaching-based sitcom, they learn from their mistakes so that such a monstrosity never touches the television screen.
