Some twists to come. <br /> <br /> The so-called renaissance of the Nashville network as "the first network of men" is a complete disappointment, as is its block of adult cartoons. The new Ren and Stimpy were just awful, "Gary the Rat" at best mediocre, and "Stripperella" rather unassailable. This cartoon is mostly boring; If "Ren and Stimpy" have been brutally overexploited, "Stripperella" has no decent shock gags, funny and mindless gags, clever gags or gags, period. The concept is bad in its infancy: Pamela Anderson, a stripper-super-heroine, saves "The City" from an assortment of zany supervofaines. This caricature seems to be a tribute to super-zany superhero periodontiums, like "Darkwing Duck" and "The Tick", but without the wit and good writing of these cartoons, or even a good storyboard. "Agent 0069" tries to waver between sexy and sexy, but she is neither, and the failure of this caricature to do one or the other would film this series. <br /> <br /> Watch your recorded episodes of "The Tick", "and see what a true cartoon of parodic superheroes looks like.
