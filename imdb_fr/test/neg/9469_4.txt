Telly Savalas made a passable (but no better than that) performance as Pancho Villa, the famous Mexican / revolutionary bandit in this account of Villa's raid on the city of Columbus, New Mexico, in 1916. Villa is not really a historical character too familiar with, so I will not say much about the historical details of the film. As a film, it's not great, although there is here and there a little action and humor. The performance of Chuck Connors as Colonel Wilcox, commander of the US Army Base near Columbus, seemed a little exaggerated, and Clint Walker as Gringo's escort in Villay, Scotty, did not not really brought much. The film is obviously a small budget effort and of limited technical quality. For a film whose duration is only a little over an hour and a half, I must say that this film has dragged in places, especially in the last 20 minutes. The Villa raid in the United States was an interesting historical sidebar (though, overall, unimportant), and probably deserved better treatment than this one. 4/10
