Hello Y'all, <br /> <br /> I bought it on DVD from England. You see, I have one of these multi-region actors. I thought it would be fun to get a nice movie to show to my friends. Well, surprise for Amy-Jo Johnson, she's barely in the movie. Although she is on the cover. It is very difficult to imagine how such a bad film was shot. Maybe someone has a trust fund. <br /> <br /> Oh ... it's about vampires living on the beach
