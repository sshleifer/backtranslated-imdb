Yes, there is a "sleeper" looking at the dormant cell and it's me. After reading the comparisons with "24" (as on the cover of the DVD), I was expecting a frenzied action. But no ... this series is just beginning. In my half-awake, groggy state, I thought, "He's going ..." and, poof, that would happen ... "I guess the van is going to roll off ..." and there it is. <br /> And so on. <br /> <br /> And why would Darwyn, in deep cover, chase a baby? Maybe we could provide some T & A? Hey, it works for me, hence four stars instead of three. <br /> <br /> This show is not a "24". I watched "24". Sleeper Cell, you're not a "24".
