It is amazing that some people have seen this as an art. We saw this as a poorly filmed film (shaky handheld camera and everything), (usually) a misinterpreted mess, without a script, that looked more like a high school movie project with kids who are experimenting with the realization of black and white movies. The injection of mounds of poetry instead of a story is not a film of art. When we watched this in the theater, people were starting to have giggles (including us) in the endless stupidity of this mocking and indulgent mess. And believe me, it seems endless. If we had finished our sweets and our popcorn, we would also be out of the theater with the other two dozen people who packed their bags and left in search of something more interesting to do!
