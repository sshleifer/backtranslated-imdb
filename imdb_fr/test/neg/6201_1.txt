I did not know what to expect when I started watching this movie, in the end I pulled my hair out. This was one of this year's most pathetic films ... in fact, over the last ten years. David Dhawan should just give up his career as a director. I have not yet come across an original script that David Dhawan worked on. This one was a bit full and a bit ripped off Hitch. I have nothing against the remakes as such, but this one is so ugly that it makes you even hate the original (which was rather correct). I can not understand what actors like Salman and Govinda have seen in this scenario. I read somewhere that it was supposed to be Govinda's return vehicle. If it's true, then only God can save his career. Salman just acted too much to the hilt. Govinda who, in my opinion, is a very high caliber actor has been completely lost. Katrina Kaif and LAra Dutta had nothing to do except to wear designer clothes and smile for no reason or rhyme. Please stay away from this one!
