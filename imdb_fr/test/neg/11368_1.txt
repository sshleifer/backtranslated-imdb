It was the worst TV movie I had ever seen. The visuals were so jerky that it made me turn my head. I hated constant zooming and zooming, as well as frequent black and white switches to color. I also thought that the story had no meaning, and that it was a cliche action movie, with a villainous hero and a few hostages. I could make a better movie than the one with my own camera, why? I can maintain it, something the director could not do. All in all, really the worst I have ever seen, did you think Disney was bad? I did not even bother to look at it because I'm sure I can guess the result, and the visual is the worst I've ever seen.
