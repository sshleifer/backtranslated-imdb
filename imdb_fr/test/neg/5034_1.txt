It's been ten years since this film was released and the weather has not improved a little more, as in other comments formulated, Australian filmmakers should have a little more drama than the Australians of the middle class in beautiful places on their motorcycles with not much in the dialogue. the middle class is not funny or rich. there is also a molding mix. why a young woman is going to marry a man old enough to be his father, that escapes me. It's a shame that this movie looks like a wonderful place for a vacation. Anyway, it's an hour and a half of my life, I'll never be able to come back. lives short to watch this movie.
