Dark Harvest talks about a group of friends who go to a farm (she belongs to one of their friends' parents or something) to escape. But there are Killer Scarecrows hiding there (there was something about a curse in there too, but I forgot what it was.) <br /> <br /> The game in this movie is terrible, I do not know what the director thought when he was casting actors and actresses. The script is the same story as the actor "dreadful" (this statement is very obvious but ...) if there was a better acting and a better script, it could have been "correct". <br /> <br /> The stinking direction too, I do not see any potential in the future of this type. After all these negatives, this film still maintains a factor "fun" that makes it go to two. The last advantage is that they do not use CGI! My general thoughts about this movie are that it's bad, really bad, but so bad that it's "fun" so it gives a 2/10
