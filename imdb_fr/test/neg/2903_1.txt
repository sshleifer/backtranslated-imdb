You can only describe that with one word and it would be WOW !!! Wow, I really did not think such bullshit could be published. If you watch a film called Ninja, expect to see at least some cool martial artists, right? However, none of these guys know the martial arts and it looks like they went to China to pick the first people they saw on the street and train them for a martial arts day. The actors act exaggeratedly, the special effects are ridiculous and no plot makes sense. This is the worst martial arts movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot!
