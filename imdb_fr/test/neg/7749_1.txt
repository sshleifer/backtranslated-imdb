The director of this celluloid waste is specialized in the terrible exploitation films where pretense is everything; The previous year, he had done "Dangerously Close" whose good idea (that the gangs had too much power at school and that the editor of the school was against them) was plunged into an ocean of neglect, and that he would continue to make "Cyborg", Jean Claude Van Damme's worst film (not a small feat). This so-called comedy about a girl - Kathy Ireland in her film debut - is a total schlump whose inner girl only woke up after her fall to the center of the Earth and who has a series of misguided and impossible adventures to follow (mainly involving a set of dwarves who want her because she has big bones - will understand!) before going home changed for the better is not funny, captivating or entertaining at all. And anyone who watches that salivate Miss Ireland will be put off - not because of his voice, but because she spends most of the film under tons of loose clothes, with huge glasses. No wonder Cannon, the producers, are bankrupt. Surprisingly, Kathy Ireland has since made better films ... or maybe it's not so incredible. Beside this, "Barb Wire" is "Aliens".
