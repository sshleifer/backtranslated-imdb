Based on the 2007 spy novel by David Ignatius, Body of Lies tells the story of a CIA member, Roger Ferris (DiCaprio), who is sent to Jordan to find Al-Qaeda's brain, while by climbing a narrow cordon of loyalty. Jordanian hosts and his American manipulator Ed Hoffman (Crowe). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen the movie trailers could be forgiven for thinking that the story revolves around the action of a double agent and Ferris' treachery by Hoffman. the story is much more banal. Instead, we are served a lukewarm broth of ridiculous subterfuges while the pretty white boy, American Ferris, walks with impunity through the bustling streets of Amman Jordan with a worried look over his shoulder or the lure of the attention of the local population. It is only during a scene where Ferris takes her newfound Iranian teapot that the couple is bombarded with Jordanian Jordanian glances. <br /> <br /> The film's problems are complicated by twists that seem designed as nothing more than padding. Ferris takes off for Jordan, Ferris is kicked out of Jordan, Ferris takes off for Washington, Ferris takes off for the UK, Ferris takes off for Jordan, Hoffman takes off for Jordan, Hoffman returns home to take care of his children ?? a top is ok. This is the kind of thing you expect to see in an episode of The Amazing Race, not a spy thriller. <br /> <br /> Faithful to his art, Crowe acquired an impressive mass of Ed Hoffman, thus being part of the small select club composed of actors, composed of Robert De Niro and Christian Bale, as spectators who have experienced a significant gain or loss of weight for their roles. It's unfortunate that all the other people involved did not share Crowe's level of dedication for quality, because if they did, we would have a much better movie than this mess of sub-par.
