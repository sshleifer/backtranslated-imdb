The DVD for this movie was designed by Alpha Video - a company that almost always produces poor quality prints. In Alpha's defense, it's often the only copy available, but it specializes in cheap, public domain films. If you can find another print by a different company, try it first because the print of this movie is rough and faded. Yet, compared to most Alpha DVDs, this one is excellent - especially since the sound is pretty clear (and Alpha never seems to include closed captioning - even with horrible sound movies). <br /> <br /> A man has been dating a lady for a very long time. One night, he is a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. Shortly after, he talks to his fianc√©e, she forgives him and they get married. <br /> <br /> Shortly after the wedding, he gets a frantic call from the other woman - she NEEDs to see him and just tries to kill himself. When they meet, he learns that she has an STD and she wants him to know that he can also have it now. Then, even though there is a nurse on the spot and she is treating her for her suicide attempt, she finds somehow a gun and kills herself! Does a huge mistake. He does not tell his doctor and he does not tell his new wife. Some time has passed and now she and the baby are infected! At this point, the doctor meets the guy and explains the importance of getting treatment. They show him pieces filled with horribly infected people (in fact, they were only movies of people with STDs that they merged into the movie - most syphilis). <br /> <br /> In some ways, the film is very progressive. This addresses a serious problem and it is interesting to see how the film encourages couples to NOT wait to get married, but to get married quickly and give in to these sexual urges - but only with each other (no bad advice at all). On the other hand, the film never says exactly what it's talking about. They never use the terms STD, VD or others, and do not even name diseases. This is often referred to as syphilis, but sometimes to herpes or other sexually transmitted diseases - the information is simply not very clear or precise - a VERY common problem with such films of that time. The audience at the time must have looked pretty confused about what they saw and many of the most naive probably need to ask some of their "faster" friends to explain everything to them! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "such films", in the '30s and' 50s, many small, often sordid, production companies shot movies depicting the dangers of drugs and sex (although they often wanted to promise a cheesecake for an audience that generally could not see such a racy taste in Hollywood movies). Many of them are hysterically funny because they are too confused and the information so inaccurate. The most famous examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (both from the same two-bit production company) and, compared to the stupidity of these two films, this cheap movie seems to have to appear in the Criterion collection !! <br /> <br /> Interestingly, there are crazies (I would certainly be included among them) who like to watch movies because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are very entertaining. This one, however, is not that bad, any more than the message that has complicated things and that the movie of the victims is not as grotesque as some similar movies. The message should have been more explicit and useful, but for a 1933 film, it's pretty good, despite sometimes mediocre actors and a ridiculous suicide scene. Remember the kids - just say "NO" to suicide! <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, the "two years of treatment" they talk about in the movie was actually the norm for syphilis in 1933. Nowadays it's much more treatable - like the rest STDs.
