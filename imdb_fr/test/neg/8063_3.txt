I bought this thing used in a "customs clearance bin" of a video game store. I wanted to have that feeling of guilt by looking at something that had been warned me is too intense to be watched; I wanted the shock value. I wanted to feel guilty and mean to watch a "forbidden film". I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox does not work because it is so campy and fake. Most of the time, the camera does not show you shots, chops, "shocking" cutouts - you only see the consequences. (They show a hanging chest in detail). The special effects are just OK. Nothing here that tells you that violence is real. The "cannibals" are obviously poor people from Central / South America, disguised as jungle savages and supposedly behaving nasty. These people were obviously all in all to have some money, or food, or both. Again ... not quite convincing. <br /> <br /> However, as everyone has said, real animals are killed. This is the extent of realism. For me, it was more shocking than feeling guts, cutting scalp or castration, and even then, the animal deaths are not so bloody - maybe just sad.
