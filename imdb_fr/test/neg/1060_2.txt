My Caddy Limo was destroyed !!! Well, I had one like this - I drove the polloi hoi and many elected around Manhattan for a few years. <br /> <br /> It was a lot more fun than this movie, I can tell you. Lordy, what a bomb - as in the RPG. I also drove many more stars in my white Caddy than in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robert Patrick is a very serious actor and did a credible job with the nonsense with which he had to work. Unfortunately, Rutger Hauer played his role as a circus clown with a red nose. If he could not take seriously why his audience should he? The director should have left the set during the first hour of filming. <br /> <br /> The dialog box has been written by 10 years for 8 years. Surprised, there was not much more fear on the sets. Oh well, I'm a movie fanatic - ergo - you have to take the bad to get the best.
