The horror of this TV movie is that it did not end with this one. He spawned a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot / movie. Most films on various professions have a certain realism and are of course jazzed to make it exciting. It did not have any of that. If the intention was to "camp" then he succeeded. He surfaced on a cable a few years ago and again failed. The performance of Richard Jaeckels as Master Chief who does everything was the only redeeming part of this film. Campier than the Batman series of the 60s.
