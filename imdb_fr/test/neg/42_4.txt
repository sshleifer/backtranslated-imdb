Art-House Horror tries to use an unconventional aesthetic to cover the fact that this is just another serial killer cooler that ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teen sex and violent gore. The suburbs look as good as in every piece of Australian writing (book or film) since 1960 - surprise, the suburbs have a dark underside - and the plot is as artificial as anything you've seen. "Neighbors would never know this guy," said one of the filmmakers about Joel Edgerton's character. "But he was completely plausible as to who he was.The serial killers do not have any marks on their eyes or scars on their cheeks, they look like the type next door." Another pornographic trafficker who sees a serial killer in every street. But the real insignificance of this film lies in the fact that it is a genre film that no one has seen. Backed by substantial funds (including some from Film Finance - this is the government), this was run at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival and had to rely on the kindness of ACMI for a very short season. Q1: How does the FFC finance genre films, even if they are "artistic" and aesthetically unconventional? Q2: Why are these nasty films (ACOLYTES, BEAUTIFUL, PUNISHMENT, NO THROUGH ROAD) done in the first place? Richard Wolstencroft & co encourages its creators to believe that they are giving the masses what they really want, as opposed to what the elite of the government-funded culture thinks they want. The truth is that these brutal and forgetful villains earn much more critical praise - and win far more obscure rewards - than they are.
