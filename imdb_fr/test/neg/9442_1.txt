I can not believe anyone gives a good rating to this movie. In addition to the terrible acting game, the thin plot (non-existent?) And the slow pace, it would be the movie to watch if you really tried to fall asleep. The brains of the writer and the director must be fried eggs for ever concocting something as abominable as this one. Based on the summary of the plot on the DVD case, the principle seemed really promising. But in the first ten minutes, I knew it was a lost cause. If you want to see a really whimsical idea of ​​the Area 51 idea, check out the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes". Dreamland will soon disappear as all pathetic films of its kind do. FOLLOWING!!!
