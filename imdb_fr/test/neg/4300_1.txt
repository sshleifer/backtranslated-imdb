Sensational. They told me it was bad, but I did not know. <br /> <br /> We started a tradition. We found a copy of this film and we pass it from person to person. Anyone who has the film looks at it, then passes it on to someone else worthy to see this unique, creative and horrible movie. Hopefully it will be around the world many times. <br /> <br /> It's painful. Really painful. It's even beyond so bad that it's funny. Okay, sometimes it's so bad it's funny. But most of the time, it just gives you the feeling that something sucks your brain from the inside. <br /> <br /> Wow. Look at it, then pass it on.
