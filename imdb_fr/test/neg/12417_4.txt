"Wild Rebels" was probably a second fun movie on a triple feature film tour 40 years ago. It has not aged well, but it has never been designed to age well. it was obviously meant to be disposable, a pleasure forgotten from the beginning. Taken at this level, this is a good example of the biker movie genre. <br /> <br /> Several elements make it possible to distinguish it from dozens of similar films produced at the same time. The "hero", "Rod Tillman" (Steve Alaimo) is an unimpressive "Everyman" - he is not particularly courageous, beefy, talented or handsome (though he wins a fight against a gang member bikers hard at mid-term) the female gang member chooses to help her rather than her other gang member at the end of the film). The soundtrack is pretty well done, with a nice 'Ventures' style bass / drum riff that makes things move, saxophones and brass charts that make things up. And although the scenario is rather superficial, all the actors inhabit their cardboard characters convincingly and with a lot of energy. <br /> <br /> There are many negligent technical blunders: dreadful day-to-day scenes that occur in daylight, squealing tires in a marsh, fire sirens mistakenly stuck on the soundtrack at police sirens place, a bank billboard tape on a ceiling slab, a Luger that looks like a Winchester 30-06, rifle shots that cut 100 meters away, a detective killed a biker on a landing on the 3rd floor with a revolver with a 2 inch gun. <br /> <br /> There's a whole lot of dubious story elements: Linda (the girl) gang member deactivates a bank guard with a drug-filled syringe, the final shooting takes place inside a lighthouse (!), police roadblocks do not block roads, police have apparently never heard of ducks, nor have police detectives apparently ever heard of planting insects or to have their guy under cover wea ring a wire. <br /> <br /> But the plot is moving forward, the cameraman knows what he's doing, the pace in most scenes is pretty good, and there are good and very nice liners and dialogue exchanges here and there that maintain the level of energy. (My favorite: "Man, you play with private actions! (Linda, for example)" So no, do not look for this one or anything, but if a copy of the MST version should fall into your hands, you should be superior to "Five the Hard Way" or "The Hellcats" or even "Girl In Gold Boots" (three other MST counterculture films).
