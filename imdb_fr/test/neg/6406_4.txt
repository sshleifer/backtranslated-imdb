There was a time when Joel Schumacher figured prominently on my list of favorite directors. In the late '80s and early' 90s, when his name was associated with several great movies such as "The Lost Boys", "Flatliners" and "Falling Down", he was truly one of the most gifted with Hollywood. Then came the stupid series of "Batman", unfortunately, and after that, it seemed that every potentially sublime scenario turned into a gigantic mess in Schumacher's hands. "8MM" and "Phone Booth" could have been much better films and even the incredibly idiotic concept of "The Number 23" should have been turned into a slightly more convincing and entertaining film. Literally from start to finish, "The Number 23" desperately tries to be a mysterious and strange thriller and so uses all the dreadful clich√©s of the big book of the history of the cinema, including the loud narration, the flashbacks, disordered structure, characters with multiple personalities. , many twists of conspiracy that become more and more absurd and sinister. However, nothing helps, simply because of the foolishness of the basic formula and the obviously uninspired commitment. Even if you try to associate with the main character and be open to foolish theories, it's still a movie on a two-digit number and the two-digit numbers are not scary. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey in a rare non-comic role) is a bored animal trapper and his wife Agatha gives him a strange book on his birthday. The book tells all kinds of diabolical theories and strange coincidences related to the number 23. Walter identifies almost immediately with the protagonist of the book (a sleazy detective investigating a sinister case of suicide) and begins to discover many examples of the 23 riddle in his own private life. I did research on Google and Wikipedia and apparently all this nonsense about numerology 23 really exists and some people honestly believe that most disasters and accidents are directly related to this perverse number. Well, it's just ?? crazy! But hey, I'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears, no matter what their madness, and I can only share my humble opinion of a film based on a wacky riddle. "Number 23" is not suspicious, despite several dark decorations and unpleasant make-up effects, and never at a certain point makes you think about the role of numbers in your own life. All the members of the cast have performances inferior to their usual abilities, but it was still a joy to see again the beautiful Mrs. Virginia Madsen in a relatively important production. This is definitely not recommended if you are looking for a solid and scary thriller night, but bearable and not entirely devoid of merit.
