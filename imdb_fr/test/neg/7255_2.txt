Thirty percent of this film appears to be the prototype of the map channel. You see a giant map for about ten minutes, then they release the archive footage while buzzing (drones, get it?) On the radar. Apparently, there are many radar stations in the far north, protecting North America's borders from deadly polar bear attacks. Bears never show up, but a giant Mantis does. It was frozen in the ice for about a million years, until it was published by an earthquake elsewhere in the world (yeah, that's right.) For my money, it was released by global warming). It is a huge prehistoric insect that needs a lot of food. Since there are no cows in the icy north, he decides to feast on creatures that are more like the cattle he can find there. I.E., human beings. He starts attacking radar stations, probably because the zoom of the radar antennas scared him. <br /> <br /> Enter the Col. Joe Parkman, the well-prepared guy of the movie. He investigates a plane that has fallen and wonders why there is no body in the wreck. The only thing he finds is one of the claws of the mantis. Apparently, he decided to cut his nails while he was nibbling at the crew of the plane. Parkman brings the tip of the claw back with him for analysis by a thousand-year-old scientist. <br /> <br /> The scientist of a grandfather can not queue or tail the claw, especially because he missed his naps and he does not mind anymore works too well. So, he appeals to a discreet paleontologist played by the guy who was the P.I. in Perry Mason. He and his friend, a travestied photographer, fly north because he decided that the claw had to come from a praying mantis. One train the size of a commuter train. <br /> <br /> It's a great love at first sight for Luke when Colonel Parkman first looks at the photographer. The men at the base, who have obviously been deprived for many years, think it's the best thing to do since Granny Clampett. A hearing-impaired scientist and an armed soldier begin to work together to follow the path taken by the Mantis, which has devastated archival footage of an Eskimo village. He arrives at the base looking for a snack after dinner and quite effectively crushes some cheap dishes. Then he flies south and disappears. <br /> <br /> Now comes the hours of tension when civil land observers are called to sweep the sky in search of anything flying over their heads. I doubt that they would actually have been told that they were looking for a giant mantis eating human beings, which would have caused panic. They were probably told to look for a giant 727 painted in green and humming because his engine was out of order. <br /> <br /> Col. Parkman gets on a plane to try to defeat the Mantis and bump the mission. The Mantis landed in New York, probably because he wanted to attend a show on Broadway or visit Sex World in Times Square. The army blocks it in the tunnel and Parkman and his men put on stupid costumes that they borrowed from the Orkin man to enter and try to blow up the Mantis. Success! Well, almost, since the Mantis is still shaken enough to almost kill Eve Arden's photographer. There is a lukewarm love scene at the end, and the paleontologist takes a picture of the dead mantis because Colonel Hair Grease and Ms. Gender Unspecified are busy smudging. So, a kind of nauseating end.
