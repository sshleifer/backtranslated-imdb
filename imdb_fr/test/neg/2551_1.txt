In the dusty little town of Furlough, Texas, an animal is killing cattle and people. When teenager Tommy (Michael Carreo) is killed, their friends Anna Furlough (Erika Fay), his Mexican-American boyfriend Miguel Gonzalez (Gabriel Gutierrez), Jill Gillespie (Sara Erikson) and Rosie (Martine Hughes) discover that a Mexican werewolf Chupacabra is the killer and they are developing a plan to kill the beast. <br /> <br /> "The Mexican werewolf in Texas" is an amateur shit and among the worst films I've ever seen, if not the worst. Nothing works in this movie: the script is laughable, with some of the most terrible lines I've ever heard. The direction does not exist and the camera follows the "style" of "The Blair Witch Project". The amateur game seems to be a farce of high school students or a play. The "special effects" are horrible and extremely poor and the "werewolf" is the cheapest I have ever seen. Ed Wood's films are cult, but this "Mexican werewolf in Texas" is pure waste. In the end, Jill says no man can resist his pacifiers (actually the most beautiful thing in this movie). But I believe that the correct quote should be "no man (or woman) can resist watching this movie until the end". My curiosity drove me to see how bad a movie could be and I lost 88 minutes of my life, but I think most viewers will stop seeing with less than 20 minutes of posting. My vote is an (awful). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomen Mexicano no Texas" ("A Mexican werewolf in Texas")
