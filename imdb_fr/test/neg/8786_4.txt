I rented it when it was released on videotape in 1995. After reviewing it, my idea about it did not change much. <br /> <br /> I was an adult at the time and I'm still an adult now! lol <br /> <br /> The illogical elements mentioned by other commentators did not bother me. It's not a documentary, it's a fantastic story where animals can talk! <br /> <br /> Even if I did not care about the songs, I liked the one at the end of the picture where she is sung barry manilow and another person. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to pretend it's a primitive animation saying that computer graphics are not used often in animated feature films, but let's not forget that THE LION KING has been published about a year earlier, and perhaps better than any other animated feature film that preceded it! <br /> <br /> But I think it's fair to say that LE PEBBLE AND PINGOIN was made cheaply while THE LION KING was not .... <br /> <br /> The highlights for me in 1995 and today is the suspense generated by the few underwater (mostly) dangerous hunting scenes. <br /> <br /> I also liked the opening scene that takes place on a page of musical notes and a little love story. But most of the time, the story dragged on and was boring. <br /> <br /> Worth a look if you like entertainment, but if you're an adult and do not take risks, get another Walt Disney production instead!
