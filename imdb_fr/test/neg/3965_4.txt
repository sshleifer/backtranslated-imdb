A man is arrested on a London street and taken to a foreign country where he is tortured as a terrorist suspect. Dull and banal film bored me a lot. More an idea than a movie. I was halfway through this 77-minute film when I realized I did not know who the person was on the screen. It was as if they were taking all the other similar films and removing all the ideas and placing them in the same place without the true notion of character. Certainly, he has acted with passion, but there is no emotional center, there is simply a kind of person that filmmakers consider sufficient. It's not. And although the story presented is silly in theory as a warning, the film is too dull to convince anyone, especially if one has seen the other, better films of the same kind (interpretation with Reese Witherspoon for example).
