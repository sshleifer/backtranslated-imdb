This film was purely trash. Not the worst movie of all time. If the scenario was to be broken down, the acting was enough to do the job, but the script was so stupid and stupid that we wondered, "Where did my life go?" Even Vanessa Redgrave ~ whom I love (and that's the reason I watched this) was wasted. Totally wasted. She did not even leave an impression. The staging was so far away that none of the characters left me much, but seeing Redgrave leave nothing behind. His share was nothing. She was good as a naughty leader, but that was all. Do some depth and give depth to small roles ~ see Venus and Atonement. I would not waste my time and was upset to have spent $ 5 on this movie ... I wanted to get it back. No return. Pass the movie. This will only bring you sorrow ... and boredom.
