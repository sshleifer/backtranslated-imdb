I hate when movie people talk on screen again. This is one of the main reasons I stick to DVDs or videos. I saw The Clearing on DVD, but if I had seen it in the movies, I should have got up and SCREAM "IT'S NOT DEAD, YOU MORON!" <br /> <br /> The Clearing is another in a long list of horrible movies starring Mr.Redford. Legal Eagles, Havana, Indecent Proposal, Up Close and Personal, Sneakers, Last Castle and Spy Game. If Robert Redford told me to invest in something, I would go the other way. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing you can do to an audience is this. Suppose you are kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun. He is angry at you for most of the movie. You turn the tables around and start strangling him. Whatever you do, keep strangling him until he is DEAD! Do not just strangle it for ten seconds. Stay with that! Ten minutes at least. But Bob stops too early, walks away and forgets Mr. Kidnapper until ........ He gets up, finds the gun and keeps it on our hero again. At this point, I wanted Mr. Kidnapper to shoot Robert Redford. More than a few times. And I wanted to shoot him too.
