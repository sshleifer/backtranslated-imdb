Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Obviously this is not intentional though. It takes about half of the movie for the main characters to realize that the mountainous landscape in the middle of the city spits bright red, and that the other half is diverting the flow of lava through the city using fire trucks (you're right). It certainly made me laugh. The game makes Arnie look like a thespian of the RSC. It's amazing that movies like this one are ordered. A more interesting version would be someone who would approach an active volcano to film it and would probably cost around Â£ 20. ($ 40) I can see a guy present the film to a production company "well, there's this big VOLCANO and he burst into a city .... quite radical hey" If you can find him in the bins to a dollar, maybe worth buying as after watching this most other movies would be fine.
