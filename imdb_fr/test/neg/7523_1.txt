It is a machine to go back in time. It works in "real time" for 96 minutes, but it looks like 96 years. The first 20 minutes were totally superfluous. Massive amounts of "dead" time all the way through. What happened? When will something happen? We do not care? Apparently, the film was made with a tight budget, I note for your edification the following: The Morlochs: nothing like saving a little money by reusing the sets and costumes of Lord of the Rings, Part I , Hey? The "scary guy" charged with controlling the Morlochs ... The most scary thing these guys could think of was someone wearing one of Gene Simmons's costumes: (from the Kiss group), old costumes ?? ? Little known: the monsters of the future have perfectly maintained nails. <br /> <br /> Save your money, save your time. Pass on this one.
