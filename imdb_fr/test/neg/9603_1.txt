Normally for film critics, I try to be constructive and objective, but there is only one word for that, uh, "movie": SUCKS !!!!!!! The dialogues, the actors, the special effects, the plot, the sets and the characters all seem to have been created by my potted plants. Do not see it, for all that is good and right in this world! :)
