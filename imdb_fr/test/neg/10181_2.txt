The only reason I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 is because, for some reason, I felt compelled to finish it! Basically, I wanted to see if there would be extraterrestrials, UFOs, anything suggested by the title of the film, the cover of the film and the beginning of the film! I was very disappointed to see religion being incorporated into the mix as it was. It could have been used to the advantage of the film, but I felt rather that the film was trying to send me subliminal messages! Finally, what was the size of the wardrobe of this casting !? The number of different and extremely bright shirts that each character wore in each new scene left me so perplexed that I began to wonder if this film was not supposed to be classified in the "bad comedy" category. <br /> toes thumb down!
