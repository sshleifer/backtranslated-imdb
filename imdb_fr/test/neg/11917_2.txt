It's really not worth commenting on, but I guess it's my job to warn you all, especially since there are some very good reviews of this Canadian bomb floating ... A bad game actor and a slow movement, absolutely excruciatingly boring The story of three boys is upset when a fugitive man shows up at their clubhouse in the woods. In the fir trees, the boys are doing well with the intruder and at one point even consider it as a kind of role model ... However, all that changes ... and you do not care. You will recognize Chris Penn, whose greatest cinematic impact is Corky Romano, and a young Devon Sawa, whose career culminated at "Casper". I was hoping for a '12 and Holding ',' The War 'or' Lie 'and all I got was a waste of time. This film is struggling to hold the public's attention and never impacts or keeps a note of anything interesting.
