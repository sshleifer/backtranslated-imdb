I remember seeing this years ago. The beginnings were relatively promising, with an interesting premise, but they then degenerated into nonsense rather quickly. Interesting characters, unsuccessful attempts to add drama and tension, and a bit of simplistic philosophy too, all culminating in a terrible end. <br /> <br /> Simply, it's a garbage can. <br /> <br /> Before seeing this TV movie, I did not think I had a movie that I thought was the "worst" I had seen, but after I finished watching this movie, I knew it from now on. on, if someone asked me what was the worst film I had ever seen, I could say without hesitation: "The second coming". <br /> <br /> Avoid.
