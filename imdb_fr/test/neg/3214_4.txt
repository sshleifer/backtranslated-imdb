Nothing that I do not like more than a kung fu movie that plays for laughs. That's the main reason I can not stand Jackie Chan (or his look-alikes). He has not always been a clown, I must add. "My Young Auntie" is the worst martial art. This is a perfect example of how the sub-genre has been shattered by endless antics and childish behaviors. Unless you're 5 years old, I really do not understand how anyone could find this kind of funny movie. But humor is indeed a very subjective thing. Personally, I think this type of approach has caused permanent damage to the beloved subgenus. I thought the main woman Kara Hui was very good here. But I had so much trouble watching this one that I could not enjoy his good performance. If you do not mind, you could enjoy it. I know I do not have.
