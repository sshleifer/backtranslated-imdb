First, the idea of ​​redoing a classic such as "Psycho" is nothing ridiculous. A lot of time and effort has been lost here. I'm sure they are smart enough to know that they could not improve the original, so they had to have in mind a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. However, the idea that started as a well-meaning tribute is translated as a slap for the master of horror. This film is badly produced, badly played and useless. to begin with.The original classic resists well, even after 40 years. The event of Hitch's return from the grave and the arrival of those responsible for this junk is unlikely, but if I were them, I would sleep with an open eye just in case. Do not waste your time.
