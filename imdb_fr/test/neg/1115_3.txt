I saw Wicked Little Things as part of the "8 films to die for" Horrorfest, and this is the only movie that disappointed me. Namely, a mother, her granddaughter and her teenage daughter settle in an abandoned house in the mountains of Pennsylvania. However, every night, the spirit of vengeance of children killed in a coal mine sweeps and slaughters everyone they find. <br /> <br /> I suppose the director was counting on the fact that his viewers would be pushed back so that children would be able to commit killings by picking and eating human flesh (there are somptuous close-ups, a nice tribute to George Romero) because the movie just is not afraid. In layman's terms, there are far too many established shots of evil children jogging to their next murder site. If anyone wants to find him in the barn, there will be a picture of the kids coming to the barn (oh suspense), then moving in for the kill. <br /> <br /> Come to think about it, why do children suddenly walk so slowly when they catch their prey? And it's not that I have any experience in this field, but I think a shotgun shot will throw a child MUCH further than what this film entails ...? It does not help either that the mother is one of the worst parents I have ever seen in a movie. "The lock of the front door is broken"? You have an eight year old daughter in WOODS with BEARS and MOUNTAIN LIONS! FIX IT, you MORON !!! Moreover, Mom and her eldest daughter seem too close together in their age, even for a teenage pregnancy, and there is a pretty incredible death of sneaking someone trying to push a car from the mud with her buttocks. <br /> <br /> I give him a 3 because he tried. As a splashing movie, it's not bad. But for good scares, go elsewhere.
