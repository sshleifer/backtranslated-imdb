After 30 minutes, it was removed from my recorder. Critters' first film was funny in itself, the "talk" between the critters just before Granny threw them out of the porch, for example. This film is just fumbling, it is waiting for someone to film and put an end to your misery. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine anyone who worked on this turkey to be proud of it. <br /> <br /> We were fun, four was horrible. Do not bother, even if the alternative is to watch the rebroadcasts of a fundraiser of the "700 Club" TBS, you will at least laugh enough (and the makeup "alien" is more credible. .. more grin).
