If you like to stay in the dark, literally and figuratively, for ninety minutes, then this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> A waste of actors, resources and audience time. In the end a waste of space. Do not be tempted by the resume. There is nothing else of substance beyond. The film lacks all the basics you can expect of the genre. intrigue, character, development, denouement. The actors may be carried away by the belief that, in this case, their efforts will be quite negligible and that, over time, their career may be better.
