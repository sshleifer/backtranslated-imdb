sdiner82 had clearly not seen the film for decades and his memory is appalling. His attempts to portray Mark Lester's shaving scene as a suspect are completely wrong, as are his incorrect comments about the villain "peeking over the child's body". Lester is dressed all the time the man is in the room, and the man barely gives him a glance. <br /> <br /> The scene is a crude attempt to show Lester's innocent curiosity about his body. <BR /> <br /> Like everything in this movie, it's badly done, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Even the comments of sdiner82 on the Savalas character who "suddenly sent a German family to death pushing their trailer" cliff "is nonsense (it was a single woman, she was already dead and she was in a car) <br /> <br /> I suggest that the review of sdiner82 says much more about her own mind, far from the liberal mentality, than about this worthless film. The only reason I even bothered to watch it is out of curiosity to see if it was shot before or after Kojak. <br /> <br /> The film is a worthless piece of trash from the 70s, but his criticism by sdiner82 is the worst of slanders.It summarizes his account in pseudo-intellectual "facts", but the only fact is that he is squarely wrong on almost all the "factual" topics he discusses. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he was looking for, which is disturbing now, he can return to burning copies of Catcher in the Rye.
