In fact, some parts really pleased me. There were some interesting twists. But it just leaves me with a summer there, considering this feeling after all SAW movies. True, the end was different than a typical saw, but let's face it ... a group of guys unknown to each other (or at least they believe) thrown together in an abandoned chemical plant .. <br /> <br /> But then he loses something. There is no intensity, there is a weak group dynamic, there is no sense of urgency. <br /> <br /> Some nice twists at the end, and it's really worth watching if there's nothing else on your plate, but it left me empty. ..he has passed the time, but he has not satisfied.
