It's really one of the most horrible movies of all time. It's dull, heavy, badly played and pretentious teeth. <br /> <br /> I watched for about an hour wait for a drama to unfold before realizing that it did not exist. Reducing the budget of a chain of shoes has been particularly painful. These must be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from the outdoor area. <br /> <br /> The only barely redeemable feature is the ridiculous "demons" wandering the countryside with a plastic cat basket. How is this scary? And I liked the moggys used as extras, I guess they are the cheapest. Although it seemed a little obvious that they had been seduced by the judicious placement of tuna. <br /> <br /> This film is so terrible that it should contain a public health warning. When I picked it up, there was a queue in my local video store, where people were asking for their money. I am not joking!
