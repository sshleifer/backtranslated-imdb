Low budget "movies" like this just give me hope as a future screenwriter. In other words, if there are people willing to finance such a thing, there is certainly much more than a glimmer of hope for a man like me who can write stories. This movie is right up there, or should I say "over there" with Ed Wood of the world. History, if you can call it that, and dialogue, not to mention the sophomoric acting, is a parody of the genre itself. Someone should have driven a stake into this trap while still on paper. It follows that since the literature has been virtually eliminated, this film should follow. To have a good movie or even just a passable movie, you must have at least a decent writing. We think of the legendary Curt Siodmak. They used a lot of his stories for low-budget films a long time ago, but they still present themselves today as serious and quality entertainment, like "The brain of Donavan". The actors in this "work" should seriously consider getting back to work in their respective hamburger or shoe stores and forgetting any future mediocre attempt to appear in front of a camera. Avoid this one like the plague itself !!!
