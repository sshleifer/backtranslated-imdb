The great Yul Brynner, who won an "Oscar" and who has notably starred in blockbuster movies, such as "The Ten Commandments", ended his remarkable career with cheap films such as "Sartana", etc. Regretable, indeed. We should be sorry to see him doing his best to keep this silly thing going. Gone are the days when he was surrounded by Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach, in "The Magnificent Seven" and was walking under the famous soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein. It is sometimes difficult to make a living by being an actor.
