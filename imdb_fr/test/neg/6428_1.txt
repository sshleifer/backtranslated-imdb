Well it was a complete waste of celluloid. The preview was promising, but after watching the movie, it seemed like the preview * was * the whole movie. No plot, no clear scenario, just a suspense gone astray. It seems that the director has done everything to create an atmosphere of mysticism and fear, but there are still gaps to fill. Why drugs? Why number 11.11? (As Sarah enters the library, the clock reads 11.14) What is the connection to murdering parents? What is the role of this Rayden woman? Is she one of the children or not? Who are these children anyway? There are a lot of materials hanging around to create the ultimate cult film like "The Omen", but the director just lets them lie on the floor without digging into the story. Even the "Blairwitch project" was more scary than this one. All gaps that you hope to fill, as in "The butterfly effect", remain open as the credits begin to roll. OKAY. At the next movie ...
