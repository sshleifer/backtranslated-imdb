Fortunately, I watched this movie alone, which allowed me to move quickly in the worst scenes (most movies, in fact). Okay, some of them are not all bad, with partially good photos (even underwater scenes) and sometimes not too bad. But that still does not save the incredibly poor script and does much worse. Plus, when I do not find "hottie" movies as all that, even wannabe-sexy scenes of love making make bored. Really dull! And for the drama: You know that it's always a bad sign not to love all the characters to the point of not worrying about who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> If you still have not gotten tired of the Survivor reality show, you may find something to your taste in this movie. Otherwise, stay well away!
