Tony Curtis and Skip Homier both wear black shoes with white canvas shoes, just before and after the swimming pond and tank explosion. It must have been too hard for young stars. If the real Marines had participated in the mission, they would wear boots. In the first scenes, they removed their leggings just before leaving for their little trip in search of the farmer. When they went into the area where they dug the fox holes, Tony and Skip wore combat boots, then later, when Lovejoy and Curtis clashed with the Framer and his daughter, Tony, wore the "shoes of tennis ", but they were black. The film speaks of a true story but did he really need love?
