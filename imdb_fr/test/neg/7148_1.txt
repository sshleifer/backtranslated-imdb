That projected Sundance last night to a mute receptive crowd. Obviously, the story deserves to be told, it is powerful and true, but did the director have to interpret each role with a recognizable face? I mean, really, you spend your time saying "Oh look, this is the guy from" Armageddon "", or "Hey, it's Easy Rider!" and you lose sight of the story. This is perhaps the only way for this guy to make his film, but it's a little distracting, like "The Love Boat," or those old Towering Inferno movies, which were "chock o" with stars! I just told the story just with less famous faces. In addition, the work of the camera seems a little lazy, as if we did not think where to place the camera to tell the story better. could have been really good.
