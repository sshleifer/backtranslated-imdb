Okay, I saw Wrath of the Ninja. <br /> <br /> This is not something I would recommend to those who are not serious about Japanese fight movies. It's a kind of Japanese combat ninja movie, with a complex plot. These are the 3 ancient ninja schools that had these 3 "Swords of Witchcraft". I saw the subtitled version (not recommended by the way, it's easy to miss something) and I did not really keep up. There were good, difficult scenes, but in general, it was not much to my taste.
