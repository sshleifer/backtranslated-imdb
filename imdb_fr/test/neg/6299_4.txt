This film strives but fails. It may be a travel story that may appeal to a non-Australian audience, but it is simply boring for natives. <br /> <br /> Anyone living here knows that Broken Hill is an isolated, rough mining town. If two or three fruits appear in trail, everything is so predictable. Where have I already met this well-used theme? Oh yes - city mouse and country mouse. Spare us. <br /> <br /> I was hoping it would get better, but after the Broken Hill scene, I could see where it was going, so I turned off the TV and went to bed.
