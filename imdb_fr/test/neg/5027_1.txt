Oh man! This series must be the worst possible anime I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It started in a new, exciting and fresh way. And I really liked it then. Kagome was a good female model for the show. And Inu-Yasha was funny and sensible. <br /> <br /> Then, it continued to decrease more and more as the series progressed ... and I'll explain why. (Warning: SPOILER ALERT !!) <br /> <br /> Okay, they destroy the relationship between Inu-Yasha and Kagome very early, reviving his 50-year-old deceased girlfriend who falls to nightfall, dark and lost. . <br /> <br /> They present a pervert named Miroku, who is supposed to be a kind of religious character of the series. (Which really bothered me, because it was out of place and stupid.) Then they present a demon killer named Sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save his brother who has been brainwashed. <br /> <The big villain of the series, Naraku, when he started as a very good villain, lost his hand after a while. (He soon became old enough and it bothered me to be the only villain in the series to have done anything.) <br /> <br /> The characters all became wooden and without emotion. And then, the end of this terrible series was a disappointment for all fans of cartoons. Nothing happened. Naraku has never been killed or vanquished. Kagome and Inu-Yasha have never really fallen in love (because he was still in love with his dead chick, 50 years old). The plot holes were left open. The animation became worse and worse as the series progressed. And nothing has changed in the plot. (I mean, they dragged over 150 episodes, and nothing changed in the plot ... at all.) And they expected me (as well as other fans of the series ) are satisfied? I was disenchanted, disgusted and annoyed like shit. At least I had high hopes that the series would end well. Instead, all I got was a dragging commercial for the manga. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you want to see a good anime on swords and stuff like that, I highly recommend "Rurouni Kenshin". This show progresses and goes somewhere, plus it has a very good animation too. <br /> <br /> But stay away from this bland excuse for cartoons, as best you can.
