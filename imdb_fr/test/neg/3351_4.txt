When you look at the cover and read about it, a different type of film comes to mind. Again, I may have read the summary of the other film called "Mausolem", because there were two films of this title released at about the same time, with both intrigues featuring key elements in common. However, when I read articles about this film here, I know that I saw this one and not this one and that this film is even less what one could imagine in a movie carrying this title. I'm going to be honest, I'm expecting more of a zombie type image and you get that to some degree in this movie. However, there are more things involving occult and strange powers as evidenced by the opening scene of the people taken by the coroner at the beginning of the film. The film also has the old theme of children going somewhere where they do not belong to a crazy party, in this case it is actually a mausoleum. I think the other movie does not really have that key feature that plays that important role in the movie and I see that the score of it is also higher, but it was just not the movie I was waiting for .
