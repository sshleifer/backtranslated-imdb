I'm not a big fan of the Spielberg / Cruise version of this movie. And so I have to add the humblest version of Latt / Howel. C Thomas Howel had more heart and sympathy than Cruise in the lead role (at least in my opinion). Now, it's hard to imagine until you delete everything that, in the Spielberg version, cost more than a thousand dollars. There would be nothing left, no special effects, no sets, no cruises. Because I doubt that something costs more than a big cool in the version of David Michael Latt. So comparing apples to turnips, I guess I have to go with turnips. At least, this gives independent films a first try on the epic market of science fiction disasters.
