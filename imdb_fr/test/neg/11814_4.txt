If you find the desperately amateur acting, the uninteresting story, the fake blood, and all the foolish filming bearable, then you may have a good time watching this trashy, low rent movie. You may also want to watch a very good sequence of catfights that is offered, although it is not good enough for the rest of the movie to be worth watching. (**)
