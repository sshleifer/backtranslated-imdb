I never really thought about watching this movie. I always saw her perched on the shelf of a horror movie in my local video rental store and I never thought much about it. Just your run, bland zombie movie with a little gore and a sex scene. Nothing special, so much to watch Python ... oh no wait, it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I only decided to watch him when some of my friends saw him on TV and he said it was a terrible piece. garbage. So, I decided to check these stories, and only then did I realize how the film hidden behind the film's bland and uninteresting film was terrible. <br /> <br /> The idea is not bad in itself. An airplane is a confined area and would be a real death trap for the people on board if the zombies made their appearance ... a good premise for a zombie movie. But this film took a good turn and shit on all levels with a mediocre action game, unstable camera work, annoying characters and a terrible score. <br /> <br /> The characters all have different levels of hate. There are two young couples who are essentially friends who go on holiday in France. A couple is made up of a jock and his boring bitch girlfriend who has an affair with Mr. Jock's best friend, who came with his girlfriend who is a blond psychopath. There is also a policeman escorting a crook (an effeminate and very annoying swindler). The policeman is probably one of the least irritating characters in the lot. Then there's a crowd of flight attendants who end up mostly becoming zombies ... no, I did not watch the whole movie, it was an experience too painful to conduct, almost as painful as watch the Holocaust of Cannibal. Oh, and there's also a golfer on vacation with his wife, a strange air marshal who really does not seem to matter until he's summoned to help solve the problem of fleeing zombies , a trio of scientists who are all victims of the undead and some pilots. The work of the camera is often fragile, and although many people do not seem to care, it can annoy you after a while, as if a small fly constantly buzzing around your head. It's small but it's there and it's annoying. <br /> <br /> The adulterous couple is really annoying. All they do is make love in the bathroom of the plane while their spouses do not look ... in fact, all the young adults in this movie are incredibly annoying. They moan, greet, discuss and have some of the most insane and boring dialogues of the movie ... yes, it makes you happy to see them die. <br /> <br /> The score is atrocious. He is so generic and uninspired that he kills any suspense that a scene could have generated and replaces it with the feeling that someone is scratching a picture with his nails and making fun of you. In fact, it looks like the score of ... Python! This film will never stop haunting me. <br /> <br /> There is also a character that filmmakers seemed incredibly determined to have in as many shots as possible. A nun sitting near young adults and holding her Bible in many ways, one wonders if she plays a major role in the film ... but no, she does not, so why have it in so many scenes? Was it because the original project of the creator of the film was a pornographic film? Nobody will ever know. <br /> <br /> The zombies are pretty beautiful. Their makeup is good and they are probably much better actors than the living characters, they are much more convincing and friendly! The guard responsible for monitoring the illegal cargo of the scientist was quite amusing. A big box seems to fall on him, and the camera briefly shows the public that his leg was pierced with a sharp object ... but he does not scream, grimace or moan pain. He just grunts and squirms to try to get the thing out of his leg ... In fact, he looks more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man who is in pain. <br /> <br /> Ah well, Overall, I give it 1 for interesting setting and 1 for zombies. <br /> <br /> Watch this film only if you love young adults who are bickering and throwing things at you, and unfortunately there is not something funny about it, so look laughing would probably fail, unless you like some kind of psychoactive drug.
