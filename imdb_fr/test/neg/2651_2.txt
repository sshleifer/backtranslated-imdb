Harrison Ford plays Dutch Sergeant Van Den Broeck of the Columbia District Police Department. He tries to catch the bad guys, but does not do a very good job. When we meet him, he tries to catch a corrupt infiltrator. Kristin Scott Thomas plays a New Hampshire Senator, Kay Chandler, who is trying to get re-elected. She runs against a candidate who has a lot of money. The last thing she needs is the death of her husband. She's a politician - she can not get bogged down in feelings. <br /> <br /> This story is moving slowly and painfully. I looked at my watch every five minutes and wondered when it would be over! The story gets lost in details, the director, Sydney Pollack, does not need to describe it. We do not want to know more about Dutch police investigations. They throw a little bit of insight into the politicians and the "rotation control" they do for the campaigns. After watching the movie, I still wonder why they engaged in a romantic way. Does not anyone cry anymore? Do not you need more than two weeks to even consider going overboard with someone else? <br /> <br /> It was good to see an actress, actress, native of Chicago and the second city, Bonnie Hunt. Her role is not necessarily comical, but it's the only one I want to see more. Do yourself a favor, wait on video if you want to see it at all.
