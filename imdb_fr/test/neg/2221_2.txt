Slightly entertaining and timidly voluntary - but what else could it be? Cushing in one of his poorest roles, and he often sounds doubled. McClure is just too Cheezy to be believed, but who can blame him in the wasteland of this film whose plot on ancient man-made dinosaur birds has the "period charm" of the 19th century, but not enough and unfortunately the script carries the racist connotation of literary genre in the movies. Nice effort of the actors, but a poorly conceived production.
