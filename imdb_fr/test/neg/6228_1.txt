I must say that there is a redemptive task with regard to this "film". He firmly fixes the bottom of the barrel. Now, filmmakers know what to aim for before making a movie. Other than that, I regret to watch this debacle. What shameless abandonment the making of this "film" was. What a waste of $ 100,000 (that's right, a hundred thousand dollars). This "film" reminds me of the show "Adult Video Awards" in which a group of "industrial prostitutes" praises themselves, believing themselves as true actors, actresses and directors. Ironic then how I watched blue movies with better interpretation, direction and writing. I also found it funny that the executive producer, Justin Ament, is in the "movie". He plays assistant Jake Barker. I'm sure his acting career has taken off ... Ted Pfiffer, the writer, has a role to play. He was probably wallowing in the glory of the clich√©s he had created. It should be noted that Carrie Finklea plays a leading role in the film. You may remember the "elephant" of Gus Van Sant. Although I'm not too sure she wants to write this movie on her resume. And I'm not sure what is a more depressing point; the money has been spent to make this movie or people will watch it. With "Torque", "Godsend" and "Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow", one of the worst movies, IF NOT THE WORST FILM, of 2004.
