First of all, I must say that I saw the 1939 version at least 100 times; know the whole dialogue and have read the play of 1936, which is different from that of 39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own. This version is as flat as a lifetime movie about adultery. There is a reason why you have not seen an expensive campaign of TV commercials for this. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the bold tone of the original and the way women spent all their time waging war. GUESS WHAT??! It was Booth's intention. It was a theatrical and theatrical rendering of gossip, adultery and back pain among a group of affluent Manhattan socialites. The crowd that created this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material. They go strangely, staging a half-scene and half-scene of the first version. Bette Midler (who is in a few scenes and plays the role of the old countess in a broad and smiling style) has no context in this version. She mentions going after "Buck", which is a key part of the original - so he was never mentioned again. This film is so dull that I will not analyze it too much, but here are some things I found incredible:> Mary Haines boasting about her housewives: "I can suck the nails of a painting!" Right. Great writing. Norma Shearer could have read a line about it and have an Oscar name, right? > A COMPASSIONATE Sylvia Fowler !!! ??? Annette Bening got what she wanted, and the movie is disappearing. Claire Booth used Sylvia as a comic book engine that swept the game. As described immortally by Rosalind Russell, she was an ignorant and nasty woman who dropped a bunch of petty, ridiculous, irresistible dialogues, which remain classic and can be cited. She was not afraid to bite the ankle of Paulette Godard. The filmmakers of 2008 decided that this character had to die. In killing her, they killed the movie.
