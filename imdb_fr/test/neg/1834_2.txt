There is an endless amount of trashy horror movies. It seems that people never tire of trying to scare and shudder. Unfortunately, very rarely these attempts succeed. This unhappy film has almost no redeeming value. The story is very predictable, most actors having no inspiration, or just a typo, special effects of very poor quality. It took a lot of effort not to turn off the DVD and go to bed. With such a limited number of foreign films released in the United States, why in the world would anyone want to import this film? To top it off, there is apparently an "Anatomy 2", for those who have nothing better to do. I prefer to watch the paint dry.
