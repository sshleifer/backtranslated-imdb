My 15 year old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on cable TV. As a person who saw Revenge of The Nerds in a movie theater, I found that this movie was an extremely predictable remake of it. The Nerds have simply been replaced by Dorks. I made her crazy by being able to accurately predict what would happen in each scene. The cast was cute, especially Amanda Bynes. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Chad Creasey should be ashamed to have written such an obvious remake of the film of the early 1980s. The title should have been simply "Revenge of The Dorks". Maybe the sequel will be Revenge of the Dorks 2.
