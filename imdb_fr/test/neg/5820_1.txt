Thank God it was not renewed by ITV. <br /> <br /> This series, although popular (God knows why), has a very simple: "Look, I found another body behind the flowers / bushes / trees / wherever you are. - for the sixteenth time, the plot of this series The dialogue is so simple, it's as if it were written for the children - talking with the viewer and explaining each point of the plot. <br /> <br /> They "happen" to be present when someone does something out of the ordinary - and no one notices them. <br /> <br /> Every time they investigate and investigate the murder of someone one, they annoy everyone, spoiling the lives of everyone - including completely innocent people. <br /> <br /> They break into people's homes, steal objects and evidence (even firearms) curious, entering the lives of people, spying on them and rummaging in their affairs.They never apologize, are never s arrested or arrested (and if they do, they can talk about it, even if another character who does the same thing is put in jail !!!). <br /> <br /> They always climb the trumps. Now, I know it's an easy-going series, but I think it really should not have gone beyond the first few episodes! In simple terms, it's unrealistic. <br /> <br /> I think they found enough bodies in the undergrowth, here and on the continent (where they are every two weeks), so I hope it will never come back. ITV should have an onscreen action instead of all the years of monotony - a series of type "someone was murdered at the village fair".
