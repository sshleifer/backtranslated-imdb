This seems to be one of Noel Coward's lesser-known films, and it's easy to understand why. At first glance, it's not a bad movie, but it's not very good either. Throughout the film, not much happens, it's just the story of the unhappy case of Chris and Leonora and Barbara's reaction to this case. The only thing that makes the film interesting is the fact that we already know that it's going to end for one reason or another, because of the first scene. Oddly, the story offers many perfect opportunities for conflict, but none of them are used. For example, it would have been much more interesting and believable than Barbara had scrambled with Leonora, but both remained on good terms throughout the film. Barbara's notion of betrayal by her friend was not explored at all - in fact, she did not even seem to feel betrayed by her husband; she even encourages him to go on holiday with Leonora. Similarly, Susan Birch and Tim Verney, Chris's two secretaries in his office, who are also close friends of Chris and Barbara, are never forced to take sides. In fact, Tim avoids conflict by telling Chris that he likes him and Barbara a lot. Despite the strange absence of conflict, the biggest flaw of the film is the fact that we do not care whether Chris will end up with Leonora or Barbara. The personalities of the two women are indistinguishable anyway, so we do not know which of them is best suited to being with Chris. In addition, Barbara's permissiveness gives the impression that she does not care much about the case anyway. In addition, I found the relationship between Chris and Leonora unconvincing. I can forget the ridiculously short period in which they fall for each other because it is so common in movies of that time, but even then the relationship seemed superficial. Coward's character was too austere and cynical to be the object of Leonora's affections. It reminds me of Sir Earnest Pease's socially inept genius from the film "Very Important Person" - I'm sure the two would have got along well. Chris's coldness and austerity made his love for Leonora unfeeling. I think Coward should have left that aside and handed over his role to a younger man - in this case, I was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in such a dark, almost emotionless and bald man. Despite all my criticism, the film still manages to be interesting - but not really convincing. The fact that none of the characters is particularly well developed gives them an enigmatic character, which is a little intriguing. The Surprised Heart is certainly worth watching, but it is an imperfect piece of cinema.
