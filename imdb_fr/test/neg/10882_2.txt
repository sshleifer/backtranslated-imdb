Obviously, Raw Video Feed is smarter than all of us who have wasted our money by renting this movie! They will make millions with video rentals and their low budget investment will pay off, which will fund "Rest Stop II" (unfortunately). I guess they spent a few hundred thousand US dollars to hire the actors, rent the rest places, burn a truck and drag a motorcycle behind the truck for a little more money for the technical equipment. That's all. We should all be as smart as these guys, I will not blame them for having the genius to promote a shabby market in good money returns. The premise of the movie was good, and it could have been a really good horror movie, but it failed by not describing a clear story. I'm always looking for a jewel of the new movie companies, but I have not found it here and you either. I'm just sorry I wasted $ 3.99 plus taxes to find out.
