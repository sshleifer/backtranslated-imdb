I will never recover the three hours of life that this film stole me. <br /> <br /> The film is basically a psychedelic journey to drugs disguised as an important creative process. I would love to know what they looked like at the time of this film. <br /> <br /> It is also the most historically inaccurate film; The year 2001 arrived and passed without any events or forecasts occurring. <br /> <br /> The characters are incomparable, the design is simplistic and everything happens without any sense or logic. <br /> <br /> And the end is probably the worst: it's supposed to be a source of reflection, but the only thought that came to my mind is "What is the F $ * K is going on ?! " <br /> <br /> I would say to those looking for serious entertainment: AVOID this movie at all costs and choose a sci-fi movie that DOES NOT live up to your @ $$ account.
