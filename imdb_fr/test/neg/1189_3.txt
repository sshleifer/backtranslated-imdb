If you have watched the series and love the league as I do, then get ready to be disappointed. I went to the movies with a group of hardcore fans of the league and we all agreed that this movie was not as funny or as dark as the previous three series. In my personal opinion, it was a pot of money. The writing was artificial and the intrigue confusing - not confusing just confused with what she was trying to do. It was a self-indulgence of the worst kind on the part of writers much more talented than my pitiful critics. I hope at least that the league can be honest enough with themselves and recognize that this film is inferior to the superb series of three. I will not buy it despite the fact that I have most of the league's memories.
