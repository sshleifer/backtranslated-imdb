When I wrote this in November 2005, I realized that the great boom in British cinema was over and that, if people would say so much, the British government would not give tax breaks to filmmakers. simpler - a lack of diversity on the part of producers in recent years. Let's see what the British were doing from 1995 to 2005: <br /> <br /> Fun thrillers about gangsters. LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKE BARRALES was a really great and entertaining movie. People went out of their way to emulate Guy Ritchie's style with generally disappointing results. <br /> <br /> Romantic comedies. Yeah okay, I realize that FOUR WEDDINGS, NOTTING HILL, ETC. were produced by American studios, but they still remain vaguely "British films". Unfortunately, because they are guaranteed to make profits for the studios, they must follow a winning formula that usually implies that Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant for the umpteenth time <br /> <br /> Black Comedies. Can anyone explain what a black comedy is? In the British context, it is usually a disjointed film with political statements often contemporary and often resembles Mike Leigh's film NAKED <br /> <br /> BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE by Jasmin Disdar is a good example of the third type of British film. Filmed in 1999 but shot in 1993, the film begins with two men fighting for a bus. It is then revealed that one is Serbian and that one is Croatian. So we have a glimpse of what was happening in the Balkans at that time. the probability that two former Balkan enemies will meet in a London bus? This summarizes one of the main weaknesses of the film - irony over probable situations, you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots, but the result is likely? The greatest irony is perhaps the title of the film. This is called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, but it is certain that this member of the public found stereotypes clich√©s that I could not believe as characters in three dimensions.
