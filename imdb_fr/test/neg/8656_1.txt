Neal N Nikki was voted one of the worst films of the year by Planetbollywood. It's hard to believe that the famous Chopra produced this shabby movie. It has been portrayed as a film for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. It does not make you laugh either, but he is crying with boredom and he does not have any sexy girls to make the movie sexy. The title track is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm the Neil, I'm the man, the rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of the worst actors in Bollywood, without acting talent. After making several Super Flops and not receiving movies from a producer rather than his family. It gives a total performance of shit, which bores you to death. Tanisha, who is and will always be known as Kajol's sister, gives a dreadful performance. Both actors have the most annoying chemistry and are very immature for their age. He has a special appearance of the very cute Richa Pollad, in a pathetic role. The end was so stupid and stupid, I can not believe that I actually paid money to rent this shit.
