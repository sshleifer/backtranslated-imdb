This review contains a spoiler --- <br /> <br /> The film is an American ninja mysteriously trained in martial arts. He falls in love with the colonel's daughter and goes from the most hated grunt of the post to the "hero of the people" at the end of the film. This film is extremely cheesy and very poorly documented. It's good for people who do not care about developing plot or reality. Good for children under 14 years old. The military errors in this film are comical. I remember that during my three years in the army, we, the soldiers, were not obliged to salute or call "Monsieur" NCOs, the film does it in different places. The colonel's hair is much too long on the ears. The master-sergeant's mustache went against the military protocol. On the post, the colonel was the only officer present. Not a single officer was shown walking around the station. You had fools of ninjas wielding swords against troops with m-16s, rather poorly made. <br /> <br /> The people that this film has filmed stank. Michael Dudikoff is not really that bad, he just has bad scripts. Ninjas were more hilarious than dangerous. Avoid this movie
