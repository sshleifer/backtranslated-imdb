This film follows in the footsteps of The Riddle for a British all-star cast in a dreadful movie! Poor CGI effects, mediocre editing, mediocre staging, casting which, I hope, has been well paid, as it will be a highlight in many career coffins. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer should have donned his wig Neil once again & went out with a laugh at least! <br /> <br /> It was like a particularly long and prolonged episode of "Torchwood" but without the camp, the fake Canadian doctor Fella ... there was nevertheless the same music too dramatic, perpetually repeated, in a vain attempt to create a tension. <br /> <br /> Oh, humanity!
