Amitabh and Jiah Khan aroused great expectations at their press conferences, though it was easy enough for critics and fans alike that, after all, the long-awaited product, Ram Gopal Verma Factory by Ram Gopal, will fall flat on all odds! Why, because Jiah was so immature and childish, and Bacchan mixed guilt and uncertainty. they themselves did not know, what they were talking about, to the press, to follow the slogan, that some love stories should not be understood, or such trash! Why is the title Nishabd? Ramu needs to refresh his knowledge of Sanskrit, as Vidhu Vinod has to study the Mahabharata, aligning his alignment, another glorious flop of the year, Eklavya! The comparison with Sweet hearts and Lolit's is inevitable, as the so-called plot is supposed to be inspired by it. but unfortunately, Ramu has made little serious effort to deepen the psyche of the elderly and the elderly. Lolly Pop suck the ultimate indicator of innocence? and contrary to this tendency of infantry, the show of legs at the dining table, with a Vijay, that is to say Bacchan in this role, bursting into cries of endlessly scrupulous laughter? this girl is actually in her seductive game, attracting poor Vijay to think, she is in love with him. the legs, too, are rather thin and this act of passing the water hose between the legs is obscene. it is incomprehensible, how can a girl who comes as a guest in the house of a body be so brazen, impetuous and overpowering? and why the devil this stupid woman, played by Revathi, remarkably well, although poorly scripted and unrealistically characterized, encourages her own husband to dance with a girl who says sexually? This part of Vijay, who tries to cool his life, is pure bullshit. because, apparently, he seems to be happy as he is, with a well-established life and a hobby to recreate. It reminds Blame it on Rio, the older dad, and his young love, superbly interpreted by Michael Caine. Bacchan looks horrible up close, and most of all, when Kevin and Spacey and Jeremy Irons are handsome, which is why girls are sometimes attracted to older men, for their charming personality, in relation to youth vulnerability boys of their age. The only good thing about this film is these green landscapes, sprawling, winding roads and nice cinematography. no substance, nor even emotion, drama or even stormy and intriguing sex as in Lolita, this superficial film is not surprising, it fell flat on the face and had to be removed from the screens during the first weeks! next time, before blindly copying such a Hollywood theme, Ramu should do his homework, and Bacchan should think twice! you can not fool everyone at all times, Mr. Bacchan!
