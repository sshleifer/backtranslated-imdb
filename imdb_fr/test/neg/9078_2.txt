The Evil that Men Do (1984) is one of the few films that Charlie Bronson did not make in Cannon in the 80s. Unlike most of Charlie's movies in which Charlie played, this one did not was neither entertaining nor entertaining. Charlie tortures and brutalizes people for more than an hour and a half. If you thought he was Mr. Emotion before, wait until you see that! <br /> <br /> In this one, Charlie goes to an unidentified Central American country and shows the people that anyone who interferes with Chuck or his people has to pay the piper. This one is not fun. It's not cheesy or campy, just brutal, sadistic and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I did not like this one. I have no love for this movie. No recommendation as it is not worth watching. Maybe if they did not get away with it. Look carefully. <br /> <br /> Do not worry.
