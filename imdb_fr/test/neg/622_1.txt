Leave Ed Wood alone. Calling "Plan 9 of Outer Space" the worst movie of all time would deny this abominably vulgar heap of Hollywood guano its legitimate title. This pretentious fusion of endless whimsical and endless phantasmagorical socio-political commentaries seems to have formed itself as "Plan 9", with poorly staged scenes of miserable actors on cheap scenes dotted with what seems to be. images of battles and crowd scenes from higher-budget epics. But while "Plan 9" sometimes manages to be funny when it comes to entertaining in a reasonable way, this sticky fade is sorely lacking in the basic spectacle, with scenes ranging from offensive to scandal (the disgusting burlesque of Groucho Marx flying Manhattan to the Indians) at the bass camp (Hedy Lamarr trying to pretend to be Joan of Arc hearing his "voices") to boring (Dennis Hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of Napoleon) to the surprisingly poignant performance Peter Lorre as a psychotic Nero. Give the worst director trophy to Irwin Allen, for having so much transformed.
