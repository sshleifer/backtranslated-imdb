This is probably the only movie I've seen where IMDb critics on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Stupids" is an atrocious, weak-minded film that has absolutely no artistic value and denigrates a director like John Landis. And that's what makes him great. <br /> <br /> To appreciate "The Stupids", you must keep in mind a little known but very true maxim uttered by director Abo Kyrou: "I urge you to learn to watch bad movies, they are so often sublime. "In order for any film to work, the film must establish and follow its own logic. If he does it so convincingly and sincerely, it is possible that the film works. For example, when you look at "Freddy Got Fingered" as a crude traditional comedy, it's a total and complete junk; when you look at it with the understanding that it's actually a neo-surreal comedy, it's brilliant. <br /> <br /> It also works with good movies. If "Jaws" had not accepted the reality, the end of the air tank explosion would not have worked. But many people think that "Jaws" is largely overestimated for this type of reason, and they are not wrong. But he has his strengths, does not he? The fact is that a film like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others will never get it, no matter how often they are explained. Jim Jarmusch made a convincing defense of "Showgirls" once, and even then, I still do not see him from his P.O.V. This does not mean that he is wrong though. If you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie (and NO, I'm going to put it to bed right away), you can enjoy it for the idiotic, cheap, and pointless movie Stuff at the 80's / start of 90s. <br /> <br /> The defenders and the enemies of this film are right: it is STUPID and it is the goal. The film accepts the stupidity of the characters in the same way that "The Jerk" accepted Navin Johnson's idiocy. And because it takes and works with it, the movie focuses exclusively on using that to transfer the plot and define the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do that and could not use that logic properly; bad movies are bad because they invent as you go, while movies like "The Stupids" know where he's going, what he's doing and why from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I can not defend the film from an artistic point of view, which is why I give it such a low score. The acting is generally bad, the jokes very superficial and the quality of the live action probably spoils what could have been a cartoon. But I can not deny that it's entertaining in its own way, and that's why I'm defending it. I have it right away, and I pity those who do not. <br /> <br /> I must admit I was attracted to this film because of Christopher Lee's delightful cameo appearance (hearing it say "Let go of the record." That would have earned the rent even though I hated this movie), but I was surprised to find that, aside from the Studio Applause Sign TV segment with Jenny McCarthy, I never got bored or disappointed. In fact, many jokes, because of their caricatural context, were hilarious (especially the airbag-cigarette explosion). They were stupid, but they were funny. And the movie does not pretend to be anything else: a STUPID comedy about the STUPID characters and instead of apologizing, he's having fun. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly why it works.
