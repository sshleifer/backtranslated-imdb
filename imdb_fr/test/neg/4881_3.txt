I saw Bogard when he was released in the 70's. This is one of those images that received the X rating for violence. We snuck into our local mill and we saw it anyway. Pretty good picture. A lot of street blood is fighting, although the cheap sound effects for the shots have taken away something. And a lot of sex. I remember one of the first scenes where Bogard met this pretty brunette in an apartment she shows him. Without saying a word, he takes her in his arms, puts her in the window sill and nails her. From what I can remember, the photo sailed from there. So when I discovered that Bogart was also called Black Fist and was available on VHS, I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist is Bogard edited for television. So many scenes that I remember missing, I wondered if it was the same picture.
