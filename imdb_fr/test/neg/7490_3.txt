Fatal Contact: Avian flu in America: 3 out of 10: This film is both funny and sad. The fun part is pretty obvious because it's certainly not a sober look at a possible impending crisis. This is a modern version of The Swarm. And much like these deadly bees (and the so-called deadly bee crisis that prompted them), bird flu has joined a pantheon of media-inspired media stories (SARS, Y2K, Global Warming) that simply refuse to happen. <BR /> <br /> What is sad is the flagrant attempt by filmmakers to create panic. Pandemics were traditionally quite common after not all people died of about 40 years of heart disease. Even recent pandemics such as AIDS are akin to the old-fashioned crisis (think of syphilis) that killed more soldiers than bullets. <br /> <br /> The flu pandemic in the early twenties was an odious venture that killed millions of people, but honestly, life has disappeared. sure. I wonder if our overly dramatic media and their power-hungry government allies would allow life to return to normal. <br /> <br /> The film itself deviates from quite competent scenes (Triage in the Central Station) to ridicule (Rednecks tries to ambush a National Guard in Manhattan). <br /> <br /> The scenarios themselves are rather useless, filmmakers do not seem to be able to decide how much the bird flu is contagious or even if the symptoms look like an Ebola-like accident or just a long disease. Indeed, one scene will show everyone in combination of protection against biological risks and the other will not wear anyone, even a mask. <br /> <br /> The film also refuses to give practical advice on the measures to be taken in case of bird flu. . (Apart from washing your hands, what's not tape?) The acting and the director are competent for a TV movie but the script is everywhere on the map. Finally, the movie has a strangely unexpanded death total that runs down the screen. Just like the swarm did it.
