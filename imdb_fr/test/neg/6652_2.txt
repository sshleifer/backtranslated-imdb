I can not believe I watched this whole movie. Another "Ishtar" in the sense that I kept waiting for it to get better, which never happened. The sound is terrible, ranging from too low to hear the conversations, to a scathing sound in seconds. The plot is absolutely implausible, the acting is mediocre, although Keaton does his usual good job as a mental case, although being labeled in this role could certainly be considered negative. The director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals, drugs, science or anything technical. "Sociopath" ???? I wonder how they got this diagnosis? There are so many mistakes, blunders, and things that do not fit in this movie that if we list them all, it would create some sort of record. Demerol as a general anesthetic? A motorcyclist on the highway wearing a non-DOT / Snell off-road helmet. San Francisco ??? The walls of paper move when you hit them, the helmets come out of nowhere, the cannons point in one direction but hit objects in another, the light appears and disappears and there is hardly a scene of the movement that does not contains no errors. My wife, a nurse in an oncology unit, finally left the room before the end of the movie, so upset by all the medical mistakes. I gave him a 2 only because of Keaton's acting game, otherwise he would have definitely got a 1.
