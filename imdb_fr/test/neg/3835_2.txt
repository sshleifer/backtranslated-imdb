I admit it now. This is one of the most lamentable films ever made. But in Mr Sjogrens's defense, the scene "Not really" was not so bad! <br /> <br /> And you have to like the effort to go to Sweden to find a pretty 15 year old Swedish blonde. Make her speak Swedish by pretending to be Henry's Jewish mother (Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br /> What makes this scene so perfect is that Henrys' father responds to the blonde girl speaking Swedish (Jewish?) in German ... <br /> <br /> The best actor / actress of all the film must be the nun who takes care of the mother of Henry, it is a woman who has no experience of dramatic play, but who nevertheless presents the most convincing performance ever! <br /> <br /> flick is for me a personal nostalgia, it's after all that allowed me to publish on the database IMDb: s. : D <br /> <br /> // I feel like a movie star *
