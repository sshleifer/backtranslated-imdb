This movie is trying to snatch Predator, but this film is much better. This movie has really special effects and a stupid plot. The team that enters the forest to find the cause of disappearances of military and scientists is a combination of rough and rugged delta male commandos and pretty but tough rangers. None of them are too bright. All the characters seem more than willing to flee into the forest and throw their heads in the sword or sword and their death. Some pyrotechnics are very bulky and must be expensive. But close-ups of the creature are laughable, as are most death scenes. Every shot that writers could think of was used. If you are looking for a senseless massacre festival, you risk filling the bill. The night I watched it was very slow so I sat through it all. I must admit that it's been a while since I look at something so serious. There is very little to redeem this movie. I am surprised that such nonsense is produced.
