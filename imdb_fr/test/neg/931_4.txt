First there was Zu Warriors (2001) by Tsui Hark, visually innovative, but he was missing a lot in the departments of actor and screenwriter. Today, this film is visually almost as good as Zu (although it is no longer innovative), but is even worse in the acting and writing departments. It's really sad that there seems to be an almost total lack of acting and scriptwriting talent in the Hong Kong film industry. I guess you have to understand Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogues of the film are. It's as if some delinquent kids were talking on the street, it's so bad. To make matters worse, actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent kids and can not act even if their lives depend on them. I understand that this film is supposed to be a comedy intended for the younger generation in Hong Kong, but have the young people of Hong Kong become so brain dead that they can not appreciate anything other than such acts / writings juvenile and vulgar? If so, it makes me feel ashamed to be from Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> I would like Hong Kong filmmakers to learn some lessons from filmmakers such as Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee, and finally make a stunning visual film as well as a knowledgeable and mature filmmaker in the departments acting and writing. And stop using young singers / idols / idols / hearts as actors because they can not play the number of fans they have at HK!
