Adenoid Hynkel, a humble soldier of the First World War, rose in the following years to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania. He creates an aggressive and anti-Semitic war machine and grows a small mustache with a toothbrush. Does it look like you? <br /> <br /> For the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this platform to urge Europe to take up arms and challenge Hitler and Mussolini. Since in 1940, the United States had more than a year of neutrality and did not want to get involved in the civil war in Europe (remember that it was Hitler who declared war on United States, not the other way around). It is amazing that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate controversy. <br /> <br /> The story concerns on the one hand the vulgar and repulsive Hynkel and the reign of terror that he presides unjustly, and the life in the Jewish ghetto where Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays The Jewish Barber, the ghetto's little hero (The Tramp, if not his name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, interprets, composes and interprets music. <br /> <br /> In 1940, we did not yet know the truth about the Third Reich and we can forgive Chaplin for having something less. that the perfect historical forecast, but even by the standards of the day, Hitler is seriously mistaken. Comedian and sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel stupid and unlucky. All this only humanizes it. When Hynkel, the little warrior soldier, plays with the big gun and the plane upside down, he becomes endearing rather than despicable. As a dictator, he inspects the technical innovations of his subordinates who do not work (the parachute cap, the bulletproof uniform, etc.) and these passages are intended to make us think that the real Nazis are incompetent and can be scanned. In fact, Hynkel's diet is made cute and friendly by its awkward buzz. <br /> <br /> In truth, Chaplin's day was already over by the time he started this ill-considered polemic. Basically, he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (discover the humor, with gags staggering the semi-conscious street or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). The Schultz hero is supposed to represent a measure of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz is more like an operetta character than a Nazi. Is it credible that a figure of Schultz (if it already existed) would say to the FÃ¼hrer's face: "Your cause is doomed to fail because it is based on the stupid and ruthless persecution of innocent people"? And how did Schultz come to the cellars of the Jewish ghetto? If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he persist in wearing his Ruritanian uniform? Chaplin did not yet know all the horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp he is proposing to us is desperately disrupted by the dark spirit of the century. As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of "silent" comedy scenes, loosely rooted in the narrative line of clothing. There's fighting with the stormtroopers, the shaving of a man with Brahms' accompaniment, and the ballet globe (look at the segment filmed upside down). <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard is the tirelessly perfect Hannah. Just as the inhabitants of the ghetto are incredibly nice and the Jewish paradise of Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, Hannah is literally too beautiful to be true. Courageous, provocative, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the incarnation of Judaism in the ghetto cage. "Damn, is not it cute?" she asks after the barber has given it a makeover. Too cute by far, is the answer. She does not intend to tell the truth, because Chaplin has made it caricatural. Would not it be wonderful? The speech that Chaplin puts in his mouth is typical of the author: too verbose, too disgusting. <br /> <br /> Jack Oakie is awesome like Napaloni, the fascist dictator of bacteria. It brings a whiff of cartoon if necessary to the procedure, but the underlying weakness of the film remains. If Napaloni is stupid and ineffective, how can we fear him? Be that as it may, the jerky stop-start of the rear-projected train is a fine example of evergreen gagging far beyond its comic value. <br /> <br /> And where did the Jewish Barber acquire this immaculate Hynkel? uniform?
