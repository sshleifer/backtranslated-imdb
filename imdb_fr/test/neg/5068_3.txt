Like Tinto Brass ("Caligula"), the film's authors do not differentiate between explicit and eroticism. No accumulation at all, just throw naked women on the screen; no, it does not work that way. If close-ups of female genitals do not suit you, be prepared to look away from the screen in several places (I used to do so often). The "all women are whores in the heart" mentality of the film is shocking, and "the story" is in turn absurd and boring (the escape is the most boring part!). But in the middle of the stage, a random scene emerges from nowhere and involves one of the female prisoners and one of the male goalkeepers in a naked wrestling match, which she wins with two judo movements. Although the choreography of the fight is bad, the entire scene is undeniably memorable. In fact, this scene and the beautiful cinematography are the only two reasons why I give this film * on 4, instead of 0.
