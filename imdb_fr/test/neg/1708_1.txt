As an independent filmmaker, I try at least to make a decent movie. This piece of ____ was beyond the small budget. It was shot in video and not at all in mini DV 24P. The look and feel of this was just baaaad. I met the director a few years ago at ShowBiz Expo in Los Angeles and he was talking about this book, Film Making for Dummies, which he was preparing. I thought this little video was going to be something but I guess I was wrong. He could have increased the value by turning a 16mm film instead of this terrible video. The plot was stupid, as were the acting, the fake green screen, the sound and the nine meters. Tonight, I had the choice to rent a movie and I made the wrong choice. Heck !!!!! I bought JoyRide, which was a big movie. The filmmaker should perhaps read real film on filmmaking and not try to cut corners while trying to shoot a low budget movie. Perhaps he should learn from the masters who made The Night of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead and Chain Saw Massacre. to name just a few of the greatest hits of all time. It's a video that should have stayed dead. I can not call it a movie because he did not use a movie.
