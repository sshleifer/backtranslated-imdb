I imagine that it should initially be composed of at least two parts, and therefore a quarter more, because if not, how to explain his confused and abbreviated story? I was never completely lost, but I was often partially lost and generally unclear about my character's motivation. The film gives the impression that the points of the plot have been dropped to get him into his slot. <br /> <br /> If it were longer, it might make more sense, but it would still not be very good. The most interesting idea of ​​the film is to make war between Zeus and Hera a war between a man and a woman, but the film drops the balloon, making the Hera supporters quite horrible without specifying what the followers of Zeus do or think. The film is also interesting because you do not see the gods and there is no real certainty that they exist. So there are some intriguing ideas, but it does not help them. <br /> <br /> Bad dialogue, cardboard characters and an interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic sons. Not unassailable but not interesting to watch.
