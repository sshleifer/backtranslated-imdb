Honestly, this is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. And I saw Spider Baby, and not of this Earth. Damn I even saw 200 motels. Having just discovered the series Freaks and Geeks and being surprised by Linda Cardellini's acting ability, I looked at the critics and decided it was worth trying. This is the last time I will trust an exam at IMDb. I did not realize that MORONS was writing IMDb critics until their calls were answered on AM radio. <br /> <br /> This film is so far beyond the harm that mere words can not express the misery of its state of vomiting. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Watch this film if you think Will Farrel is really funny, if you think Adam Sandler is a comedy genius. Watch this movie but PLEASE DO NOT RACLE!
