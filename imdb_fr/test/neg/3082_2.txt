"Committed", as if Heather Graham was COMMITTED to saving her husband / marriage, then to BE COMMITTED to a psychiatric ward, failing which: what intelligent use of words. <br /> <br /> One of These insignificant films want to be philosophical films in which narration is a series of wise observations that come close to poetry (classy club poetry of the 90s, better known as the name of "chit-chique poetry"). Oh, it's so-so-know-nothing ... Written / directed (or "authored") by a woman (Lisa Krueger, whoever you are, devil), it's a useless road movie, directed by lethargy, full of New Age spiritualist nonsense and the characters that are supposed to be interesting, but are simply seen-before or simply dull. The Latinos of this film, as members of the poor urban minority, are generally glorified throughout their primitivism obsessed with mysticism as a "spiritually superior" people, which is the "strong point" of the political correctness of this movie. <br /> <br /> This whole thing is dead and no longer when good cast members appear occasionally (Kay Place, Baker, Wilson). For its part, Casey Affleck, which is one of the best examples of why nepotism is comparable to first-degree murder. I have rarely seen a more apathetic "actor"; an ugly and ugly moron who crosses his replicas in a sleepy way, almost as if he were pronouncing them in a near-dreaming almost awake, plus that weak voice, one of the weakest male voices I've ever heard of my life. (He must have gone to the Lethargy Tobey Maguire School of Acting.) Throwing this idiot in ANYTHING says a lot about ALL film, that is to say, ALL director or producer. Lisa Krueger is a waste of space without talent. We also have this moron who had the lead role in the "Werewolf" parodied by MST3K; I think his name is Goran Vishnjic, but I'm not sure. Discover his ridiculous accent and silly speech.
