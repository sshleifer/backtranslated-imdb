I just saw Princess Raccoon at the Asian Film Festival in New York. The gentleman who introduced the film praised the audience for its good taste. "You could be at Herbie's: Completely loaded," he says with a smug smile, "but instead, you're here to watch Seijun Suzuki's Princess Raccoon." The audience applauded and applauded. Well, let me tell you that I would rather have looked at Herbie: Fully charged twice in a row. Princess Raccoon, a seemingly fanciful musical based on Japanese folklore, easily qualifies for one of the ten worst films I have ever seen. He is so miserable that his misery actually makes me hate Seijun Suzuki's other films, which is quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that do not go with Princess Raccoon that I do not know where to start. Perhaps his worst faults are both unintelligible and incredibly monotonous. If the reels were mixed or if half of them went astray, the public could not make the difference. If you do not believe me, I challenge you to steal an imprint and have the reels run in random order. If you can tell me which of these films will go, I will give you every cent that comes back to me. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film contains a hodgepodge of scenes, songs (including an inducing rap number) and images. it does not seem to be related in any way. A horribly integrated computer animation is in the spotlight, adding another brick to the huge wall of incomprehensibility, growing rapidly. I would not be surprised to learn that the author wrote any Japanese folklore that came to mind on a pile of note cards, stacked them, mixed them, distributed them on a table, then wrote the script as follows: Their order. <br /> <br /> About thirty minutes after the beginning of the film, a semblance of intrigue arrives on the scene. Something about a raccoon princess with a changing form (in human form) and a falling human being. I was hoping it was an omen for the film to be anything but a series of disturbing scenes, but no luck. The film continues in the same way absolutely confusing. I wish I could go out then, but I was stuck in the middle of a narrow row. In retrospect, it would have been worth staging. <br /> <br /> I'm exhausted thinking about the last two rolls. I spent every moment hoping and praying for it to be over. Every big movement of dolly, music or scene that gave the impression of being about to conclude ended up renewing my hope that the credits would begin. For a minute after another, it continued. And so on. Finally, after dozens of false alarms, this resulted in an abstract pattern on which credits were about to appear. Then, in defiance of all reason, this led to another scene. How could I forget? The completely independent sub-plot of a ninja captured, urinated and boiled in soup had not yet been packaged. <br /> <br /> I will never recover those 111 minutes, but you can save yourself the pain. Unless you want to alter your memory or future enjoyment of Seijun Suzuki's big movies like Youth of the Beast and Tokyo Drifter do not see Princess Raccoon. I would have rather spent my time throwing up.
