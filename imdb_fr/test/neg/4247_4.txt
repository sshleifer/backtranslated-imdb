Everyone I know loves this movie, but I'm afraid not. I hated the movie so much that I had to turn it off at half-movie because of the repulsion. Too much time is devoted to tears, emotions, the fact that the divorce of the character of Bullock is devastated by the pounding of the viewer. Already enough !! And why did not we hear about her ex-husband? It is described only as a costume that passes from time to time. Something must make him want to marry him, what was it? What makes him so devastated after their divorce? More time could have been spent on it than on another wrinkled Bullock shot on the floor of the bedroom. The dialogue is elevated, clich√©d and terrible, a bit like one of those "Afterschool ABC Specials" or whatever. There is no imagination or creativity in this film, it is very predictable and therefore boring. This film also goes into overdrive on the cutiness factor, very stupid and not funny as it was supposed to be! This is just another of those horrendously "I'm a woman, hear me roar" movies, a bit like "Waiting To Exhale". If you want to see "I'm a woman, listen to me roar" really entertaining, original and well done movies, then check out "Gas Food Lodging" or "Ruby in Paradise". Pass this shit !! I give "Hope Floats" 3/10.
