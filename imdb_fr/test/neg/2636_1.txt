This film was nil. The script is so full of holes; I do not see how the producers agreed to fund it. <br /> <br /> We never explain anything. The acting is horrible. The plot is nil. This film was obviously written for 8 years old and under. <br /> <br /> I must say this: why do high school classes only last 2 minutes? The teacher enters, finds a frog on the desk or draws on the board, and 30 seconds later, the bell rings, the class is over. The kids did not even open their books. Can we have at least a little continuity? <br /> <br /> Oh, the dialogue. Milo Jeter is the stuff of the fetus and the reincarnated zombie. Do we really need the line "This is Dr. Jeter's office, Dr. Jeter, Milo's father." Thanks for the advice; I could never put that together myself. It never improves. <br /> <br /> Why does Milo talk like he does, even at the beginning? Has Milo ever been "real"? Or was he ever real, just always what he is now? And if it was always so, why did Milo's "unexplained" accident? <br /> <br /> In addition to "What is Milo?", What are all unresolved items for? We see all these things in his father's office and we never explain what they are used for or what they have to do with this story. What are the injections for? What about the aquarium gear? They are obviously not necessary. (See the movie, it's going to make sense) And what does this medicine do to someone? Apparently nothing, because it has no effect on the main actress. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very, very bad scam of all other slasher movies. It's a really horrible Friday, celebrated by a 10-year-old writer. It's not cheesy enough to laugh, it's just incredibly frustrating trouble.
