Since Roger Corman attached his name to this production, I had high hopes for this film. Corman made many memorable low-budget horror movies in the 1960s. I particularly appreciated his adaptations of Poe's stories, such as "The House Of Usher", "The Pit And Pendulum" and "The Raven" , which featured the great Vincent Price. These films had an acting, an atmosphere, a suspense, a strong characterization, an intriguing plot development and delivered scary moments. Unfortunately, "House Of The Damned" sacrifices for the most part these qualities instead of special effects with modest budget, free nudity and carefree gore surmounted by quick shots and angles of shooting. <br /> <br /> 'House Of The Damned' begins with beautiful shots in Ireland, but it is quite downhill. Unfortunately, instead of spending time creating an atmosphere, creating characters that might interest us or creating suspense, the director chooses to start counting the number of people. After a brief introduction to the main characters, a young couple and their daughter, the audience passes the balance of the film from one dreadful event to another, which in this film replaces a coherent plot development. The main characters are so badly designed and so misinterpreted - the audience does not care what happens to them. To make matters worse, the "spooky" events are either totally cliché or unconvincing because of the undeveloped technology - low budget special effects. The soundtrack was lifted from "The Omen". The plot, the little bit, borrows a lot from 'Poltergeist' and 'The Legend Of Hell House', but has none of the qualities that made these films compelling. <br /> <br /> If you want to see well do haunted house movies, I recommend watching classics like "The Haunting (1963)", "The Innocents (1961)" or watching the first American international movies from Corman and move on to "House Of The Damned" unless you are masochistic or blind. <br /> <br /> 3 ½ of 10. <br /> <br /> Rob Rheubottom <br /> <br /> Wpg, MB.
