Considering they wanted to make a vampire movie in space, I thought, "Well, it's probably going to be pretty lame, but at least interesting enough to see a different version of the whole genre." Oops. I do not care what kind of movies you like; Even if you're the biggest fan of vampire, horror, suspense, or suspense in the world, or unfavorably, if you've never seen a horror movie before and you're expecting your first is impressive in any way ... you are mistaken. I do not think I have ever seen a movie "made for the TV movie" or special after school. I have never seen a TV pilot show such a bad experience. I have never seen animal footage sleeping or boring as bad as that. This is by far the biggest waste of hours you might otherwise spend contemplating the importance of tea towels and their effect on your life. I'd much rather stay stuck in a bathroom for weeks without consuming anything other than my own urine and excrement rather than watching a single clip of this movie again. Looking at this, I figured I needed to know the fate of the characters instead of knowing that I was paying money to watch it. It was like a train wreck, it was a shame that you could not help but watch, hoping that something positive could happen. It does not have. Please, for the sake of God, if you or your friends - even if you use illicit substances at the same time - even if you plan to watch this movie, instead choose to hold a contest to see who can shoot further. This will bring you a lot more fun and entertainment.
