Well, here we have a zombie movie that may not even be really a zombie movie. The whole movie is set in the near future in the grip of zombies, but the film does very little with this concept. Instead, he focuses on a zombie hunter who tries to get revenge and gets his money back from a bunch of other bounty hunters. What good is money when the whole world went to hell and the cities are sorry? And why pay people first for killing zombies? As if people would not kill these dangerous menacing monsters when they will not be paid. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the story of "The Fast and the Undead" is far from tight. Of course, it does not contain either the most logical and interesting moments, characters or dialogues. <br /> <br /> This is not a completely horrible film though. It's certainly not as bad as some people are trying to make you believe it is. It's pretty beautiful, or rather, the movie does not look cheap over it. Its effects may be a little overused, but they still look good, as well as the effects of makeup. <br /> <br /> But the movie was not what I was hoping for. Its title could suggest that the film is in the wild west, at the time of cowboys, but its title is a misleading title, chosen without a doubt to take advantage of it. I fell in love hoping that this film would be a combination of a western and a horrible movie of zombies and horrors. <br /> <br /> For fans of zombie movies, this movie will be mostly a disappointment. Of course, this does not add anything new to the genre, but it does not have enough of that kind in itself to be considered a good one to watch. <br /> <br /> Not totally unassailable, but also far from recommended. . <br /> <br /> 4/10
