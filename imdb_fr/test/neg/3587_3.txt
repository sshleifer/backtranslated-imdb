We have already seen a story like this: a woman in marital conflict (played by Nastassja Kinski) has sex with a stranger (William Baldwin) and then wants to resume her life with her husband and daughter. When she returns home, she discovers that her husband has finally found a job. Everything seems bright. However, Kinski discovers that the new boss of her husband is actually the stranger who is still interested in her and seems to do everything in her power to get what he wants. What to do? Say nothing? <br /> <br /> I did not really like the movie. Although it was not only bad, it was clearly missing something. Maybe he should have focused more on what's going on in Kinski's head. Nothing to say about the actors themselves (I guess Baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsessed boss), but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical, acting just as you would for your daily TV movie characters. Finally, the end completely ruined what could have been an interesting plot. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film tried to look cool, there was a bit of photographic work staggering here and there, still images, fast cuts and glamor, but in the end, I think that it's much better suited to Spelling productions. Same thing for music. Otherwise, it did not seem so bad. <br /> <br /> Some might like it, but it certainly was not my cup of tea. To be fair, I do not usually look much at this type of thriller. It was too long, even though it only lasted an hour and a half. I think it would have worked better as an episode of an hour in some TV series. Some scenes are absolutely unnecessary, especially the shower scene. <br /> <br /> My advice: try before you buy!
