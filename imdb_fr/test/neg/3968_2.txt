This film comes from the mom of my friends who worked in a charity shop. She gave it to us with a load of other unknown tapes. The film itself is a bit nil. There are a few things to laugh at like the bite of his girlfriend, but in general, the movie is bland. Interestingly, when I saw the trailer for "The Island," I could not help but notice the similarities. Clonus may have inspired this film? All in all, do not worry about watching this movie because it is dull and boring. We loved music so much at the age of 16 that we gave our band our name. Another sign that this film is a bit crappy is that the shots on the back of the video box do not appear in the movie? weird
