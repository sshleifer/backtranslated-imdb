I watched Kindred for the first time in 1987 with another movie called Devouring the Waves. I remember then that I hated both of them and that I never really cared to watch them again. <br /> <br /> However, I recently launched a crusade in order to collect as many horror titles from the 80s in their original boxed form, which have been removed for a while. I myself have a pretty proud collection with many more titles on my list! <br /> <br /> The Kindred although I have not received a copy yet is a priority because all the old movies that I did not like at the time, I now own and have now reviewed and think that 'They are brilliant and the pieces I remember from the Kindred now lead me to want to get a copy as soon as possible <br /> <br /> Hurray for the 80s and long live the horror!
