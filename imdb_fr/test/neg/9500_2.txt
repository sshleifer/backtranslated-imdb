Yah. I know. It bears the name "Sinatra" in the title, how can it be serious? Well, it's bad, believe me! I praised that thinking that it was a film I missed in theaters. It's not. It's a waste "film" made by people at Showtime (cable station). Decidedly, these cable channels earn a few dollars and think they can make movies of all the garbage they want! It's not good. I'm as big a fan of Sinatra as any sensible man, but this movie was just silly. Boring. Dull. Not funny. Uninteresting. The only quality that redeems is that (assuming they stick to the facts), you learn what happened to the kidnappers of Frank Jr. Otherwise, it's just a stupid movie.
