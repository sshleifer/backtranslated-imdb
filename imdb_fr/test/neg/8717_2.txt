Surely one of the most unhealthy shows ever produced on these shores and that says something. Even many of the main actors did not stay around. The fact that it lasted eight years is a sad indictment of the average intelligence and cultural system of the Australian viewer. He was going around in circles, with repetitive gags and badly drawn characters. Arthur MacArthur, for the love of God. did they really pay the writers of this show? I wonder if anyone has checked their qualifications. There were gags about the rural people and second-rate joke situations that were just bad imitations of a thousand English and American sitcoms. I think that's what I hate about it so much, that it seems like no one wants to make it memorable, original or smart, opting for the lowest common denominator each time.
