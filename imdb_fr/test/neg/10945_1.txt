Now, I love Bollywood movies and I am very happy that they have recently achieved success in the UK. However, Suneel Darshan's latest effort is a deeply flawed film from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a modern Bollywood shooting of Amadeus was quite exciting, until the two supposed "musicians" appeared on the scene, as if they had never touched a manuscript of their life. Upen Patel is a very handsome man and the film plays according to his narcissistic sensibility, but he is never credible as modern Mozart. In terms of acting, all he can do is stand there and pout. His expressions, his hair, and his clothes are all alike, even in the scene where he is supposed to be "dying," when in fact he seems to have only a slight snort. Bobby Deol, who plays the role of Salieri, does his best to animate this little wooden script, but, alas, he seems a little angry when he is supposed to fear jealousy. <br /> <br /> Bollywood films are widely known for their beautiful scenery and colors, but Shaklaka resembles a dull reproduction of the BBC. In fact, Shakalaka is closest to Hollyoaks because it blatantly conceals a very bad scenario behind beautiful looking people, who are beautiful. "It has not yet reached mediocrity" - the same could be said of totally forgetful songs. <br /> <br /> In short, Darshan's latest offer has no boom, no collapse and no resonance. Instead, he just walks with his head down, hoping to catch your attention with a slight pat on the shoulder. And that's not enough at all.
