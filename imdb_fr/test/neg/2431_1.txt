This show is not in my opinion, well, again I did not appreciate any Disney Channel cartoon. With the exception of "The Proud Family", because it's like a normal teenager. This show is very similar to how I feel about Lilo and Stich the Series. It was a mistake to turn the film into a cartoon because the film was excellent, the drawing is terrible. Disney Channel was doing well before adding all those silly comics such as Dave The Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Lilo and Stich the series, American Dragon Jake along and where it all started: Kim Possible. The shows would have been better if they had come to PlayHouse Disney! Regarding this particular show, Kuzko will never leave school in the same way that Dave The Barbarian's parents will never come home and Brandy And Mr. Whiskers will never come out of the jungle.
