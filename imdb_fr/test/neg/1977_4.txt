I give this movie a 4 because I am a hardcore fan of the video game series. the graphics and animation are excellent and it's nice to see the whole group in computer graphics Sephiroth is still cool <br /> <br /> now that he's got a 4, the characters have the impression of to be wooden boards with the worst voice I have already seen a movie (I watched an epic movie). <br /> <br /> The film seems so oriented in the clouds that it is so annoying that even the fans are embarrassed by the cloud. the clouds have talked so much that you would not want to see him in this movie <br /> <br /> the villains have been rewarded for the worst villains of all time (I was more scared by the evil witch of the 'west' <br /> <br /> all the other characters in this movie are just put in the movie to wink at the fans and go no further than this <br /> <br /> wtf with the chaular cold ??? <abstract>: waited 9 years for this film and that's what I get a great cinematic scene useless and boring that I beg the head of square Cenix to shoot the head of this engraving for each copy of the film and one who participates and creates a new film from the ashes (it would be nice to make the film live and based on the original game)
