The set of this artificial film of the Disney family (ad-exec gives a horse to his teenage daughter because she "wants one more than anything in the world") is only a pretext to film the great show horse culminating at the end. . All the other ingredients (the stomach pill advertising campaign, Kurt Russell as a boy's potential boyfriend, Lloyd Bochner as Dean Jones's potential rival on Diane Baker's affections) are set aside by from the end simply to introduce the horse. More than half of the image is a filling, and even worse: he is whiny and obnoxious. The girl is a kind of ninja who cries on the couch with a dog in her arms and, as usual, she is doing. * from ****
