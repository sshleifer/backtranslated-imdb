The Foreigner is a direct video from Steven Seagal that was originally to be released as a theatrical feature film in March 2003, an intention that would have been reversed when the previous Seagal film (Half Past Dead) was presented at the box office. According to reports, the film had a gigantic budget of $ 20 million, including filming in Warsaw and Paris, and was completed as part of the studio's obligation to obtain a negotiated two-image contract. after the relative success of Exit Wounds, which seemed to indicate Seagal still had a solid customer base. <br /> <br /> Despite the size of their investment, Sony Screen Gems probably made the right decision when it came to filming this film. It's almost incomprehensible. What do I say? It's the world upside down. I do not think I understood what was happening except in the broadest terms. <br /> <br /> Seagal is used by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious man. Other mysterious types are trying to stop it. Other very mysterious guys are trying to kill the moderately mysterious guys who are trying to stop him. Others really very mysterious are doing particularly mysterious things, which were in fact too mysterious for me to understand. The mysterious wife of the intended recipient tries to intercept the package before it can be handed over to her husband. Because he is a self-proclaimed "consummate professional" who was hired to deliver the parcel solely to the husband's hands, Seagal first challenges the woman, then pledges to protect her later, as well as her daughter, against other mysterious dudes with unexplained explanations. agendas, as well as her husband. <br /> <br /> Many people have mysterious and cryptic conversations. Many people are bleeding their brains. Some guys seem to die more than once, while in other scenes, the fighting ends without a clear view of the result. The public sees someone dying, but it is not clear which one of the shooters is about to leave. Allegiances often change, adding an extra mystery. Or should I say confusion? <br /> <br /> I do not know who was on the side of who, or what anyone really wanted, and the resolution was as unsatisfactory as the show. At the end of the movie, I sat there thinking, "This is the end? What is ...?" <br /> <br /> I could not even understand the credits. IMDb says that Australian actress Kate Fischer (from "Sirens") was in this movie, but I'll be damned if I know where. Either she stayed on the floor of the cutting room or she wisely chose not to participate in the project. She could have found some activities that were more beneficial to her career, such as unnecessary surgical procedures, retrieval of these cumbersome magazine cards, or taking classes at a community college. <br /> <br /> Seagal was a pretty woman. just a melee, but the action scenes have failed to redeem this movie. Seagal is in his fifties now and is a very big man. It is therefore reduced to a minimum level of physical effort. Even during this period, he is locked in a coat going up to the knee to hide his circumference of Brandoesque. He might even be a little tired by removing the chocolate bar envelopes, although this is understandable if you estimate how much he needs to eat to maintain his current size. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal seemed to be doing it. a return with Exit Wounds, but if his last movie was dead at half past one, it must be about to fill the other half.
