Harrison Ford plays the role of a police officer in a crime thriller. The perfect ingredients seem to SEPARATE for high level entertainment. Harrison returned to his best Indy and Han Solo, protecting a witness from ruthless and merciless murderers. How easy it is to be fooled. If the film focused on the main themes, supposedly, crime and suspense, instead of installing barns and placing ice in the faces of people, it might have been more useful. Corn is incredibly predictable with the best method of sending an enemy.
