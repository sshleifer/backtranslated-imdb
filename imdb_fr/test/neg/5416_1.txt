It was so bad that I want God to give me two more hours of living after sitting there. <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting game was uniformly bad. There was hardly a plot, unless "Shaggy's dog story with a guy in a rain poncho and a skeleton mask in place of a dog" counts. <br /> <br /> The editing was everywhere and the idle shots of the "gore" (a red corn syrup that flies in the air - probably spun) became irritating after the tenth time and annoying after the hundredth. <br /> <br /> I love Michael Rooker. He did a good job. It was not good. It was less than good. And by that, I mean that it was afraid. Difficult. <br /> <br /> For God's sake, do not watch this movie.
