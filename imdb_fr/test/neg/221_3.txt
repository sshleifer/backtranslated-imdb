I am so angry to the point that I normally make criticisms with spoilers, but in this case, I will make an exception. The first scenes of this film are weak and then, when they get to the meat and potatoes of the film, it's sucks. It's a movie where I loved the bad guys because the captain's backup was incredible and there was no connection with him, nor anything that could make you like him. The main actor gave the lowest performance and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon could not even save this film. Sometimes there are revelations or great moments in a movie that may not be so great ... this movie has none. If you are looking for a movie to watch while waiting for nothing to interest you, do not choose this one ... save your money.
