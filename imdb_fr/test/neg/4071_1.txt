Aghhhhhh! What a desappointment. A very good song like Antonio Sabato Jr and nothing but embarrassing embarrassment coming out of his mouth. I creaked 95% of the dialogue! It would have been better to make the character dumb! How Antonio Sabato and Michael Par√© could talk about these lines without losing control of certain bodily functions, it exceeds me! If Michale Pare's character had preceded or finished just one more sentence with the word "Men", I think I would have thrown the iron through the TV (I love multitasking, especially to avoid bad ones movies). It must have been a lean year for both of them to sign up for this film. Washing cars for a living would probably be very useful to them now. And the villain ...... if he was so mean, why did not he just shoot all those rich college students instead of promising toilet breaks? Even the title was an abuse of language. "Crash Landing" means that the plane really crashes and does not land without a symbolic fire or a casualty. Instead of landing safely, the plane should have crashed and burned exactly like the scenario. <br /> <br /> THIS FILM IS A STINKER!
