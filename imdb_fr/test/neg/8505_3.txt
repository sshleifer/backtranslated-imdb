I enjoy gay-themed movies where the characters are not stereotyped and that's what attracted me to this film, the main actor, which is the only reason I give this movie a star more than he deserves (but not because of his role in the film, let me tell you). Many people complain about cinematography, but the camcorder aspect of the film has added a certain "underground" quality and there are several scenes, usually around sunset or sunrise and between trains that would make people blush. movie screen. <br /> <br /> But the acting is cardboard, the music is repetitive (I listened to the last half of the movie while listening to a soundtrack from another movie), you have to wait almost twenty minutes for a dialogue, then it's awkward and amateurish. The subject of the graffiti could have made this film great if it had been exploited with elegance and if the art itself had been more intriguing, but it is not the case. <br /> <br /> Worse, there is no climax; there was no real plot to start. The film returns to its shell of silence and dies. A forgettable movie.
