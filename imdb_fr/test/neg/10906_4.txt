The cookie cutter starts to work overtime in this obvious and non-original love story. The plot, as it is, was made before a trillion dollars, so there is no need to tell it. Suffice to say that all 12 year old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to make faces. Even the soundtrack is awful! It's not that I do not like figure skating, although I do not like it, is that I do not like clich√©s, bad movies.
