Jumpin 'Butterballs, this movie stinks! It is a dull and apathetic brake that never lets go. It is a marvel that anyone has even bothered to worry about Groucho with his weird eyebrows and mustache, for he has nothing witty or unworthy to do or say throughout this boredom. Chico must have been so selfless that he forgot to use his Italian accent. <br /> <br /> Only Harpo smiles or two, and there is very little to do here. Figure in a strong angry hotel manager and another odious co-comic to Frank Albertson, and the road becomes even more bumpy. <br /> <br /> A real failure.
