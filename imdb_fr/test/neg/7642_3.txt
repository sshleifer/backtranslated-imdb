I'm surprised by the number of people who have rated this entry in their favorite song "Chan" (have they ever seen "... at the Opera" or "... ... at the island at treasure? "--- the latter ironically written by John Larkin, who dropped the ball here). This plot is a train wreck and overloaded with useless characters. First, viewers are reminded of the sordid details of Steve McBirney's 1929 murder series (played by venerable thug and HUAC, Marc Lawrence). Let's not forget that he escaped a skilled murder in the courthouse with only one policeman on his tail. There is also a victim who was caught in a river 11 years ago and who never seems to worry about anyone. Then there is the suspension of the disbelief required when all the characters are apparently trapped in the wax museum (although Inspector O'Matthews manages to maneuver his soft and wet hindquarters through a window). Why is Joan Valerie (Cream's assistant) in this movie? She can not even handle the pliers properly --- I realize that Chan is suffering the same way but yeesh, he is 66 years old here-- (and has less than 10 lines --- and the motivation of his character is too weak to never be adequately divided (excuse me, when I'm on a speech, I write like Ricky Ricardo) The character of Mary Bolton (Marguerite Chapman) is written as a googly-eyed moron, apparently only for the the insipid and romantic interest of the horndog The lawyer Tom Agnew (played by the ferret Ted Osborne) Why is Willie Fern a character and why could the McBirney's henchman not press the switch at 8:20 am (not a spoiler, alright ?!) One wonders how the IQ of lint he manages to get dressed or why he had not stopped in front of a bus years ago. himself gets a little more rope to play than usual (a plus) and the real congratulations go to scenographer Thomas Little and director of photography Virgil Miller who created a truly scary atmosphere ... but this entry is less logical than a Ritz Brothers movie. until the way a toothpick can be used as a blowgun is staggering.
