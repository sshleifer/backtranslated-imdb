The worst Korean movie of all time! The plot is ridiculously complex, incredible, and the film does not create a single shock. It creates enough suspense, then leaves you agitated, causing neither shock nor instability. Whenever there is an icy moment, it does not bother you because you are always trying to determine who is who and what is happening! It looks like this: a modeling company is hiring 4 people for a modeling career. but the owners are not what they seem to be, they have model dolls from all over the world and we see a strange girl walking around the premises and the owners have no recognition of a girl. It turns out that everyone is there for a reason and that's all I could understand. The end is a mix of murders and you do not know who is a doll who is real and who is dead! I do not recommend it to fans of Korean / Asian horror movies.
