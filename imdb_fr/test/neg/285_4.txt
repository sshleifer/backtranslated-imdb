Every James Bond movie has its own rules. Like every Indiana Jones movie has its own rules. And the fact that the writers do not respect these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely useless plot, the integrity of the two films on the ocean lies between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon. <br /> <br /> Imagine what would happen when you swing on the rope bridge outside the Temple of Doom. Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry because throughout the first two movies, he secretly had super powers and could send them both safely. <br /> <br /> Entertaining? Of course, for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done it because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly, it would have annoyed the public. They had already sat at the edge of their seats for 3 hours of Indiana Jones movies and were counting on Indiana to crank them out of this bridge. If he flew? People would have come out of theaters in the same way as during Ocean's 12. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> 1. The character of Julia Roberts, Tess, infiltrates a museum by dressing up in ... Julia Roberts?!? A smart trick? By breaking the fourth wall three hours after discovering these characters? Is the naked cannon 33 and 1/3? This is a classic example of how a cheap laugh can ruin an entire movie. But wait ... just in case you are not out yet ... <br /> <br /> 2. The suspense is created throughout the last hour of the film - how will they manage the robbery - there are only 10 ... 8 ... 5 ... 2 DAYS THAT ARE! And then, in the last 12 minutes of the film, the only entertaining part of this movie, we see that the robbery was made a few days earlier and it took Matt Damon 30 seconds to finish. The last 10 days? A total loss of time. <br /> <br /> BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON THE BRIDGE TO THE CORDS ... "Relax, Willie, I stole the real stones about a month ago, and I convinced them that you were Kate Capshaw! "<br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, cut your losses and see the Polar Express. I do not want to ruin the end for you, but there is really a Santa Claus. More importantly, you will not feel cheated when leaving the theater.
