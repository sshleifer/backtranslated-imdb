To think that he could only improve was the worst hypothesis I ever made .... <br /> <br /> Drivvle does not describe this film appropriately! <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot lean, but I feel more excitement for my pet fish! <br /> <br /> It was a shame to see Pete Postlethwaite, whom I respect as an actor who tries to do his best with the little he has had to work with ... <br /> <br /> I think a cardboard cut in Stephen Baldwin would have done a better job and he would have been more animated. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! It could really be dangerous for your health!
