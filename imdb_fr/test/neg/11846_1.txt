First of all, I want to say that I consider it one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I watched it nearly 10 times just because I wanted to spread the deliciously tasteless bowels of this film to other unsuspecting victims. It contains the captivating essence of a hand-held video recording of the seventh birthday of a distant nephew. He has all the writing of a WWE match. And above all, it has the consistency of a face scraped on a sidewalk. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three drunk teenagers in the desert. This scene convinced me that I was on something big when I chose this movie on the DVD holder (being attracted by the box because of the graphic of a velociraptor shouting the word "RAPTOR" on the front of it). The scene contains treasures such as tomato sauce, spaghetti intestines, vain attempts at humor and rubbery dinosaur puppets that are repeated throughout the film. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film contains erratic backgrounds and props that make people think that someone might be ashamed of making a film. For example, a truck in the middle of the night is parked near a cliff wall. The next day, they find it in an open grassy area. The driver could not have driven him there, his face having been stung by an anonymous bipedal carnivore (I'll explain why he is not named in a second). So my only assumption is that the velociraptor drove it, the cattle that the driver was carrying did, or Jim Wynorski does not like his viewers very much. In a corner, they expect me to believe that they walk at night on a main street while the road has no gutters, that the fire hydrant is precariously placed near a cabin phone and that there is only one lamppost. Still, I always feel obliged to watch and see this movie again, just to find more things that will make me laugh the next time I watch it. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The making of this film is horrible. Long extended breaks. Strange cutouts of characters who were not even close to the conversation. People talk casually about the camera (and in turn, facing the wall). They can not even give the dinosaur a coherent species, calling it a baby dinosaur and using a velociraptor rubber puppet (characterized by an extremely long, greasy and disproportionate claw). This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Editing occupies an important place on this film. It is not a good thing. I am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films, crafted with talent in one piece of shit, but there must be a limit! The secondary plots end as abruptly as they started. Explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters are not limited to, well, are not explained at all! And an end that looked like driving a muscle car in a brick wall without a seatbelt. You never know what will happen because the film does not follow a coherent structure. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Now, all I have to do is mention a scene (the biggest one) that takes place towards the end. It's a spoiler, but not really. The final scene contains a confrontation between Tyrannosaurus Rex and Sheriff Tanner. It's like the clash between Sigourney Weaver and Alien Queen in Aliens, except without all the emotional power / budget / epic battles. It's nice, it's that Tanner drives the dinosaur with a construction machine. A white lynx. In a few minutes, through a series of sneaky cuts, the director manages to turn this bobcat into a yellow machine / crane. Now, as I said, I know that this film is made from scenes from other films, but which two films justify a confrontation with a t-rex in a construction vehicle? This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> This film gets a 1/10 for the quality of making a movie, but a 10/10 for how much it makes me laugh and have fun.
