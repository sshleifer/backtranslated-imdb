Solo is an action movie on an android similar to Terminator, built and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, it is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chose to escape to the jungles of Central America where he took refuge in a village. The army pursues him, leading to a great feast of action. <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peebles decently executes the android. His movements and gestures seem mechanical enough to do the job. The current scientific realism is abandoned to become a good action hero. And it works. the action scenes are not so spectacular, but they are not all that bad either. The other characters' game is pretty bad, but I did not expect anything too good. The special effects were also decent. <br /> <br /> The solo is a decent action movie, but very memorable. It lacks the substance that most movies have. But if you just want to spend a few hours without thinking too much, the work will be done.
