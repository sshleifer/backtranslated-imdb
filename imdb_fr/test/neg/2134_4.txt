A giant mutant squid "five meters long" with five tentacles, razor fangs and the ability to breed its own cells terrorizes a small Florida town. Various marine biologists, doctors and cops plot to kill him. Meanwhile, a human monster called Miller offends people who discover that "Devilfish" is an artificial creation used for the greedy benefit of some evil doctors! Miller attacks a researcher, strangles her, drowns her in the bathtub, dries her hair, then tears her corpse's pants! <br /> <br /> Many false alarms are triggered when our heroes Peter, Stella, Janet and Bob set off on a high tech "Seaquarium" boat (anyway for 1984) to catch the creature, who is frequently seen in a film very close or hilarious, at the accelerated speed, to appear more threatening. And only fire can destroy it, leading to a group of weapons armed with flamethrowers and a final aquatic beast. <br /> <br /> This withdrawal of JAWS is quite tame (other than a corpse without legs and decapitation) but has an excellent score Antony Barrymore and a decent monster design (also for 1984). Luigi Cozzi and Sergio Martino wrote the original story. <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
