Killjoy 2 is identical to killjoy 1. Bad acting, bad characters, annoying clown, bad lines, you name it. Honestly, I'm not at all surprised that more people have not seen this movie. The only reason I watched Killjoy 2 was because I wanted to think that filmmakers learned from their mistakes. They do not have. This film is just as bad, if not worse, than the first one. That clown ... that fucking clown ... I hate him! I hate him so much! And I do not hate him because he's a good villain ... I hate him because he's annoying beyond belief! I hope the filmmakers realized after trying and failed again that this film is irreparable. The last thing we need is a Killjoy 3.
