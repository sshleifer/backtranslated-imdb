"You know - I went to cities where the girls were not so pretty, in fact I went to cities where they're ugly ugly, but this is the first time I've been in a city. There are no girls at all "I'm sure fans of the classic will remember this sentence that belongs to Vin ... one of the REALLY gorgeous seven years (from the first film) ... <br /> <br /> I would like to rephrase it here. You know, I've seen movies where the plot is not very good. In fact, I've seen movies where the plot is terrible, but it's the first time in my life that I've been watching the movie without any plot. <br /> <br /> OK. Maybe my statement above is a little exaggerated, but honestly ... how can you call the plot a shit happens in this movie. The bad guy (oh, do not ask me to give you his name, because I do not remember him and he's not even close to Calvera, whose name and character is unforgettable ...) try to build a church on behalf of his dead sons, who were killed in battle, and this villain is abducting poor villagers to force them to build the church ... <br /> First of all, what should be the size of the church to force hundreds of villagers to build it ... is it an Egyptian pyramid or something? but well, let's stop here on the plot and the absolutely unforgettable character of a villain and say a few words about The Seven itself ... <br /> <br /> The good old Chris of Yul Brynner, always calm, always silent, speaking less but talking wise left (unfortunately). Oh no ... he's as calm as he was ... but now he's so quiet you do not buy it. (Imagine, he meets a good old friend Chico, whom he must save after so many years and there are just some "hello, hello" and not even a handshake (as far as I can remember)) ... Honestly, it looks more like it's like meeting two strangers on an internet chat, rather than meeting Chris and Chico. That makes "new Chris" look more like robocop or terminator rather than our beloved sage quickgun ... <br /> <br /> I will not stop here to talk about other characters. There is simply nothing NONE ... (imagine if an actor as powerful as Yul Brynner is so wrong to forget, then what other characters will look like) ... <br /> <br /> There still have some attempts to give us a background story for each of them ... for example one of the favorite women, the second is a man with a dark past whose wife was raped and killed by Indians and since when he kills everyone and everything that moves ... but none of these characters makes sense or can take your heart. <br /> <br /> I remember I was a little kid and when O'reilly (the character of Charles Bronson) died in the first movie I was crying. Here, I did not care about each of them ... even if all of them with the film crew would die, it would seem that I do not care anymore ... <br /> <br /> > So, please, go see this movie ... I recommend it because you will not have another chance to see something worse than that.
