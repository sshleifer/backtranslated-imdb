Robert Altman's "Quintette" is a dismal thriller, dark and hard to follow. We give it up after a while, because it's so complicated. . At the end of the photo, she was less than a quarter. I have never witnessed such a mass exodus without the urgency of driving people away. That should tell you how bad it is. I think it's the worst film ever made with such talent in front of and behind the camera.
