Due to rather dubious plate tectonics, Japan is starting to slide underwater. The initial forecasts indicate that it will take about 40 years before the country is submerged, but a dishonest scientist adds to even more dubious scientific data and estimates that it will actually be less than a year! The government thinks it's a headache, but the evidence is beginning to support its theory. <br /> <br /> This catastrophic budget-budget film follows the formula set by many Hollywood movies of the late '90s (I guess, none of them), the scale of the disaster and tragedy bringing out the nobility of the human spirit (well, Japanese) by acts of heroism and sacrifice, and proving the power of love or something of the kind. that is to say, as naive in its psychology as in its geology ... we all know that half of the population would be raping and looting the moment it thought that the police had their back turned and the other half would panic and be useless. <br /> <br /> The film has some very nice special effects, but is not as smooth and expensive as an equivalent Hollywood production. He is at least as nationalistic, devoid of humor and self-conscious as this Hollywood film would be, and his action is probably even worse. The devilish bitch of Battle Royale is one of the main actors ... but she is not even a little perverse, so she is much less hot. <br /> <br /> The film is much too long at 132 minutes, and it gets worse and worse as it progresses to a conclusion that threatened to throw me up. I did not care whether Japan was flowing half-way or not, and well before the end, I was trying to find ways to speed up the process should I ever be in this situation for real. <BR /> <br /> But it has pretty special effects and Kou Shibasaki is always so hot, so I give it magnanimous ... 3/10.
