All I can say about this movie is that it is absolutely boring. The intro of the movie is probably the worst intro of a horror movie I have ever seen. I mean an angry chick hitting a guy in the head with a frying pan is not at all scary, that's what the director was aiming for, but in fact it was "slightly" funny. <br /> <br /> The game in this picture was beyond pathetic; a note to filmmakers: if you make a horror movie, please engage good actors, not famous reality TV followers who have no idea how they are acting. <br /> <br /> The death scenes of this movie were beyond boring. .. no gore, and I'm sorry but horror movies without gore, or good suspense are only corny. I mean, this girl gets killed by the hair around her in the middle of Tokyo and no one sees it coming, they simply declare it as "missing", wow it's great! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you and your friends want to see this film, make sure to bring sleeping pills because I guarantee you will not succeed until the end. My friend and I left because we did not even care what happened at the end. . <br /> <br /> Cheers
