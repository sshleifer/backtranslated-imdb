This film is the worst I've seen in a long time. The talent of Terence Stamp is totally lost and the only thing that I liked was to hear one of my favorite songs, "If I had a million dollars" from BNL, in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Ashton Kutcher plays the main character, a nice guy who gets into the house for his boss. Mishaps follow. Blah blah blah If you have time to kill and you have nothing better to do, then this is the movie for you. If not, look at something else. <br /> <br /> There is not necessarily a moment of redemption, but it's nice to see Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor on the screen. These are always pleasures to watch although this film managed to mitigate even these bright spots.
