Try not to see this one. I thought it would be fine because I'm a fan of the 80's nerdy movies and I really liked Linnea Quigley's work. I was wrong. I should have said no and look rather Gigli, which is probably a much better movie. I guess my biggest problem with this movie was its humor attempt. None of this was funny or even almost funny. The acting is bad, even for the queen of 80s cheesy movies. There is no story, just random clips. I guess I should not hate it too much because it was just a fun and stupid piece but I did not have fun and I did not have fun once. I even had to move quickly to the end to get through all this bullshit. I'm sorry, but I do not think zombies doing aerobics are funny.
