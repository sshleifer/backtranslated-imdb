The only interesting part of this movie was his jazz and reggae New Orleans. This is one of those films that has two struggles that the heroine must overcome, one of the past and one of the present, that she can not convince. The acting is bad and the direction is even worse. I'm not surprised at all that it went directly to the video. The end result of this film leaves no one convinced or convinced, including the actors themselves.
