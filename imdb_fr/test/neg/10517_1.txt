Everyone knows that late-night movies are not Oscar nominees. Well. I mean, I'll admit that I was a little drunk and bored and thought I'd get to a skin-a-max. It's a real shame when the news on the TV guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description. This even gave him a half-star. To be honest, I sat down and threw it all because it was so bad. I could not help laughing. I mean the words that come out of those people's mouths and how they were trying to be serious. Most of the time, I think the people on the screen did their best not to laugh. In fact, I think in one scene, they laughed. In any case, the film did not make sense. It was like an episode of Sopranos with the big gay guy. Only the Sopranos make a big show. But it was terrible, I mean, no nudity, just sex scenes in the 90s. You know the kind that uses shadows and silhouettes instead of flesh. I gave him two reasons why this movie is a good movie to drink. I mean with all the cheese, it helps to get the wine out. If it's late at night, and all that's on TV is this and that, Tony Little's guy and his exercise bike, then I suggest Tony Little.
