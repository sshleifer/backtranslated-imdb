I wish I could tell you that this film is as exciting as its theories. But I can not. Another species could have mutated while I was waiting for an action. For such a controversial man, Darwin led the most conventional life. If you did not know crazy theories, you could almost confuse him with a stamp collector. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers have dubbed Darwin, which makes him a disservice. Even when he briefly loses his reason because of his indefatigable theories, he was not interesting to look at. Maybe the big thinkers are boring people? I do not know what I was expecting: an eccentric on the forehead wearing disheveled hair and eyes marrying his love for all that is simian, the glow of madness pulled by a pleated forehead? A long-haired hermit who chatted with animals? A madman in the head with eyes lit up like lighthouses of truth? All of the above would have been great. These are the films for Scorsese's sake. <br /> <br /> But none of that. No thunder, no thunder, no wonder, no fear. Just Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly, fresh out of the Subtle Breath School of Method Acting. I imagine that someone with Darwin's ideas had a brain that looked like a high-speed train, so why did this film just go on its way - chug chug chug - like a slow winter? The disappointment is immeasurable.
