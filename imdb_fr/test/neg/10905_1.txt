I do not often write reviews here, but I can not remain indifferent and let others suffer through this film without at least trying to warn them. This film is horrible and it's not because "I do not know what the director was trying to convey" or "I'm too stupid to understand the plot"; this film is horrible because of the wrong direction, the writing of the screen and the acting of the actors. This is the "trifecta" of the wrong decision and the reason why the film was shot directly to the video. It tries to be something like "High Voltage", "Youth Hostel" and "TCSM" with the lifting of some of these ideas, but it just does not work. I did not have high expectations or even average expectations in the movie, but I was still very disappointed. It had the potential to be very good with a nice decor and a good movie idea but it was wasted.
