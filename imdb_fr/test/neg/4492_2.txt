May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> An innocent trailer park or perhaps a white child of "Compton" in Los Angeles is witnessing a terrible tragedy of children related to drugs and violence. Unprofessional but dedicated police partners are trying to dismantle a "sophisticated" drug ring in luxury clubs, and then be fired and sentenced by lawyers at the high prices of the lords. The plot thickens as more and more people come back for revenge and justice with a predictable end. The only memorable part was Ron Jeremy's turn. <br /> <br /> If I had been in a movie theater, I would have asked for a refund. I'm sorry for the poor actors in this film. It was horrible and painful to watch. The worst was the cinematography where the director continued to flash in the same scene so that the sound is not quite the same. And NO, it was not a codec or DVD problem, but an intentional technique. Ughh. Two stars
