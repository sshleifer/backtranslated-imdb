It's hard to imagine a person making a Tom Cruise movie look good; difficult indeed, but it makes it look good. Very well. In fact, it gives him the impression that Sir John Gielgud is celebrating the very good day with a bravura performance. <br /> <br /> The actor of the ensemble had a hard time surpassing himself and failing. Let's be fair in part that the plot resembles both the original HG Wells and carcasses skinned human victims in the film to their living predecessors: the two were bloodied and violated the remains of a more attractive predecessor. . But to describe a plot like this to be a bit sacred is to say the colander "My, this kitchen utensil has a remarkable number of holes", unless the holes are your bag; in this case, this movie will be recommended to you. <br /> <br /> The fault in the other part is that it was disengaged, jobs, DVD players who knew very well, it is supposed, that it was their exposure that wrap on the $ 5 DVD shelf. And too expensive for that. <br /> <br /> So should you look? Why yes, of course, you should. You are a miserable sinner and deserve to be punished.
