I really liked this movie. Number 5, the film's star robot is struck by lightning and something has happened to its circuits. He acts and thinks more like a human. The robot repeats the advertisements it learns after watching television. He then applies these words to his situation. Number 5 is quick wit and fun. The character imitates the voices of the stars, tries to dance like John Travolta in Staying Alive and many other things. He memorized a saying for most of his circumstances. The robots' actions are really good. Number 5 wants to drive, cook and please Stefany with all the characteristics of a human. The way robots move and align is really hysterical. I am disappointed that screenwriters can not keep this clean for all viewers. This film has a surprise that ends something you would not expect. I hate movies that have sworn even though I like them, I give them a lower rating. This film had words that swore. Jesus Christ was used as a swear word, which offends me to be used at least 3 times. G-d D-m, Bull sh_t etc. It could have been a wonderful movie with all that offensive language. There is no sex in this film, violence such as robots explode cars and machines.
