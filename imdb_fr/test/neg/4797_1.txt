I went to see this movie over Matchstick Men, actually buying the tickets for Matchstick Men and going to the next, because it sounded like a fun movie with action, romance, thrills, jungles and exotic places. They had all this, but a lot of movies having a story design. <br /> <br /> All I can say is WHY WHY WHY WHY did not they just make a simple story instead of a soda story? <br /> <br /> Here are all the movies of what I saw in the movie: Indiana Jones and Romancing the Stone, of course, but also True Lies, Proof of Life, this 80's old movie from Tom Selleck, Bananas (Woody Allen) and Hero (from the use of digital extras). <br /> <br /> PS: the only scene in the film that is cool is when the central character finds his room enlarged.
