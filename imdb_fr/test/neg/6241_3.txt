I wanted to love this film, and there is certainly room for a character-driven psychological movie that does not fit for cheap thrills. However, for the pleasure of a film, you need a credible plot, a bit of rhythm and editing, as well as a sense of involvement. In The Clearing, what began as an intriguing mystery, with an abduction and unknown motivations, turns into a slow and uninteresting exercise. There is not much going on, and the so-called angles directed by the characters (as expressed by the director in his commentary) do not really give much. <br /> <br /> Good actors are lost here. Robert Redford does his best to engage and frustrate Willem Dafoe. Dafoe brings a little nuance to his character, to the extent that one can feel a little sympathetic to him. It is unfortunate that Dafoe was cataloged as a villain. He entered the Hall of Fame of Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is generally good, but her character's entry into the film was brief and artificial, and I wondered why they even bothered to introduce her character. Helen Mirren was by far the waste of talent. In the director's commentary, all I've heard is how fantastic she is. I agree, she's an excellent actress. So why was not it used correctly? It is only towards the climax of this film that it has the right to show itself, but the spectator has already stopped worrying about it. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I liked some parts of this movie, but as another reviewer wrote, Halfway, you know that the movie is not going to get much better.
