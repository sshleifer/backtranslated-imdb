There is a moment in the career of every famous actor where they find themselves neglected and accept projects they would not have touched with a pole of 1,000 feet in their heyday. Remember "taxi driver"? It was a good movie. I can hardly believe that the De Niro of "Showtime" is the same actor. <br /> <br /> I would rather watch "Time Chasers" twice than see this movie again. If someone offers to see "Showtime" or gives you free passes, or something else, run away as fast and as far as you can.
