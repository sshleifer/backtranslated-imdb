I love movies ... and I rarely see a movie I hate ... but it was the worst film I've ever seen, or at least almost. Any film that ends with a rape scene is awful. Hands down ... I can not believe I lost 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I am really angry, I want to get my money back and my time. TERRIBLE! Do not go see it, the cinematography is awful, the plot is awful, the end is awful. I did not know what was happening during half of the movie because I could not see it (and I was watching on a very beautiful and very large TV). The rent has been seen, the hills have eyes or a house of wax. of those who are better if you want something scary.
