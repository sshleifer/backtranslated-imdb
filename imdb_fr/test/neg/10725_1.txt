A satire of greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they are trying to mock. Jim Carrey's reign was certainly short-lived. It is an unbearable presence on the screen. The lack of sincerity of his portrait is simply scary. He also produced this "masterpiece", so he can not blame anyone. "The number one comedy in America," launches desperate television. Of course, Jim Carrey was supposed to guarantee the number of places but the match is over. If I look angry it's because I am. I spent a sunny afternoon in California, in addition, between tickets, parking, Cokes apartment, etc., almost $ 45 on this thing, interpreted and produced by Mr. Carry. No more, do you hear? Not anymore.
