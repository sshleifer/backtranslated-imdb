If someone tells you that this picture is just fantastic, it probably has something to do with it or make a profit. This film is a real loser and it copies situations of horror movies with big budget and soundtracks. I would not recommend this one to my worst enemy. It's a low budget movie with amateur actors. It looks like he was filmed for a movie contest. The acting is terrible and it would not surprise me if the screenplay was written by a screenwriter Hee Haw. My family laughed. A grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way. You will not be scared by this one. Here is a little taste of the terrible elements of this film. When the guy is stung by the stupid representation of the walking stick of the reverend James Johnston by Ric White. The reactions of the guys are as if he has amputation without any painkiller. Watch the extras of the DVD after watching the movie. When you see Ric White and others talking about the film so badly, you will laugh until you have a stomach ache. How will people tell the truth and what they will do to win a dishonest dollar? Do not be fooled like us and buy this failure.
