I went to see this film last night at the National Film Theater in London, as a birthday present. It was the first time I saw him, and I think he has now passed the terrible "Twister" as the worst movie I have ever seen. Disjointed for no reason, full of indulgence and full of images that oscillate from the gross and obvious of the obscure and incomprehensible, not particularly beautifully shot, I really do not understand why this is considered classic, gay or not. I normally enjoy films that push boundaries or even movies that are hard to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography. But it was really, really horrible.
