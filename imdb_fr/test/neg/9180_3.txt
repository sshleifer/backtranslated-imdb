Unlike most critics of this film, I'm really not a fan of Cynthia Rothrock, to say the least. However, when I saw that the film had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I only had to watch the movie. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic policeman, reluctant to clean the toilet with a toothbrush and, worse yet, team up with Cynthia at the request of Captain (Robert Forster). Forster is still visible, it is a shame that the film itself is so commonplace and cliche. It also features one of the least terrifying villains ever to have been attached to celluloid. Williamson would return to Dakota's character in a few extra movies, the next being "Down N Dirty" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nina Richardson shows some T & A; Mary Kapper goes topless <br /> <br /> My note: D <br /> <br /> Where I saw her: Showtime Extreme
