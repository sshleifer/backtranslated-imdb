I'm new to Argento's work, and if this and Suspiria give an indication, Argento is much more of a filmmaker than stories. In his films, the characters are placed in exhausting and fascinating horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them. The camera literally runs gracefully through the sets as the characters run, stumble and choke to a horrible conclusion. It REALLY worked well in Suspiria. For some reason, it did not work here. <br /> <br /> The problem I see in this movie is that even if the protagonist "gets help" by contacting the police and asking for help from his friends, it still feels like she refuses "to get help" to try to find a solution to her problem. The trap in this movie is that she is trapped in the killer's game, a game she could easily get out of ... without getting ready so easily? Strangely, it seems that the character wants the torture that the murderer inflicts on him, which is in a way the goal and could have worked if the whole psychology is not done, mainly because of what Argento wants to do. <BR/> <br /> In homage to "The Phantom of the Opera", it is certainly an interesting and unique catch. Despite its value, Argento also loves opera movements, which highlights the action. It just does not make much sense, especially since it's a completely useless end (yes, I know it's a reference to Harris's novel "Red Dragon." No, it does not work). Why should the character go from a horrible experience of trapping to a will with the director beyond me. It was almost selfish on the part of Argento. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun experience, and between that and Suspiria, I'm quite willing to follow up on other Argento productions. But this is not a film in which I would like to come back or remember. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
