Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actors, and director Kostas Karagiannis is at the origin of the success of the Greek thriller Giallo-Esquire Death Kiss in 1974; And yet, when you combine the three talents, you only get that full charge of drivel! Only God knows what drove personalities like Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance to play in this cheap devil cult movie, but I really hope they were well paid, none of them deserving of anything as amateur on their resume. The story focuses on a group of devil worshipers kidnapping children, leading another group to pursue them. The pace of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the movie is very boring. The plot is also far from original and anyone with a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a little like this one, and probably done a lot better. The obvious lack of budget is persistently felt and the film never manages to overcome it. It's really a depressing and miserable watch, and even a decent end fails to raise the bar high enough to get this movie out of the bottom of the barrel. Extremely poor and certainly not recommended!
