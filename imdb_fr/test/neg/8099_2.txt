First - Nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941 and not in 1942. They did not have to predict the attack. <br /> <br /> Second - did anyone notice that these six industrials / lawyers / all that was missing long enough time? They were killed * before * the operation took place! Third - how the hell did Lugosi get out of taxis without being seen? Fourth - why did not the Japanese just kill him, instead of putting him in jail with a companion who looks like him and his surgical kit? Fifth - oh, what's the point? This film contains some interesting moments, but by the time they explain what's going on, you'll probably stop watching. Otherwise, you will not worry.
