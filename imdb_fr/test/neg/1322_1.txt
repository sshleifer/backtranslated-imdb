What a lame film. This is definitely a low class B movie. StormTroopers German elite troops assault the Russian bunkers en masse, like an old battle of the First World War. The acting is mediocre, the plot thin and filiform. It's sometimes difficult to track where it's going. The action sequences are not worth much (when it shows), except that they use authentic equipment / vehicles dating from the Second World War. This is NO LEVEL that "Save Pvt Ryan" or "Platoon". Many vain attempts to develop character, which lead nowhere. Old theme good officer / bad officer very predictable. Even the action sequences look like those of a 12 year old child. I could have managed better. Too bad it's the same guy who did "Das Boot (The Boat)" because it was a good movie. He must have party too much after this success, because he has certainly lost his touch with regard to this film. I bought it on DVD, it is better to rent it.
