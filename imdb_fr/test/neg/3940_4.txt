Stay Alive is an unpretentious horror movie about a video game that kills people in the same way that they die inside the game. Friends who play this game are quickly aware of it and realize that they must defeat the countess of the blood of the video game or accept their fate. We had video tapes in The Ring, a deadly website in FearDotCom. Now it's about video games. Stay Alive does some things well; the development of the character is a bit deeper than it would usually be in a horror movie. We really see in the feelings and the past of certain characters and we all know them pretty well, so that the public can get emotions. The film is also very suspenseful. The film frequently releases moments of tension and nervousness, accompanied by disturbing and disturbing music. There are many jumps and jolts for the viewer. This may be ideal once or twice, but these false alarms that Hollywood seems to enjoy playing excessively in horror movies nowadays, fade away in Stay Alive. The camera will tend to provide sharp angles or fast flashes to give viewers a very fast glimpse of a demon or witch, and to try to scare them with that sudden burst of the screen. Why? The gore is obviously very weak because of the certificate of the film. The Stay Alive script is very laughable and laughable, and the characters tend to play it too melodramatically and confusingly. In addition, clich√©s come from all directions, for example, people wandering alone in search of a strange noise or if they have spotted a silhouette in the dark, they will look for it. However, the computer images used for the video game segments are rather impressive and have a clean and colorful appearance, working well with other parts of the film. But overall, there is simply not enough to hold this movie. Spanning a little over a hundred minutes, it will not be difficult to stay alive, but rather to stay awake.
