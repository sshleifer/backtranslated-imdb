What a horrible movie. This movie was so broken and so hard to follow. It was so difficult to follow and was confusing. During all the time I watched, I wanted it to end! I felt like I had lost two hours of my life that I would never come back. Save your money and do not rent this movie. I see now why Sarah Michelle Gellar was barely in the movie. The first movie was great but it was just nil. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Save your money and watch the trailer, because that's about the only thing to do with this movie. This film had no real story either. I still wonder what I watched.
