What is there with studios like Paramount that have a series of successful movies in their hands and who think they can get away with their budget and their formula? Paramount has spent less on this movie than on TMP, which does not look bad until you realize the gap between when the movies were shot. The $ 40 million production cost of TMP would be about $ 75 million in 1989. This film is why Shatner never had the opportunity to make other films. Every time he turned around, the studio slashed the budget and made requests for the script. The fact that this is the only story on which Roddenberry and Shatner were able to agree for the most part made the first-year director's job quite difficult, but after all the machinations were done, everyone ended up being a uneven story and a load of evil special effects worthy of the original series, let alone an important film. The most glaring examples: - All Phaser effects were severely attenuated and looked like fakes. - The picture of the Enterprise heading towards the Great Barrier was obviously a motionless plane from which one moved away. At least the popsicle stick that held the cut-out Enterprise had been successfully mended. - God "chases" Kirk up the mountain ... Egads, they might as well have cut plans from Godzilla climbing the volcano at the end of "Godzilla 1985", and used bedbugs to scrape the emulsion from the film so to make Electric flashes spring from his eyes on Captain Kirk, in danger ... Yes, my friends, the look of this last scene poses a real problem, in particular. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Star Trek VI was so a redeemer of a movie ...
