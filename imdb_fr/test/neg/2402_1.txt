SPOILER - This film reveals plot points and discusses the end. I hated this film - mainly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. On the political front, this film glorified war and military technology - making things soar. We are led to applaud when the music gets bigger and the Afghans use our weapons to blow the Ruskies. And no American soldier risks his life, so it's a funny war. Aesthetically, the film does not contain a real human emotion, but people privileged, sarcastic, feeling superior and doing whatever they want, whatever the consequences of these. And speaking of consequences, the film makes only a few small successes against the arming of the Afghans. I had read a previous draft of this script, which ended on 9/11 - Charlie Wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong. But that would not let the audience feel good. It's a good movie about the killing of Ruskies. And that made me sick.
