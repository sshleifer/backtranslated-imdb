So many people have loved this movie, and yet some of us, critics of IMDb, have found Mirrormask extremely uncomfortable to watch and knock out. I fall in the last of these two camps and I will try to explain what made my nails curl so unpleasantly. <br /> <br /> First, to make things clear - I like Neil Gaiman's books. I sometimes find his humor sarcastic, devious, "twisted" a little geek, and I prefer his work when he plays straight and leaves the jokes alone - but even with his lapse from time to time in "daddy" bullshit, I find his creativity and imagination for something a little special. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, one of Gaiman's strongest works is Coraline, a gothic fable for children that is very low in jokes and high on tension and goose bumps. His latest novel (Anansi Boys) exaggerates the amusements, and tends to read at times like Terry Pratchett does the Sisters of Mercy (not the nuns but the band). Mirrormask lives in Coraline-like territory, and when I saw the beautiful trailer footage, I was a little excited that someone was able to transfer Gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination to the screen. <br /> <br /> To the glory of the film, some sequences are superb. However, visual effects are sometimes ruined by a CGI animation that looks like a student project in media studies. The sets and landscapes are often incredible, but some character animations look clumsy, amateurish and cheap. At the beginning of a dream sequence, the spider is beautifully animated, but the book-eating cat is poorly rendered and very "computer-generated". Compared to the level of animation found in productions such as 'The Corpse Bride', Mirrormask sometimes has a very amateurish appearance. However, for Mirrormask's defense, the budget allocated to such a grandiose vision was minimal, and some cracks in the effects can be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> What can not be forgiven is perseverance, sneaky, pretentious dialogue. The actors are struggling desperately with dialogue - and there are so many that they are constantly hobbled and stumbled on. The conversation is rendered completely unnatural, the jokes fall flat, and the turgid speeches seem to be the only method of exposing the plot of the writer. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen (which always adds an element of "Phantom Menace"), this makes the film almost unassailable. In such an unreal context, actors have to work twice as hard to be believed, and they fail overall. The girl who plays the leading role leads a courageous fight against the impossible school-theater dialogue and is sometimes very promising, but that is never enough. The cod god '' Oirish '' of Valentine's character (with whom she is forced to spend a lot of time on the screen) puts all the chances on her side for this young actress to rise above the material . It seems that Valentine's task is to explain the plot to the young viewers and bring a slight relief. Personally, I would not want him close to my 15 year old daughter. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this movie? Answer .... Rob Brydon. What is annoying (for us British, anyway) is that we know that Rob Brydon can act! We saw him hold the screen for half an hour alone (performing these monologues of "Marion & Geoff"), and in the first "real" piece of the film, he's fine. However, put him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and becomes the worst worse I have known in years. A real shame. <br /> <br /> What's wrong? Answer ... the wanky slap-bassing, saxing sub-Courtney Pine and not listenable, a soundtrack too high in the mix that never goes silent. God, the music is incessant, strong, embarrassing, without interest and, if that is not enough, it is weakened. This makes the dialogue very difficult to hear, but it could be a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with that? Answer .... The piping artist mimes. In modern society, there should be no place for mime, apart from some secret places in France. At every moment, the camera lingers on the mocking idiot, hissing, juggling with moss, tying yogurt, I understand why the people of Edinburgh get a little worried and troubled when the time of the Festival returns. <br /> <br /> My latest criticism is that the movie is pretty dull. Surrealism is often dull ?? it is necessary either that its public slips into a dreamlike, zen or tolerant state, or that it is constantly seduced by bigger and bigger surprises. A slightly rhythmic story featuring characters we could believe in and cherish would have been instrumental in giving this film the emotional center it was sorely lacking, while preventing the eyelids from collapsing. <br /> <br /> Finally, my apologies to all who have found depth, meaning and wonder in this film. You have managed to suspend your disbelief, you have gone beyond the creaky CGI, ignored the crappy dialogue and the abominable performances that have resulted and understood the great imaginative vision of the manufacturer. I wanted it, but I could not see beyond the real world failings that dragged it on. <br /> <br /> I hope Neil Gaiman will be successful next time, if he has (or even wants) an opportunity.
