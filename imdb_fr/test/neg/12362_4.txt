Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of any old "Giant Attack [INSERT ANIMAL HERE]" - movies from the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have looked more like a remake of, instead of what was. So, how is a movie about monsters made in 2002? Well, from the typical start with a chemical that makes spiders grow to huge proportions, they mix up movies like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and perfume him with a parody like Scary Movie. Gremlins is probably the best comparison, but Eight Legged Freaks was so full of parodies and silly jokes that it sometimes looked more like Scary Movie. It was way too much, at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another parody movie full of jokes. <br /> <br /> For a film like this, you do not expect much of the acting, and that's exactly what happened. The story was, however, extremely skinny, with just a bunch of events bound together to show an action mixed with all the jokes, leading to an end easy to spot and cheesy. <br /> <br /> I rated Eight Legged Freaks a 4/10, and that includes the fact that the special effects were pretty good and the spiders' noises were hilarious.
