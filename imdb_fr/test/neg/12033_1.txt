First, let me start by saying that this SOUNDED movie is very interesting: a serial killer copying the works of Edgar Allan Poe (who is one of my writers of all time). Sounds cool, does not it? Yes, certainly not. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Already. And this is not an exaggeration. I saw a lot of very, very bad movies. This one takes the cake. And I was even ready for a bad movie before I started. <br /> <br /> The author may have had to study a law enforcement procedure: if you have the name of the murderer, his story, a criminal record, and his address, where is the first place where should you look? Hmm. . . perhaps. . . his house? What?! NO! It's an absurd idea, Anthony! How can you suggest something so obvious and balanced rather than go bowling? * The end of spoilers * Honestly, I can sometimes forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad, or vice versa. . . but it did not work at all. <br /> <br /> I think my biggest pet peeve was the way the police and the FBI acted. <br /> <br /> For example: Black FBI Agent: "Okay, woman in danger, sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while I go in and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be. How are you? Moron woman, FBI agent: "Yes, that's fine with me, go ahead, I'll be sure not to focus on my environment or at least check the perimeter." Black FBI Agent: "Excellent, that's what I would do!" Honestly, if you want to be part of the police force, rent this movie to learn not to act. . . or if you are a human and want to learn the same thing. <br /> <br /> 0.5 / 10: Half a point just to make a film produced and in stores. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
