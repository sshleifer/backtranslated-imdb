It could have been better In fact maybe so much that if the filmmaker had not done so much, maybe it was better. <br /> <br /> On a good note. The lighting was reasonable. But almost everything else was missing. Wobbly camera. (Yeah, yeah, I know, that's supposed to be the style now.) A poorly recorded sound. And a montage that looked like someone looked at too many Ulli Lommel films (which are some of the worst films ever made). In summary, the film seemed to be a rationalization for the director / writer / main character to get some young women naked, place them in false slavery and fumble them by saying "threatening" things.
