I remember seeing this movie on one of Showtime's channels. What struck me is that this movie is entirely in Phoenix, Arizona. I come from there, so I easily spot the places. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a ninja kills a scientist because he wears yellow pullovers and plays golf, which is pursued by the police. It takes about half of the police force to shoot it down and when they end up killing it, there are no discernible gunshot wounds. Her mind lives, however, when a woman finds her and touches her katana. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, she is periodically possessed and kills the policemen who killed the original ninja. Then another ninja from Japan comes to kill the evil ninja. This could be a feature of the plot of the previous two movies, or perhaps a hole in the plot. All I know is that this movie is very campy, bad and entertaining. It's something to watch with a popcorn tub and several friends and give it the MST3K treatment.
