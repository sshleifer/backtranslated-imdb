I watched this movie with great expectations. The presentation text on the back indicated that it was going to be mean. But it was pretty tame and a bit unsatisfactory. The violence was nothing that I had seen a thousand times before, the blood level was only average (beware, there was probably more than what was seen in Hollywood in the last five years - maybe more ), and I did not even feel uncomfortable let him scared. Again, a CAT 3 movie with big films has not kept its promises. <br /> <br /> Of course, engage this film, but do not wait. I am so eager to get into the whole Asian horror scene, but I am continually disappointed. I really liked Ichi and Audition, but again, Miike remains alone for the moment. <br /> <br /> Please, inspire me ..... there is a big group of jaded genre fans who are hungry for quality horror!
