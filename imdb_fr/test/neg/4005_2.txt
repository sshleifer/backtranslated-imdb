I think this film had a very bad production value. The lack of acting makes me think that they should mark it as a precocious docudrama. He may not have had money for it. I'm sorry to see that Jackie Robinson played a tour in the Major League. <br /> <br /> I think he was way better than many of the white players of his day. He had to be really good at breaking the color barrier of the time. We must not forget that it was a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> I wish there was more information about its creators. They may have been limited by the quality of the actors willing to take charge of the project. Maybe no money to have good people.
