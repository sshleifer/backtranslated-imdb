This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun (La Monja). Seriously, I think horror movies should try to offer more imaginative titles, even if the story is about the character as it is described in the title. Who knows, we will soon have fallout such as the monk, the priest and others belonging to various religious sects. <br /> <br /> The basic principle is very simple: a ghoul wearing a nun's outfit (while claiming the title) goes around killing girls from the former convent. There seemed to be a kind of conspiracy involved, like the daughter of one of the victims, Eva (played by a delicacy for the eyes, the Icelandic Anita Briem), continues to discover, with the help of some good friends, a real scam I know what you did last summer (also mentioned, by the way). <br /> <br /> So as the death toll goes up, it's a race against the clock for our emotionally scarred heroine (do not they always?) discover the truth and save the day. In digging into the sins of mothers, the film did the unthinkable, with as introduction a sequence of dreams. I hate dream sequences because it's a pretty inexpensive technique if it's not executed properly. There are several in the film. <br /> <br /> Partly, the movie played at times like Ju-On went wrong with the Many references to Dark Water, and they could have renamed this Unholy Water, for the circumstances and points of the plot of the film. However, there are many holes in the plot, so do not lean too much in the scenario. You would expect the sadistic nanny to be slightly turned towards the end, as if she could compete with the recent Thai horror film Dorm. <br /> <br /> The acting is quite unforgettable, the cast expressing itself in the perfect English film strongly accentuated. And since most of them are enjoyable to watch, the story must be part of a love scene in the midst of a witch hunt. Which give? Hello, hantu, always mood ah? Again, Ghoul is an inexpensive animation / SFX that has an integrated artificial intelligence that appears from time to time, in different ways, just to arouse the cries of a shy public. The characters also break all the unwritten rules in the Do-Nots in the horror legend, so that you know and expect their just dessert. <br /> <br /> Can you enjoy this movie? Sure you can. Just be sure to watch the movie in a packed house (this should be easy, as the locals are fond of all that is horribly horrible), and laugh at those who are so nervous that they scream at every scene " scary. " It's quite fun and adds to the atmosphere, in addition to what's happening on the screen. Surround sound does not even come close. <br /> <br /> Think of it as if you are watching an episode of Scooby Doo without the ridiculous, and it is a pity that the movie's bloody moments had to be censored for a PG rating. These were perhaps the best pieces, now rotting on the floor of censorship.
