The only reason anyone remembers this smoky fecal load is that it has been recorded by Pink Floyd. (Or as they were nicknamed then "The Pink Floyd".) Stefan, a really annoying Eurotrash hitchhiker, binds with the American model Estelle and they begin to get naked and naked during the whole film ... < br /> /> And the purpose of this is, what exactly? What drugs are bad? Or only the heroine (horse) is? The problem is that you make fun of the characters and that even Pink Floyd was not up to par. When Steffan took an overdose in the end, you're almost happy to be rid of him because he was so annoying.
