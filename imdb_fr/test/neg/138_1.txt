I'M BOUT IT (1997) <br /> <br /> Developed and published by No Limit Films <br /> <br /> >> For: Absolutely none <br /> <br /> >> Cons: I do not even know where to begin! <br /> <br /> Summary of the plot: Master P plays the role of a drug dealer who looks, talks and acts rather like a cartoon character. That's all the plot I drew from this movie. <br /> <br /> Summary: I remember the ninth year of its release and everyone in my class praised this clown called Master P. This film is so bad, it's not even not funny. All the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes, the audio is audible only when the music is played, and the film seems to have been recorded on video by a public channel. Fortunately, I did not buy this film like all my other degenerate classmates. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My verdict: avoid this video as its a sexually transmitted disease.
