Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor join forces in this comedy about the owners of discotheques who are victims of organized crime. Eddie Murphy wrote and directed this odious journey for the ego and therefore has no one to blame except himself for his failure. It's a really bad movie, so completely devoid of energy and humor that it serves only as an example of Murphy's contempt for his audience. It would be remarkably easy to continue beating this movie, but I will show him more pity than he showed it to his audience and stop me now.
