Finally, a film rivaling "El Padrino" and "Darkness Falls" in terms of pure and total dullness. This is actually the first movie I give 1 in 10 for IMDb, and with good reason. <br /> <br /> For one, the casting is nothing special. This is not usually a problem for me, except that the only character that is interesting or different from all the others is Harrington from Grand L. Bush. Secondly, the production has a value lower than the norm - the science-fiction TV such as "Stargate" has more convincing decors, and all underwater scenes NOT managed by the teams of SFX are filmed on dry sets with "falling particles" unconvincing. . This film is literally "in dry dock". The worst thing is that this movie is BORING. For the first 45 minutes, I felt like I was going around in circles: "It's a prehistoric shark." "Bullsh * t." "Not really." "Bullsh * t." "I'm not inventing anything." "Bullsh * t." "Here he is now!" "I did not see anything." "Let me guess?" "Yeah, Bullsh * t." After that, the volume will resume slightly for about twenty minutes. Then we return to the dialog box. Dialogue is not a bad thing, but that's all this film has. The characters speak. That too is not a bad thing, except that this movie is not very good. The dialogue is often artificial and clich√© and is not very interesting to listen to. I see no reason to slander special effects; this film has worse qualities. <br /> <br /> The sets are small and unrealistic. The acting is less than normal. The script - oh Lord, the script - is worse than a sci-fi trash basket has to pick up. One wonders where is the budget of this film. <br /> <br /> Yet another horrible addition to the "Megaloadon" film series (there are about four). Bring Steve Alten, please ...
