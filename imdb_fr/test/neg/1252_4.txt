This film tried to make Stu Ungar's life interesting by being creative. What they have forgotten is that his life has been quite entertaining without the necessity of inventing anything. <br /> <br /> A short list of inaccuracies: <br /> <br /> 1) Stuey was not sent straight to Las Vegas for a gin tournament to pay his old debts, he passed a much of his time in Florida and went to Las Vegas only when he missed gin games on the east coast. <br /> <br /> 2) Stuey never associated (nor played Gin) with a casino manager (like the one played by Pat Morita in the movie.) <br /> <br /> 3) There was no magic turning point in the preparation of the 1997 WSOP. In fact, Stuey has barely made the tournament as he was. He even snorted cocaine the week before. <br /> <br /> Tell the story correctly or do not tell it at all. 4 out of 10 stars for the credible performance of Michael Imperolli (the only redeeming quality of this movie.)
