The curse of the mummy is the last in the Kharis mummy film series, and it seems that creativity has become a bit dry when they made it. Kharis and his companion Ananka are both in the bayous of Louisiana and, at his resurrection, he seeks his beloved princess. The way they end up in Louisiana is not entirely clear, but with different people trying to find them, the viewer can be assured of some mummy killings. <br /> <br /> The curse of the mummy was visible, but nothing special. Throughout the film, I had the feeling that I had already seen this before. Frankly, aside from the original movie The Mummy with Boris Karloff, Mummy's movies are not my favorite among the old horrors of Universal. They are not bad, but they become a bit repetitive. <br /> <br /> There are excellent scenes in the film (the scene with Ananka coming to life in the swamp, for example), but overall, that was not the case. Do a lot for me. <br /> <br /> It's worth it to see if you want to be the most complete and see all movies about mummies, but otherwise, you may want to skip this one.
