Diane Keaton is a pathetic actress. She is so boring and fake. She is the same on and off screen. I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres and she behaves exactly as she does in movies. His stupid facial expressions make me want to change channels. She has been in two good movies, but they would have been better if someone else had been chosen for the role. Steve Martin does not add much to the film either. He also plays and ruins an old favorite. The ridiculous part played by Martin Short only adds more idiocy to the film. I tried watching the movie twice, but both times I had to turn it off.
