Well, here's the problem - for this film to work, you have to accept the following - a murdered woman is alive again at the end of the movie, a policeman stops interrogating the bride of the deceased woman because a journalist Asked him not to do so, and this same journalist, beaten by a pretty blonde in a night court for suspicious behavior, ends up marrying her in exchange for the judge's decision to let her go. Do you follow me? I can not tell you how many times I paused and rewound the photo to repeat scenes that made no sense. In the end, the blonde (Claudia Dell) and the reporter (Richard Hemingway) remained married, but I do not know how they made that decision. In fact, I can not understand how the filmmaker made the decision to make this film. Oh, I guess there's an entertainment value here for the sheer absurdity of it all, but it would have been nice if some of the pieces were compatible. Still, I'm not ready to add this one to my list of the ten worst things. I think this nightclub scene with the feathered ladies could have saved her. But why was it in the movie? I just do not know
