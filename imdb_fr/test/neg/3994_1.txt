Let me clarify the point ... "The Church" has a "lock" security mechanism to stop the spirits from leaving, but the ultimate solution is to bring it back to the ground! LOFL! Maybe I'm missing the plot. Maybe this guy is from Ed Wood Film School or something like that. This film is about as useless as the church itself. Hey ... maybe that's the goal. This whole segment of Rosemary's Baby-esq was hilarity. I can go to my Halloween costume store and get better resistance than that. The entire movie needs to be redone. Correctly. There were so many things that were downplayed ... so many things that could have made me jump out of my seat and across the ceiling. I'm not sure that the fault is in writing or editing, but what I saw should not be so high.
