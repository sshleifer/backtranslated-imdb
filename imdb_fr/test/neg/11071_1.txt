I agreed to watch this film with a group of friends despite my extreme aversion to horror movies. However, it is not the shock of a monster that upset me this film, it was a horrible end of activity and absolutely disgusting. The interior, or the cave, has no redeeming qualities: it is badly done, its script is ridiculously written, its blood is disgusting and the inclusion of the free final scene pushes me away. No, it's not my aversion to horror movies that makes me hate this movie. I've seen teenage horrors as wonderful as "House of Wax", it's the fact that the film leaves you with the terrible understanding that to rent the video, you support the creators of Within
