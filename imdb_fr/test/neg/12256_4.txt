PREY <br /> <br /> Format: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> A lesbian couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) living in a distant country the houses are disunited by the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes) who turns out to be an alien flesh eater, at the forefront of a massive invasion ... <br /> <br Despite its tight budget and fast pace, Norman J. Warren's follow-up of SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) is much more than the sum of his meager roles, thanks to a surprisingly complex scenario by Max Cuff (apparently his only credit of writing): Faulkner and Annan abandon an obsessive relationship while living in the isolated splendor of the English countryside (made beautiful and disturbing by the striking cinematography of Derek V. Browne), although the Annan's discovery of blood-stained clothing in a room of high marks one (or both) of these eyes disturbed s psychologically, which may explain the absence of their families, some of which seem to have lived in the house at one time or another and who are "parties" in mysterious circumstances. The unexpected arrival of Stokes throws relations into disarray, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because Annan is attracted to him, which creates tensions that cause a whirlwind of extreme violence. There is an extraordinary multi-level sequence in which Faulkner attempts to emasculate her helpless visitor by dressing her in women's clothing, though Stokes' extraterrestrial mentality allows her to rise above the mockery she desires. <br /> <br /> The first scenes, at least, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan are portrayed with unusual grace and dignity, but this well-known Sapphic connection quickly turns into episodes of sex and pulch-pleasing which will please the crowd, resulting in an explosion of horror when Annan is seduced by Stokes after a violent dispute with Faulkner. The last sequences are (literally) heartbreaking, especially the last scene of Annan, which seems to have been cut for reasons of censorship in 1977 and has never been completely restored (what remains is still quite alive, so prepare you!). The three main performers achieved excellent performances, reinforced by Warren's discreet leadership, which takes full advantage of the beautiful wooded sites, thus offsetting the film's budget shortcomings. Originally published in the United States under the name ALIEN PREY.
