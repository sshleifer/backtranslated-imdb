Like his contemporaries "The Great Race" and "These magnificent men in their flying machines", I always associate this film with my childhood, especially at the New Year. On New Year's Day, we visited my grandmother and, after lunch, while the adults were chatting, the kids were watching television, invariably one of those three crazy racing movies. <br /> <br /> For this reason alone, I really wanted to score "Monte Carlo Or Bust" but I'm afraid I can not, the child is not the father of the man on this occasion. By that I mean that I see his faults too well and that, although I was tempted to smile from time to time, I really wanted all the competitors to come to the end of the race well before their arrival. <br /> <br /> Of course, he is dated by his stereotypes about nationalities and the woman as the weaker sex and I did not care either about one or two vagabond vagabonds, admittedly light ones, which sometimes surfaced. More than that, the actors, despite the fact that they were scandalous, do not sell the film enough. Tony Curtis, in a test run for his filming "Yank Abroad" in the television series "The Persuaders", seems too old to play the young gal, Terry Thomas is just not too despicable, Eric Sykes is amazing like a dirty - Lothario has some objections while Gert Frobe is an exaggerated Teuton, it's weird to do the comedy of the camp when we remember that he was the best villain of Bond, Goldfinger. Susan Hampshire is at least endearing as a "brilliant young man", she plays the kid like a flap chic and, although chained to the scenario leash, Pete and Dud offer the most entertaining entertainment with types of rigid army Although at that time the team "Carry On" had done so much better in "Carry On Up The Khyber Pass". <br /> <br /> The director Annakin does everything to evoke the "Golden Silents", with lashes, identity errors, accelerated shots, dramatic stunts and a light love affair, but there is not much tension for such a famous race and, anyway, the race at the end seems to be a new swizz. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would have given them another brand if they had stuck to the alternative title "These gorgeous men in their Jaalty Jalopies", but in reality, the animated series "Wacky Races" l did a lot better.
