I rarely give ratings below 5, but in this case I have to contribute. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many intricate and marvelous books, original characters, a clean dialogue, tonic twists. The films based on his books date back to Hombre (Paul Newman), Mr. Majestyk (Bronson) and Out of Sight (Clooney / Lopez), among others. Even when it does, movies have at least some essence of the story. This one, it's just not a worthy addition to the catalog. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad (I do not know why, because they are very capable people here) and the story is handled stupidly. The characters are rearranged, chemistry is missing, actors and actresses are misinterpreted. <br /> <br /> Since Elmore Leonard is a very good narrator, I hope that anyone who does not know his work would be deterred from reading his books because they saw this disappointing interpretation of one of his stories . <br /> <br /> The story is a sequel to Get Shorty. If you have not seen this movie, do not look at it. If you have seen Get Shorty, do not go there. <br /> <br /> I saw Be Cool a few years ago and tonight we revisited the video. The first time did not have to make such a negative impression, as I had forgotten how dismal this suite was. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I do not think less of those who have appeared in this film for doing it. They were probably expecting something more. Get Shorty was original and very entertaining. Travolta almost always pleases me, but it's so much better in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and in the previous Get Shorty. He was clearly unable to appreciate what was going on here. <br /> <br /> And I hear that Freaky Deaky, another book by Elmore Leonard, is in pre-production for the 2008 release. I hope they can cope. <br /> <br /> Read the books. They are almost all great.
