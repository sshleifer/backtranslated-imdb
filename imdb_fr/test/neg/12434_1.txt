Larry Clark is not recognized for his talents as a writer or director, but he has made films of undeniable importance. Kids, Bully and, to a lesser extent, Ken Park all achieve the desired goal: shock, repulsion and even disgust. The content of these films is uncompromising and uses their controversial nature to expose very serious problems of modern youth. The children exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among young people. Bully addressed similar issues. Ken Park treated the sexual abuse and boredom of the suburbs quite disordered. All these films have undeniably revealed something horrible and left a bad taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers tells the story of a group of poor Spanish skaters from south-central Las Angeles who arbitrarily go to Beverly Hills for skateboarding. That's it. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers are nothing. <br /> <br /> He has no substance. He has a story essentially non-existent. And, like Kids, he presents a cast of novice actors drawn from the scenery. However, unlike Kids, none of them has a semblance of talent. There is better play in porn. This film undoubtedly presents the most terrible performances I have ever seen in a feature film. We can respect Larry Clark for exposing these young men to the process of making the film, but these children are absolutely worthy of the name. May I add that seemingly, these gentlemen have also produced the soundtrack, which contains some of the most sordid garage-punk you've ever heard - my advice is to pass some pills for migraine before entering in the theater, otherwise you will regret it afterwards. <br /> <br /> But again, it's not like they have a lot of scripts to work on. Each line that is pronounced is artificial, delivered in a pathetic and irritating way beyond any measure. The story itself is ridiculous. It starts reasonably well, but soon slips into unexpectedly pure absurdity. This of course begins with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of clich√©d encounters with the national Lampoonish, characters being killed for no reason and eventually ending up in a ridiculous anti-climax. The shots last much longer than necessary. Get ready to watch people fall off skateboards for about fifteen minutes in a row, long and long shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding in the streets. But again, with the script just 32 pages long, they need a filling as useless as possible. Maybe Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could go on like this. It's the worst film Larry Clark has done yet. For those of you who are interested in seeing a Clark movie, if only for its shocking antics of pederast, look elsewhere. It's by far the most modest film he's ever shot, and it's also the worst. It's downright horrible. Like, Uwe Boll horrible. Certainly the worst I saw at the festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
