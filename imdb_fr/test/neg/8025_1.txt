After learning that some of the authors of the low-budget films "Terror in Rock'n'Roll Önsjön" and "He came from space ... and other things" were involved in making this film I decided to buy it without being seen DVD. I wish I did not do it. The other movies were funny, silly and a little stupid. While Kraftverk 3714 is devoid of humor at all. And it's so horrible that I just get mad at it. The worst possible actors, the worst possible scenario, the worst special effects available. And the most obscure sex scene ever. Uhhh. And everything lasts 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please, do not make another movie.
