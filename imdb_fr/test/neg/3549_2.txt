I ask you not to watch this movie ... It starts with a promise and, as you go, you want the film to end ... Predictable, not entertaining, lost movie ... Save your time and watch better thrillers. ... The synopsis sounds good and that's why I watched the movie ... But it was too predictable with nothing to give you a start ... No big suspense ... no big direction .. Nothing phenomenal with the acting ... fearful of this ... bad note ... There is nothing to write about this movie, so I fill in the remaining lines of text to allow you to imagine to how much this movie is a waste of time ... really irritated by how good a premise that was and how much a script was written on it ...
