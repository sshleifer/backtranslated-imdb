A truly masterful film. He managed to fall asleep and lose myself in my mind. So annoying that it induces sleep and yet so ridiculous that it makes me wonder how things like this are made. Avoid at all costs. In other words, unless you like to take an invisible cranial punishment, in which case I strongly recommend it.
