Two little girls make friends. One tries to convince the other that she is a witch. The other is a breeze that bends to the witch's will. The film hangs around again and again with the useless interaction between the two little girls, many of whom are dramatic, as they pose "shocking" questions. You know, nice little kids should not ask, such as "How do you make a pact with the devil"? Oooh ... goose bumps. <br /> <br /> In the end, the opponent is tired of being controlled by her witch friend. Her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. But at that moment, you will not worry anymore. <br /> <br /> I imagine this movie may have scared a very religious 1960s Mexican viewer, but it does not even hold water. a relic of charm. He just hangs out. It's boring. It's useless. You must not look at it. <br /> <br /> Many people here have a lot of good things to say about this, based on their knowledge of the director's other work and, of course, the common denominator that everyone is telling useless movies: "Ah, cinematography is beautiful!" These reviewers probably have one point. But for those who have found this film without any prior knowledge, who do not care about his "photography", his "atmosphere" or ... anyway - for those viewers, then, who just want a good movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half, do yourself a favor, dear friends: <br /> <br /> Ignore him.
