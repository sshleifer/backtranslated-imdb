Another first: this French film is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer. I may be a bit hasty when I say that this is probably my last film about Rohmer, but I was immediately shocked by the way Rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point. There is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that I never thought of ending. Honestly, in spite of all my efforts, I did not understand why Rohmer enjoyed such esteem among movie buffs. He seemed to me to be one of those people who were extremely agitated and filled with hot air. If it's a sample of his films, I'm not interested. I do not care about French cinema (generally reflexive and speculative about a fault), so maybe I'm biased.
