I think it's very interesting that this movie is called a thriller. It's anything but exciting. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, you hear piano sounds. Then you hear piano sounds. Then some people talk about facts that do not concern anyone. <br /> <br /> Then again piano sounds. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie was the reason I signed up for IMDb, because I think this film is one of those whose humanity needs to be warned. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: By the way, the most lively part happens when a can of hot chocolate is spilled. <br /> <br /> Also very interesting: the "actors". Yes, the quotes are intentional, as you might think, because they do not act. They play the piano and talk with them, but they do not play. <br /> <br /> I think that before this film, I had never left a cinema and felt angry. Really, this movie made me angry. Angry for the time and money I spent on it.
