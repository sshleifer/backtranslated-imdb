Mansfield Park, in its second half, is my favorite among the novels of Austen and Fanny Price is my favorite among her heroines. I am therefore saddened by the unfortunate fate she has suffered in her performances on a large and small screen. The only good reading of the character that I heard was made for the radio by Amanda Root, who gave it the same quality as that of the character Anne in the film "Persuasion": a severe moral focus, sure and sincere. If the actress had been younger, she would have also been a good visual cast. but the Fannys that have reached our eyes so far have more resembled, respectively: Mary Crawford; Ruby the maid girl; and (in this incarnation) a jovial servant serving, or possibly a pie, with her high moral principles lowered. <br /> <br /> Well, I had hoped for better, but I feared the worst. The drama had a solid Edmund, in an actor who excelled in the friendly sands, and the perfect, that is to say absolutely abominable, Mrs. Norris; otherwise it was dull. The film, apparently aimed at deconstruction or another bad theatrical idea, presented itself as a burlesque mixture. After such disappointments and the most recent disappointments of the sisters of this production (the new "Persuasion" and "Northanger Abbey"), I could not help but have mixed expectations for it; and overall, it left me feeling a little better disposed than not. This intelligently condensed the novel and ended up leaving me pretty much the same feeling as a comic book. To do this, however, he had to rework most of the characters, with the exception of Crawford, and reduced or eliminated incidentally most or all of the most memorable elements of the book, including his most famous character and what should be it's not his most famous scene. <br /> <br /> The character is the unofficial Aunt Norris, always ready to lead others on the course of action, but always avoiding doing it herself; here we do not understand at all that. And with her goes much further: her remark that cuts through Fanny, "... considering who and what you are"; The discovery by Sir Thomas that she had forbidden Fanny to make a fire in her room all these years, and her circular excuses for her; The honesty of Fanny to recognize, during a visit to the house, that Aunt Norris, despite all her faults, could manage the household better than her two sisters. But then, all this trip is missing in history, as well as most of what happens during theatrical rehearsals and what most often disconcerts Sir Thomas on his return; and in fact, Sir Thomas himself and his wife are different from what they were. Especially, the scene in which Crawford proposes to Fanny, one of the most complex of Austen, is simplified. what she lacks is Fanny's firm determination to defend what she knows to be right, and what she knows to be probably true, against all the distractions that Crawford and everyone else can blame her for. For a male reader, nothing less than when it was written, it reveals with unmatched clarity - unmatched, anyway, as far as I know - what a woman experiences when trying to treat fairly but firmly a man has reason to be wary. It is a brilliant scene in the novel; on television, it's just a scene. <br /> <br /> And, Fanny, oh, Fanny: when will we see yours?
