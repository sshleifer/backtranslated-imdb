OK, the idea itself is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 1. Children do not own planes 2. Children do not race with off-road motorcycles 3. This gave the air force a completely idiotic air 4 The father of the children would not put his career in danger to allow his boy to make the joy of driving him a reserve colonel <br /> <br /> The suites, I am sure, were worse than these guts . The soundtrack is pretty much the only redemptive quality of this celluloid waste. I'm sorry but I just do not understand why anyone in the world would want to write directly and produce such unwanted material. The Iranian Air Force is lucky enough to have some parts for an aging F-14, and this young man argues not 1 but 2 F-16 fully loaded and full of fuel? Leave me alone.
