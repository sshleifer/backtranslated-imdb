I saw this film on VHS some time ago (January 27, 2003), only because of the name of Paul Rudd on the cover. I loved his performance in "The Object of My Affection" and I was really expecting a good job. However, I found this movie a complete mess. The story has a very confused scenario and the characters are not well developed. Plus, low-budget special effects do not help much. I do not know the previous generation of Generation Y officers, but this next generation is not good. I do not remember exactly why I attributed this rating (and I do not intend to review this movie), but my vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `General Y '(' Gen-Y Cops The Next Generation ')
