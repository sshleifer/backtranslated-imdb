It's so cliché that you'll want to turn it off after the first 45 minutes. The beginning is very interesting, there is a fair and someone is killed. This film would have been better, set on this scenery. <br /> <br /> Jill Johnson is a depressed sprinter with boyfriend problems. I do not see the point of adding his break with his boyfriend in any of the events in history. <br /> <br /> Since Jill returned late, her father sent her to babysit for the Mandrakis in their glamorous house in a deserted lake. The children are sleeping and the housekeeper is cleaning, another empty house next to their son who is in college. OKAY. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour of her own hunt at home, she has some problems to solve. Ooh, scary. To which her friend comes to the rescue to propose some lines of high school on "love" and so on. A friend leaves and goes to his car. Who does she drop her keys to? Uhhh ... then the music! DumDumDum ..! She searches to pick them up and gets into her car. Which of course does not start. How is the cliché ..? So..She disappears = D Jill, alone again. UH. (Most of this film is with her alone, so there is not much dialogue) So more time, she calls the police. Who says they can not help, but remember if she still has problems. <br /> <br /> She suspects that her boyfriend is calling or that her friends are calling her. They were but only once. How is it supposed to be scary? Oh, and did I mention? Her friend has just entered the caller ID and a scary man's voice is heard. She is completely panicked and shy. <br /> <br /> Yeah, so skip that. She sees the light coming on in the home of the Mandrakis' son. So she runs through the woods with the music as a companion and enters. Bleheh. <br /> <br /> AH HIS SO BORING I CAN NOT CONTINUE !!!!!
