Like many, this pile of manure caught my attention as I surfed on chains. It's a horror movie, in the woods, it has a stupid title, but hey "Michael Rooker" is in it, and he was part of great horror movies, I know he would not lead me badly ... Ugh! The most insulting part of it is that I watched it. I see that the director Johnny Martin is a stuntman, and this stuntman is nothing, and the way he brought some actors to make this intestinal movement is the biggest mystery of all ... I can understand Casper Van Dien, but shame on you, Mr. Rooker. Your reputation in the horror community has always been tarnished and your agent should be fired immediately. I'm sure this nugget of faeces is available on DVD, but if you like the 99 cents menu at McDonalds, you'll get more for your money.
