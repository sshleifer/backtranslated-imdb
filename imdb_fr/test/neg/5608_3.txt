In simple terms, this film is without any substance. Just take my word for it and save time, it's a complete DUD !! I would say that the characters are one-dimensional, but that would imply some kind of character development. I thought Eric Roberts was going to jump from one second to the next so close to B-Movie status. <br /> <br /> That 70's girl is beautiful ... but unless you're a stalker-like fan, this movie has nothing for anyone. <br /> <br /> To avoid..Avoid ... To avoid <br /> <br /> This film was directly shot in DVD for a reason ... this being ... it is a wreck Train !!!
