Just to save you $ 3, or all it costs to rent movies in your local video store, and the troubling time of this movie is a simple plan. Go to a friend's house, ask him to rent The Pest for you, watch the first 30 seconds or so, then make an excuse to leave. The opening sequence is really fun and really worth watching. Unfortunately, the other 99% of the movie is horrible. Without the shower scene at first, it's one of the worst movies of all time.
