About 20 minutes into this lame excuse for a movie, I realized that it reminded me of one of those boring people at work who was always telling lame jokes or doing extremely nonsensical things because they were finding that funny and were trying to entertain everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is presented as featuring Traci Lords, it's not a bad actress, but her aftershocks are not funny and she's not the star <br /> <br /> > the most horrible I've ever seen, except for Lords, the girl who plays Casey and maybe the Colonel - who seems strangely out of place. I do not see why a retired military colonel would like to create an ACADEMY OF SNOWBOARDING. Do these exist themselves? <br /> <br /> The budget would have been better spent to persuade these women to make a pornographic feature film. <br /> <br /> "Freddy Got Fingered" currently has a score of 3.5, "Frostbite" has a 2.7. I am confused by the fact that these two films are close to 1.0, FGF is "The Godfather" compared to this junk. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars
