This story had the potential of a good movie. The difficult choice of love against money and anguish and regret doing bad. However, the film was ruined by the horrible mistake of Robert Redford as a villain who offers $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Demi Moore. As Redford has to pay for it. Redford's handsome youthful appearance and All-American charm are not enough to call him a fool. Redford's acting skills are insufficient to make his character threatening. I can see it now, $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Robert Redford. OK, said the lady, but you will have to give me some time to raise the funds. Jack Nicholson would have been perfect as a sleazeball.
