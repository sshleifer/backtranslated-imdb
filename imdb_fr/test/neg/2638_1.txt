This movie was so weak that he could not even find good shots to rip off. I love horror movies and I see almost everything, but if I had to do it again, I would have completely skipped this one. You may think I'm exaggerating, but I challenge anyone to find anything that is both satisfying and interesting about this garbage can. Not scary, not funny, not curious, not worth it.
