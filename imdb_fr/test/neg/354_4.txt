You hardly know that a year later, MGM placed Norma Shearer in THE DIVORCEE, which shines with its technical know-how. How far they came in a year. CHENEY is a very beginner walkie. The camera is barely moving. Shearer is his usual charm and Rathbone plays well in a romantic lead role. They are all very attentive to speaking clearly and slowly in the source of the microphone, which mitigates the effect of a dramatic scene that flows naturally, but the room is a sturdy and fun workhorse, allowing to be entertained if its expectations are not too high. Oh, by the way, the plot involves a circle of thieves of high-class jewels infiltrating society to attack their victims. There are some intelligent twists in the script and true love triumphs over everything. Oscar nomination for the best adaptation to the script.
