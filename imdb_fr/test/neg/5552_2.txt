I like camp movies, trust me and Gordon Lewis's usual technicolorian gore does not bother me at all, but this is just one of his stupidest movies, even more than BLOOD FEAST, I'm not kidding not. THE GORE GORE GIRLS is about a crazy person who kills a lot of girls in a nightclub. A detective and a journalist tries to discover the big secret. Maybe the performances here are slightly better than those of the average H.G Lewis movies, but that does not say much. The work of the camera is even dreadful. <br /> <br /> But at least, we can watch it with the game of the girls who play, you will have a good time with the film, and the murders are simply absurd. , very bad way: a girl is killed with a wooden hammer hitting her buttocks (!) and do not let me talk about what she does with the nipples. You'll laugh like anyone else with that. But the best of all this mess is a scene that I only love his campness: the go-go girl before being attacked by many feminists who dance in a very American way. It is important to note that this is one of the first films to have been rated X because of its violence. <br /> <br /> ONLY if you want to laugh and have a good time (but only with a lot, A lot of beers).
