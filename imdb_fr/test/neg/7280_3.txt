Infamous horror films rarely measure the hype surrounding them and I have not yet met a worse offender than Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes. Having stopped looking at this for years, I was really happy when I got it for Christmas and I waited one night when my girlfriend was ready to sit down to watch it - knowing she hated the extreme for anything really horrible. I did not need to worry. <br /> <br /> After a promising start - albeit a familiar one - that firmly secures the film in the world of survival horror 'Desolution USA', things get blurry quickly when protagonists and antagonists meet in the deserted wasteland. <br /> <br /> It looks like she was shot on a budget of $ 5, with the costumes of the Cannibal clan, hired in a quirky disguise shop specializing in fake cavemen and Indian red clothes, the story follows an annoying group of unfriendly WASP who make a detour on a trip to California, looking for a silver mine in a nuclear test area (!). When they break down, they get trapped by the local carnivore family and have to fight to survive. <br /> <br /> Hoping for another deliverance, the chainsaw massacre in Texas, the devil's turnaround and the devil's rejections, I realized I had stumbled on something that should have stayed dusty and unattended in a bargain basket of a video store located behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> With gallons of tomato ketchup to make the blood flow and some horrible close-ups on the wounds, I can see how a certificate 18 (in the UK) is justified, but with these big well-fitting shots, it would not have seemed a Saturday afternoon thriller on ITV. <br /> <br /> All the silver mine / The sub-plot of the nuclear test site is only a McGuffin to justify the opposition of the "civilized" family to the primitives, but given the ease with which the savages get their ass fucked, it is hard to believe that they survived for a generation struggling with passers-by. /> <br /> And then there is the end ... or its absence. It seems The Hills Have Eyes is missing a third act or, at the very least, a satisfying denouement. Instead, I was just wondering, "Yes, and ...?"
