What can you say after watching this movie? In other words, if you had the interest and concentration to go to the end. I was speechless, because of the astonishingly boring story, the boring situations in which an American equaled that of about fifty Iraqis and a boring dialogue. I think that if this movie has something to teach, it probably says to itself: "Do not be fooled by us, or we will come and kick your ass". Moreover, this film really encourages and votes to kill masses of foreigners, in the name of war. I had the image of tackling chess pieces on the game board. Except now it's fast and there is not much thought. And on top of that, no character has wit; so, how can you care what happens to one of them? By excluding fans of war movies without taste, I would not recommend it to anyone. There should always be something more interesting to do.
