A friend of mine who has a mysterious talent to find and - horrors! - like the bad movies recommended, I watch "The Pest". At the time, unaware of how pathetic his taste was in movies, I decided to try it. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. <br /> <br /> The story, even if it is clearly ripped from all sixth-grade English textbooks with regard to the theme "manhunter" would be fun in good conditions - good actors, writer, director , wardrobe, etc., and so on. Clearly, these factors are absent. <br /> <br /> "The parasite" is supposed to be funny, I think. I say "think" because I have only cracked a slight smile throughout the film. Not a laugh, not a laugh, not a laugh, not even a smile. A smile, at best. And it happened to me so rarely when watching this movie, I even remember how many times I have smiled - maybe three or four times at best. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a huge favor. Never look at this movie. Avoid at all costs.
