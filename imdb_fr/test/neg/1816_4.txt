This is the first and to my knowledge, the only complete production of "Heart of Darkness" ever released. Before starting on "Citizen Kane", Orson Welles shot some test footage for a version of "Heart of Darkness" that was to be filmed entirely in what we will now call "POV", where we would see everything from the point of view. the main character Charlie Marlow; it would only be seen fleetingly in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The film was never shot. The technique of "POV" was used, without much success, in 1947 in "The Lady at the Lake", with Robert Montgomery in the lead role of Philip Marlowe. Presumably, the coincidence of the two characters "Marlow (e)" is just that. Of course, Francis Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" was based on "Heart of Darkness". <br /> <br /> The short film "Heart of Darkness" of the British writer of Polish origin Joseph Conrad, published for the first time in a British literary work. magazine in 1899, features one of his favorite alter egos, ship captain Charlie Marlow, who also tells the short story "Youth" and indirectly tells the story of "Lord Jim". Marlow, temporarily unemployed, decides to take the post of captain of a river boat for a Belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of the personal stronghold of King Leopold II, the cruel independent state of the Congo. Marlow travels from London to Brussels and signs with the company. It is said that his mission is to get the boat up on the Congo River to an inland station, headed by one of the most productive agents of the company in the colony, a German named Kurtz . . Deliveries of ivory, latex (for rubber manufacture) and other products from Kurtz Station have ceased and no word has come from Kurtz for some time. There are rumors that he has become "native". Marlow needs to investigate, take action and report back. He borrows the passage from the West African coast to the mouth of the Congo, is delayed by several weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the station of the company on the coast and finally gets upstream to find the station from Kurtz. The river, the heat, the vegetation, the fauna, the insects, the people weigh heavily on its endurance, its imagination and its mental resources. He finds Kurtz sick, half crazy and close to death. The final encounter and Kurtz's death is almost an anticlimax, especially since Conrad is so obscure about what is really happening that we have to fend for ourselves. This is a novel where you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the end, but nevertheless enjoying the story for its extraordinary atmospheres. <br /> <br /> This "Heart of Darkness" was shot with Guyana in Central America, replacing West Africa. . It is better that the novel is the most disadvantaged: to show us in fact first-world citizens what a boat ride on a tropical river would look like. But the rest of the movie was forgettable. Tim Roth does his best as Marlow, but so much of the plot, characterizations and character relationships have been changed beyond recognition that you wonder why they bothered you. If the goal was to make Conrad's story for the screen, why did not they leave him alone? It is unreasonable to expect that no compromise will be made when a book is turned into a film, but so many changes have been made that no cinematographic justification has been given for you to wonder whether they were simply writers and incompetent filmmakers. The most disappointing of all was John Malkovich as Kurtz. He was completely misunderstood and simply blurred the role. All that concerns him is false: his appearance, his acting style, his voice, his accent, everything. A much better choice would have been someone like Bruno Ganz (unlike Malkovich, a German like character). <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing production and I would recommend it only after reading the book if you want to rely on more than your imagination to get a visual image of a boat trip on the river Congo around 1900.
