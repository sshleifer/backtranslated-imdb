I am a big fan of sci-fi movies. So when I saw this movie at EPG, I felt like I had a good evening. What a desappointment ! Such a mediocre display of "special" effects that I could not imagine in 1980, but in 2005? Come on, why would you want to make special effects of a helicopter flying in the desert while you can film a real one at a much lower price (I guess)? And these killers "muppets" ... well, I could do better than that in a few hours in the garage. You can expect to have a small budget for a movie, but I do not think it's reasonable to have a low-budget movie. As for the "star" of the movie (I use a lot of quotes tonight ...), Lou Diamond Philips, the guy is not even a remote actor. Maybe he should have stayed in the martial arts movies. Overall, a horrible movie. Maybe I'm in a bad mood tonight. Again, maybe not. A sincere 1 out of 10.
