Talk about false advertising! I lost an hour and twenty-five minutes looking at this shit and there was not a casual suit, not a wedge shoe, not a finger-danced dance, and not a single disco ball. I watched it on a Saturday night and ended up with a terrible fever, but it had nothing to do with music. <br /> <br /> Seriously, with or without John Travolta, this movie was bad. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene, you ask yourself: "Where does this rope come from, and will it hang me too?" From his absolute bias against the driving abilities of the Dutchman from Pennsylvania to the shameless promotion of the seemingly eternal capabilities of Alienware laptop batteries, to the cheap horror effects directly raised by Japanese cinema, he is the worst film to be released since The Grudge.
