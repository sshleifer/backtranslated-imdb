Somewhere in the United States, the young Clair manipulates her friends Mic, Billy and John, showing him a letter that Bob would send him and the loose group loose Bob and Mic kills him with a piece of wood in the forest. Mic feels grief and decides to tell his mother what he did, but John and Billy threaten him, with tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> I think "The Wind" is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The horrible scenario is ridiculous and it is almost impossible to write a summary, because there is no story or plot, but only sequences of disconnected scenes. The staging and the amateur game are incredibly poor and terrible. It's amazing how producers invest in such garbage, distributors distribute it around the world and viewers like me buy this DVD. I was waiting until the last scene because I was curious to see how bad this movie was and I was impressed because it is worse than I could imagine to the extent of my lowest expectations . In the end, I wonder why IMDb does not offer zero in the voting system, because the trash really deserves this vote. My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Força Invisível" ("Invisible Force")
