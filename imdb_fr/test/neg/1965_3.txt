-can contain spoilers- <br /> <br /> It is clear that those who have already made this film had to have a lot of connections. I simply can not see it otherwise. What really surprises me is that no one has used Allen Smithee's name, and even more surprisingly, not everyone involved has used that name. <br /> <br /> Anyway, where to start. The bad dialogue, the shabby costumes, the mine of film, the involuntary comedy, the extravagant characters and more inconsistencies than George W. Bush's university career. I do not know what was more funny, the guy who loses his arm because of a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all of Jack Frosts' babies were killed. In addition, one of the highlights of all time has been stated in this film. "How do we know it's him?" As if there was another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! An excellent camp movie, but a very bad movie as a whole.
