If you're looking for the hit of the summer, Dark Harvest 2 might be your ticket. The production values ​​of this film are extremely high (it looks like it was shot with a Sony Handicam and edited with iMovie), especially the sound effects: they sound directly from a CD "Spooky Halloween Sounds"! The scarecrow of the cover, although it does not appear in the film and has no other relevance, is terribly realistic! From beginning to end, you will see a man who is aimlessly searching for his daughters through a play on words, MAIZE! At the end of the movie, you'll see, well ... you'll have to watch for yourself. <br /> <br /> What I'm really trying to say here is, do not go within 1000 yards of this movie. I rented it because I thought it would be some kind of funny "Troll 2" camping, but that's not the case. I cried after watching this movie, because I realized I had spent some money on it (and I found the $ 4 I spent to rent it). I fell asleep for 20 minutes and I always knew what was going on.
