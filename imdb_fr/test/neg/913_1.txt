people, get a clue! I mean, the writers do not have one, so I would expect you ... this show is like a pale imitation of the 60s show that you can laugh at! and the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects, and is in B & W Iron Chrissakes! Still, the atmosphere and the writing of the old series are at the forefront. Get kids HiP! if 98 Degrees or Brittany told you to watch it, you would! You know! Bypass them and tell all your friends that you were "IN" with the "scene" BEFORE it gets too cool!
