In this idiotic symphony, a country mouse visits his cousin in the city. Most of the shorts are the two mice exploring the dinner table. The animation is good, where this short film suffers from a lack of humor. I may have just seen this "table adventure" in too many shorts with Tom and Jerry. Even if it happened first, I just did not find it nice.
