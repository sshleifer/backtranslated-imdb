A pigtail Linnea Quigley drinks milk, undresses and kills her sister and boyfriend after sex. She goes to an asylum, makes Amy's best friend (Karen Russell), and both have them sing out of a psychiatric facility by sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by Lyle Wagoner, a regular " Carol Burnett Show "). Outside, these two mafia princesses who hate men (!) Stop taking their medicine and invite six old slimeball friends in their big country house for a party where they are systematically bloodily massacred by a glove in leather. mysterious killer dressed. <br /> <br /> The ugly David Barton FX are so bloody, but so unrealistic that they take on a kind of surreal quality. Same thing for the movie. The dialogue is so strange and scalded, the film so little rhythmic and edited, and the play as mundane as you will begin to doubt your own sanity. This movie actually tries to have a plot and characters in three dimensions, but everything is so badly managed that it's a bit like what would happen if Ed Wood rewrote the script Ingmar Bergman! And as in any good movie from Bergman, it has a mature morality to respect - Any good evening needs a good ratio man / girl, so there will be enough girls to "tickle your lizard". See for yourself ... or do not do it! <br /> <br /> Linnea (the only reason I even wanted to watch this at first) is very funny in this one, has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several dazzling nude scenes. Unfortunately, it also disappears completely from the last third of this film and the film suffers. <br /> <br /> Note: 3 out of 10
