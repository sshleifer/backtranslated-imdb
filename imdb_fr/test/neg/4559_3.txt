Ugghhh !!! This is exactly the kind of pre-code film that could wrongly convince the viewer that the movies of this period are shabby - and they are NOT - it's just that this movie is awful. Horrid because even though the movie strives to be "hip" and "grown-up", it's as hopelessly old-fashioned, dull and hokey as I was torn between laughing at the movie or falling asleep !! It's a unique combination, to say the least. <br /> <br /> So why did I hate him so much? Well, the movie is incredibly shabby, but it has no style and the movie is supposed to shock but lacks subtlety and takes too many ridiculous twists to be credible. The film begins with a cliche - a whore with a heart of gold. Dorothy Mackaill is a prostitute and she seems to accidentally kill a man! Shortly after escaping, she meets an old boyfriend who wants to marry her (he does not do his job). Seeing the innate goodness of this man, she decides to change her life and stop leading a wild life. It's difficult when she's hiding on a fictitious Caribbean island. Here, alone and waiting for his man to come back, there is nothing to do and the place is infested with super horny men and totally unattractive. In fact, this part of the movie is so boring that the audience may have trouble staying focused. The men on the island are so inflamed by Mackaill's presence that they seem perpetually about to rape her - to be pushed away because she is no longer that kind of girl. Frankly, I got tired of all these salacious scenes - there are just too many things rolling in the eyes and waving the tongue to make believe something else than a very bad movie. And watching all those naughty horned dogs was just boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> But wait, ... it gets even worse. The man she thought she had killed is on this small island (what are the chances ?!) and is also trying to rape her. However, he must not be dissuaded and she ends up shooting to save his new virtue. While the jury on the island is about to acquit her, she goes to court and lies: she tells them that she wanted to kill the man and that it was premeditated (?), Because even if she is acquitted, she knows that the perverse jailer will have her with her when she is sent to jail on a charge of possession of firearms. Since the jailer himself gave him the pistol to train her, she rushed to court and said she was guilty, which seemed really, really ridiculous. Why did not she just tell them the jailer's twisted plan ?! Supposedly, she did it to preserve her virtue but to admit that she killed someone so that people think you are a virgin ?! So, to avoid a short prison sentence (and, again, the threat of rape), she does not intend to tell the court that he is trying to force her into a sexual compromise situation (the jailer promised to violate it). when she is locked up). And, just before she is taken to the gallows (to avoid rape), the boyfriend arrives in time for her to send it and the credits. <br /> <br /> An impossible situation and the coincidences do not fail - come so often that the film is just silly. Combining this with all the sexual insinuations, this creates a messy and suspicious film that will seduce only the most fervent fans of pre-code movies. All the others, beware, it's very tacky and ridiculous from start to finish!
