From what I understood, Mr. Bava abandoned this project before its completion ... AND JUST EITHER !!! If I were him, I would certainly have made EVERY copy engraved and if anyone ever asked me about this film ... IT NEVER ARRIVED AND IT NEVER EXISTED ... end of the story. <br /> <br /> Despite some great scenery and good photography, it's a horrible film ... is it supposed to scare you? (not in the least) is it supposed to be funny ?? (puh-leese) A total loss of time ... and I really do not like to say that !!
