I have little more to add to bowlofsoul23's comment here. But as the first Brazilian (born, raised and living in Rio de Janeiro, in a neighborhood located a few kilometers from the favela of Vigário Geral, described in the film), he commented on "Favela Rising" funded by the United States. United here on IMDb, I have mixed feelings: on the one hand, it is good that Brazilian and foreign filmmakers and media are looking more and more at the disastrous situation of Brazilian favelas, as local governments seem to have given up since a long time. On the other hand, it's incredibly frustrating that "Favela Rising" turns out to be a missed opportunity to enlighten an enlightening non-Brazilian audience, as new directors Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (from the US, neophytes in this matter) transforms the biography of the AfroReggae group's leader, Anderson Sá, into a glamorous canonization in this superficial, biased, under-researched and misleading documentary. Good intentions, confused results. "Favela Rising" looks like a TV commercial, is superficial as a prime-time TV interview and biased as a promotional video. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" is uncomfortably wrong for a Brazilian viewer, and not only because of his hype visual treatment of the sad reality and his happy feeling of happy ending. "City of God" is an obvious reference here, with COG actors Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen incarnated for no apparent reason other than the "hype". "Favela Rising" is apparently a documentary about the AfroReggae group and its leader, Anderson Sá, but beware: when you see the scenes shot in the favelas overlooking the beautiful Rio coast line, you might as well know that Vigário Geral (AfroReggae House and Anderson) is located in an area of ​​Rio far from ALL beaches. Strange choice of place, to say the least. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" is probably confusing for non-Brazilians, who will not know many interviewees (and the film will not tell them either) and it will be necessary to wait for the closing credits to know that many of the songs from the soundtrack are NOT AfroReggae Band (although you will become suspicious when you start hearing Pink Martini from everyone!). They will also not know that important questions have simply been left out: why does the film insist on the fact that AfroReggae is a project in its own right? Why not recognize the many partners who provide significant financial and logistical support, such as the Rio City Council, private Brazilian companies, multinational record companies and international NGOs, without whom AfroReggae may not even survive? Why not make it clear that Vigário Geral is still plagued by violent drug wars and that its inhabitants are still living in fear of attacks by traffickers and cops? Why not make it clear that many archive footage showing violence and police corruption have NOT occurred in Vigário Geral? HOW and WHY did kid Richard Murilo finally join AfroReggae? WHY was Terrible Earth not interviewed at the end of the film? <br /> <br /> As for Anderson, the film leaves much to be desired by the viewer: what is the story of Anderson having "two" mothers? Is the baby he's holding in his arms his son? Why is it inspired by Shiva? Is he a Buddhist? Why does a Candomblé appear on the beach when the film mentions Anderson's "miraculous" recovery after his accident? Is he a disciple of candomblé? Why not let him explain the contradiction of creating a group that fights drugs and simultaneously congratulates Bob Marley? If AfroReggae is also a movement that builds pride for blacks in favelas, why are AfroReggae girls limited to bouncing routines? No, you will not get answers to these questions either. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers would like to turn Anderson Sá into a composite blend of pop-star, Malcolm X, Gandhi and Christ (check out this latest image of the Christ the Redeemer statue at the top of Corcovado Hill, immediately after showing Anderson "miraculously" walking after his operation). And that's the worst thing filmmakers can do to Anderson and his cause: make someone CHOOSE (by the time they show their scar to surgery, you're ready to believe it's a mark of God ). <br /> <br /> What is remarkable about Anderson, who is the most common type you can meet, is that he has helped to change his environment, NOT being "special", but copying and adapting the winning projects movement in Bahia, among others) in his own community, with the support of his friends, artists, intellectuals, politicians, businessmen and media. If you do not speak Portuguese fluently, you will probably not notice that Anderson is not particularly brilliant or articulate (unlike his very spiritual partner, José Junior), although he is not particularly talented as a singer. , lyricist or musician. However, his "banality" could have been the real "inspiring" core of the film: to show that ANY person with idealism, perseverance and constant support can really contribute in a meaningful way to his community, no need to be incarnated by Jesus. Because what really matters is the movement - AfroReggae - not the guy, you see? Do not we have enough of personality worship? <br /> <br /> At the end of "Favela Rising", you will probably not know more about the favelas of Rio than when you entered; you will have just seen what some of them look like.
