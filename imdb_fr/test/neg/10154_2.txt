my friend and I rented this one a few nights ago. and, I must say, it's the best movie I've ever seen. I mean, woah! "dude, we'd better make some beer before closing this joint" and "dude, Linda is not wearing a bra anymore." what poetry! woah! and it's such a wonderful movie. I mean, you usually do not find a slasher movie where every murder is exactly the same. I mean, exactly! now it's originality. and almost all transitions between scenes are those great shots of psycho in the scrubs of emergencies. it's cool! the acting is so wonderful. Dad was just awesome. must have studied REAL DADS before filming. And how many movies do you find that makes no sense? not a lot. but it's one of those jewels. I mean, how cool is it that a guy waited outside for about six hours to make a joke, while his friends were both inside? it's really cool. Overall, I'd say it's the biggest movie of its kind in the world! *****
