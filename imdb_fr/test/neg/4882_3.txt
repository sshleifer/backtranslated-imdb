I think I won the "windfall" contest for this film because I got it as part of a "Martial Arts Movie Classics" DVD collection with 50 movies for $ 20, which means I paid about 50 cents for the chance to watch the movie. "Black Fist" version of a movie that was released as "Bogard". <br /> <br /> For a basic "revenge" movie, "Black Fist" is not that bad, even though he's obviously embarrassed by a small budget. One of my informal "rules of thumb" for watching a movie is that if the main actor is better than his production and his scenario, the film automatically gets at least three stars. This is certainly the case here; Lawson has a certain presence and a certain charisma and probably deserved a better cinema career than he had. <br /> <br /> The street fight choreography (the ostensible reason of the film) will not really impress anyone who has ever fought in a martial arts school or who has just been punched in a fight. school playground. I only spent about two years learning basic kung fu, but even I would never fall for kicks, wrists and punches before. But the atmosphere is good - dust, blood and screaming crowds, and the actors mingle with battle scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot is less credible. Dawson's character, "Leroy Fisk," is described as a smart, intelligent young man seeking work as a trucker in illegal, unethical street fighting. Yet, he is surprised and indignant when he has to pay the cops? Excuse me, but I was raised in a small town in Iowa and even * I * knew (looking at "Hard Times" with Charles Bronson) that the cops had to be paid for this kind of action and that the The guys who were fighting needed the repairers to get their matches, and the repairers were worth their money. So you have to watch this movie with some sort of voluntary suspension of your critical faculties in order to accept it as a "black brother repressed" movie. (Most other non-black fighters in the team are also punched for the same contract, yes?). <br /> <br /> The film suffers from a lack of attention. The director obviously did not have the budget to film some of the scenes he needed. So he had to fill in the gaps with ridiculous exhibition scenes (The scene "I dressed him, I had dinner, then I killed him" it does not work) as well as voiceovers and clumsy and unconvincing montages. This is especially true with all the angle of romance that seems to have been filmed as if it were an afterthought. It is a little suspicious when one considers that the death of the woman of "Fisk" is supposed to nourish her desire of revenge. <br /> <br /> But once the film passes the "young fighter who climbs through the ranks" on the theme of revenge, he takes a little steam and plays with a little more conviction. I'm not sure that the end result is worth it - Roger Ebert calls this kind of thing "a long drive for a short day at the beach" ... but that ties things up quite satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> If Sylvestre Stallone had directed this film with a real budget and the same actors, sets and costumes more slicker, and himself as a hero, people would have hailed him as the next "Rocky", who is going to show you how circumstances and chance can wreak havoc on the dreams of potential filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing once for various decent shots and lines and watching Dabney Coleman embarrass himself into a role that underlies it.
