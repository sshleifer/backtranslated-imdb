Plunkett and MaCleane are two bandit thieves who steal the rich to give to ... well, the rich; comparatively, they are the rich. But we know it's good because the guy behind the police, Mr. Chance, is so perverse. He rapes women - or tries to do it. He beats his subordinates. He commits murder. He has bad breath. He does not shave properly. He has no sense of fashion. He tortures puppies. This last point is only one of my conclusions: we do not really see him torturing puppies. But I'm sure he does. Chance's little badness has a lot to do with his pursuits against Plunkett and MaCleane. It's just something he does in his spare time, a kind of hobby that he takes to be absolutely certain that we do not like it. He did not have to try so hard. Nobody in this film is nice. <br /> <br /> Let's take stock. Attractive characters? There is none: I think we covered that. Swashbuckling? Not a swash. Instead, we have a kind of heavy, dirty breathing. Hyphen? Sparkled? Effect? I fear that everyone has engaged in deceit. Realism? None of that, either. I think they were trying to achieve realism, because everyone was so dirty, but the characters and action had all the plausibility of Errol Flynn - without any sense of joy to back them up. Beauty? Nope. Nice camera work? For a television crew, maybe. Humor? You can laugh once or twice if you are in a good mood. Again, you could not. Dialogue? See "humor" above. The music? Do not even get me started on music. Ladyhawk's music was, by comparison, strangely appropriate; and at least the wrong aesthetic of this score was consistent. <br /> <br /> Ugh. I apologize to Ladyhawk for even thinking about this in this context. <br /> <br /> To summarize: there are many negative things here and NOTHING good - unless you count Liv Tyler, which I'm confident in two do. <br /> <br /> I feel like I just wrote a review of the pox. "Not very good," says the magazine. It would be much more interesting if I could one way or another defend smallpox, claiming that its detractors were all wrong, but I do not know how I would do it.
