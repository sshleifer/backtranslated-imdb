Spoilers ahead JEEEEEEEEEUSSSSSSSSSSSS .... I have a saying that says: "Insecticides kill insects and Moronicides kill morons ..." The "ghost" of this movie kills morons. Many of the people who are killed in this movie REALLY ask to be killed, by rushing into abandoned houses, looking for ghosts, etc ... <br /> <br /> From a strictly point of view cinematographic, this film is really bad. . The three scenarios are parallel and suddenly we learn that they are separated by at least a few days. It's a cheap shot ... <br /> <br /> In addition, the "chills" are so cheap that they are laughable. Even "Nightmare on Elm Street" has not sunk to the point of showing someone that his own sweater is attacked ... it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Save your money, stay home and you will not have a grudge against filmmakers anymore.
