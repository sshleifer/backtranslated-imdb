Wow! After the first five minutes of watching this "movie", I was quite tempted to put a bullet in my head and put an end to my life. It's really hard to describe what exactly this film is. Honestly, I do not know what kind of human being would even fund a piece of excrement. The film seems to have been shot in video or in 16 mm. Normally, I do not have a problem with SOV movies, 16 mm films are poorly made, but it was really awful. And where did they find these "actresses"? I've seen bad actors, but it takes the cake. Look at the first 5 minutes and you will see what I mean. BCI Entertainment should be boycotted for distributing this terrible mud. It must be the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure to see. I want my 74 minutes back! If you can sit for the first 5 minutes without pulling your TV or committing a mass homicide, give it a shot. After all, what do you have to lose?
