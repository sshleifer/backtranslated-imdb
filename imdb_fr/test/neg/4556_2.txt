This movie was so bad that it became nice. If you want to see a soap opera cast decide to make an action movie, this is for you! Excessive incidents, unrelated, an unlikely dialogue: everything is together. The main character has a double personality and can not decide if he is a thief, a loving father or a hero who risks his life for others. It is not plausible in any of these roles. This sets the standard for many other characters. The boss of the company whose building is set on fire displays the same unpredictability, as does his wife. And the typing line - who took the "chip" - beggars belief. I found myself laughing heartily and for this reason, I recommend you watch it.
