This film is terribly bad. Kevin Spacey is a very good actor, he shines in LA Confidential, American Beauty, Usual Suspects, 7 etc. .. But it's really bad, he did not arrive at a decent Irish accent. was about Adam. For the Irish, this film is laughable and even worse, it is quite annoying for many scenes. I think the producers made this film hoping that the target audience (non-European) would never have seen or heard of the "General" or Martin Cahill and that he would be fascinated by an intriguing and entertaining story. Total crud !!
