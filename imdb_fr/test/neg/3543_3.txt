Nightscream is a TV movie, so it must be pretty terrible, especially since it's a supposed horror movie. This girl is haunted by dreams when she arrives in a small town where a woman was murdered a year ago. She is amazed when everyone in the city thinks she looks exactly like the murdered girl. The townspeople are amazed when she enters the dream, trance, where she reveals specific details about the murder and the murderer, because the police apparently made a mistake. Thinking that they might be discovered, the murderers (there are two) begin to develop a plan to get rid of her before she discovers the truth. At that point, you will probably fall asleep and why the filmmakers have the machine to "fog" in full acceleration in the sequences of dreams.
