The worst movie ever, without exception. Give yourself a pat on the back if you can possibly get through every extremely painful minute of it. Except the moment when the unlucky loser turned into a disturbed psychopath by forced medical experiment pours his pea soup on the doctor's head and laughs like any good madman in delirium should ... that's all.
