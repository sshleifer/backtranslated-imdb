This film has pretty special effects, tearing the Japanese archipelago to a degree that would humiliate Godzilla. Both leaders also performed exceptionally well. Apart from that, everything is a bit complicated in this discrete disaster movie. The incongruities in the rhythm are weird. At one point, Hokkaido sinks into the sea and pyroclastic snow falls on the rest of Japan, while Osaka is buried under a huge tsunami. Yet elsewhere in the country, people are still roaming the streets to lick ice when another tsunami occurs ... Kusanagi also manages to travel great distances unhindered, or even a crease in his cream shirt. Other people come with burns, torn clothes and mud on their faces. <br /> <br /> The Japanese character of the film is both touching and disgusting. Kusanagi's sacrifice on his last night with Shibasaki is a touch of chivalry rarely seen in this genre today. However, the Prime Minister's unhappy thoughts on the Japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that Japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance, suggest a darker paranoia. which infects Japanese concerns about their status in the country. world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the last sequence is an Armaggedon scam, edited with a cookie cutter. <br /> <br /> Finally, my own bear-insect, the heavyweight product placement for cigarettes. This time, it's Toyokawa, a crazy scientist (or rather himself?) Who becomes the poster holder of Japan Tobacco. At one point, he manages to light 5,000 meters below the surface of the ocean, in a miniature submarine the size of a phone booth. Leave me alone.
