I admit it's not a good movie. He shouts practically "low budget", but curiously, I always found myself loving the film because, even if it lacked quality, it was full of energy. It was like the little engine that could and a film merged into one! <br /> <br /> The film takes place on a radio network and concerns some of their subordinate employees - two page boys (one very arrogant and the other by wuss) as well as a new receptionist. All three have visions of radio stars but must for the moment be satisfied with their modest jobs. <br /> <br /> In this story appears a murder that seems somewhat safe. I did not know it was a detective film and was a bit surprised. However, like most B-mysteries, the cops are lame and it's up to our insistent hero (Moran) to try to save the situation. All the while, I had a hard time deciding whether Moran was odious or endearing. I'm still not sure !! <br /> <br /> There is a moment in the film that is very worrying, and it is at this point that the two pages try out the roles of comic radio. They appear in black and imitate Amos n 'Andy in the 3rd or 4th quality. In addition to being very insensitive, it was not funny either. Fortunately, the producer of the series for which they were trying seemed to have the same feeling. <br /> <br /> Overall. it's easy to skip this movie and I will not blame you for it. However, the strange and frenetic pace of the film seemed to actually offset the film's artistic shortcomings and I'm happy to have seen it. A good film? No, but it's still worth a look for fans of old Bs. <br /> <br /> By the way, I may not have very good taste, but I thought divas singers had really a mediocre voice. despite the fascination of all the spectators of the film. Listen to yourself and let me know what you think. I just could not believe that one or the other had the right to sing on a movie, even if it was only for the modest Monogram Studios.
