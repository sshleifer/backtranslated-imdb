Porn legend Gregory Dark directs this horror movie to which Glen Jacobs (Kane of WWF / WWE / whatever his name is today) makes his film debut. He plays Jacob Goodknight, a blind serial killer whose strength is to deprive people's eyes. The plot, anyway, has a group of troubled youths who clean up the historic hotel in which GoodKnight resides and who subsequently get offended by him. Hemmingway it is not. It's starting to be as much fun as movie B, but it's getting too tedious to be nice. I am happy to have entered with rather low expectations, but even these have not been met. How can you have a porn king run and still suffer from a lack of nudity ??? for shame. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Samantha Noble unveils her ass briefly
