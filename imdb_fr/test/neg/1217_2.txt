Zzzzzzzzzzzz. It came directly from the "Jaws" cookie cutter, with some other weird pictures added for good measure. I was interested in seeing this after finding a picture in a book about Italian horror movies, and wow ... I guess I got what I deserved! <br /> <br /> Very slow and talkative, a lot of This killer shark movie takes place on the ground, which is not really surprising. It seems that the only method to show a shark is to photograph a shark in an aquarium. The shark is never in the same frame as one of the actors, and it's a shame ... most of the characters are so boring that you really want them to be eaten. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns A group of four children who meet a mysterious Indian on the beach while grilling weenies. The Indian, for whatever reason, provides them with an ancient artefact that will allow them to hunt down an ancient evil that took the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe ... supposedly because they were too good for fishing the ocean and the god of the ocean was worried they would take all the fish. Or something like that. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing too, because you would not know it ... years later, a monster shark appears and begins to engulf people in the sleepy seaside community. When a shark eats one of the four guys, the other three are determined to kill the thing ... especially since (big upheaval here), authorities have killed a shark and think the threat is over. Yawning. <br /> <br /> Mandatory death scenes are incredibly tedious and you can see them arrive a mile away (my favorite was the girl arguing with her boyfriend while sitting in a van, then jump and say "I'm going to swim", immediately to be engulfed by the waiting shark). They had the nerve to call this film "Deep Blood" since you see almost nothing but troubled water. The actors interpret their stereotypical roles as if they were all thumbs, and there's even a hilarious secondary plot involving a nasty type of greasy rocker that threatens our beneficent heroes, then finally reveals itself to help kill the shark. <Br/> <br /> It took me a long time to find this film, it's rather obscure, so I do not think there is a risk that too many people are wasting their time on it. However, if you are drawn to it ... do not say you have not been warned!
