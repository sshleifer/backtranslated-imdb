So you have the spoiler alert --- but I would say that you can not spoil what is already rotten. I guess they changed the name to "The Cavern" just in case "WIthIn" would be famous for its reputation. <br /> <br /> After paying the cable rent for this movie, I planned to keep my garbage for a month and send it to the author / director. He had his garbage delivered to my house, so I thought it was fair that I return the favor. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a suggestion that the scene takes place in the Kazakhstan desert. I do not know why they chose Kazakhstan. The writer may be a fan of the Ali G Show. But they should have just started inside the cave, because the outside was obviously not Kazakhstan. It was the first hint that I was going to hate the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has no qualities that redeem you except one: it is consistent. Everything is terrible. Writing, staging, acting, cinematography - all aspects of this film are simply bad. And I like bad movies, wacky movies, horror movies. . . but it was just bad. And stupid. And crushed. And predictable. And boring. <br /> <br /> To get an idea of ​​the movie, go to the laundry room with 5 of your friends and turn off the light. Put a flashlight (lit) in your dryer and start tilting it. Now you all start screaming and screaming loudly. That's it. <br /> <br /> For a complete reenactment, have 5 of the 6 people in the laundry room play flat on the floor. Mix in the Karo syrup. Turn on the lights (stop the dryer). Now ask a guy in gorilla costume to enter the room and rape the last person standing. <br /> <br /> END <br /> <br /> ADDENDA: While reading the other comments, many find it remarkable that this film was made on a small budget. It's not remarkable. Make a shitty movie with a huge budget is remarkable (Waterworld). Making a good movie on a small budget is remarkable (like Blair Witch, whom I really enjoyed). Making a shitty movie on a budget is not surprising, and you can expect it to be the same if these people are still making movies, because I can not imagine that someone one gives them a pile of money after watching this. Is the small budget an excuse for a terrible movie? No, and this is certainly not a reason to look at it. Do you want to eat a dog dung sandwich just because it was cheap to prepare? <br /> <br /> The IMDb rating of this movie over time will be interesting to watch. This should go lower, but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent bystanders can surpass the filmmakers' ability to beg their personal friends to give him 10 stars.
