I am passionate about cinema and I enjoy a wide variety of films. However, I did not find ANY pleasure in this movie. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I do not think there was a lot of scenario, the characters were not friendly and the relationship between the characters was at best dysfunctional, and the end only made me hate the movie more. This is certainly not in the same category as "The Cave" which was, in my opinion, the best cave film ever made. Even "The Descent" was better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a waste of $ 3.79 rental and my time to watch it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one.
