This film is overestimated, to say the least. It's not good as a comedy, nor as a "serious" film either. The pace is much too painful for the first and there are too many lame genies for the second. The only laughs come from some of the shots of Bud Spencer's reaction when he is exasperated by his brother's behavior. The copy is excellent but framing in full screen is terrible. (* 1/2)
