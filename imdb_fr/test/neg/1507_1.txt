I watched this movie at a party, we were very intrigued by the end, it ended rather badly. Although the film is not extraordinary, I was expecting something slightly better. This movie is pure junk, but I suggest you watch it if you find cheap horror movies with a low, pretty funny storyline. Personally, I loved advertising, it was my climax overall, the fighting scenes were basic, stabbing, shadows in a window, fake blood. I must say that Granny's costume was pretty scary. This film is a mix of killing joy, camp blood and boggy creek 2, except that this film has slightly more camera processing and color processing than camp blood.
