This overheated southern gothic "mellerdramer" has a few decent moments - but is too often spoiled by a novice director stacking cliché cliché, and by a star who apparently decided to make the decision to make this photo his personal showcase rather than allowing the Writer / director Gabel to update Inge or Williams as a kind of contemporary "Midnight Cowboy" encountering "Lolita" tear-tearer. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes, listen to the exaggerated Southern accents and try to decide whether you are attending a feature film or a theater class - full of enthusiastic amateurs. <br /> <br /> Johansson is for once tolerable (that is to say, less upset than usual) - although it's not good, Macht is decent, but a little too cute boy at believe, and Travolta juggles with the landscape never before (with the help of a good editor and some restraint on the part of the director, his performance could have been really touching, as he is, he - and almost everyone - is too inimitable to make us forget the point of boredom or disgust). Kara Unger is perhaps the best of all; If her role had been developed beyond a few lines, she might have even been named best actress in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> Pic is almost saved by the Leonard Cohen-themed theme song, decent design and production venues, and a continual reference to literary works (which has earned critics of otherwise classic screenplays , such as "poetic"). Sonny Shroyer, and perhaps more importantly, the Soderbergh cameraman, Elliot Davis, whose outstanding work will undoubtedly be attributed to the first director, who in ten or twenty years learn to lead. <br /> <br /> But probably not.
