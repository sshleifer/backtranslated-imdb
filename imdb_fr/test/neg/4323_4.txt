Lon Chaney Jr returns to conquer the mummy Kharis in search of his companion, Annanka, whose soul now resides in the beautiful army of the descendant Amina (Ramsay Ames). Andoheb, Arkan's high priest (George Zucco), leaves Yousef Bey (John Carradine) in charge of Kharis to continue his evil deeds. Tom (Robert Lowery) needs to find a way to preserve his beloved Amina from some mummy terrors. <br /> <br /> The predictable and routine entry into the Kharis series proves that almost all films follow a specific format / formula. The city is threatened by an armed, armed corpse, masked in an envelope, which seems to have been endowed with a superhuman power to smother the lives of able-bodied men, held fairly easily by a simple strangulation of Kharis. Frank Reicher, who saw Kharis in action..and well-known Egyptian history..in the previous film (The Tomb of the Mummy), proves that anyone who survived a previous encounter with the mummy is sure to die he returns in the next film. Well produced, but lacking originality that would distinguish it from other films in the series. Unfortunately, Carradine is wandering through her role as villain Yousef Bey. Kharis, known to have donned a lame and crippled right arm, carries an unconscious Amina with two arms over long distances, with no ill effects. One of the aspects, the shocking climax where Tom's heroism attempt does not unfold as expected while Kharis holds his damsel hostage in distress, slightly lifts the film from the doldrums.
