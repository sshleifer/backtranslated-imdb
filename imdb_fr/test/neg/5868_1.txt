This abomination and the ONE MORE TIME (no thanks) and the ugly disasters of Jerry Lewis, such as Do not raise the lower deck for water (why not just shoot), have pushed the owners of movie theaters to close their doors rather than being forced to shoot these films. Certainly, in the 60s, the block reservation of films was still imposed in suburban cinemas and unfortunate campaign ... that means that to get a good movie, the cinema was forced to turn terrible watchmakers like those I remember very well in 1974, wanting to go to the FIDDLER ON THE ROOF movie theater or something like that, I was saved at the United Artists Reservation Office by a foolish salesman who waved a sheet of flops in front of me me and squinted: "Now, before you get there, lemme see you date those first". which basically means: "book these failures and we will give you a tired blow". This is how and why so many cinemas have closed, forced to sift and annoy their declining audience with these failures of the assembly line with lame comics and bored talents. The movie owners, exhausted by merely closed arguments, were sold at a gas station and saw the cinema demolished. Nowadays, the same type of movies (for example: I'M CHUCK AND LARRY 'S NOW) is banned at the cinema instead of 99, in a mega google plex. Not much has changed. FREDDY GING FINGERED ... Anyone?
