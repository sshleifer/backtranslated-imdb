This film is essentially a "how to" on how to be a well-connected pedophile. I'm surprised that so many people - especially other gay men - have seen this film and read the book and no one has mentioned that if Weber was not an influential photographer he would be in jail, he would be time to abuse on minor. Poor Peter Johnson. Weber took this poor, naive (though incredibly beautiful) teenager he found in a wrestling training camp in the American Midwest, made him live at home and took thousands of homoerotic pictures of him, including many are bare-faced throughout Johnson's adolescence. This is not art. It's child abuse. And what's worse, Weber has made a lot of money and poor Johnson is going to have serious "problems" the rest of his life. Weber's lustful love for the boy is downright terrifying, as are his speeches about famous (and less famous) people he knew as he tries to complete Johnson's "education." Creepy, and then just boring. The only thing that redeems me about the movie is that it's a fascinating study of self-illusion. But I can not help wondering why no one has ever considered the effect it had on "Chop Suey" (Johnson's nickname for Johnson) himself.
