I do not really know why so many people like this movie: maybe it's funny, all right, but it totally ruined one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself said, this film betrayed the book: not only is the story violently cut to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a fantasy film to children / adventure of very 80s. Today, we have effects, directors, new attention to books: I hope that someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki ...) will one day direct the story of REAL Neverending. A great dead writer, a wonderful book and many literary lovers deserve it.
