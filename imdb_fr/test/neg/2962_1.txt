This movie was produced by Producers Releasing Corp. (PRC), one of the film studios "Poverty Row" of the 30s and 40s. So you can imagine how little money has been spent on it. <br /> <br /> The music is forgotten. The cast member, Gerra Young, shows a lyrical quality voice, but Deanna Durbin is not up to his talent. The IMDb database shows no other appearances in a movie for her. Let's hope that she was able to hold a position similar to Grand Opera. <br /> <br /> The opening credits of the recently printed Turner Classic Movies document indicate that this film has been preserved by the National Film Museum. This immediately raises the question ?? WHY? <br /> <br /> Are so many resources available that they can afford to keep waste? Some low-budget musicals or musicals of that time have characteristics that value them. This film does not have one. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, ignore this movie. This is REALLY wasting an hour of your time.
