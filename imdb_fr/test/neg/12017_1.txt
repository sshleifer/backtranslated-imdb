It was just a horrible film. I watched it once when I was about 12 years old. I'm 19 now and I do not think I'll ever forget this movie. <br /> <br /> I always feel sick every time I think about it, it was just everything that could fit in a movie. I really do not understand what kind of person would appreciate this crap. It's not enough to simply leave the mind to enjoy this movie, I can enjoy as much as the next of the stupidest Disney movies designed for television, but that's quite another thing. <br /> <br /> Usually, I do not like judging a movie until I've seen it myself, but believe me, I'm doing you a favor. Do not watch this movie.
