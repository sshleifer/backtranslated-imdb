The brands of this film, like Suit Supply, take the story away, because it's supposed to unfold in the eighties. It's not a very exciting movie. Moreover, the single of Intwine on the soundtrack is very bad, it has a chorus repeated many times, like "I am a cruel man, I withdraw all that, I am a cruel man I am here for Rest .." Jeeez, could not those guys have anything better than that? I guess they wrote it in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It's really annoying, just like the product placement in this film-product, which traps controversy and publicity around a criminal who should not be a celebrity as he is now supposed to to be, but should be forgotten as the rats should be.
