I watched Cheats a few years ago with my friend. He said it was a very funny movie and one of the best comedies of all time. I think he was on crack or something. I just learned recently that this movie was not released in cinemas, I understand perfectly why. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves a group of guys who cheat just about all their homework at school to get good grades. This is the main problem of this film is that morality is bad. There are other teenage comedy films where students do bad things, but they are often things that do not happen in school. So, I think the concept of a whole movie that basically has children cheating is very bad. <br /> <br /> I did not like the characters in this film either. The main character is a completely arrogant and arrogant fool who is not a good protagonist. In fact, I'm not sure you can say that there is a protagonist because they all cheat in school, which is wrong. The other secondary characters were not funny at all and, basically, the cast was blowing in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad message and, even worse, actors and characters. There are other teen movies that are much better than this movie. So you do not have to see this one and it's a good thing because I do not recommend this movie at all.
