I just wrote a comment on "ACES HIGH" (1976) and it reminds me of this movie that I saw when I was a kid when he came out. Since then, I have watched it only once and it was more than enough. As Kevin says, "it's a total waste of time." In addition to dogfights that are well organized, the rest is a sequence of badly connected scenes with actors struggling with a lousy scenario and a staggering equally ugly. I do not remember the ridiculous German accents mentioned by Kevin in his commentary, but that's another pathetic mistake; If Corman tried to make the characterization of German pilots more convincing, why did not he use German actors or double his roles? On the other hand, it's a good example of the awful Hollywood twist with "bad guys" clearly identifiable, not only by their cruel actions, but also by their grotesque accents. <br /> <br /> There is talk of "cruel actions" the ridiculous scene where Lieutenant Hermann Goering murdered English nurses during an attack on an airbase is an absolutely disgusting propaganda made with a "historical decline". If you want to see a factual, moving, well-interpreted and realized film about the air war during the First World War, look at "ACES HIGH" (1976) or this wonderful classic "THE DAWN PATROL" (1938), you will not be disappointed.
