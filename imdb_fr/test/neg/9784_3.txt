My jaw dropped so often while watching this movie that I have bruises. Okay, okay, I really did not expect the quality, for example, of The Others or even Thirteen Ghosts (the new one, which was dreadful and is always above this madness). Someone else noticed the thin characters ... I would not call them "thin". "Thin" implies that there might be something for them. What about almost nonexistent? In no particular order we have: The girl who will cry out; The American who will understand everything; The macho guy who will just screw up everything until he is killed: the wise black man who will die early; The extra guy who is here to die first; The extra woman who is there to play hard. That's all. It's your list of characters and that's what they are and what they stay from beginning to end. If they were "skinny", they could at least change a bit from beginning to end. But they do not do it. All right, the American decides that he will stay at the end of the field work and the Screaming Girl returns to his home country. It's the change. Apart from this, they all act according to the roles assigned to them and rarely betray any real emotion when they finally meet the threat. Now, producers get props for an original threat, I would say. I understood that the story was going to be "Tremors" but with ants instead of giant worms. I give credit to the author: they are very cool ants and very scary and what they do with the bones is excellent. (The first time the "snatcher bone" appears, I admit that I jumped a few feet.) Unfortunately, the very cool concept quickly becomes Alien in the Desert. We have a lot of comments about ants that may or may not be true, but we do not have much of the mythology on which the threat is based. And we have all the clichés of monster movies ever made. People go to places where they know they should not and when they have no compelling reasons to do so. The moronic characters try to harm our heroes and die for it. A character has a double duty as a "scientist who does not want to kill the monster but study it". A very cool gadget is presented only so that the American can tell everyone something about ants, well, I hope everyone knows it anyway. Then the gadget is broken. Our heroes lack the only thing that can contain the threat. And then there's this last boring moment where we know the threat is still there - and we wonder exactly what and how the hero's or heroine's salvation went by. This completely renders everything that has been done before as useless and false. <br /> <br /> Three stars for fun use of ants and bones. Nothing at all for clichés, clumsy dialogues and characters with the light bulb off.
