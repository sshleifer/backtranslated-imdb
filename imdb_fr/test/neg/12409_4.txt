"Ashes of Time" was a daring project but ended up being a pretentious film. This film is a good example of the complex way of telling a simple story. The plot of "Ashes of Time" is quite simple and can be summed up in two words: "love triangle". Because of these "triangles of love" that cross stories, jealousy, hatred and love are the main dynamics displayed by the characters. The narrative part is seen through the eyes of Ou-yang Feng (Leslie Cheung). Ou-yang Feng lives in the desert, where he acts as an intermediary with various swordsmen and becomes the tool of Destiny through which revenge is realized. Unfortunately, "Ashes of Time" fails to tell these simple stories of love and hate. Wong Kar-wai was carried away by the desire to make each image of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. In fact, next to the cast of beautiful actors (men and women), everything else is a failure in this film. The dialogues are minimalist and not original at all. The quality of the image is very uneven, editing is one of the worst ever seen (at least by me) in the genre "swordplay" and finally the shooting of the rare fight saber is very confusing and unattractive. Even the attempt to build artistic scenes is not always accomplished: the scene called "women on an erotic horse" is ridiculous, not erotic or useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to offer 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a movie is first and foremost the way a story is told. Forgetting that he delivers a delicate film that does not even fulfill his artistic objective.
