Hercules: The TV Movie Hercules - A very distorted version of the story of the Greek superhero. Paul Telfer tries to play this hero. Sean Astin resumes his image of Sam Gamgee playing Lupine, a character incarnated in order to make the whole film boyfriend. I was almost expecting his to say at one point "We're in a bad situation, Mr. Frodo, um, I mean Hercules." A good, unexpected performance comes from Timothy Dalton (one of the smallest James Bonds) as the father of Hercules Herucles' love interest seems like Paris Hilton, something that immediately extinguished me ... Inevitably, someone distorted the original story into a somewhat troubled story and The special effects are useless, and while the Hydra scene does justice to the original story, the lion and the Nemean harpies are just ... lame, I think the creatures and the effects of the Power Rangers crossed my mind at least twice, and the Golden Hinds felt rushed and very computer generated, they eliminated Cerberus! The film can not determine if it is a Greek film , Roman or American and almost ruined the original story, a classic epic. Do not look for this one in the direct DVD movie. - C
