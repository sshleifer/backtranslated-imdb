This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time, no matter how much useful stuff continues to appear on this island, "how convenient !!!", the cast is beyond poor from the outset, it's like these softly screened soft movies on channel 5, a total waste of time, and I do not remember the names of the main actors but I can not believe that he works always !!! I've never seen him play "I've seen him in a lot of movies ... But I've never seen him play." Here are some of the glaring mistakes. </ P> <p> Apparently, gasoline lighters still work, even when they were soaked in sea water !!! also from this movie you can walk naked in the sea, but go out wearing a bikini bottom (I guess the cameraman and the editor were students) there are still a lot of mistakes, but I now plague, in addition to its not so much the mistakes that cast the script and the entire movie avoid at all costs
