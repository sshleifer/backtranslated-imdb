The DVD version we bought included Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we discovered it was a picture of her from another movie. Unfortunately, she is very little in this movie. But you can see how far she has come. <br /> <br /> The other plus point of the film, aside from its very small part, is some shooting scenes shot in New York and New Jersey. the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The sound is terrible. Sometimes, the background noise is so loud that the dialogue is hard to hear. Sometimes the dialogue was redone without any background noise, which is disconcerting. For example, sometimes when they are in the car, the sounds of the car are too loud, then suddenly, there is absolutely no additional noise. The director loves close-ups on faces. It is clear that the film was over-doubled because the words do not correspond to the movements of the lip. For most of the film, the voices sound as if people were talking in a tin can. <br /> <br /> The background music, when there is music, is entertaining instead of adding to the movie. <br /> <br /> Management is laughable. The camera angles and zany sound effects make the movie a joke, especially during periods of tension, as in the middle of battles. The writing is terrible. Some secondary intrigues are meaningless, and most characters look very stupid because their motives are not explained at all. The author / director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men who were together in Vietnam, but that makes no sense. These assassins and former soldiers do not seem to be able to see the shadows of others or hear others move. The actors go from calm to panic and return to calm without warning. It's simply a combination of bad staging and bad writing. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are so bad that at first we thought we had discovered a student film that contained Sandra Bullock. If you like to laugh at really badly made student movies, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie.
