It was terrible, petty and full of the worst clich√©s and racial stereotypes I've seen for a long time. Seeing Hayden P trying to play "ghetto" was painful (hello, one leg of pants on your tracksuits and some braids, Downs will not make you "fall with the mates"). Solange Knowles makes a big face all through the movie. Most of the sequences seem to have been filmed in boxes ... what happened with the finale ??? And poor Rihanna was simply exploited to get people to watch her "play", which she can not. <br /> <br /> In simple terms, this film does not even deserve a star. Please put this tired franchise to rest. Or at least do the next Bring It On IV: Cheerleaders vs. Freddy & Jason.
