It is rare that anyone denies that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, inventive and prolific directors of all time, because it is without doubt all that. It takes real genius to scare generations of moviegoers by taking showers and wearing ties. Saboteur, however, is neither creative nor prolific. Instead, Hitchcock departed with the intention of creating a film gathering "American Pride", a certain title calling to support our troops and that was a popular theme at the time. With this in mind, Hitchcock severely downplayed other important aspects of the film, including logical plot, characterization, credible dialogue, and a fluid storyline. <br /> <br /> Typically, Hitchcock does very well with spy movies. A few years earlier, he was reaching cinematic splendor with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps, but seems to have lost his pace in Saboteur's creation and is just recycling the same story lines his previous two readily available tours. Without going into details, here is a list of some of the major problems of this film: <br /> <br /> 1. Although his face is stuck on all newspapers in America, the only person who recognizes Kane is blind. <br /> <br /> 2. At dinner, Kane and Patricia do not want to show up at the door because the bad guys could pick them up and tell the party they were "door destroyers". Logically, what prevents spies from catching them and saying it at any time of the evening? On the other hand, should we remind Kane that he is a wanted terrorist? <br /> <br /> 3. Since when can a fan belt cut handcuffs? <br /> <br /> 4. Nobody recognizes him ... his face is on EVERY NEWSPAPER !!! <br /> <br /> 5. The spies join Kane in the ghost town and assume that this is the man Freeman sent to work with them ... should not he have some kind of references? I know that spies do not run with name tags and photo IDs, but a secret handshake maybe? <br /> <br /> 6. The cop picks up Kane escaping from Freeman's house, it still seems that nobody recognizes him. <br /> <br /> 7. How does the FBI come to believe Kane without any proof? They do not even show that Kane is talking to the FBI, the scene sets in and we have to assume that everything is now kosher. <br /> <br /> 8. When the cops search the carnival caravan, how do they know Kane is now with a woman? The blind man thought that Kane's story would not have logically signaled his daughter's disappearance, abduction or, more importantly, his race with Kane. Why does not this movie use logic? <br /> <br /> This is a selection list. The film is not exciting, the plot is meaningless, and the world is filled with people who transport wanted terrorists every day to their homes and cars, because it's not that bad. Hitchcock fails miserably on this one.
