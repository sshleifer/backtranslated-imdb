Led by E. Elias Merhige "Begotten" is an experiment with some interesting ideas that do not quite succeed in what they were trying to do. The film is an extremely slow 76-minute experiment of dubious and irritating effectiveness that attempts to present a fascinating philosophy about the creation of the Earth and human nature. <br /> <br /> He begins with a god presented as a psychopath attached to a chair. man who tears his stomach using a knife. From entrails, blood and human waste, Mother Nature emerges. It then proceeds to the impregnation of the sperm of the dead god. Later, she gives birth to the Son of the Earth. A delay that constantly mistreats a group of cannibal people that I believe is the representation of humanity. <br /> <br /> "Begotten" casts a distorted and disturbing glance on the origin of life. Demonstrate the self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed that have become a trademark for humanity. The problem in the film comes from two points. The first is that the film is too slow in its exposure. What we get is a good half-hour spent showing how the Son of the Earth constantly trembles on the ground while being molested and tortured by humanity. Such an insipid prolongation becomes boring rather quickly and lacks punch to blow the viewer's senses. <br /> <br /> Another point is the visual and sound aspect of "Beggoten". The low, black and white cinematography, grainy and inverted, enchants the troubling factor of the plot, but such novelties often work only in short periods. Then, little by little, their effect decreases as the public gets used to the look. The sound suffers from the same problems. It's constantly repetitive and similar sounds become annoying so fast that I wanted to turn off the volume. "Begotten" loses its charm shortly after the start. He tries to be original and creative but does not develop the ideas suggested by the vague plot, but repeats the same scene again and again. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that "begotten" is blocked in an instant. . Even if he tries to advance in the plot, the images and the audio remain the same. Show the same action in a slightly different way with only a slightly different sound. A gadget alone can not make a movie. He also needs rhythm and variety, which Merhige seems to have forgotten.
