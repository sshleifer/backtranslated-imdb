A group of crazy teenagers goes to an old mining town in the hope of finding gold nuggets. The only drawback of this stratagem is that the former supernatural miner to which gold belongs does not wish to part with his treasure so easily and therefore begins to ship the intruders accordingly. <br /> <br /> A literally clich√©-germination dialogue, a horrible acting game, a terribly ugly 'Southern dialect' and a ruthless killer who looks like the Jeepers Creepers (without the natural predilection of younger boys mentioned more top) combine to make this puff a little unassailable. Even the cult legend, actress Karen Black in a small role, can not save this aberration. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elina Madison shows (very poorly lit) T & A <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: TMCX
