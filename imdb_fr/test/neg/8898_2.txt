Although I rarely agree with filmkr√∂nikan, I must say that this film is not so horrible, it did not do anything to me at all ... three or four that made me sneer ... but most of time, I was just sitting and wondering why? why did the characters do that? Even the characters of Hot Shots felt more thoughtful and concrete ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see an interesting Norwegian movie, look at Pistvakt. This is where a lot of random ethnic groups wandered around in the Swedish tundra ... <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed ...
