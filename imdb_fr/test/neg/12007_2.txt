I can not find the words to explain how much I hated this movie. The historic trial between Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and the Duke of Praslin is a tragic and fascinating story that, in my opinion, had the potential to be a fantastic film, but failed. <br /> <br /> Although cinematography certainly has something to say, it can not in any way compensate for the terrible structure of the film, the poorly written script and, above all, the characters terribly overwhelmed. The worst of them were the Duke's children who were so fake and so fake that they were almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film left me only the feeling of being irritated and deeply disappointed.
