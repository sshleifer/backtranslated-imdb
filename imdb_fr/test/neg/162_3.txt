I just finished watching The Edge of Love (by the way, this is one of the worst tracks to date this year) and it felt like a chore. Watching Keira Knightly's skeletal and unpleasant character made me squeak even more throughout the film. <br /> <br /> It took me four nights to watch it, it was so boring. Cillian Murphy was the only good thing about it. He is always good / credible and is often overlooked in many movies. However, that was not enough for him. <br /> <br /> Aside from the unimaginable characters, the boring story, the plot was also unsatisfactory on the emotional level. I felt like I was watching it for nothing (which I did). I should have done the smart thing and turned it off, but I kept it out of respect for Cillian Murphy and great cinematography.
