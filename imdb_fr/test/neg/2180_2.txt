It's supposed to be Charlie's masterpiece, but I'll argue it's one of his weakest films. First of all, it's not funny. Nothing in this movie made me laugh. Okay, there's a quick jump in a box that was a laugh, but it was a desperation. The first - and the only - Tramp talkie where he speaks (he sings in a previous movie), but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was so happy to watch "Modern Times" and "Gold Rush" - two films that are at least ten times better than this movie. There is literally only one good scene in this film, the one where Hitler plays with the globe like a beach ball. That's it. <br /> <br /> Okay, so we complain about being the first movie to go to war, even long before we went to war. Nope. Not true. This is simply not true, so the praise can be a little rejected. The Three Stooges did it on January 19, 1940 with "You Natzy Spy" - ten months earlier than the release of Chaplin's movie in October - and this movie was actually fun! If you want to watch Chaplin's greatest movie, watch it for reference only. And then, enter "Modern Times", "The Gold Rush", "The Lights of the City", "Limelight", "The Kid" or even "The Tillie Punctuated Romance".
