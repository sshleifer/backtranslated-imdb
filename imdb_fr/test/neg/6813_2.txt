After reading the reviews, I decided to rent the DVD version. <br /> <br /> I like classical music and I wanted to know more about Bach. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. I guess I do not know enough about Bach's music and the comments have not been enough to understand the importance or the nature of the music. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it would be appropriate to guide a Bach music expert able to explain the film. <br /> <br /> I really tried and saw the whole movie hoping I could enjoy it at least, but I did not do it. <br /> <br /> See at your own risk.
