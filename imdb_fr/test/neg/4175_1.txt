This movie was really funny even though it was not meant to be! The acting was stupid, as were the voices. About all that was, he was a guy walking in a corn maze for an hour and a half. They threw in this stupid super natural thing that made him even more silly. It was not even like a normal movie, this strange scary music played almost throughout the movie. What about horror movies about maze maze? The corn kids were really scary I thought and I thought it would be something like that, but in reality it was just stupid. The main character just walked shouting aimlessly for these two little girls. And then, in the end, he kills someone or something. It's worth seeing if you're with your friends because it's really funny, but if you're looking for a horror movie, do not waste your time
