We sat through this film wondering why this or that scene from the movie, what does this have to do with the plot? We hoped that everything would be a little clearer by the end. It did not have to be. <br /> <br /> I think the director, in a dive crisis, threw the scenario in the air, then a minor (and avenger) underling reassembled it at random, without any regard for the scene filmed. (possibly with scissors and a glue stick). <br /> <br /> The motives of the film include: Is Communism bad? Bad nihilism? Bad parenting bad? Household three bad? TV is bad? Coherent script bad? Deconstructionism good? It's really not clear. <br /> <br /> Finally, no German water taxi would ever have had a raging staircase that would let the passengers fall into the water. The abundant amount of "achtung" signs everywhere testifies to this.
