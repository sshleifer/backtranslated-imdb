Lou Costello (without Abbott) plays the role of an independent "garbage collector" in a small town (and the inventor of a time control machine!) Who secretly woo the niece of the city. After an argument, Lou's daughter (Dorothy Provine) comes up against a hazy cave - why she never fogs, and appears like a 10-meter giant. Provine is certainly a good sport, and she does not bother to try not to sound ridiculous (it was impossible anyway), and yet the screenwriter is really cruel to this character, transforming her not only into a giant but also in a good harpy. The bosses of Costello province are wreaking havoc among army soldiers, but nothing funny is done with the transformation. Trumped by "The Attack of the 50-Foot Woman" from the previous year, the film presents Lou Costello in his last hi, but brings little more. The special effects are marginal, while the script required more funny lines and a livelier direction. * 1/2 of ****
