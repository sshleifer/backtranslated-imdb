As a true movie lover, I advise you to avoid these appalling efforts. God knows how the funds were approved. Seriously, this is a cinematic experience that does not bring about any dramatic tension and that advances without anything happening again and again connectivity is at least two threats that keep you awake at least possible the worst movie that I have never seen and the main role of the main actress borders on criminal intentions. A blessing with modern technology, you can fast forward and watch it 12 times over a span of 25 minutes, ,, and you will not miss anything from the plot <br /> <br /> No idea how people find it interesting and some give him good grades!
