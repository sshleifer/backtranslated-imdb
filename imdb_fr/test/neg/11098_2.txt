Okay, I admit that I always associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. This is the main reason why I went to see this movie. But it was so boring that I almost fell asleep. Sorry, but her acting skills are not very convincing. In addition, this film was presented with special effects and exceptional special effects. Yes, for a movie B, it's not so bad. After seeing her in "Marquise" a few years ago (also a very crappy movie), I thought she would play more convincingly. But La Boum (and perhaps the James Bond "the world is not enough") seem to be the only good movies with her. Is it his "talent", does it have a bad taste in the choice of his films or just a bad luck?
