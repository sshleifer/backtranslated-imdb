Do not avoid this movie. Just because it's so bad it's absolutely hilarious. It may be the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was so bad that my friends and I could laugh at every moment of this movie. We have sometimes discussed the question of whether it was on purpose, but we are pretty sure that is not the case. The characters come out of nowhere as if they were already established, the landscape is constantly changing in this warehouse and the vampire assassin ends up having about 6 fierce battles with enemies before finally getting to the main vampire. You will also be able to appreciate the one and only face of the vampire assassin, because he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts. So, if you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh in a historic way, then I suggest this one as long as you go with an open mind. Do not expect a good movie, expect the worst ... and it will be even worse than that. I seriously want to buy this film and place it at the top of my humorous film selection. Right next to Anchorman.
