This movie was so horrible that I can not even describe it. I was surprised that I even sat through this pile of garbage. I could not believe that a movie like that was even thought of. It was a serial killer who chuckles like a chicken. He did not just snap once or twice, he giggled all the way through the movie. He even beats his arms like a chicken that's even more stupid than anything I've ever seen. I could not believe it was released in 1990. I thought it was early 80's or something. Then the girl is not very smart either because she was protecting the geek chicken or the man. The end is getting worse and is the worst end I have ever seen. This movie is just chicken s ** t. I laughed more than I was scared and strongly suggest going out and grabbing a bucket of fried chicken instead of seeing this movie.
