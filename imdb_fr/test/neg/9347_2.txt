After missing out on countless times on TCM UK, I decided to check it out for its science fiction / adventure / camp pedigree: I knew I was going for a completely stupid ride - but that was as incredibly bad! Anyway, perhaps appropriately considering the characters involved, the scenario tears many sci-fi titles then recent vintages - SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN'S RUN (1976) , as far as it was shot together!), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but uninviting: we can deduce from the title that water has become scarce on the planet where all this happens - then our shredding buccaneers heroes seize the ice blocks tyrannical rules of the Knights Templar (!). Also involved is a beautiful princess (Mary Crosby, daughter of Bing!) In search of her father, the fallen king; By the way, the cast includes another famous offspring: Anjelica Huston (John's daughter) as a member of the pirate group. Fortunately, the mistake made by the actress to accept such a role would soon be forgotten after her victory at the Oscars. his father's advice, no less) for PRIZZI'S HONOR (1985). Since STAR WARS chose Peter Cushing as "Supreme Commander", the filmmakers chose to create their own legend: John Carradine, 78 (who was seen attached to some kind of operating table during his brief scene!). . <br /> <br /> The most remarkable elements (for all the wrong reasons) are: the stranger using the toilet; the castration machine; clumsy antics (including karate fights!) inevitable companions robots; the bad makeup of slave / eunuch carried at a given moment by the heroes; recurring attacks of "herpies of space" (no matter what it is); the climax in which the characters age as they go through a time war (Crosby gets pregnant, gives birth and sees his son grow up in 30 seconds, while the main man Robert Urich himself is replaced by John Ford Hank Worden for this scene!) - by the way, the jumps adopted here (intended to indicate the rapid passage of time) are not only unsuccessful, but downright irritating.
