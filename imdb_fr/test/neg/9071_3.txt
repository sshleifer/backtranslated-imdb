The cast of "All That" returns for good mood in the "Good Burger", a place similar to an old fashioned fast food. The comedy is great, the entertainment is constant, and even if it's a clich√©, he is a smuggler comedies for children and for the family. <br /> <br /> A film for all ages, this film is made to have fun, laugh and be pretty is a lazy movie for a rainy day, because that's what I would save this movie, a rainy day. USA aired it today, and since I know that the cast of "All That" is there, I thought it might be a bit of laughter, but having fun, like Keenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell (probably one of the best duets of that time) were great together, the pieces were put together and everything worked out, which makes for a good family break with a few days of fun. lazy to get out of the bad day. <br /> <br /> Can I take your order?
