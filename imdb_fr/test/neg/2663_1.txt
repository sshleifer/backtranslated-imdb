A friend gave me this movie because she loved it. I decided to finally watch. It was so long. I was waiting for the suspense but it never happened. I was still waiting for something to happen after the opening scenes, and it never happened. I stopped the movie and came back later. In fact, I forced myself to look at the rest of it in the hope that everything would be better. It got worse. I kept asking myself, who are these people? Do they have feelings? are they just robots? I'm glad I did not pay to see it or rent it. The end would have been better if Dutch had died as a result of his gunshot wound. At least we would have had some emotion on the part of the public. Or maybe not.
