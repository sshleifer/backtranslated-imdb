This season has been a real oomph, but in terms of creating stories to put us in the mood, season 6 is without highlights and spontaneity. <br /> <br /> This season has missed its usual soprano style, and if you cut out all the garbage that has been filled every episode this season, you'd probably have had 6 episodes of real stories. <br /> <br /> In parallel, stories like that of Pauly's mother, is it or not? was boring and had no other purpose than to further explore his character. I would have liked to see Bobby express his anger more against Pauly in this carnival episode, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> And that's it! These side stories had no real purpose and lacked finishing. If they will finish these stories in the next 6 episodes, I would prefer not to watch them, because it's not really interesting to see. <br /> <br /> Disappointing is too nice to say a word about this season and its finale.
