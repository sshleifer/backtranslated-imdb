Although it's better than most movies made for television, "Buried Alive" is nothing more than a banal revenge story. There are so many holes in the plot in this one that you wonder why the writers did not do a series of rewrites. The end has a nice twist, but it's barely believable. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is fantastic, as always, but Tim Matheson makes sure with a cheese lining reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's "The Shining". Do not bother with this one.
