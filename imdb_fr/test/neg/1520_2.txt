As a huge fan of the bottom series, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie coming out. I waited impatiently to laugh at a roller coaster ride ... alas. <br /> <br /> Where to go I think it's a good start to say that it's hardly the name of Richie and Eddie on our screens, since none of the jokes and linings they deliver if good are funny.I was still waiting for the first laugh after a good twenty minutes of viewing. Many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was filled with the bad times they were rehearsing and decided not to participate in the final cup. <br /> <br /> The set and the atmosphere around the film are dark and dark, which I suppose is good if they want to portray the "terrible" guest house that the 2 jesters try to escape, but for me, it simply puts a higher factor on a sad state of filming that should never have been created. <br /> <br /> The action, at times, is pathetic.Fenella Fielding is wasted because the mad Mrs. F oxfur and I saw Simon Pegg make much better outings. <br /> <br /> I would recommend Guest House Paradiso to anyone who is drunk blind because they could enjoy the terrible puns much more. But to any fan of background who has not seen this movie and s' expecting a real action richie and eddie you have been warned
