Normally, the BBC's Jane Austen productions are pretty good, but Northanger Abbey is just strange. What were they thinking? This film has little charm for Austen and ironically imitates the gothic novels that Austen mocked so marvelously. Not only that, the "gothic" sequences are sticky, excessive and frankly ridiculous. The actress playing Miss Morland is misinterpreted and has no obvious interest in getting the attention of an eligible single. Although I rather like the terrifying character of Peter Firth in the role of Mr. Tilney, he does not look like the novel at all, even when he delivers the dialogue right away. of the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney presented one of his executions terribly "ham". This movie was so weird and strange that I watched it again just to savor how terribly wrong it was.
