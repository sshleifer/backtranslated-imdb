I hope that Matt Dorff's original script for this was much better (there are signs: the dialogue should take place well before the big f / x scenes (to present the characters) that would make sense much earlier, is stuck later in time- The original script was perhaps longer, but maybe not - at least it stinks ... Every character is uninteresting and * everyone speaks explanatory passages as if he was speaking of God. "Secretary Abbot" of Dianne Wiest is awful, she explains things to her assistant (and us), in endless speeches that nobody would tell anyone, in real life (when she does not is not) explaining things to her assistant she already knows, her assistant explains things she already knows._ There are characters that are quite one-dimensional - the kind of company of forces perverse, the pilot who does not just shut up life and focus on his job. The "well-meaning" super-hacker of the energy company who can plant <br /> <br /> * at * everything * in Chicago (including phones) - and then gives the oh-no-what-have- I- speak (but not leave a back door?). The journalist of the crusade who abandons his principles overnight? The team leader of the power company who has given up his job in the middle of the worst crisis in Chicago since the fire - without consequences? Hospitals abandoned by doctors and nurses during the crisis (I'm not kidding, it's in the movie.) <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and it's filled with Hollywood moral clich√©s - usually women are good, men are evil, unless influenced by a woman (the ultimate goal is punk with the weapon - deprived of the influence of a woman, he becomes literally crazy); a diabolical and stupid act (like what the journalist did with hacker-bozo) is fine, provided you "think well". The evil men die, the evil capitalists die as horribly as possible, everyone lives (well, except Randy Quaid). And did I hear anyone say that the nuclear power plants had to be shut down because there was no electricity to run the security systems (think of that one)? <br /> <br /> There is a ray of sunshine (if you forgive the expression) - Randy Quaid basically plays his character of "Independence Day" (you know - "Hello boys - I'm baaaack!") - this time as a storm hunter with an infinite range of SUV and superdooper batteries for his camcorders. Nevertheless, they kill him - especially, it seems, so that the public understands that tornadoes are rather dangerous things (a little superficial, that.) <br /> <br /> Give this one a pass .
