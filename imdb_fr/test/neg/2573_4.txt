Since I'm not a big fan of Steven Seagal, I thought it was a great movie. It is obvious that his fans are very unhappy with this drama that lacks an abundance of martial arts and brute force. <br /> <br /> Gailard Sartain plays the role of a self-proclaimed patriotic leader of the militia in the face of the ATF. weapons violations. He goes with the intention of releasing a deadly virus. Seagal is a former CIA agent who has become a country doctor who is pressuring him to find an antidote to the deadly virus that has neutralized a small town. The natural American herbal remedy of his grandfather is in salvation. <br /> <br /> Remarkable appearances of L.Q. Jones, Camilla Belle and Silas Weir Mitchell. My favorite in this movie is Whitney Yellow Dress. It is stunning and seems to have all the assets to assume a more stimulating role. <br /> <br /> Despite the long-awaited end, this film was decent and could have been much more filmed.
