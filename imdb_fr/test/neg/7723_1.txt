I'm sorry, but they left the impression that these commandos had already fought zombies. But they certainly did not act as if they had seen a zombie before. Jumping and turning their backs like amateurs. Second, the characters are poorly written. The actors did their best with what they were given, I blame the bad writing and the bad staging. Finally and here is where the spoiler warnings are the highest. They lose the sample twice and the girl Jennifer Holland does not know if she was bitten or not. How stupid is it? Even if it hurts to get stung, you'd think you'd know it, plus a gallon of blood flowing from your body is a good clue. Dumb, the first movie had its flaws but it was re-observed, unlike the disaster of a movie, that I could barely cross once. I give to the HOUSE OF DEATHS 2: WITHOUT PEOPLE, ANY STUPIDITY THE CRAP-O-LANTERN
