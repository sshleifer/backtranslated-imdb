Interferencia begins when unemployed Martin Sanders (Andres Bagg) hears something strange on his phone, he hears a mysterious man talk to a prostitute named Diana & arrange the meeting with her. Shortly after, Martin reads a local newspaper and sees on the front page the story of a prostitute being murdered and thinks about what he has heard. Martin confides in his friends Laura (Virginia Lustig) and Aaron (Oliver Kolker) but they do not believe it. Shortly after, the same thing happens again, the phone call, the man, the prostitute and his death reported in the newspapers. Martin decides that he must find the murderer and put an end to his killing, but who is he? <br /> <br /> This Argentine production would have been shot in just eight days (why so long?) With a budget of about $ 3,000 (why so?) was written and directed by Sergio Esquenazi & I can not not believe some of the praiseworthy comments that Interferencia has on IMDb. Of the 195 notes I wrote, 113 people rated this pile of shit 10 out of 10, I'm sorry, but it's impossible for anyone to give a movie such a bad, literally perfect 10 out of 10 rating. a score for a movie on IMDb is corrected, so, it's true, honestly, I do not believe that if you show Interferencia to 195 people on average, more than 100 of them would judge it as absolutely perfect, absolutely impossible on Earth. User feedback is also incredibly positive, with IMDb users writing only comments for a movie, this one. The only user (except me) who actually wrote more than one comment gave him an impressive score, 1 out of 10, which seems to be fair. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but I would bet my life on the fact that most of these positive comments come from fake accounts set up solely to silence that piece of shit. Where do I start? How on earth can I adequately describe the severity of Interferencia? Intrigue is a mess that lives or dies from its terrible twists, while most twists turn a plot on its head and change the perspective of everything that happened before in an intelligent and relevant way. the first half of the film and makes it totally useless in a kind of "it did not happen" and the turn is so badly managed that it lets you ask more questions than answers. What made Martin crazy? Why did he imagine the phone calls? Why did he imagine a killer? Why did he imagine the titles of the newspaper? No explanation is given for Martin's behavior during the first hour of the film, there is just this absurd revelation that everything was in his head and that's all, that's all that is exposed. Then there is a plot about the woman and her lover disappeared from Martin before Martin, for unexplained reasons, starts killing his friends for no apparent reason. I'm sorry but Interferencia is so bad, so boring, so badly written and thought I honestly can not think of a positive thing to say about it. Sorry, but that's what I feel, quite simply. Interferencia is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's a complete conceptual and technical mess. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, Interferencia was hot in just eight days. To be honest, it does not seem to me at all. No, it's more like shooting in five days! The whole movie is horrible, Interferencia probably has the worst night shoot I've ever seen. It's as if no attempt was made to light up the scenes, it was as if the manufacturers had just gone into a dark room or a basement or anything and just turn the stage, that we can see something or not. Scenes that take place outside during the day have that awful unnatural blue-green hue for no apparent reason that just looks silly and gets more and more annoying. This strange hue is not repeated on indoor scenes, so they are quite discordant and remarkable. There is no real horror or fear, in fact, I would say that Interferencia is more a thriller than a horror. As for gore, there are two heads decapitated in a refrigerator, a knife is stuck in someone's mouth and nothing else. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb, its budget was about $ 3,000, making Interferencia one of the least budgeted films ever marketed? Some people think that just because a film is low budget, all reasonable viewing standards should be exceeded and we should accept any old shit, fake! To watch this on DVD, you will still have to pay a lot of money and I personally think we have the right to expect some kind of good product. If it can be published and congratulated as it deserves at the Oscars, we can all publish our holiday camcorder images (including embarrassing karaoke images and scenes of total darkness because we forgot to remove the lens cap ) and win the first prizes at the next Cannes Film Festival! The acting is appalling even though female star Virginia Lustig is actually pretty sexy and helps ease the pain of the last twenty minutes because she is very present. <br /> <br /> Interferencia is an absolutely terrible film, seriously, I beg you. you are not fooled by any false positive comments, there is no chance that anyone who is not involved in this project or who has an agenda gives the rating 9 or 10 out of 10. An amateur mess that is really awful to sit across. Sorry but that's how I see things, sometimes you have to be cruel to be nice ... we warned you!
