Two years after this short film, the last short film "Our Gang" was made. After seeing this, you wonder how it lasted so long. The quality of "Our Gang" has quickly dropped after the passage of Hal Roach to MGM, and this short film is a perfect example. The gags are all very funny and the last line of Froggy - being the happiest day of his life - paints a bad picture of what it is for him the rest of the time. A very bad example of film making.
