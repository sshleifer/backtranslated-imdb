I have not read the book of this and based on this adaptation, will not bother. I hated all the characters in this series - Miranda was slutty, selfish and miserable miserable through this dreadful dialogue, her sister was a real wet chicken and it was the worst representation of manic depression I've ever seen. I have a degree in psychology and it was not correct. In fact, until that was mentioned, I did not know that Troy was supposed to be bipolar - I thought he was a normal, slightly grumpy teenager. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this stupid show was David Tennant, whose brilliantly psychotic performance was the only thing that led me to look at the second half. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the writers and producers of this program have not conducted any research - Troy's mental problems are not very accurate, nor are the judicial analyzes involved in the end of the " twist "(and if you have not noticed you're a big model!) <br /> <br /> Immaculate garbage.
