Will there be, please, an end of exciting films dealing with social conflicts or other human disasters? Okay "Care" is about sexual abuse, "Care" is about perverts who abuse boys in a school and how disgusting that might be. If the film is badly written and made with bad actors, it remains a bad film. "Care" is a film that could have been, but is it because it was a film I did not know, but everything seemed so limited that it came out like a cheap movie that some women will see home and fathers who decide not to go to bed. There is so much unanswered in this film ... the relationship with his mother for example or the death of an abused boy we do not know anything about. "Care" should have been much better.
