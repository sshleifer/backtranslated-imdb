Always want to see a movie where Chuck Norris takes the bad guys aside and calmly discusses with them the mistakes they made until they see the light and, with tears in their eyes, they shake hands, correct together the wrongs of the world in peace and harmony and end forever the reign of evil in the world? <br /> <br /> Well, forget about that, Jocko. <br /> <br /> "Breaker! Breaker!" Instead, our kickoff is immediate as our truck driver, Chuck, heads his large platform in the backcountry town where his younger brother is detained by a corrupt judge and his men even more corrupt. <br /> <br /> Chuck's karate kicks, chops, slices, julienas and crumpled blows to every bad guy in sight until no malefactor dares to raise his head. Many fights take place in slow motion, for excitement, but just help the film fill the film for 86 minutes. <br /> <br /> And there's a lot of fighting here, leaving about 15 minutes for the development plot ... and that's about all the plot you get. But what were you waiting for: a calm discussion? <br /> <br /> A star for "Breaker! Breaker!"; and he's a little 10-4, good friend.
