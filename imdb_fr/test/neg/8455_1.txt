This movie has just been on HBO yesterday so I watched it. It was a mistake. I guess I got sucked and continued to look good even though it looked a lot like a train wreck, terrible, horrible, but anyway, you can not look away. shaudenfraud I guess! ; ). <br /> <br /> This is the story of a photo shoot for the models of some Caribbean islands. One by one, they are all murdered. We drink cleaning liquid, we blow ourselves on a waverunner, we go over a cliff ... so these are NOT accidents, but for some reason, the police are never called and nobody do not think they should perhaps "wrap" the shoot. and go home, not only in respect of the dead, but perhaps for fear of their own lives. No, they just keep filming because THAT is the most important. Forget the dead models, we have a magazine to produce! <br /> <br /> One of the subplots is the owner of Evil magazine, played by Lee Majors, his name is Rex. He is the most obvious suspect and every time a model is killed, he whirls his mustache and says "hey, I can not say it will not be good for the sale", mooo hoo hoo hoo ah ah ah ah ah. Another secondary intrigue is when it is revealed that Rex is one of Dad's baby models, but only when he learned about the baby's existence, he tried to convince the girl to abort. She did not do it, but she always wanted it on her side. <br /> <br /> They try to give you false clues and point to a guy named Raule, apparently because he's the only one who has an accent and looks "scary". <br /> <br /> At the very end (sorry to spoil, but this movie was released years ago, so if you have not seen it yet ...), one of the women was found face down, dead in the pool. It was the last straw !!!! Vanessa Angel, forget her characters her name comes to Rex with a gun, they fight, the gun goes off and now she's dead too! While she is lying on the floor, her partner tells her that, despite all this bad press, the magazine will be worth it and everything is his fault. He makes him sign the magazine. Once he's done! All the dead models come back to life and you discover that it was a complex trick to return to Rex. <br /> <br /> Oy! What a ridiculous movie. Like someone else said; if you want to see something like this, April Fool's is better!
