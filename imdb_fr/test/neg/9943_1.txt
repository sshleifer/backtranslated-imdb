I watched hundreds of kung-fu movies and I heard something positive about this movie, so I decided to try it. What I saw is one of the worst movie shows I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not help but think that the director wants to have all the muscles of Hong Kong in this film. Everyone exaggerates to the point of stupidity. Even Conan the Barbarian had a certain civility. This film has only half-evolved men shouting in all the scenes and stupid women who do not respect each other. The character of the narrator should have been killed for having sucked so much ... she really did not deserve to live to the end. The entire film was a melodramatic mess, with horrible play, bad staging, and bad action. They should have just renamed the movie "The Stupid Caveman to a Weapon with a Blade". Here's a question: why does a director use quick cuts for some action movies? Answer: To hide the shortcomings of the actors The film has tried so hard to show intensity, but it has become almost laughable. Stay away from this movie, you have every taste in kung-fu movies ... or any taste in movies.
