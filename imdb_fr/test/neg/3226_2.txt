Although this is one of John Cusack and Demi Moore's early films, it's an event that even hardcore fans can miss, unless they absolutely have to complete the collection. I have rare moments where I can handle Better Off Dead, but this film is finally worse. I'm just not a fan of Savage Steve Holland, and he shot both movies. So, if you do not like random comedy, random comedy and amateur animation, avoid this one. FYI even for Demi Moore fans: she can not sing and the synthesizers of the 80s did not save her. There are too many predictable twists and jokes too easy. I suppose if you want thoughtless entertainment or something that you can leave in the background and ignore while doing something productive, then go for it. Otherwise, do not watch this movie. If John Cusack (or Demi Moore) could not save him, you know it must be bad. They are the only reason I did not give this movie a 1.
