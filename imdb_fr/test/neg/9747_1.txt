Would it be too commonplace for me to create a criticism of just that I pronounce the word "STUPID" again and again? Probably. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Seriously. Mystery Science Theater 3000 contains better movies. I saw this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party while still in the room. Although it was actually * with friends * and at a * birthday party *, I had to leave. I had to leave. I apologized and went out. Fortunately, some parents were doing the same thing, so I did not look like a fool ... Anyway, this movie is awful. There is nothing to like about it. It is painfully slow (as in causing physical pain) slowly and unhealthily (causes literally vomiting) unhappy. You almost feel sorry for Tom Arnold, but you do not do it because you remember he was actually in the movie. It really hurts me to think about it. <br /> <br /> It was on TV a few months ago and I decided that I had to watch it all, just once. I then remembered why I went out and felt guilty about raising the ratings even by one viewer. The gags are not funny, the characters are not interesting. it's just a crazy mess of idiots and stupidity. <br /> <br /> There is a small crowd of eight-year-old kids who watched the movie when it came out and judged it "brilliant". If you think that having the face removed piece by piece with an ice cream scoop is brilliant, then go ahead, praise it. But if you have any dignity whatsoever, avoid this big bazaar STUPID. SCORE: 0/10 ... maybe a negative, actually.
