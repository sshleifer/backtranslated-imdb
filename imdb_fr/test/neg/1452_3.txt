It seems to me that I remember a lot of hype about this movie when it was released, but I had avoided seeing it over the years. I would have liked to wait longer. Maybe this movie was funny in 1988, I do not know. I was younger then, but it did not seem like the world was so different. Michelle Pfeiffer, as beautiful as she is, is never convincing. Mercedes Ruehl not only chews the landscape, but shoves it into his cheeks like a gerbil to keep it for later. Dean Stockwell is about as convincing as a gang leader that James Gandolfini is the main dancer of the Bolshoi. And Matthew Modine presented the most pronounced late puberty case I have ever seen. All in all, it's not serious enough to make you want to tear your eyes off with a ball of melon, but it's not that far.
