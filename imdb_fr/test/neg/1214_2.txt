Brooke Shields - far from her "Susandenton" homework - plays the role of a bitter divorcee who takes three girlfriends on a girls-only weekend in Palm Springs. The problem: Brooke is "unattached" and on the lookout, while her friends are all involved. Hence the title implications and the emotional repercussions of their "amoral" causes on weekends. <br /> <br /> Despite some laughter generated by Dan Cortese ("Victoria's Closet") and "MTV relations", Adam Corolla and Dr. Drew Pinsky, It's a dark thing for women only. D.B. Sweeney, Virginia Madsen and Jon Polito co-star.
