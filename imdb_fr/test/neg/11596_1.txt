So, Wynorski remakes Curse of the Komodo a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original by a group of odious ecologists / anti-capitalists. And he adds a cobra. Most of the film is devoted to listening to Pharisaical characters on the evil capitalist pigs, while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks about what happened on the island before their arrival . DNA experiments were conducted, creatures began to grow, people talked without pretending to be morally superior imbeciles, and so on. Needless to say, it would have been a much better movie if the flashbacks had been forgotten. the pious benefactors. Lest I forget, there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the holiest characters are removed one by one, but they probably represent less than 2% of the film. The main event against our main characters lasts about a minute and is just as exciting as watching the previews of the latest Dino-Crisis video game. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty bad overall, even for this kind of movie game. Half of the actors seem more concerned with pronouncing each last syllable of each word than talking about their dialogue in a credible way. <br /> <br /> In fact, I did it until the end, but it's a I would have liked to be able to record these movies and watch them later, because many parts have to be quickly transferred. Overall, I give this effort a star, it contains absolutely no elements that make a film B fun to watch. It's a sad day when we can honestly say that the filmmakers could have learned a thing or two by watching Boa against Python.
