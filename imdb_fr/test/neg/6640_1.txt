So I turned to HBO, I thought there would be quality movies and I saw that. Carrot Top is so funny that it's nauseating to watch. I have seen some funny movies, but I find this one so impossible to watch, because Carrot Top seems to find it hilarious. Watching this film is like watching a movie designed for 5-year-olds with excessive madness, overbidding excesses filled with stupid jokes that only a 4-year-old would appreciate. <br /> What's amazing is how talented actors have actually signed up for this project, such as Larry Miller and Emmet Walsh. If you've ever seen the absolutely horrible ads of MCI's Carrot Top (or anything else), it's more or less the same, just worse. It's a slapstick festival that wastes a high budget and could have done something to save the homeless ... anything but that. I'm not sure it's in the bottom 50 of all time, but for the $ 10 million spent, it's a shame.
