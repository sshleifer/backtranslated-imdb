You know that this film is in serious trouble when the role of BEST actor is the supporting role played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Although this is still relatively early in his career and he is not the best actor, compared to Brigitte Nielsen, it is Sir John Gielgud. In fact, this film proves that the only reason she caught the attention was her breasts and her involvement in the incredibly self-destructive footballer, Mark Gastineau. So, instead of being her "group movie," this movie and a Beverly Hills Cop movie are about as high as she has been in her career. It was also obvious that the financial assistants have abandoned this film too, because the secondary distribution (except Arnold) is rather lame and the scenario is dull, dull, dull. Fans looking for another film from CONAN would probably be very disappointed by this slow and uninvolved movie.
