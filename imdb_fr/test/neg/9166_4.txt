Something of a disappointment. Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union leader of Roxton Garments in New York. His partner in the company is killed when an elevator is unleashed and plunges twenty-seven floors down the pit in the scariest scene of the film. <br /> <br /> Cobb does not know it or does not know it. The author of this murder is Richard Boone, who protects the company against union organizers. <br /> <br /> Cobb's son, Kerwin Mathews, returns from Europe, determined to learn the business and join us. his father in running a clean store. He is shocked - shocked! - learn that Boone has tarnished union members and killed some who have become irreparably irritating. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is one of the organizers who is killed by a couple of Boone henchmen, led by Wesley Addy. Loggia leaves behind a widow, Gia Scala, with whom Mathews, naturally and with elegance, gets up. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cobb pays his self-deception, Addy and Boone get their fair dessert, and the Mathews winds with the succulent Scala, which gave its name to an opera. <br /> <br /> There is no spark in any line of dialogue. Some lines are stolen textually in "On the waterfront" - "pistoleros", "you speak to you immediately in the grave". The plot is schematic and absolutely no surprises. The management of Vincent Sherman is pedestrian. The photography is flat, but there are some pretty pictures of the streets of New York. <br /> <br /> Lee J. Cobb can play. In this case, it must have been easy for him as he plays Johnny Friendly from "On the Waterfront", but this time with a soft heart. Richard Boone can also act. Joseph Wiseman, in a small part, does a good job. Gia Scala marks her mark, says what the script requires and does what the director tells her. A beautiful woman, her life deteriorated early. The director and the photographer are doing a good job on Wesley Addy. He has white hair, a whitened face, the eyes of a glacial lake, and he is sometimes caught through a wide-angle lens to turn his surprisingly fleshy lips into those of a parasitic fish. I do not see him as a low-level muscular man. He and Boone should have changed roles. Harold J. Stone is a trustworthy man, though he is forced to be more "Italian", like Tony, than it naturally comes to him. No one else in something that looks like a major part is just mediocre, and some performers do not even clear that bar. Kerwin Mathews may be a good guy in real life, but he is stealthily sterile and part of national drama on television in the afternoon. <br /> <br /> A great title, evoking intrigue and shadows. Some good people in the casting. Potentially explosive presentation of a company that no one knows anything about but deals in megabucks. <br /> <br /> And everything happens like that.
