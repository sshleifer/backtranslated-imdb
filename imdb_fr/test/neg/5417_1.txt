Sensational. I thought Eskimo Limon was the most horrible and embarrassing first sex movie of all time. But I had forgotten that Germany was still trying to compete. In this case, the famous German film producer Bernd Eichinger managed to produce even worse shit. Harte Jungs is stupid, not very credible and predictable, and especially not funny. It is almost a tragedy that so many children have gone to Germany to see this (and, I am afraid, also for Austria). <br /> <br /> Tobias Schenke, 19, looks too good to be 15 years old, and her character is too stupid to be true. Schenke does his best to make us believe that he knows nothing about sex, but it's useless. Harte Jungs seems to have been made by someone who looked at Al Bundy and took it too seriously. <br /> <br /> The best actors of the film are Sissi Perlinger and Stefan Jürgens, who interpret the semi-liberal parents of Schenke. Perlinger and Jürgens are comedians who are not particularly good at cinema. Yet, their performances are the "best" and "the funniest" in comparison. <br /> <br /> A complete failure.
