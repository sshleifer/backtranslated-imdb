It must be the worst show I have ever seen. I've always loved Chuck Norris in Movies, but why do we have to make these series politically correct by adding a black kick that is as threatening as Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker. I also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy and make it interesting? I know an African-American who looks like this guy Trivette and who gets kicked once a week, he is very confident. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris is this man and he deserves all the congratulations he receives, I think. this show started well, but lost speed over time <br /> <br /> They should have gotten rid of the Chucks kick
