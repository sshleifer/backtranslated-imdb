I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was a fun caper film and was shocked to discover a wrong direction, awkward dialogues, a poor pace, sticky briefs without motivation and a general rudeness that permeated the film. Just not funny! The decorations seemed cheap, and the costumes of the excellent Donfeld, usually excellent, are garish and entertaining. Even the title song is annoying. The characters in the children's books do not represent the married couple whose life is upset when they lose their job. For a film that seems to target the injustice of social protection and unemployment systems, filmmakers do not hesitate to be unfair themselves, allowing Hispanic stereotypes, blacks and gays played at such a cruel level. The look of the movie looks like any episode of Love American Style. It's not a compliment. The fashion of the seventies teeming in this world of the theft of white-collar which gives only an air improbable to all the situations. Apart from a clever initial idea and two talented stars in Jane Fonda and George Segal, this obsolete social commentary is proving to be forced and mean-spirited to minorities, especially homosexuals. If you want a better caper movie, it's better to play in The Hot Rock with George Segal and Robert Redford or in What's Up Doc with Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. Now it's funny!
