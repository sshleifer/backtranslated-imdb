There seems to be a lot of fans of this film here, but I found it boring, slow, winding and useless. And I watch and enjoy a lot of art and freelance movies, so I did not expect an action movie. I did not sympathize with any of the characters. The original guy from the countryside was a bad customer and did not seem to have much difficulty finding a job. His relative in Istanbul was moody and emotionally closed. <br /> <br /> In an interview on the DVD, the director explains that the film describes a current situation in Turkey: the person who goes to the countryside because there is no work and who comes to Istanbul and stays with his loved ones while trying to find work. It's interesting in itself, but the film was not.
