Another sadistic and ultra-seedy revenge movie of the late 70's or early 80's? Wes Craven has certainly launched a popular trend with his "last house on the left", although "Terror Express" looks more like a scam of other scams, like "I Spit on your Grave" and especially "Night Train Murders". In terms of history, this film has absolutely nothing new to offer and the only thing left to do for the director Ferdinando Baldi is therefore to multiply by thousand the decisive factor! It's actually just a soft core porn movie that gets a little rough towards the end. On the night train from Rome are three desperately foolish losers who are unleashed. They provoke male travelers and sexually harass females. Things get a little out of control and an itinerant inmate comes to the rescue of a prostitute who continues to be screwed up by the three. It's a very docile film and there was not even enough money to buy a few bags of fake blood. This type of movie is generally infamous for brutal rape sequences and discriminatory behavior towards women, but sex in "Terror Express" is not at all disturbing. On the contrary, these "rapists" spend more time to please their victims orally than to get them themselves! The music is great, the dialogues are involuntarily hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous I've ever seen. The bad guys are idiots and the passengers on the train are so still they seem to be part of the set. If you like your exploitation as sordid as possible, here is your movie. However, your bloodlust and controversy will certainly not be alleviated. "Terror Express" should be part of the pornography section of video libraries.
