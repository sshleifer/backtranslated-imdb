I recently bent 8 ?? by going to see this film in the cinema. It was a waste of time and the only feeling that you are leaving the theater is a little nauseous of all this disgusting social pornography. <br /> <br /> It could have been interesting if it had had a rather absurd twist, but it was just horrible with maybe one or two scenes that could have been shot and shot in very nice short films . . <br /> <br /> Another thing I thought about is the way the director uses all the stereotypes of Finish as characters. It is quite extraordinary to see how a Finnish director can make a film with the worst stereotypes of his own nationality. It was sad to sit down and hear the audience sit and laugh at things that seemed typical of Finland, but that usually make fun of people.
