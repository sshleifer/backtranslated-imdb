Luchino Visconti, the artist with the sword. Courage should be the first word associated with his entire album. Movie. Theater. The music. Artistic, cultural, personal revolutions. A legacy with powerful consequences and endless ramifications. He introduced neorealism through the work of the American novelist James Cain in "Ossesione". He gave Anna Magnani the most extraordinary plans of her career. He gave us Alain Delon and Maria Callas. But the last word about his life and work lies in the talents of a certain Adam Low and the voice of Helmut Berger. What a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> For those interested, a 61-minute documentary by director Carlo Lizzani (a man who really knew Visconti) is called LUCHINO VISCONTI A PORTRAIT. It was released on DVD distributed by Image Entertainment
