The Girl in Lovers' Lane: 3 of 10: The homoerotic subtext in the movies is a well-known phenomenon. Film schools have published numerous memoirs on hidden sub-texts of films like Top Gun and Spartacus. The Girl in Lover's Lane certainly corresponds to the homoerotic trope. In fact, it is so blatant and disproportionate that even MST3K, who rarely notes such things in their riffing, just can not avoid it. <br /> <br /> The film talks about two dinghies. One of the rich children (Lowell Brown) who runs away from home with a hundred dollars and does not know the street, the other is a professional tramp (Brett Halsey). The tramp rescues the kid from a gang of thugs and they find themselves in a small town consisting of a restaurant, a billiard room and a brothel. Our waitress is examined a second time by the waitress of the diner (Joyce Meadows in the role of the titular girl in Lovers Lane), who clearly passed the age of the mouth and whose only other potential is the insolent Jack Elam who makes an impression of Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> On the surface, this seems to be a strange film for the MST3K treatment. While the actors are too old for the characters they play, the acting is actually quite good with Brett Halsey and Jack Elam giving solid performances. The story is light, but the material The Robot Vs. Aztec Mummy and production values ​​are rather economical, but relatively competent. <br /> <br /> It's the strange Batman and his homosexual sub-currents that make this film hideous and hilarious. Halsey's main objections to children's attempts to get fucked in the brothel are hilarious, her inability to engage with the waitress (or at least pass the first goal) is revealing, and dozens of looks between him and the child; a hand on the shoulder, sleeping arrangements, dates with the girl so that the kid and he can shave. It does not need to be Freud to understand this underlying current.
