Having no idea of ​​the subject of this film, but since John Leguizamo appeared there, we decided to watch it. Well, it turned out that it was not the wisest decision. In fact, as another comment on this forum says, we were embarrassed for the actors who participated in this film. <br /> <br /> Although the film is by no means horrible, it makes no sense. The exceptional performance of William Baldwin does not help the situation either. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserves better. The fundamental problem, it seems that the film is a project that started with good intentions by doing a little comedy and the leaders ran out of ideas along the way. The result is an uneven film.
