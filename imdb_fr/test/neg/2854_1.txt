Before watching this film (at a screening attended by the director herself), we learned that this film won the short film award at Galway Film Fleadh. This result will give filmmakers hope that everyone can do better than that! <br /> <br /> How can nobody notice Donnie Darko's flagrant scam in what I'll never know. The film is pure drivel, the cardboard acting, the dialogue ridiculous and the end just flat! The only amount of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this garbage was to comment out loud how awful it was in front of the manager! Yes, it was mean, but liberating! <br /> <br /> At least, making Irish movies can not go lower!
