First, the title of Mexican Werewolf in Texas is misleading, as many have pointed out. In fact, this is El Chupacabra, who is a creature like a werewolf, but is by no means identical. <br /> <br /> Production and publishing are simply void. When it was over, I probably could not give a very precise description of exactly what the Chupacabra looked like, because every time it happened in a scene (despite one or two exceptions), the camera became very fragile and could see that face of the monster clearly. The special effects were ridiculously bad, but be prepared for a low budget horror movie. <br /> <br /> Parallel to the terrible production come the bad actors. Now, a couple gives quite plausible representations (Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but there are also the bad actors (all the others), who seemed to have no emotion at the death of the people. Then there is the absolutely terrible actor (Sara Erikson), who gives one of the 2 worst performances I have ever seen in a movie. I mean, my god, she was incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> The plot was very simple. Basically, a Chupacabra is in a small Texas town killing locals and a group of teenagers are trying to stop him. However, even with the plot so simple, some intrigue holes managed to escape. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is horrible. However, if you are looking for a movie to make fun of and laugh with your friends one night, it would be a very good choice. My friends and I had a good time watching this. Probably the second worst movie I have ever seen, 1/10. Terrible.
