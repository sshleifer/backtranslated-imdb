What a sad surprise. <br /> <br /> As an unconditional fan of the original series (starring Don Adams), I was really looking forward to seeing that. Poor fool me. It's more silly and deadly cerebral than the buttocks of a monkey. <br /> <br /> To say that it was bad would be a serious understatement. This is / was the worst movie (well the first 30 minutes of a movie) I've seen for a long time. I could not stand more than the first half hour, preferring to watch my hard drive get defragmented. <br /> <br /> I can tolerate evil ... the harm is O.K., sometimes even cute. BUT with artificial Hollywood shit (and it must be the worst for many years), I will not put it. This film is a flagrant insult to the collective intelligence of humanity! My five year old daughter could have written better - and she is not even disconcerting !!! I'm really tempted to try to look at the rest, but I'm afraid I have better things to do ... like making pizza dough and watching it get up. <br /> <br /> What a sad disappointment. No ... I'm screwed! What a scam! As Mel Brookes once said, "A piece of shirt!"
