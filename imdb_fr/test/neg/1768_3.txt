A fast-paced frenzy / horror adventure that is only too memorable for (a) the beautiful wandering Mathilda May naked in chaos and (b) for a terrible price defeat. It has some slightly horrible effects and surprising moments, as well as unintentionally amusing scenes, but it's mostly a waste of time.
