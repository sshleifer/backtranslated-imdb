Why are not there good reviews? Because this movie is hysterically bad. <br /> <br /> Located in a Japanese prison camp during the Second World War, we have Jim Brown for heroes, who supports an incredibly incredible racist officer, and an equally hysterical way the Japanese officers have black noses in the character of Jim Brown. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst film these actors have ever done. Stereotypes abound not only, but they dominate this movie. The music of the sixties and seventies is perhaps the best in the film, perhaps because it has nothing to do with the film. <br /> <br /> It's hard even to sit down and enjoy such stupid fun. This film is even more racist than the message of racism it tries to convey. And believe me, I was alive in the seventies and we thought that such bullshit was just as stupid. It was never popular.
