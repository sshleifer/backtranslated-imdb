I was wondering what led the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival to include this film in their program. I guess they had to agree with the other people who watched this movie. For me, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It starts with a bad script, full of holes, and a dialogue so unlikely that it is embarrassing. Ideas are introduced and then abandoned without development. The acting game left me totally cold and uninvolved. The decoration of the decor was appropriate at the time, but the decorator's nightmare. The characters could only love this house if their previous homes had been horrible. The attic gave the impression that the objects had been thrown into the scene, without any attempt to create the appearance of a real granary that had been filled with garbage over the years. The photograph was plumbed and lacked variety. Save your money for something worthwhile.
