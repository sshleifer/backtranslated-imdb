It really surprised me that someone would take so much time to evaluate such a bad movie. The beginning (of the film) contained some truth. The partisan "AF" was launched in 1943 when two communist pilots of the Croatian AF Ustashi deserted, accompanied by their observers, to Breguet 19 and Potez 33, respectively. The aircraft witnessed manual bombing and manual bombing, but did not last very long. One crewmember was killed and the other survived, the pilot having been killed later while flying a Spitfire Vc. The actual squadrons of partisans were created when the RAF detached two of its (Yugoslav) squadrons from Spitfire Vc and Hurricane IIc, held respectively by pilots of the former Royal Yugoslav Air Force, and assigned them to to Tito's forces on the island of Vis. Even those were never engaged in air-to-air activities, but only for ground support. So the film was a giant cow manure, it's the least we can say, and the lowest point for his director, otherwise quite bad. By a whim of fate, I was present when shooting the last sequence of the film, when dozens of German aircraft were destroyed (522 Yugoslav training devices, also used in flight sequences) on the airport Mostar. The pyrotechnics were impressive and the scotch abundantly served by the film crew was even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie and was often joked about the contemporary audience.
