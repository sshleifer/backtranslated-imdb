This movie is funny if you are the gentleman who sat in three rows behind me (repeating every punch, laughing when there were no gags on the screen and emitting a "gritty haaaa" to every scene involving a computer or mobile device). <br /> <br /> For all the others, it's a mean, sloppy "comedy". The film rigorously follows the formula of the latest films "Scary Movie", as well as "Epic Movie" and "Meet the Spartans", but without the flood of references of the heartless pop culture that made the latter two so irritating. Nevertheless, the uproar in the world of intellectuals and peace advocates clearly shows that the film knows its audience: people who envy brains. "Superhero Movie" is particularly and consistently mean to Stephen Hawking, portraying him as a drug addict hungry for sex and using his disability as a way to deceive. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on "Spider-Man". with "Batman Begins" and "X-Men" for the sole purpose of delivering a physical comedy. Much of the film is great, but not invigorating or interesting. The oldest gag is a joke of feast, and the writers seem to believe that the fact of bringing up the main character in stark piles of fake animal poop automatically animates a repetition of the spider bite scene of " Spiderman". Perhaps the only reducing characteristic of this characteristic is its energy, notably absent in other recent parodies. Filmmakers act as if they are doing something new, and the audience can feel the influence of the actors' rebound on the screen. An extremely short length (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the zest of the presentation make "Superhero Movie" tolerable rather than horrible.
