I managed to see that in what I thought would be the second screening in the world, just days after it opened at the Dublin International Film Festival. As I watched another film two nights later at the same theater, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the actors and the film crew at another promotional projection of the studs. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was bitterly disappointed by the movie. I did not expect a masterpiece at all, but what was presented to me did not include all the crucial elements of the genre in which he had set himself. Before continuing, two things, I accept the fact that some filmmakers love to subvert generic expectations, this is simply not the case. Secondly, I know that she was relying on a play (which I had not read but that we knew it was not a shimmering work), but that does not excuse the huge narrative problems who are going through the film. /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the script, forget it was based on a play. As a sports comedy, it just does not work, the inflexible team trying to win a football cup, few games are shown (when they are, it's very short) and we have no satisfaction because of their athletic performance. Having read so far, you might assume that this is not a strict sports film, but a psychological study of the relationship between a manager's "quack" and his desperate team. It certainly does not achieve that goal, I'm not even sure it was intended. Any attempt to shed light on the story of one of the characters is banal and peripheral. Overall, I found the scenario missing in many ways. <br /> <br /> I think that the performances and the music were good and that, technically, the film was well done. But aside from these points, which should be expected from any Irish film at this point, I left the theater very disappointed. <br /> <br /> My judgment may seem severe but I think there is hope for a strong Irish national in the near future, which does not support this argument. As Studs became a Dublin Cineworld recommended film (I was part of the audience at this screening), most people would seem to disagree with me, which means that you should probably make your own judgment of the film.
