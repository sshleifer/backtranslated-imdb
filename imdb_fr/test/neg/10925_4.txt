I mean really, really, really high and this movie has a chance of entertainment. I do not mean normal high, I mean the top where to read the phone book would have scrambled you. otherwise, save time and do something more constructive, like banging your head against a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence. A total waste of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny and Ham Master Shatner) and exactly the kind of bullshit they deserve (the myriad of rappers who insist on making movies). Not without laughing (again, chemical help is crucial) and certainly not without offense politically too sensitive (which I'm still in favor of), but that is not worth the time of your life.
