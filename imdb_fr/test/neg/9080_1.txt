It's one of the few movies - maybe the only one - that has really haunted me for years. It was the first time I saw people being tortured, so much so that blood ran out to them when they clenched their teeth and shouted, etc. It was brutal; the worst thing I have ever seen on the film. <br /> <br /> Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the most evil characters I've ever seen in a film, and I've seen thousands. He was so sadistic that I would never watch this movie again and I would not recommend it either. He makes Hannibal Lecter look like Mr. Rogers. If seeing tortured people is not your idea of ​​fun, then avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> I know there are a lot of sick people, many of whom are professional movie critics, who have probably enjoyed this sordid. , story of sick. Anyway, it's a movie "B", with a stupid dialogue and a wooden interpretation of Charles Bronson. This is not one of his best efforts. Even if it were, there are so many horrible scenes that you would not want to watch. Trust me for that shot there.
