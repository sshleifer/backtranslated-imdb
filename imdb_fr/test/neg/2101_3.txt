By praising this, I did not expect to be blown away. In fact, I knew it was going to be horrible. It was just to see how horrible it was. That's what comes with a low-budget horror. <br /> <br /> "Snakes On A Train", not to be confused with the serpentine summer blockbuster "Snakes On A Plane" with Samuel L. Jackson, tells the story of a woman who is put under a curse maya that causes snakes to hatch and devours them from within. His only hope of survival lies in a shaman who lives on the other side of the border. She and her companion hide in a train bound for Los Angelas. Add a few passengers and hilarity ensues. <br /> <br /> When you think about it, the story is not half bad. Is not half good either. <br /> <br /> The action in this film rivals that of a Sci-Fi Original, if not worse. Believe me, it's horrible. Snakes were another problem. I guess they were supposed to be rots, but most of what you get are mostly harmless garden snakes that do not attack anything and there's that rattling sound effect that gets really annoying. <br /> <br /> The gore effects on the other side, even if they were not at the Tom Savini level, they were actually quite good. <br /> <br /> And something else, the end alone makes up for the rest of the movie. I will not talk about it here, so you will have to rent it and see for yourself.
