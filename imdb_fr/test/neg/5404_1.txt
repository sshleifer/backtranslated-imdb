I have very little to add to what all the other commentators have already made clearer! This film is awful! Beyond the horror ... In fact, they are so unbearable that they have not yet found a term to describe the atrocity that is the "skeleton man". If you expect your movies to have a minimum of logic and intrigue, stay as far as humanly possible. Of course, tons of people are killed by this puppet-skeleton wearing a ridiculous cape, but no one ever cares to explain correctly what he is, where he comes from or why he is so angry at the world. It looks like a cross between Skeletor of "Masters of the Universe" and the rider of "Sleepy Hollow" and runs in a sort of lost desert. The setting of "Skeleton Man" is another totally delayed aspect! For almost half an hour, I assumed that the film had taken place on a small isolated island, but that it was simply playing on the continent, where fanciful highways crossed the forest and where the power stations were located at the end of the wood! Huh? Why does everyone pretend to be trapped when there is a million escape routes? Anyway, after a few totally random assassinations, a special commando team, led by poor Michael Rooker, arrives to hunt a monster they do not know anything about. It's really hilarious to see how each member of this team comes in as an expert in a particular area (we have a sniper specialist, a tracking genius, an exercise instructor, etc.), but they all die before one of them is able to do it. to demonstrate their supposedly mastered skills! The gods of horror must really hate Casper Van Dien, because he is present again, representing a heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, crashes on the road, but is catapulted back into the woods for to die there. That makes sense ... In addition, the characters steal cool liners in "Predator", the bonehead horse is constantly changing color, the helicopters are shot down with a bow & arrow, ordinary bullets blow up the trees and Totally futile flashbacks in Vietnam haunt Michael Rooker. I say we combine all our strengths and vote for this pathetic move in the top 100 IMDb down as soon as possible!
