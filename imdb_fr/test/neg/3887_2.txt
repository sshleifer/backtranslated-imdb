It is impossible to understand all that the producers of this appalling adaptation have attempted to do. <br /> <br /> A group of actors of high quality, in the main cast (with some notable exceptions), which gives very good performances. Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and Joanna Lumley as Diana are also talented. All are doing well with the scripts they have been given. <br /> <br /> That's good. The average would include sets. Nancherrow does not look like the house described in the book, although the house they use for the Dower House strangely resembles them. It is obvious that the Dower House is much too big. In the final sections, the authors decided to bring the whole story back to the UK, probably to save money, although with a little imagination, there is no doubt that they could have recreated Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Let's go now to the worst. . The scenario It is difficult to find words to condemn it. Edward does not die in the Battle of Britain but survives, blinded. He makes a brief appearance then commits suicide - why? Loveday has gone from being a woman totally in love with Gus to the wife of a sensible farmer who can give up the love of her life with barely a tear (less emotional than Brief Encounter). Gus, a man adored and passionately in love, is ready to give up his love without complaining. Walter (Mudge in the book) goes from a superficial unfaithful husband to a devoted family man. Jess is transformed into a psychologically disturbed young woman who does not want to talk. Aunt Biddy still has an alcohol problem, but now without any justification. Dower House is occupied by the military without any obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess, who fears armed soldiers. Although Miss Mortimer's breasts were absolutely delicious, I could not see how their display had made the conspiracy advance several times. The deliciously named Nettlebed becomes the banal Dobson. The word limit prevents me from continuing the list. <br /> <br /> There is a sequel (which I lost interest in watching after this nonsense) and I wonder if the changes were made to create the next story. It is hard to imagine that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of his book; it likely lost control when the rights were purchased.
