Once upon a time there was a great American movie. What a combination of horror and comedy with equal sensations. This film had an intelligent direction. Revolutionary special effects and superb comedies and serious actors. It was titled "An American Werewolf in London". Sixteen years later, the long-awaited sequel was finally pinned to a bulletin board outside your local theater. He would surely have at least some of the thrills of the original. Think again. "An American werewolf in Paris" is an incomprehensible mess from start to finish. The problems begin with the ruler. Tom Everett Scott's performance is stiff and tiring. From the start, he seems to want to prove that all young people are mere age. In his defense, not even a seasoned Shakespearean thespian could have made a good performance of the juvenile and spiritless dialogue. At one point, one of Scott's dead friends, whose soul is bound to travel the Earth after being cut off by one of the werewolves, is finally able to leave for life after death. He then rushes to Scott and his friends. 'Ok guys, see you soon.' What a memorable farewell. Julie Delphy soon presents herself as Scott's mysterious interest in love for Europe. Basically, it's a French who plays French. It's not really exaggerated. But all this stupidity is not even the most disappointing thing about the movie. The special effects, which are part of the great original movie, are far in this flop. Werewolves look like cartoons. And no matter how much you carve a cartoon with tense muscles of lycanthropes. It's always hard to be afraid of a cartoon. Instead, the American gang on vacation, led by the very weak Scott, continues to look for excuses to return to the werewolf's catacomb den. Here, it is much easier for this incompetent team of special effects to keep computer-enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under cover of darkness. Some have said that if you do not consider this film as a sequel, it is not so bad in comparison. I do not agree, this film can not be autonomous and is even more shameful compared to the brilliant original. If he does not want to be seen as a sequel, he should not have borrowed much of the title from the 1981 film. I do not care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you worshiped the American werewolf in London. as I did myself. It's just not worth wasting your time. 'Ok guys, see you soon.' Terrible. 3 out of 10 possible
