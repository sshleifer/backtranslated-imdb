Very strange, it seems to me a very average film, if not slightly less. It's brilliantly shot but, with the performance of R. Lee Ermey, it's pretty much the only redemptive aspect I've found in the film that consists of two separate parts. <br /> <br /> The first part covers basic marine training which, after seeing it in 2007, appears as something that I've seen millions of times before in dozens of other movies and series and that is not particularly captivating. After 30 minutes, I had the idea and wished they could continue. The sergeant instructor is about the only credible character while everyone seems to be only cardboard cut. The acting is incredibly haggard and the script is devoid of interesting and consists of little more than the sergeant's cries. The boys succeed in training and find themselves in Vietnam. Oh, and the big nutty shoots the sergeant (what a surprise ...), probably mistakenly thinking he was actually the scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> An hour has passed and there is nothing worthy of mention. Nothing ... <br /> <br /> Then we have the Vietnam part. <br /> <br /> It begins with a bunk scene where the Stars and Stripes reporters get bored and have a little chat to pass the time. At first I thought they were reproducing scenes from old movies, it sounded pretty bad. But no, they were actually mumbling their lines of script. Then the camp is besieged. About twenty Vietcong enter the camp through the main gate. Too bad for them, they are dropped like flies because they are content to go to several shooting positions with no way to cover themselves. Is this behavior normal? Were the Vietnamese all suicidal? If so, how is it that the United States did not win this war in the first two months of their engagement? The rest of the film continues with war scenes even more completely illogical. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot is meaningless. None of the characters inspires much sympathy and the story is frankly rather without history. It shows a bit more than war reporters who associate with a platoon with guys who get shot at because they are disobedient morons and who also seem to think that a gaping hole in a wall will protect you from balls. <br /> <What was the message of this movie..What people died in Vietnam? That people are animals in war situations? What if you want to get rid of really stupid people, you send them in a war zone? Or that in Vietnam, concrete can really burn? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if this movie deserves an 8.3, then Apocalypse Now deserves a 38.3 <br /> <br /> 5/10
