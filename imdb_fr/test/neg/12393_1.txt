I was shocked that there were 18 pages of good reviews. It must be one of the worst movies, especially since it was recommended. I must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie did worse: he tried so hard to be smart that it hurt me to watch him. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is comparable to that of audition week on American Idol. You look because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew that this movie did not have bad actors. So, how would it be fun to have good singers trying to convince you that they should never approach an American Idol test? It would be useless since this movie was. <br /> <br /> The use of improvisation is overestimated. We have all been in this setting where a group of friends is starting and everyone is crying with tears in their eyes. I think it's improvisation. Improvisation can not be activated simply because the camera is running as the film proves. If you like the improvisational show organized by Drew Carey, you will surely love this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, the jokes were mediocre, the improvisation was sophomoric and the overprint of Guest and company was charming. ..and these are my compliments of this drivel. If a guy playing the trumpet AND the kettle at the same time makes you laugh, it's okay. For me, I prefer things more heady like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". <br /> <br /> But remember, I think SNL lost his humor in the 1980s, so maybe you'll like that G humor I was still waiting for a person to identify himself as guardian of the zoo and then tell us that there was no zoo in town. This is the humor you can expect. <br /> <br /> My only wish was to be able to give this assessment a negative rating.
