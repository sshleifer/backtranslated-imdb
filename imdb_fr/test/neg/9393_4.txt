If you are a North American "tourist" looking for a "trap", this is it. Was it "Trading Spaces visit TOSCANY?" There were far too many stereotypes. Little attention has been paid to character development and plot. YAWNING. The highlight of the film: the flag throwing. Poor man! I thought he was going to lose an eye!
