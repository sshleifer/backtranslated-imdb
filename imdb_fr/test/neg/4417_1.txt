For me, this is a case that you will never understand if you did not live it .. so read this to know why would I have such unlimited anger? <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot about (Bruce Lee) .. my dad loved him .. my mother who hated every minor blow of love loved her! and how she speaks so far of her "The Big Boss", aka "Fists of Fury", and the experience of watching him at the 1973 Egyptian cinema with all the gigantic success .. besides, I watched a real good movie about him (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story - 1993) .. so I ended up crying: where are your Bruce movies? !! <br /> <br /> I went to the video store .. and it was stupid to move .. (you'll know why!) .. and waw .. I found a lot of Bruce Lee movies .. I picked one named (Bruce Lee in New Guinea) <br /> <br /> I made myself alone and looked at that one .. OH GOD please forgive your servant .. I hurt myself but without any intentional decision .. I would not do if I knew that its harm was harmful !! its mythical level of hidosity !! <br /> <br /> After that, I did not understand at all what mattered to Bruce Lee as a great immortal star ??? .. why would anyone care if he is here or there .. this hero I looked!) Is not this talent and not this genius and of course is not so sexy ??? <br /> <br /> Until my father sees this star and he asks me to take a break at one of his close-ups and after he has examined his face a little .. he told me in a very definitive way "it's not Bruce Lee"! so I got too confused to ask: who is this idiot guy anyway ?? !! <br /> <br /> It was in 2001 .. 2 years after my first entry in the IMDb database .. so I immediately tended to know who the heck was this man .. and I discovered the truth .. it's not Bruce Lee .. No my dear friends .. it's Bruce Li !!! <br /> <br /> And what a huge difference ... so huge !! I just want to know who can love this bad clone ?? Or God forbid .. love his repulsive movies .. I watched 2 and I could not bear to finish the third! <br /> <br /> After that, I ignored all of our video-video stores because that's his cheap ruse (write on the posters THAT'S Bruce Lee!) and I Have the original .. The one and only Bruce Lee who is such a big star and Oh BOY, he certainly had the right to immortality ... and no less.
