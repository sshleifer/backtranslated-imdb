I'm still not sure what the hell is talking about this movie. I guess the boy was scared to go blind and started to imagine all kinds of strange things. that does not explain why he wanted to kill his new little brother, however, nor the relentless boredom found in this movie. While watching this movie, you will want to be blind so you do not have to see this experience in vain. skip this pile to steam and opt for something else in the video store ..... nothing else.
