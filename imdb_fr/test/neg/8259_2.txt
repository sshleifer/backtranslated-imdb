What a beautiful distribution and what a pathetic attempt at film. The script is full of holes from beginning to end. Incoherent, not cohesive ... completely ridiculous. One of the most talented and beautiful actresses in the world (and I'm talking about Nastassja Kinski) does not have a memorable line here. Worse still, she would dye her hair halfway through the movie, but it's obvious she's just wearing a cheap black wig bought at a drag queen costume store. The best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building in which the main actor Peter Coyote lives. Fairuza Balk is poorly photographed, by the way. She looks like an overweight student who has too many buffets in the student cafeteria. I could not wait to see this movie. I wanted to like it, but I think I would rather watch Nastassja read the phone book, with her own hair.
