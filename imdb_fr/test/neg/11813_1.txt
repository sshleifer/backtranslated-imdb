The worst thing about this movie is that it did not have to be so bad. <br /> <br /> They had a good budget, but many films are too; they made the film look beautiful and pretty, and best of all, they had the lesbian audience of the 21st century embracing a positive lesbian movie ... and yet the writer and director in four to bring back each film made over torment and confusion of lesbians in boarding schools (you know, the place where all lesbians love and die). <br /> <br /> This is a theme that has been repeated time and again in the film, but that viewers - if they use this voting forum as a clue - can not seem to have enough. <br /> <br /> Every element of this story was so excessive, excessively phony and artificial that it was hard to sit down. The main characters say it all: the crazy, rebellious, rebellious, rebellious genial girl (well, they took a super pretty woman like Piper Perabo and tried to brutalize her, but it did not stick much) seduced a pretty rich girl who is intended to betray her. <br /> <br /> By observing each step of the journey, you see the character 3, a dopey observer, well-intentioned, wide-eyed and respectful. I say "every step of the way" because she shares all her thoughts with the audience through the most rigid and stupid monologues. <br /> <br /> Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen-year-old girl, though they try it so oh so bad. So hard to tell how good a fifteen year old would really be, uh, you know, well ... talking. "To hear them (make love) with their noises, it was ... uh, you know, well, ok ... okay!" she says about her 2 wanton roommates, who roll in the bed next to her. <br /> <br /> Later, she asks Graham Greene- the accomplished American actor, completely lost in his role as gardener (!) "Is it wrong to worry about what people think? " <br /> <br /> Sorry, but is this a teenager or is she 7 years old? <br /> <br /> Granted, Piper Perabo (like Polly the tortured dike) and others are doing a decent job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter. Perabo has a good level of energy and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera. She would do well in a decent project, so this is by no means a criticism of the acting game. <br /> <br /> But this story does not matter to perpetuate each stereotype about lesbians in one and the same character. They could not stop with her (Polly) as an angry, mad, passionate, and passionate genius, who solved math problems for the speechless teacher. Oh, but it's after she argues with the professor who dares to accuse her of "chatter". <br /> <br /> "It's a word they use (men) against US (women)!" she said as she walked out of the classroom. <br /> <br /> Is it ALL that the writer could imagine? Or maybe we should ask: why stop there? <br /> <br /> Poole and co. continued and made Polly a dark and poetic child who communicated with the wild hawks, shouting their name in the woods. <br /> <br /> Stop the slow motion, science fiction and atmosphere of Xena! <br /> <br /> Then we receive her writing to her biological mother ... (most lesbians are orphans hungry for love, in case you are in the dark). <br /> <br /> Then, we have two teachers (one stuck, the other zany) grab relaxed ties) that fly around the action (the school is terribly big for only 2 teachers). .. and give the dark child / the seductress / the bird a tense air. Hmmmm. I wonder if anything good, you know ... um, it's funny what's going on between these two teachers ?????? <br /> <br /> There is simply no excuse for something so badly done. Grief occurs, but the author and director surely know that lesbians exist in a much more sophisticated time than this schlock. <br /> <br /> I can not reveal the end out of respect to those who oblige me to sit until the end, but if you do not laugh, I can only guess that you are crying. And not for the good reason. And I do not want to say the wimpy do scenes.
