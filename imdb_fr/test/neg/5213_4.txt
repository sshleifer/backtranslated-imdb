This is an admirable attempt by the beginning filmmaker, Ham Tran, who offers an unenlightened perspective on the victims of the war in Vietnam struggling for liberation, but who appears as a glorified story. With a clumsy and deliberately informative dialogue and a mediocre interpretation, even a relatively impressive budget with a particular attention to detail will not bring life to this melodrama, although historically dignified. Do not worry about the often distracting disconnection of actors from the reality of on-screen situations, and you should end up with an informative, albeit somewhat impersonal, educational lesson about Vietnam's post-war history. .
