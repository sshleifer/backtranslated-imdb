This film, called "Life in the fast lane", is without a doubt one of the least entertaining films I have seen in a long time. I think this has been thought of as sick, twisted, and jaded L.A. women who make up about 0.000000000 of the population of the United States. The characters are all one-dimensional, even the lead. After stabbing his boyfriend in the head with scissors, a cheap laugh is attempted (unsuccessfully) by sticking a cork in the boyfriend's skull to stop the bleeding. Oh, smart! Patrick Dempsey (whose films are almost always a class act - sarcasm) plays this "devil" that changes his life - but from what we've seen, his life was this series of thumbnails to begin with. No emotion, no laugh, no story. The only reason I give this 2 is that Jeffrey Jones is a good priest and there is a bit of style (albiet black stuff) in the camera. Otherwise, one of the 5 worst films I've seen. 2nd year out of 10 years F! I think even the most drugged junkie who did not care about the fall of a toilet seat would not like this movie. I can not emphasize enough that you should stay away. <br /> <br />
