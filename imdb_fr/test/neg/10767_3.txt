I read each of Baron Orczy's books Scarlet Pimpernel. Counting this one, I saw 3 Pimpernel movies. The one with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews, I loved him a lot. It is about violence and action, sometimes going against the spirit of the book. I do not expect movies to stick directly to the plot, I gave up being as idealistic as it was a long time ago, but if an excellent book movie has already been shot, do not do it again with a TV movie that includes great actors and beautiful costumes. but a barely decent script. Stick to the 80's version .... Rahne
