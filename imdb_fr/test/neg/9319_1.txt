Well, I remember that when the studio sent Schrader back and hired Harlin to make covers of that movie, they were absolutely right to do it. <br /> <br /> Dominion: The exorcist is simply a bad movie, it's boring, really. <br /> <br /> It would be good to think that the studio has set aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who, in such big words, have condemned the Harlin version and congratulated Schraders, even if no one had ever seen it would have been right. <br /> <br /> But that was not the case. <br /> <br /> To sum up: Schrader has no idea what a horror movie should be, and it appears in A Great Way. <br /> <br /> Droll, boring, funny by chance in all the bad places and bad support cast. <br /> <br /> Save money and nerves, do not see it.
