A woman who devotes herself to art begins to have a passionate love affair with a man named John. They make love wherever they go and play sex games. The problem I had is that's all they did. There was no plot for this movie or I just did not see it. Erotic passion was the best thing about this movie, but I wanted something else to happen. Maybe he could have been a serial killer or she could have had a secret. I just needed something and all there was was a lot of love scenes. Not that it was bad or anything, I just wanted more things going on in the movie. Maybe a colleague slept with him too. Whatever! I was very unhappy that it was all there was. Mickey Rourke was so hot at the time. I wonder what happened.
