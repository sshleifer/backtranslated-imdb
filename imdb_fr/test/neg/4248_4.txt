Although my preference is not normally made for romantic dramas, seeing this film has left me a little short. <br /> <br /> It was promising, the characters and relationships could have been explored much deeper than they had been, but the story seemed to understand the direction he wanted to take. <br /> <br /> Comparisons and parallels in history, especially the three generations of women in the family, had a lot of potential, but did not fully extend. It could have made the film much easier to understand and fix, which is the goal of any movie about lost love and newfound life. <br /> <br /> IMHO, I think the film suffered from a lack of direction in writing, although Harry Connick Junior and Sandra Bullock tried desperately to breathe some life into the contours of otherwise flat characters. <br /> <br /> It's not that it's a bad movie, some parts let you understand plot developments, it's just that this movie is underused, and a little flat in the together.
