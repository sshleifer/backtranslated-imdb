I just saw this movie in a lovely air conditioned cinema here in Bangkok. And as the outside temperature hovers around 37 Â° C with very high humidity, my 100Bt has not been lost. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I have not seen any junk extremely well done for a long time. . This is the kind of movie that provides a taste test, so to speak. Anyone who claims to love or love this product is immediately on the same list of tasteless phonies that still speak of the superiority of British television. At least the old, wide, faultless wheelchair was good for some sneers. <br /> <br /> The pseudo-scale and big lips, although characteristic of most French cinemas, do not really make a good movie. I would prefer to look at Independence Day 10 times in a row than to miss out on that stinky one more time.
