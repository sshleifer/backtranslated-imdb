OK, for my part, I found the trailer pretty good, so optimistic for this movie. Also, with the composition of the cast, I was sure there could not be less than 6 in my books. However, I pissed off half an hour in history ... where normal movies get good, this movie has bottomed out. <br /> <br /> SPOILER * The guy everyone tries to help cares so much about other wounded people in the crowd that he turns on his colleagues to save a tramp, and then lock himself in one of the armored trucks. Not only that, he constantly tries to attract the attention of others by which he ends up endangering more people. In short, the result is that he is responsible not only for the death of a tramp, but also for a policeman shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother ... oh and his five dying colleagues are unsightly victims. <br /> <br /> But in the end, he is HAPPY because he fell into the mid-term mind, so what if all his colleagues are now dead rather than staying true to the plan and to be millionaires. This movie has tried to be so politically correct that it makes me sick! Ruined a good story. Shame really.
