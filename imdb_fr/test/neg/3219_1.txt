I'm a sucker for gangster / gang movies, so I rented this movie. This film is a complete train wreck. With all the big actors in this movie, I can not believe how bad it was. It was so bad that I started laughing hysterically towards the end of the movie. The actor better known as Zues or the big guy in Ice Cube's "Friday" is doing incredible work throughout the movie. The first thing I said to Blockbuster when I came back from the movie was to remove that garbage from their shelves. Do not rent this movie unless you want to lose two hours of your life. If they go out with a suite, I wonder if it will be twice as serious as the first. I will be more careful when renting movies called "mob / gangland".
