It's a stupid film. Like many of these karate movies, it is poorly written, awkward and sometimes just stupid. The action is really not at the rendezvous and the whole film leaves a lot to be desired. Everyone here is talking jive, doing bad karate and doing a really bad acting job. <br /> <br /> Watch Scatman Crothers in a small role, he's too good for this movie in general. Jim Kelly is good at karate, but he's a terrible actor. Gloria Hendry is really mean. All, there are so many parts of this film that make absolutely no sense. The supposed scene of love / fugue with Hendry and Kelly, what was it? They destroyed that man's guitar for no reason! <br /> <br /> And then there were the obligatory girls on the trampolines !!! Now what was it? They were in the movie for five seconds, so you never heard of them again !!! Then there is all the element of the movie loaded with raciality, which is cool and everything, but in this film, it goes absolutely nowhere. As I said, it's good to laugh once, but do not look at it again.
