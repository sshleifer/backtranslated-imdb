A brilliant acting game, an excellent plot, wonderful special effects! That's what I would say about this film if I had watched it with a bag of diarreha on my head throughout the movie. Instead, I endured 2 hours of shit. Our "brilliant" story begins with billions of people who have nothing better to do than look into the volcanoes in a vain attempt to find his lucky charms. Instead, he finds a man 5 feet 4 inches dressed in a rubber dinosaur costume with a mixture of cheese and some strange cavemen. <br /> <br /> In his infinite wisdom (with his infinitely large nose), he decides to go inside this place. volcano with a team of "special" people. To get to this underground land, they go by plane? No. Boat? No. They use this giant tin can with a "solid metal" drill in the end that I swear I saw oscillate In summary, this movie was more fake than ... Oh, that's right! It was the most fake movie I saw! For those of you who have not seen it and are planning to sit down on a Sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie, I'll warn you! If you watch this movie, you should be ready to cut off all the shreds of your manhood and make a complete frontal lobotomy. <br /> <br /> ECCCHHH !! The scoring system only allows a minimum of 1/10. I give a -10/10!
