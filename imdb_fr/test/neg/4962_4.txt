I am a German student, sorry for my possible mistakes (I'm working on it;)) <br /> <br /> The very interesting stylistic converted and with accented sound effects accentuates the platitudinist action of the drama that does not deviate from horrible bad actors (movements and expressions of insincere and unnatural feelings) and makes the relatively strange and senseless story less beautiful. Just the typical slasher-genre with in this case a very strange action. Many passages partly destroy the main story and leave the spectators plunged into darkness, create a quirk and let guess the meaning of the actions and the sense purely vague. It's a hit for slasher fans but not for me. But although the interesting style of cinematography and the judicious use of light have been well revealed. <br /> <br /> So, not the best ...
