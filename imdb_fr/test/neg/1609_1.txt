I'll start by admitting that I tend to appreciate the action movies (military or otherwise). I'm a guy. But this dreck was awful. I saw it for free, showtime or hbo and I still feel that I paid too much. It was an extended episode of general hospital. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 1, only because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. Why or how 59 other people would give it a rating between 5 and 6 is beyond my reach. Unless they are all members of the cast or crew. <br /> <br /> It may be because this film was so bad that many of them were bailed out ... and as such, they were too little invested to bother. repeat, but the minimum of 10 lines seems silly, because what essentially amounts to a warning ......... in the hope of saving others the black hole of 2 hours, represents this film. Believe me, look at a white wall, they will be more action.
