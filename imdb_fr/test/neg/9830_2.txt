If you have always wanted to know more about taxi drivers, then this is an excellent movie to watch, for informational purposes only. I can just hear it now: "Wait, wait a second! Why do not we follow a taxi driver all day! Taxi drivers are funny, as are the people they meet, and they talk to each other just for a few minutes, so the other actors should be cheap! Harry, you take care of the production, Joan, you have the material, Brian, you're going to look for actors and we'll all meet here tomorrow to start shooting! "<br /> <br /> The first 90% of the movie could not have been worse if it had happened.At least without any planning, there is always an element of surprise to find. Carrey have stuff added as they go, and they always do well at the ticket office.The problem here is that the first 90% is pretty well written, and it's really bad .. Paul Dillon plays the taxi driver in Chicago who works All day, we see what he sees, people come in and out of his car, and he walks around the city, talking to them for a few seconds, then meeting other people. > <br /> I have to admit that there were some funny passages here and there, a religious family tries to convince the taxi driver to go to church with him, he takes a pregnant woman and her husband to hospital, separates a rich businessman from his girlfriend, a poor girlfriend of his is a friend and takes a rape victim home. I guess the moral of the film is that a taxi driver is more than a taxi driver and has a greater influence on the lives of his passengers than you originally thought. For some people, there is only one way to get from here to there, but for others, his very ordinary words help change the course of their lives. <br /> <br /> The last passenger of the day is used to trying to make sense of the rest of the film, and to a small extent, he succeeds. There was a bit of that death bed repentance where the good majority of the movie was nil, and in the end, it was trying to make it better in just one or two changes. I'm not too impressed by the film as a whole, but there were some fragments that deserved to be watched again. As for the actors, it's Paul Dillon. John Cusack, Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore are all in this situation, for about 30 seconds each, but do not watch for one of them otherwise you will be disappointed. I'll give credit to the other people involved that it's not your ordinary movie they produced here, but it was not a very good movie either. There was simply not enough equipment to keep you going for an hour and a half. It was a decent effort, but it did not fail.
