Anna Christie (Greta Garbo) returns to her father Chris (George F Marion) after 15 years. He is the skipper of a boat and she stays to travel with him. Meanwhile, she meets Matt (Charles Bickford) and they fall in love. Matt and Chris do not agree and Anna has a secret to confess ..................... <br /> <br /> What a boring story. ..... it starts badly with George F. Marion and Marie Dressler playing drunkards in a bar. The scene continues forever and they are both terrible. It's also difficult to understand. In fact, it is difficult to understand all the actors. I missed a lot of the dialogue between Bickford, Marion and Garbo because it's incomprehensible! It is obvious that Garbo has something special, because it attracts every time she is on the screen and its presence gives this film the 4 stars I gave it. But nothing really happens - it's a boring story with horrific accents. You will do well to stay awake.
