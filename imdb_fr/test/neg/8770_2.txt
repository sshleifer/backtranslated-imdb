... do not waste your time looking at this vanity project. My comment has been removed twice now, for reasons I have not yet understood, other than the suspicion that someone involved in "Gone" is not happy with what I have to say. So, I cut things to a bare minimum this time with an excerpt from my original comments that can in no way be taken for a personal attack on anyone, nor for an unfair comment: <br /> <br /> "" Gone "is the kind of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words Horrible raised dialogue, a scenario that scrolls like a fish out of the water, acting in ways that hinder the most egocentric community theater divas, cinematography inspired by the school of "Survivor" composed of crane shots followed by static close-ups exploring the nostrils, formidable ADR effects, special visual effects that are not , pedestrian music that does not endure any mood or emotion, terrible montages frosts and unnecessary fainting, no artistic direction to take to talk about --- the litany of wickedness continues over and over ... I felt really I was deceived by the time it took me to move quickly through most of ... a time that could have been better spent watching a wall ... By no means, nobody will have the chance to read this subject themselves in this "film", because long before it is over, they will wish to have been "removed" before making this mistake. "<br /> <br /> Case closed, amen.
