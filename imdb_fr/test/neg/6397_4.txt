Overall, do not expect much and you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And if you want to see a movie that will bring you back in 1983, you'll do it for sure. The only reason I gave 2 more points than it deserves for this film is for 2 reasons: <br /> <br /> # 1. Michael Caine <br /> > # 2. the people, the images, the culture and the music of Brazil <br /> <br /> The film is almost entirely realized by Caine while it engages in the apparently impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semi-credible story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper are not up to it. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is a pure class, as always. In addition to being a talented classic actor and comedian, Caine brings a mix of introspection, malice and sensitivity to each of his films ... the center of his charm since his role in Alfie ... and the reason for which he won the Academy Award for Hannah and her sisters 2 years later. In this farce, he seduces tenderly ... funny and vulnerable ... melancholy and sentimental ... and apart from the jewel that is Rio de Janeiro, the only reason not to seek a better form of entertainment. <BR /> <br /> Well ... maybe a glimpse of two charming young actresses, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore would be a reason. But all you can do is watch Michelle (even though her appearance looks terribly dated) ... there could not be any more painful movie experience than watching her "trying" (most of her dialogues seem also superimposed). Half is 100% better at acting and she can be easily transplanted, as such, into any movie today (to be honest, she does not really look very different). Ms. Moore is surely underutilized, especially since she was the biggest star in the group. <br /> <br /> Except for the fact that it's a silly joke, in the end, I like a little the maturity with which these people handle this scandalous situation ... it does not friends and weddings and an affair, even with your best friend's minor daughter, can be forgiven and everyone can continue. The injured parts are angry and disappointed at what has happened, but everything works for the better ... a bit unrealistic for sure, but surprisingly refreshing. Hope is always.
