Really horrible. Obviously, an attempt to take advantage of the craze for Star Wars, but nothing justifies this tasteless waste. The scenario is lost before the middle, the characters are undeniable and the kid is so little talented that it is just posing for the camera. An alien planet on which they land is actually the shipyards of Long Beach, California. <br /> <br /> This film made me physically look bad. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman has made good movies, bad movies in his career, but nothing excuses for this one. <br /> <br /> 0/10 - IMDb will not let you score a zero.
