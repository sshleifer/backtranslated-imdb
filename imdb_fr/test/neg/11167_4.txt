It's a scam of Hollywood movies already crappy like Scream and I know what you did last summer. The story is classic, some high school students try a joke about the asthmatic unsuitability of the class, but something is wrong. Terribly wrong. When you watch the movie, you know what will happen before it happens all the time. It's not good if a movie tries to be scary. The actors are pretty much in agreement and the girls are cute (after all, they are Asian), so I will give two out of five on the mojave'o'meter.
