"Dolemite" is the touching story of Dolemite (forced film titles on blaxploitation), a former prisoner who is likely to still be in prison. He has problems with cops, friends, drug traffickers, women, prostitutes and society in general. It's just not such a nice man. The film is not either, although it is still hilarious and deserves to be watched. <br /> <br /> The fragile premise is that Dolemite (played with as much enthusiasm as star Rudy Ray Moore can muster) is in jail for a crime he claims he did not commit. When a drug is hit, a drug or a drug, something is about to fall, the guard releases it to stop it, help it or just watch it. Not very clear. All I know is that I did not know that the judicial system released convicts to allow them to prove their innocence. My ignorance, I suppose. <br /> <br /> The plot is complicated and unimportant. In fact, Dolemite kills people (usually with poorly choreographed karate), makes love and curses people, sometimes even rhyme. The joys of the film are its total incompetence and total indifference in the matter. <br /> <br /> I stopped counting the number of times I saw the boom microphone after a single scene in the scene (about two minutes of film). I stopped wondering why the guard was turning a blind eye to Dolemite's sitting position, even after getting up and walking around the room, as they returned to the set-up and Dolemite was inexplicably inexplicable again. seated. I no longer wondered why Dolemite was dressing like that when he changed naked in the street, because he did not want to get into his car with the ugly (normal) clothes that the prison had given him. And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he wiggles his hand on the belly of a guy and cuts it somehow. The only time I've been nervous and tense is when the flabby and disgusting white mayor walks around naked with a towel around his neck that barely covers him. You continue to say "Cut ... cut ... cut", but at that moment, you are already healed emotionally. <br /> <br /> The film is ridiculous in every way. Moore like Dolemite, is either funny, cool, or both. If you are looking for a bad movie, you have found it with "Dolemite".
