It's hard and I did not expect it ... But it's really the worst film my wife and I have seen. Dreadful dialogues that extend incomprehensibly in time for no apparent reason except to fill the time. Narration does not follow understandably intelligently ?? everything is messy. Action and dialogs appear in jumps. What disappointed me most is to see Dominique Pinon, one of my favorite French actors, involved in this adventure ?? uh ?? I do not even know how to describe it without being polite ?? The rest of the actors were the poorest. Susan Paterno made a terrible rendition of her character, making an inexpressive flat performance. Bad special effects. I do not think it was a complete waste of film, but it's close to ?? If I mean, I would advise everyone not to see this movie. I think it would be a waste of time. Sincerely, I never thought about a movie but ?? there is always a first time.
