The line is thin between being theatrical and being simply forced. Act by force. Forced taking Forced conspiracy. Even forced photography. There are people who say "the film is developing this way because it comes from Asia" but I do not see any forced element on Seven Samurai or Sonatine. There is a dividing line between being a fiction (and each piece of art that it is, in its own way, a fiction) and simply improbable. More personally, I do not feel anything with the film, it does not take me anywhere, and I simply can not believe the proposed fictional world. It does not seem right to me, there is something inside or through that which does not click.
