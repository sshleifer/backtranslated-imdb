Get Smart should be titled Get Stupid. There is not a funny line or gag in the whole movie. This movie is so bad that Austin Powers movies look like Shakespearian. Some other movies like this one and Steve Carell can say goodbye to his career. As for Anne Hathaway, what does she do in this film? She is a good actress but is just terrible. <br /> <br /> Writing is pathetically lame. There is not a funny, intelligent or spiritual line. There is not a single visual gag. <br /> <br /> The staging is terrible. Comedy is based on timing. Someone should tell the director. Every line that's supposed to be funny (and is not) comes with the worst sense of comic timing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 0 stars
