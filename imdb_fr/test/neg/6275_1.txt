After watching Steven Spielberg's version of War Of The Worlds at the movies, I became addicted to it. I could think of my favorite parts of the movie, people evaporating, people in panic, fires, explosions, it was so great ... <br /> <br /> A few weeks later , I go into my video store, and I see David Michael Latt's version of War of The Worlds on the set. "He could not have come on DVD so fast, could he?" I said to myself. I read the substance of the case and saw C. Thomas Howell instead. "Oh, I remember him from The Outsiders!" So I thought maybe it was a try. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, absolutely wrong. As soon as I watched the opening credits, took them forever, I realized that something was wrong. Something was going to disappoint me in this film and that's what happened. The entire movie stinks like a cheese sauce that has been left in the fridge for 10 years. From the acting game, the special effects (stupid-looking stuff, when people vaporize turn into orange skeletons), and most of all, it's not even as interesting as Spielberg's version, in fact, the Intrigue was boring, and there were only 3 scenes of destruction! What is shit? I was so bored that I had to move quickly through the movie until I found something interesting. And nothing was really. <br /> <br /> My advice: Do not even touch this movie, stay a hundred meters from it. The Spielberg version will appear at the end of the month, buy this one! But please, please, please! Stay away from this shit before it chokes us all!
