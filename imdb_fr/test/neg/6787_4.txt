As a true Canadian, I always avoid Canadian films. However, now and then I'm trapped in watching one. This one is better than the others, that is mediocre. It presents many of the usual weaknesses of Canadian films: self-will play, an excess of cinematic gadgets and, most importantly, the abandonment of the Canadian habit of using Canadian cities to replace American cities. I mean, the use of Montreal's historic metropolis as a replacement for Harrisburg, Pennsylvania is simply obscene. I was in a generous mood. I gave him a 4. <br /> <br />
