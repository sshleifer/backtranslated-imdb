Seriously, I thought it was a parody when I saw it at the rental store, but I realized it was just shit, I can not even believe I did not turn it off, for we all know that these snakes were not rattles but pythons. and Gardner, the acting game was bad and oms I still can not believe the final loll if you're going to watch it just watch it for the end it was seriously priceless much better than 6th sense, I do not even know if the filmmakers actually thought this title would fly, the only time it will really fly is when I throw it in the trash ... just watch it for fun, it was hilarious to the stupidest way possible, do not buy.
