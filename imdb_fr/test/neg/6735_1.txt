If I could give 0/10 to this film, it would be the first film that I wanted to rank as low. It's worse than horrible. If I went to see him at the cinema, I would like the cinema to pay me to watch it (at least the minimum wage). Some of the camera shots were quite effective, but many were nil, for example. Reflection of wicked people in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders laterally from his body (seeing is believing). Many useless killings of innocent civilians. Two murders that made me laugh out loud because of the victims' actions / facial expressions when they were shot. I only watched it all the way (fast forward about 10 minutes of useless boring dialogue) in the hope of seeing Seagal participate in a decent body fight, but there was almost nothing that (I should have known that when going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music - end of the "action" scene). In one scene, we see Seagal's hand slicing someone's neck in slow motion, which clearly shows that his hand has never even been in contact). The evil leader comes back to life. He is hit in the chest twice. The first time, it is with a shotgun which propels it on the 2nd and 3rd floors in the street. In short, this film is a total waste of time and a total joke. It seems very small budget (even for Seagal). The color is dull and gray. I could go on and on ... just like this movie, but I would not do it. Watch this movie if you have insomnia. Its guarantee to fall asleep.
