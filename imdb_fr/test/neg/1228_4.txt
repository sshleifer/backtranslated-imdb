Like many people, I think the 1989 Lonesome Dove epic was one of the best westerns ever produced, perhaps THE best. And, realizing that most suites (in this case a prequel) will certainly disappoint, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon has responded to this expectation with marginal staging and staging, a mediocre cast and, frankly, an ugly storyline. <br /> <br /> Lonesome Dove created the Western Heroes of Captains McCrae and Call because of the incredible performances of Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Before living at Lonesome Dove, we thought they were fighting bravely to rid Texas of bandits and savage Indians during their years of guarding. <br /> <br /> If I had only seen Comanche Moon, I would think that these two bones are a couple of idiots cowardly and incompetent. In Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae would have chased Blue Duck all over Texas and would never have managed to capture or kill him. In Comanche Moon, a kick at Call's heel convinced him to settle and raise cattle. There was no fighting or fighting in the miniseries. The best punch was McCrea's sucker with Inez Scull, a fun scene but not a character for McCrae. <br /> <br /> Where was the spirit and charm of McCrae? Clara's love for McCrae, a slob and unshaven and drunken narghile, was totally implausible. And Maggie's love for Call, an impartial and sullen loner, defies logic. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was excellent, superior to the original. Merit goes not only to HD technology, but also to the director of photography. The Comanche Moon mini-series was better than anything else on television for three nights, but unfortunately that does not say much.
