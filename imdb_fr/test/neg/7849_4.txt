Perhaps the director was trying another PIRATE musical (Good Garland and Kelly) - but this lame time is falling flat. The voices of Sinatra and Kathryn Graysons do not mix well - and their chemistry together lacks a spark. Sinatra's postulate as a nice boy trying to pretend to be his late father "bandito" is ok, but he seems clumsy in the role. What is amazing and wonderful here is how Sinatra can take a rather tasteless song and make it special - her phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to listen to it again. When Grayson sings the same songs, it's hard to believe that she's not singing something completely different and not so interesting. She has her big moment with "love is where you find it" that suits her perfectly and shows her abilities. The photography is clear and the two stars are attractive, as are the costumes and sets. Co-stars Mildred Natwick and J. Carroll Nash have put a lot of energy into doing the impossible. In addition to Sinatra's singing, there is a strange house-to-house dance with Ricardo Montalban, Cyd Charisse and Ann Miller. It's fascinating and strange. Montalban and Charisse formed a wonderful team of dancers and this number is a real oddity.
