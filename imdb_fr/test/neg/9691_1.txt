It is the most inaccurate and shameful Bible film I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I would like to know why anyone on Earth could enjoy watching this. I'm so surprised that a big name like Jon Voight would agree to play in this shameful trash. Many people who may not have read the Bible will now be misled into thinking that this film was accurate and that the thought of it really bothers me. I think manufacturers have a lot to answer. The worst part is that I do not think anyone could make such obvious mistakes with a Bible movie, since they can search for the truth in the Bible. do and I find that very offensive. There are no words strong enough to describe exactly how I feel about it.
