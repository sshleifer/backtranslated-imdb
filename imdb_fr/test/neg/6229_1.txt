Wow! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, did I mention terrible? You can only tell by the cover of the DVD not to get this movie, but it was unfortunately not the case for me.Well, someone brought me this house to watch it and when I watched it I just wanted to strangle the person because they used my money. I will certainly resume soon, but I might as well talk to you while I have it in mind, because I really want this movie does not even deserve to be called horrible.It is beyond horrible.It is maybe the worst movie of all time.The game was so, so, so, so, horribly disgusting, as well as the dead being TOTALLY lame and predictable.I did not even mock the seriousness of this movie, what which makes me a little scared. Do not see this movie, shame on you if you even watch this movie page, and I pity EXTREME for you if you are watching this movie page, because you think it will be a DECENT. Final word: Beurk !!!!!!!!!!
