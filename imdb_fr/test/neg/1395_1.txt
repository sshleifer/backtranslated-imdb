... so where is my friggin trophy? I was seriously expecting a banner and confetti to fall from the ceiling for watching 30 minutes of this shit. Comedy Central has really dropped the ball lately, trying to fill the void left by Chappelle with several seasons of a retarded man mimicking the retarded men. Dah duh nah !! If you pay attention to the series, you will notice that when Mencia does not stammer and laugh at his own sketches, he makes only exaggerated observations that seem to lack humor. Have you ever noticed how much the people in Buick's drive really slow down? It's like Dah duh nah! Even dwarves and half-naked girls can not distract Mencia's lack of talent. Moreover, Mencia is not even a "reveret", as he proclaims constantly and categorically, which makes it a fraud. <br /> <br /> If anything positive can be said about Mencia, it's his effort. The man obviously has no talent, but like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, god knows he's trying.
