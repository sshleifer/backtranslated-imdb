Frankly, after Cotton Club and Infidel, it was pretty embarrassing to see Lane and Gere in this movie, because it's bad. The acting was bad, the dialogues were extremely superficial and insincere. It was well done, but, again, it's a big budget movie. It was too predictable, even for a girls movie. I even knew from the beginning that he was going to die at the end, the only thing I did not know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing that is really worth watching is the landscape and the house, because it's beautiful. But if you want that, look at National Geographic. I love Lane, but I've never seen her in such an ugly film. As for Gere, he's a good actor, but he has had films like this, so I'm not surprised. An hour and a half that I wish I could bring back.
