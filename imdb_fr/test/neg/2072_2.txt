Another pretentious film by Vicente Aranda. If "Juana la loca" did not hold the same thing, at least its quality was superior (mainly thanks to the superb performance of Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala), but "Carmen" is boring and overflowing with subjects (fiery brunette with a dagger down below), poor man driven into madness by passion, Sierra Nevada gangs, "bullfighters", ...) <br /> <br /> Obviously, Paz Vega is a pretty woman, but there is no more doubts about his talent, and Sbaraglia's role is so stupid that the result is almost unbelievable. The scenario is weak and the presumptuous character of Aranda influences the whole film. With these ingredients, the result could not be good. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've seen, but a total failure, in my opinion.
