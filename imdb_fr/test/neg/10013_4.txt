Here is a resolutely average post-apocalyptic Italian version on the theme of sport as the most dangerous game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and The Running Man. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the film commented here is far from being as much fun as the other entries listed and is further driven by a mediocre voice-over, usually bland action sequences, a number of Totally tasteless scenes like a prolonged rape sequence and some really stupid and illogical points. <br /> <br /> Take the example of the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the enclosure of the wicked. He initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep. To discover the said corpse, the answer of the wicked? (keeping in mind that our hero came to brutally murder them) ?? They decide to wait until the next morning to find the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!) <br /> <br /> However, I guess to be fair, the film still has to look to be able to to be suspended your disbelief in such stupid scenes and benefits enormously from the presence of the excellent Woody Strode (even if his screen time is very limited) <br /> <br /> Not a classic, far from it, but still pretty much worthy of a watch for Italian B-Movie lovers.
