The director is nice, as is his wife co-director Shira Geffen, but their film is nil. He has his moments (and some pretty girls), but there is too much: "Amelie" meets "Break the waves" and "Pauline on the beach". You go away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer and the girl who loves him best when nothing happens, whether in the cinema or in real life. Instead, you get a suicidal writer, a neurotic actress and an illegal immigrant social worker with a heart of gold. It seems like there's more than one really touching story hidden in the script, but at first glance it's a bunch of empty story lines and sentimental crap. Hard to sit as is.
