The producers Golan and Globus should have been ashamed to publicly release this waste. I know it will sound clich√©, but compared to that, the first "Hercules" of 1983 looks like a mature and exciting epic! This "suite" is weak, inexpensive, irrecoverable, childish, dummy, inept and BADLY ACTED. A landmark in the bad cinema, and one of the few films I've seen to deserve REALLY the lowest possible rating: no stars!
