I just went on the UK science fiction channel on July 5th, she was ****. Shame on JRD! Maybe he was bored a week! He can not be skint after LOTR. I guess he was not to blame. Mr. Sheppird was. I turned off after 50 minutes, I could not stand it. The CGI ship was bad and the creature looked like a big 5 foot bat. Who funded this project? I think it all cost $ 250. Avoid at all costs, do not think to buy the DVD if they leave one, I can not imagine that they would spend money to produce one. Let's hope someone makes a decent film for Chupra and a decent movie for BIGFOOT. Sasquatch was fine, poor Lance. It's a pity a big studio and direct no risk, no more superhero movies please!
