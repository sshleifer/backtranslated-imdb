This movie was terrible. John Wayne is a brutal actor sometimes. The main woman who plays the role of "Maura" did a good job and did her best to make the scenes credible despite the incompetence, the dimension, the Wayne actor. Seriously, did you see him when he was supposed to speak in his sleep? Ridiculous. And his character became such a hideous person in the second half of the movie and then did nothing to compensate for his behavior and he is always forgiven for everyone, including his sworn enemy, without even a 'sorry'. The story was completely implausible. We were supposed to believe that two adult men, both of whom had tremendous success in their respected fields, would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men just because they hated each other? You can choose any scene randomly and you can probably shake your head with disbelief that someone has paid money for the making of this film. It's a shame because the only other Wayne movies I've seen are the shootiste and rio bravo movies, both of which were great movies. Unless you are paid, do not worry about watching this one.
