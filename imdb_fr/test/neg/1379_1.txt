Carlos Mencia is not funny. From his special shows to the wreckage of a television series, Carlos Mencia is not funny. It's been two years since I tried to convince people that he steals the jokes of other comedians and, as far as comedy is concerned, he is a regular at "Johnny arrivals lately" with much lesser results. Psycho astronauts jokes? Does Britney Spears speak jokes? I hope this is just a programming mistake, but come on Carlos and Comedy Central, these topics, and many others, cover the full range of opening monologues of late-season TV presenters. evening, Saturday Night Live, Mad TV and many others. Racial and ethnic stereotypes? The comedy has no chance to evolve with Carlos Mencia. Maybe people, especially viewers and Comedy Central executives, will understand this point, as this week's issue of "New York" magazine has labeled it "Carlos Mencia, an impolite joke-filcher".
