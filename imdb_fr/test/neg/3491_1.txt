Crash is supposed to be a movie about racism in Los Angeles. But in fact, it's just a lot of coincidences between several characters who connect during a single day in one of the largest cities in the world. Who the hell is going to believe that? There are unrealistic situations, one after the other. On the other hand, this film claims to show racism between Asians, Iranians, Latinos, Blacks and Whites. But the great mistake lies in a pre-established racism on the part of the writer. Mainly because the white characters in this film are generally people of higher socio-economic status than other races. Iranians are poor, as are Asians. And Latinos, as always, have the portrait of a cleaning lady, a policeman or a very discreet job like that of a locksmith. Jesus!!! Do not you think it's time to change these stereotypes? Same thing for blacks, a portrait as a member of a gang, with the exception of a black television director, who was the only cool character for me. This film is so bad that I am so disappointed with the kind of movies out of Hollywood these days. Always with stereotyped characters. No realism whatsoever. Nothing to identify. This is simply a big waste, as it could have been a great opportunity to show Latinos, Koreans, Iranians and Blacks from a different angle.
