This film is so poor in its desperate attempts to be "good-skinned" and relaxed that it really embarrassed me to watch it. I can not imagine what the small circle of celebrities and the Norwegian press must have felt trying to claim to love him at the premiere of this night full of stars. His excellent press reviews illustrate how ridiculously small and innate the Norwegian media scene is. If a foreign film of this quality had reached the big screen, it would have deserved the rain of rotten tomatoes that it really deserves. <br /> <br /> The combination of literally amateur actors, home-style visual effects, clumsy dialogues, painfully vain attempts at humor of the working class and intrigue too comfy and meaningless really make a film of irreproachable quality. Stay away.
