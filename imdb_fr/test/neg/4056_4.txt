There is nothing wrong with softcore but this one is pretty clinical - a lot of nudity but it's all wrong, of course (it's still wrong - it's a movie, but you see what I want say). There is no sexuality or eroticism, it's all random nudity and bad behavior of "lust" and sexual intercourse with each other. <br /> <br /> Part of that is of course, your personal preference. These women clearly have body problems with their piercings, tattoos and silicon - not to mention their too plastic & tough look so if that's your thing - great, you'll have the chance to see it all here. <br /> <br /> I do not do that. I do not think anyone's expectations are very high when you look at a movie title like this, but for a lot of people it would be a bit like watching cyborg fembots ... they seem almost real but it's really scary.
