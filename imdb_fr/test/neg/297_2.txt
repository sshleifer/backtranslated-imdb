I looked at the first 15 minutes and I can say that there was no consultation of military personnel. The character of Judith Light (an officer) has hair under her shoulders! One of the first officers who greets her as she heads to the medical center where she works is so overweight that the pants are missing from her pockets! No, no military had advised them on this film. Even a former soldier could have helped here.
