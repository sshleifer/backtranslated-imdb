<br /> <br /> I rented this movie on June 20, 2001 and watched it for about 45 minutes. I concluded that looking at a blank screen would be a pleasure in comparison. There was not a single person in the cast for whom I would have shed a tear if hell itself had opened and swallowed the entire group of them. parents warn them, and I take the time to urge anyone who sees this note to avoid this film like the plague! I have seen some very bad movies in my day, but NEVER as bad as this one.
