**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young <br /> <br /> Hill at Katharine Hepburn Mountains (as Trigger Hicks) is a religious laundry woman. "Going 18 years old", she begins to attract men's attention and responds by throwing stones. The arrival of a dam building team triggers love dreams at Mrs. Hepburn's home. It quickly catches the attention of the suave engineer Robert Young (John Stafford), who hides his marital status with seduction. Supervisor Engineer Ralph Bellamy (as George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn, but for different reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ, worshiped by Hepburn. <br /> <br /> After using the power of prayer to heal a child, neighborhood residents suspect she is a witch. <br /> <br /> If it were not so bad, "Spitfire" could be more fun; it is an atypical vehicle and extremely inappropriate for its unconvincing actor. Mr. Bellamy is the one who drives the best. However, Sarah Haden (under the name of Etta Dawson), who appeared in the stage version of George Cukor, and Louis Mason (under the name Bill Grayson) made it the best description. Will Geer (as West Fry), "Grandfather Walton" in the 1970s, plays a small role. An unexpected end helps.
