"The Vindicator" is a strange little Canadian B movie. At first glance, it looks like it's just another cheap "Terminator" imitation (extremely cheap!), But strangely, it also shares some of the qualities with the original "RoboCop", which had not even been released yet. "Vindicator" appeared (1986). Coincidence? Who knows? Anyway, the story is this: the scientist Carl Lehman seems to be a rather likeable guy who works for an ultra-secret high-tech government research lab, and reports to a skinny boss named Whyte, with whom he relies on project funding early in the month. movie. Carl has a loving wife at home and a baby on the way, which makes the situation even more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a "laboratory accident". But wait! Carl is not really dead after all! Whyte extracted Carl's brain and inserted it into his animal project, a kind of biomechanical experimental space suit. When Carl wakes up in his new body, he goes naturally a bit crazy, destroys the lab and escapes. This is a problem because Whyte (for reasons known to himself) has programmed the mechanical combination with a "Rage Reaction" program, which will force Carl to kill anyone who touches him for any reason. In hindsight, this little addition to Carl's psyche was probably not the best idea. <br /> <br /> Robo-Carl wandered aimlessly into the movie for a while, killing some random attackers and other characters from him back home and contacting his wife (this scene is supposed to be touching, I guess, but turns out to be comical because the voice of Carl's robot is so synthesized that you can hardly understand a word he says). Of course, he tells her to leave the city and never come back because she is in danger, but she wants to stay and help her, yadda yadda yadda. Finally, Whyte hires a gang of rogue commandos led by "Hunter," a seemingly ninja assassin portrayed by Pam Grier (!) To hunt down and destroy her fleeting creation, using Carl's wife as bait and predictable chaos (but ridiculously cheap) . <br /> <br /> I'm a B-Movie guy, but "The Vindicator" was so half-stunned that it quickly turned into high comedy. I guess a good piece of the budget was used in Stan Winston's robo-Carl costume design, because it looks pretty cool, but the rest of the film suffers from a cheap look, designed for the television. The scenario might have required MUCH more work, but the filmmakers might have heard about "RoboCop" in production and rushed out to "Vindicator" so they would not be accused of stealing them. Anyway, judging by the other comments here on IMDb, I'm not the only one to have noticed the parallel between "Vindicator" and "RoboCop", and obviously "Robo" is the top movie, so you do not have no need to waste your time. Consider this nonsense unless you want to see a movie that could at best be described as a draft of "RoboCop" if it had been made by an 8th grader.
