While watching this film, I never thought of defending it. From the beginning, he's honest enough not to have a lot of conspiracy. There are no real characters on which to hang on except the killer. Some actors may be better, but most of them are capable. <br /> <br /> I know, three out of ten are not stellar, but critics say filming was done mediocre and completely useless, etc. I think it was decided to do what he is supposed to do well. The lighting is sometimes minimal, more natural than most audiences, but it is supposed to look like a camcorder movie. In fact, the quality is sometimes still too high to stay true to this reality, but no one can survive the minutes of working with the camera that are really so bad. <br /> <br /> It's not particularly scary, but it's annoying sometimes. There are one or two characters that do not seem credible at all, and the soundtrack sometimes becomes tiresome, but overall, it was sharper than many movies on camcorders.
