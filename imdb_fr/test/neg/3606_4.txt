The distribution of EMPEROR'S GROOVE's new cast returns to Disney Pictures, but this time, Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), who is no longer Yzma's (Eartha Kitt) henchman. Kronk has started a new life and is very happy with his role as chef of his own restaurant. Things are going well until Kronk knows that his Papi (John Mahoney) comes to visit him. Kronk is worried because he knows that his life will not impress his grandpa. One thing he has always wanted and never received is a helping hand from his father. A burst of gaffes and a huge explosion of cheese in the restaurant leave our friendly hero immersed in the disorder and anxiety. To save the day, a little help from his friends. <br /> <br /> Other voices: Tracey Ullman, David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, April Winchell and Gatlin Green.
