Aside from the rock cop and the show where the child dies after eating a spoiled hamburger he found under the bed, this show has always been the darkest and silliest show to survive. Without the unjustifiable success of Jason Lee in the movies, this show would never have been conceived in a conceptual way if it had been directed by a relatively unknown character. <br /> <br /> The concept is terrible. Moron Redneck Hick spends his lottery winnings to redeem himself with the white basket of his past. It's funny? periodically but not systematically. Is it stupid? Every episode. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of great shows happening before their time, but this blunder has survived longer than I could have imagined. The dialogue is incredibly funny, as are the themes of the episodes. Every episode for someone with an IQ greater than 100 is an absolute fight. And the icing on the cake? The annoying voice of Jason Lee telling each episode. Without the southern culture of the state and the southern rednecks, this show would have no audience. <br /> <br /> If you are a moron and need a show that is completely lacking in humor but overflowing with bad taste, bad dialogue and dimwit characters failing life ... then you are probably an actor of this series.
