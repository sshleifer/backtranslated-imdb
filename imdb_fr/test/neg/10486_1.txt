This film was terribly awful. Most of the film was people running in the woods, walking in the woods or dancing in the woods. More than half, at least. Then two children who discover two "horribly mutilated bodies" in the woods return to the woods the next evening for a romantic walk. ????? There is no temporal continuity. his day, his night, his day, his really really night, his twilight, his darkness, his day. All the scenes of wood continue like this until you think you are losing your mind. really bad. The sheriff discovers a five-foot claw imprint encrusted in the woodland and theorizes that a very tall alligator may have learned to walk upright. Really a silly movie without any real motivation for the characters. Could be entertaining for young children, as an alternative to really graphic things.
