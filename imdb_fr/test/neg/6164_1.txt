Unfortunately, House of D is simply horrible, with a ridiculous plot, a terrible writing, a mediocre game and, in fact, almost everything else about it. <br /> <br /> Tom flees NYC to survive as a child in Paris, and manages to convince the beautiful Parisian he finally marries that he is French, despite a low command of his language. She is shocked when years later, he reveals her "secret"! Riiiight! <br /> <br /> He then presents his story of misfortune to his own son, and we expect him to believe that it is the best birthday present that a father can offer to his son. 13 years. If only such things were so easy! David Duchovny plays his own wife, Tea Leoni, in the role of his mother and strikes again. Leoni makes me laugh as a comic but she's just wrong for that role. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with this is that none of the characters are nice. I did not care what happened to them. I was hoping instead that Robin Williams and his emblem "child in the body of an adult" would fall into a pothole of the village, but alas, it was not the case and we had to endure his performance until to be it all the time. <Br /> <br /> Zelda, the daughter of Anton Yelchin and William, is not bad, but I guess the rave reviews that other people give them are simply because they were not as bad as everyone else in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many ridiculous and artificial aspects in this film - Erykah Badu, the bicycle, the Catholic school and its stupid staff, ideally located stupid characters, etc. - this criticism continues forever, so I will end by saying that House of D is a very bad film and that I am almost embarrassed for Duchovny. <br /> <br /> What really annoys me is that online "friends" have encouraged me so much that I've come a long way to do it. <br /> <br /> I would not have been so angry that this movie was so bad if I had just lost a few hours at the local cinema, but instead, I lost a whole day and I discovered that my so-called "friends" were either stupid or dishonest, because it's a horrible movie!
