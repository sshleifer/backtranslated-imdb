Of course, I saw the insights on this at the beginning of another Lion's Gate extravaganza, so of course it was only the best parts and so I looked intriguing. And that is, at one point. A young student (Sarah) finds riddles everywhere and is obsessed with answering them, and in doing so, she involuntarily gets involved in a game. This is quite intriguing, but unfortunately, everything becomes confused and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like me) will probably be frustrated. The characters appear with little introduction and you do not really know who they are, nor why Sarah knows them or attend them. All of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a boy years ago. She explained that it was "entirely part of the design". In fact, all this is part of the "very basic scenario" and once the film is finished, you will feel like you have lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want to recover for more productive uses of your time. like cleaning the bathroom, for example. 4 out of 10
