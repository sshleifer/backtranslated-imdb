I really wanted to love this movie, especially after all the buzz I'd heard running around him. But, unfortunately, it did not work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same illusion as Lost In Translation. If you use very few dialogues, pay close attention to slow close-ups and focus on the fabric pieces of the scenery, your story will be magically deep and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot, if you can find a plot, this movie is artificial. I was not impressed by the fact that the protagonist resists the accident: "So, write everything," what should we believe? He grew up happy and then wrote a book about his experiences. It was therefore justified this terrible incident. <br /> <br /> What, I suppose, is supposed to be a film that empathizes with a young man who is without direction and facing an impossible moral dilemma, instead creates the portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection with anyone around him, and at the end of the film he has no real idea of ​​what is right or wrong. He has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends. We have here the portrait of a non-character, a spirit that goes through life all his life as he makes his way on his skateboard. I do not feel anything for him and honestly, I wish he was caught. The entire film does not necessarily focus on his feelings of guilt, but on how he will avoid sanctions and / or responsibility for a wrong decision. Not only does he get away from it, he finds a way to subtly rationalize it. A very frightening and negative message, because it is suggested that so many of our young people are so disconnected from right and wrong that they simply set the rules as they go, using the best or the best worst. I find it an insulting treatise for today's youth, and the pretentious arrogance of the filmmaker thickens with every heavy, thoughtful and moving step in the eyes. <br /> <br /> (He killed the guardian, but if you blink It's hard to say if it was an act of mercy or not, maybe it was because he was so mortified that he throws with his skateboard.When he rushes to the caretaker's car, one of his skateboard's cogs is stained with blood.)
