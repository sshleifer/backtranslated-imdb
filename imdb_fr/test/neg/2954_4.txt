The most famous thing about this movie is that it was the first time Garbo was talking in a movie. Aside from this "milestone" (if you want to call it that), it's a movie that does not go beyond squeaky melodrama, with Garbo trying his best not to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> The plot involves Greta Garbo returning to her father's home after 15 years abroad. Her father, who is captain on a barge, is happy to see her, even if she is a little suspicious. She soon falls in love with a grizzled sailor, who also realizes that something, a barrier if you will, holds her back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two guys do not particularly like each other and soon come Garbo, when she spreads the situation by unveiling her Big Secret, which is not a surprise for us , if you've read the video box (fucking MGM !!), Garbo is nothing but weapons in this movie, she acts and acts waving her arms and squeaking quickly. The two leading men are doing well. The best performance probably comes from the classic silent actress Marie Dressler, who plays the drunk captain's girlfriend. What a performance! It's too bad that the slogan could not read: "Dressler Talks!"
