It's a sin to see how these things are done, but then again, we could not see the best "dummy scene" ever filmed. Ahhh the beauty of Bigfoot low budget movies, you look to see the beauty the more you look at them, it's if your brain does not melt first. As I said before, it's the best dummy scene ever! Words can not express it, you have to see it yourself. Wonderful lines such as "It smells like flesh", "They are human ..." (You'll know it when you see it) The creature makes a blah, blah! his and the scene where the baby is being shot will make you cry (with bursts of laughter) you will rewind it. A car chase, snowmobile chase, a Bigfoot folk song and a disco song. It does not stop there, looking at the credits, a friend noticed "Wardrobe provided by K-Mart". You ask, how can you even go as far as credits and then watch them? I could only explain that as a kind of brain shock, you are so mentally exhausted that you can not move and I guess you have to know who was behind the mess. That being said, it's a must if you want to mentally punish yourself. It's a guardian!
