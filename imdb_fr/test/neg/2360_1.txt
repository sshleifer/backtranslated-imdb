Absolutely useless ... since I was with the subject, I must say that it captures the atmosphere of clubbing without any respect. It could have been the case if the characters had not been just spokespersons for an incredibly terrible and unrealistic workout. So many crazy scenes that would shame The Office (this is not a compliment for this movie). It may have also helped to have a semblance of history, a point, a message, a comment, anything. Seriously, Kevin & Perry Go Large had more to say on the subject than this film (term used very vaguely in this case). There should be less reserved numbers for movies like this one. -10 (extra turd)
