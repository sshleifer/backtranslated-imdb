A tribute to honest piracy. I felt pretty much equivalent to her light pornography, until she lost her lack of technical and economic reality, emotional and moral sophistication became evident. <br /> <br /> Basically, a confused remake of the 'Real Genius' 90s, with fewer and more stupid geniuses, and a cynical ending. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this film will please someone who is thrilled by the thesis that it is almost as accidental to become a billionaire. Or maybe to the technical guys who like to be portrayed as cool and sexy. To speculate on why someone might like this movie is certainly more interesting than the movie itself. The end credits of the movie are more interesting than the movie itself.
