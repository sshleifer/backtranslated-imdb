OK, normally I'm fascinated by Z movies. Some of the actors, directors, writers, etc. of these films have talent. They want to get that talent, so unfortunately for them, they have to partner with rotten people to make their films. But some Z movies have at least one thing that deserves to be noticed. <br /> <br /> Not here. <br /> <br /> As soon as I saw it, I thought ... "Wow blade detaches. Believe me, if this film had been up to that label, it would have made a better movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, I suffered the most horrible acts I've ever seen in my life, so Master Kao was so mean that I think some of my neurons of my brain exploded trying to understand his acting. I always try to understand his saying and why he would raise his voice pronouncing certain words ... to add a dramatic effect, I'm sure .. . but that was no reason. Absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> Oh, and then there's the black guy in the purple cloak towards the end of the film. the guy at the purple cloak fight for the hero about 30 seconds, but it's so bad that he felt he was afraid of fighting. <br /> <br /> The main hero and the main villain did a decent job. The main hero (Derek Washington) seemed to know the martial arts.
