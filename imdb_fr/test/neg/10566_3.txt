An invading alien beast crashes into the Earth and quickly wreaks havoc on the population by first using its laser gun to dissolve into dust almost every human being he sees (ie when his target is not terribly extinct) then his naked claws with which he likes to tear up and eat the human spleen! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's pretty stupid. I have to give him some points to be a little fun sometimes. In fact, I enjoyed the senseless battle of early pistol rays and some of the latest super-gore effects. However, this does not help when the monster provides the only really entertaining moments of the movie and is not on the screen for much of the film's production time. The acting is simply horrible and amateurish, and our main hero, Sheriff Cinder, is far too unattractive to capture the hottest girl in the movie. I also have to take points for blatantly copying THE THING OF THE OTHER WORLD (1951) several times. When the monster is not unleashed, NIGHTBEAST is much too monotonous and its attacks become so repetitive and predictable, even if they become less fun. Look at this one back to back with the 1951 thing and see the difference in characterization, attention to plot and detail and creating a suspense for a monster in the movie in bulk.
