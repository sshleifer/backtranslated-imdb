Screenwriter and director Robert Downey, father, pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s, satirized the advertising world in New York's Madison Avenue with his avant-garde comedy "Putney Swope". Downey does not limit his ridiculousness to advertising, but attacks black activist culture, the dynamics of Hollywood's portrayal of the race, the white power structure, and the corrupt character of any power struggle. As bold and ambitious as "Putney Swope" strives to be, this is a horrendous film, made amateurishly on a tight budget, with an unnamed cast and a humor devoid of hilarity. Everything in this film stinks with improvisation. "Putney Swope" sparked controversy when it first appeared with its politically incorrect treatment of racial issues and consumer culture. As in most Marx Brothers movies, the plot is thin and provides an excuse for Downey's anecdotal gags, most of which are terrible. <br /> <br /> The president of a prestigious advertising agency Madison Avenue goes out at a board meeting. Before the body is removed, the council holds a secret ballot to determine who will replace it. Each member understands that they are prohibited from voting for themselves. The crash is obvious when everyone votes for the black symbolic member, Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), because no one thought someone would vote for him. Swope pink slips all white frames except one, surrounded by black employees and gun wrappers and renamed the firm "Truth and Soul Advertising". Swope decides to change the face of American advertising. He refuses to accept customers whose products are alcohol, tobacco or war toys. Swope's customers are on the run after the appointment as CEO, and grandstanding is attracting a new group of customers who come to his office, shuffling money bags and ready to be abused by militant employees. Swope. Swope also exploits its African-American staff, ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after being fired, and evoking a number of offensive advertising campaigns, all of which are hailed as a "new wave" of marketing genius. Incredibly, Swope's conservatism is proving effective, but the agency is becoming the target of government officials who say that Swope's advertising tactics are "a threat to national security." The height of this 85-minute black-and-white comedy is TV advertising in color. Unfortunately, Downey does not know when to remove those ads that always start smartly, but exhaust their welcome. The funniest part of "Putney Swope" concerns the relationship of our eponymous protagonist with US President Mimeo in Washington DC (Pepi Hermine), a marijuana salesman with a Teutonic advisor resembling Kissinger (Larry Wolf), who launches jokes tasteless while trying to convince Swope to offer an advertising campaign for his new car, the Borman 6.
