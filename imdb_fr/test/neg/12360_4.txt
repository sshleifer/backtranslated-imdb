The limited views of the landscapes were the only way to save an otherwise boring and undemanding film. The acting was on the verge of absurdity, which I blame the script and script. Nicole Eggert did not watch the game, did not play the game and was totally unconvincing as a mountain guide. After watching this, I found myself feeling that friends had some free time and decided to make a movie. It must have been produced on a currency budget. At best, the plot was lean and with the low caliber of acting from time to time, the question asked was, "Why are we doing this?". I managed to sit all the way through the movie, but I also wondered why.
