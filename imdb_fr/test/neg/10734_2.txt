"Although captivating (with some very tender moments) and humorous sporadically, the satire fulgurante" Homecoming "rests as a constraint and ultimately unsatisfactory.With a material like this, everything is in time (Michael Moore has published" Fahrenheit 9/11 "before the 2004 elections), and the real tragedy of Dante's film is that it did not come out two years ago, when its message would have carried an energy that would have stimulated more dissenters.

"<br /> <br /> Honestly, anyone could be convinced of anything either by a movie of zombies with fists closed with dubious information. <br /> <br /> and if you did not notice, Michael Moore did not really help defeat Bush. <br /> <br /> the film was nothing captivating. I just felt disgusted with the way the movie was flagrant and downright stupid, it was painful to watch. if you want to do something like that, you need a little wit. unfortunately it does not have any. a poorly made satire is actually the opposite of the desired effect. as they say, with friends like those who need enemies.
