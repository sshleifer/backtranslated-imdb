Another son of Sam is certainly not an Oscar. Technically, it's horrible. The acting game is not too good either. But there is something about it that makes you want to look more (a bit like a car wreck). The ridiculous close-ups of the killers' eyes are more funny than anything. If you are looking for a fear ... this is not the movie for you. It is very dark and almost impossible to find. I am sure there is a reason for that. For a moment, it was called HOSTAGE. No matter what you call it, it's still a bad choice for entertainment. This could be good for an MST3000 party or something. Can you believe they would use such a title as SAM'S OTHER SON? If it did not write about the farm, I'll eat my hat. I remember when it was shot in Belmont, NC. Many local personalities have been used as talent.
