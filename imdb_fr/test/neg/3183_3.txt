Before I took a position of criticism, I never went into films like this, and so I did not know that, in the soul of the Hollywood movie, there was a spirit deeply hating the woman who thrives little knees on the big screen for all to sympathize with, or to insult. Or is it just a particularly bad year? An ugly trend? <br /> <br /> Here, we have yet another apparently sweet, innocent and beautiful woman become a deadly weapon. The kind that warns us that behind every pair of beating eyes and nesting instinct is hiding a wild-eyed beast that will make everyone's life within 50 miles a hell. <br /> <br /> This month's specimen is Jewel Valentine's (Liv Tyler), whose simple dreams include having her own little house, a fountain in the backyard and a mondo entertainment system. Unfortunately, Randy (Matt Dillon, in his first film in 3 years), the barman with the low lamp that she comes looking for McCool one night with the intention to fly, has a less material orientation. He's the kind of guy who drinks beer in the bathroom, prefers to stay in his deceased mother's house with little comfort and save his snowglobe collection. <br /> <br /> In this same low-rent bar, the devil in the red dress also meets Randy's cousin, Carl (the fun Paul Reiser), a lawyer with an ego the size of St. Louis. When things go south in a few hours, enter the widowed detective with a gold heart (John Goodman). The result? Three men have a big crush on the offspring of Steven Tyler and Bebe Buell, dressed in leopards, who make them do things that common sense would normally be contraindicated. For example, get involved. <br /> <br /> Many points of view and flashbacks gather information on the front page about how easy it is to become a victim of your libido, especially if you are a man. While each of these men associates his point of view with a confidant, his desire to possess The Jewel colors the "truth" of the situation. About 70 minutes later, things are pretty fun. But it's a fun from the same source that tells you that things about popcorn actually have a taste of butter. <br /> <br /> MCCOOL'S is the first film by Norwegian director of commercials and music videos Harald Zwart, and his pedigree is clear in some fantastic segments, including one on a car wash, a soap and a pipe that you can probably extrapolate. It is also the first project of the production company of Michael Douglas, who found his niche as a ball on demand in a bingo parlor. <br /> <br /> Dillon and Tyler are unlikely to win gold statues for this one. given the dimensionality of their excessive black-film type characters, you can not really blame them. Reba McEntire plays Carl's psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay plays both the role of thug Utah and his brother even more scary. (Finally, an outlet for all this aggression.) <br /> <br /> This film says a lot about the dynamics between men and women - or between men and their moms. But eventually, you will probably find more lasting psychological truths in an episode of Bugs Bunny. I would say it's better, funnier, more sophisticated than other recent gems like TOMCATS, but should we really choose what to see based on the lowest ranks on the misogynist scale?
