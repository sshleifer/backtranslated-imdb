There is not much of "Reckless" that seems to be going well, starting with the title rebutant (thanks to screenwriter Craig Lucas, who adapted his own piece by bringing the title with him) and to continue the casting ( wife playing Mia Farrow Tony Goldwyn, who is young enough to be his son). The couple lives in an idyllic winter world that seems to be inside a snow globe, but Farrow acquires a surprising dose of reality after confessing to hiring a man to kill her. She fled into the night, taking refuge with a very strange couple who wants to help her rebuild her life. The design of the production and the artistic direction of "Reckless" are acceptable, but they are services rendered for a completely absurd scenario, often alienating. This is supposed to be a dark holiday comedy, although the cast is distraught with this little funny and sometimes offensive material. * 1/2 of ****
