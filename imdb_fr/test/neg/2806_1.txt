If you have visited eastern Europe (or even its armed forces), this film might be of interest to you. I do not know why it's called a comedy (of course, there are some funny moments), but it's not a good movie if one of the service's officers speaks for 15 minutes of the achievements of socialism during a Christmas dinner, and Officers in general act like funny moguls, soldiers run to the base to meet their daughters at night, and surprise, surprise, one of the girls is the commander's daughter. The army of East Germany was known for the abusive and humiliating service of its conscripts and the comedy was in principle not filmed on the scene nor with the equipment necessary to make a good film on the army. from East Germany and its bygone era. Despite this, some actors and actresses have tried to play well, but this only appears in the roles for which they are known on East German television and some small films. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it was basically boring and very cheap.
