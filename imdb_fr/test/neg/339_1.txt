I really did not like this movie ~ !!!! it was boring and did not interest me at all ... I am more of an action girl and she had NO. I went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left .. but was totally misleading! Do not get this movie if you do not like dessert and do not bother too much. I really did not like the movie. it was not my style, but it could be yours .. you just have to watch the previews or something, but that's my recommendation if you're a girl ... do not get this movie ! This Scandinavian production is inspired by some of Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi observation strategies, allowing us to reflect on the patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both an intimate and radical perspective. it's just not for me!
