Overall, it was a visible movie. I did not interrupt or prevent him from returning - a clear sign of a boring film - so the first test was successful. Best of all, the movie quickly went down in history, without a boring and useless story for the characters. <br /> <br /> It will never be considered an excellent movie. Neither as a big movie B. I would recommend this movie to slasher / horror fans who do not mind the release of videos. <br /> <br /> Unlike some films of this genre, there is no nudity, only moderate language and a rather moderate gore. There is, however, violence. The dead were rather dry and devoid of imagination. The special effects of the computer were actually quite good. The way the "creature" used its strings in some scenes reminded me of "Spawn" and the comics "Ghost Rider". <br /> <br /> A little pet peeve ... It takes place in Lousinie, but no one seems to speak with any accent. I had to watch the credits to realize that the film was shot in Lousinia. <br /> <br /> As in most low-budget films, filming has small blunders. Lack of time and money would be the main factor for gaffes. For example, in a scene, he spent the middle of the afternoon in the dark in a few seconds ... during a short drive. The other example was the stunt double for the "creature" who did not have "creature" makeup when she was falling off the tow truck ... it also looks like he is wearing a shirt in the scene. <br /> <br /> In summary, I did not hate this movie but I did not like it either. I will probably never rent it again, but if a friend had it, I might look at it in a few years.
