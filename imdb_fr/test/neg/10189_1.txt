After a good start, it turned out to be the worst piece of holiness I have ever seen. This film is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the "Holy Bible". <br /> <br /> To sum up ... OK, let's call it a plot ... Basically, an alien does not take away people (whom we already know ..). No, in fact, his demonic forces remove people who are in the new age or witchcraft, or who read a porn magazine (as does a protagonist). <br /> <br /> It's complete with the little emotional piano music when the main character realizes he must blindly follow Christ to be saved. <br /> <br /> a quote sums it all up, imagine a subtle piano music in the background: "You can not let others, even those you love, stop you from Lord .." <br /> <br /> and we are supposed to live in an enlightened age ... there is still work to be done. Boycott this shit
