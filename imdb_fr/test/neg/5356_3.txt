Normally, I would applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre. It is obvious that this film is a kind of parody of ninja movies. And I really did my best to enjoy the movie. But I just could not. The jokes are not funny enough! (I've seen my share of Japanese movies, and most of the time, I like and understand the humor used in these movies. "Red Shadow" is just silly!) The characters in this movie know it's not is not the case. a serious movie and show that everything is about pleasure. Watch parody characters like "Hot Shots" or "Scary Movie". Everything they do on the screen is done with an impassive face and never falls outside the character! And because of that, some scenes become funny and hilarious. In "Red Shadow", the actors never realize that. The shadow ninja is supposed to be very skilled and deadly. Unfortunately, the actors do not do their best to convince us of their talents. They do not do things with an impassive face. The jokes would have worked better if they had done it! The bad choreography of action scenes also hurt the viewing experience. I love humor in martial arts movies as long as the action is good. "Red Shadow" fails in this department. So what remains to savor? Well, the music (techno) was uplifting. The action must never be exciting. And there are short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. The use of humor, the lack of history and depth make me think that this film is for children. But I wonder if kids would really like this movie. Waste of time!
