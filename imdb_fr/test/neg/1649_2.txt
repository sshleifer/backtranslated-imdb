The perfect double bill for "Beverly Hillbillies", a horribly old-fashioned, is this equally dreadful and lame "comedy", "His in Law". Rebecca, a peasant girl, goes to California to go to college, but she is attacked by her lifestyle. The "toad" of "Resident Adviser" helps him get settled and the two friends quickly become good friends. Bec decides to bring back the crazy "Crawl" home for Thanksgiving, with obvious results "fish out of the water". <br /> <br /> The only other comic angle that Steve Rash (well named) realizes here is a sexual one. He's clubbing us with that, but to no avail. Both aspects of the comics fail miserably, and you know that the movie is groping when "Crawl" diverts the combine and writes its name in the corn field. <br /> <br /> From a dramatic point of view, the film is also missing, with several attempts on the part of his family. and personal advice of "Crawl" missed. Between them, Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino manage to raise a few smiles, but nothing else, while the rest of the cast are just fodder. The problem is that it's almost impossible to really like "Crawl", and you'll find yourself spending the whole movie wondering why Rebecca would want to spend time with him. However, if you are a fan of comedy without intelligence, "His in Law" is absolutely right. <br /> <br /> Sunday, November 10, 1996 - T.V.
