This is an excellent movie for beginner ninjas who go out together. If you are trying to impress a pretty little ninjette, I highly recommend playing this masterpiece. This is one of those special movies that lets you forget big games without interfering with the plot. <br /> <br /> In addition, I also wondered where is a Teal ninja? Do ninjas have a color code like this? Is this normal? If I were attacked by one of those yellow or orange ninjas, I would die laughing before succumbing to his sword. <br /> <br /> And I finished my Ninja Black Star test the other day, it was multiple choice, it went pretty good. I discovered that there were a lot of questions about how to "sneak in" and look at evil. It's all about eyebrows and attitude. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie could have been better if: 1. There were no color-coded ninjas (or color-coded ninjas could be combined into a super ninja). 2. Joe died in the first two minutes and Patricia had to take revenge. 3. Various monkeys were scattered throughout the file. 4. Patricia did not speak and Patricia was replaced by another character. 6. The Frenchman was also a black ninja. 7 Chris Tucker, Whoopi Golderg and Chris Rock were added as "comics" in relief 8. The ninja's strengths came from miticlorians.
