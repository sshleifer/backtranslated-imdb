This movie is really amazing. Over the years, I have become fond of films about Japanese monsters and I am well aware that the first examples of this kind can be mediocre. However, this one reaches a new low, because it follows the adventures of Johnny Sokko (?), A young boy who controls a giant robot, and his fight against the evil Gargoyle Gang, who seems to have an inexhaustible stock of their disposition.
