Kennan Ivory Wayans was so funny in Low Down Dirty Shame that I had to see this one. It was one of the worst he did and Steven Seagal did not help him much. It starts with some religious killings that do not make much sense to Jim Campbell (Keenan). He is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work with him to solve the case, but Jack Cole does not seem to be what everyone thinks he is until his ex-wife is killed in one of those ritual murders that end up making him the suspect too. It's the same as all his other films: Smoke Past, CIA involvement and now trying to be a normal cop. Why does Steven dress like he's from a Western movie? And prayer is above it makes things a bit confusing.
