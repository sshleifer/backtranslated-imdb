Have you ever watched something so horrible that you just have to look to make sure it's as bad as it looks? This is one of those movies. It was criticized by critics when it was published, especially for the way it was funded. I saw it on television last night and I gave in to curiosity. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is what is written on the box, neither more nor less: low level humor, crudity, much in the 'Carry On ...' vein but with an adult language . Indeed, it goes back to the British porn industry of the years 60/70, deceiving the bettors by promising them of the true sex and by not delivering them (to locate the nipple?). All this troubled period is recreated here with love, but with a modern cinematography. He enjoys the benefits of Mackenzie Crook (The Office, Pirates of the Caribbean and more) and Johnny Vegas. The girl in the french fries shop is really sexy. Beyond these unexpected aspects, I really wonder what happened to England. Junk food, low paid work, advice, desperate lives. As a bonus, there are some nice leafy Birmingham plans. Foreigners might find it informative about British attitudes and aspirations. On the whole, though, I still feel incredulous about having been there.
