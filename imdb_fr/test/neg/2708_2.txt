A film that tears the ear, an almost old-fashioned screwball game designed to showcase the comedic attributes of the Madonna star. She is indeed far away on the proverbial branch, playing here a parolee too keen trying to prove that she was accused of murder (a body was found in the trunk of his car after lighting a red light ... large bursts of laughter). After an energetic and animated sequence of credits - which is a lot more fun than the rest of the photo - we only have to look at Madonna's black mascara and red lips with her platinum hair and pale complexion. What else is there? Griffin Dunne seems defeated as Maddy's goalkeeper, while underprivileged players find it hard to laugh with a lousy dialogue. This is an unfortunate setback to the talents of director James Foley, who unwittingly lets his star go wild in the spirit of the wacky movies of the 1930s (but even Katharine Hepburn in "Bringing Up Baby" had a human side). Wretched. * from ****
