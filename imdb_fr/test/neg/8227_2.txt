Filmed in my old hometown by two college students, this film is centered on a monster named "luther". Luther, recently released on parole (revealed by an arbitration board in one of the most ridiculous scenes of all time), runs to the local grocery store eating an old woman's neck with her metal teeth . <br /> <br /> Luther runs to the farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, ties an old woman, gets chased and gets killed. Oh, and SUPERBOY's nana is naked.
