This movie changed my life! Hogan's performance was absolutely incredible, and I still have not recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 Oscar nominations. And as brilliant as Hulkster may appear in this film, you can not ignore the brilliant writing and direction that has allowed this masterpiece to become one of the film's highest achievements. If you have not seen this movie, give up what you are doing now and get a copy. I guarantee you that will amaze you. And if you do not like it, then I just have a question for you ... Watcha will do it when the 24 inch pythons and Hulkamania will unleash you !!!
