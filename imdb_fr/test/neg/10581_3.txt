Here is a guaranteed spoof to entertain the people of Homer Simpson's IQ lineup. This is a low blow for all the great superheroes, including Spiderman and Batman. But it does not stop there. it worsens more and more until it disintegrates into a pathetic set of trollop gaffes near the load. <br /> <br /> For those who are interested in the plot, just watch Spiderman under the influence of a heavy narcotic. What do you get is Dragonfly Man ?? an amazed boy, who loves the girl next door, suddenly inheriting huge super powers. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning while brushing your teeth, but do not do it. take me at the word! For children, it's pretty fun. for adults, it's a good movie to let kids down.
