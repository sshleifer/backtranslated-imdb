The plot was not good. <br /> <br /> The special effects were not. <br /> <br /> The acting game was ... not very good at all. <br /> <br /> Like others, I felt that the plot had many holes that could be stolen, well, a space shuttle through. <br /> <br /> I thought the ending was pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> By the way guys, about the "torch in space". <br /> <br /> The blow torches have their own supply of oxygen (hence the name "oxyacetylene torch"). Two torches start from the torch: one for a bottle of acetylene and one for a bottle of oxygen. <br /> <br /> Thus, a "flashlight" would work perfectly in space.
