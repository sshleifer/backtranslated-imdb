I turned it off in the first five minutes. It's very sick and disturbing, the moment I turned it off is when the beautiful white horse was left at the slaughterhouse and his skull was perforated by a small instrument with a horn. This creature was lying on the floor in shock before dying. The narrator stated that the animal died instantly, this is not the case. I do not agree with the graphic realism towards animals, insects or any living being. I was very disappointed because I had just watched Eyes Without a Face, a brilliant film to which this short film was attached, which ruined my night. /> <br /> Reading the other reviews on this page, I noticed they used words such as aesthetics - it's neither art nor beauty. I can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic.
