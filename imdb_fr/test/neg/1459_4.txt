It's hard to decide what to say about this one. It's not totally bad at one hundred percent. Although the movie in a movie is incredibly bad, supposed to be campy, but missing by a mile. I'm pretty sure it's intentional, though. Danny Aiello is perfect here, and more or less nails his pathetic character. Dyan Cannon was good in a small role. Clotilde Courau was impressive as the last girlfriend in her twenties. And Linda Carlson had a brave topless scene that she did very well. <br /> <br /> It's not bad, but I do not think it achieves its goals. Overall, it's probably worth it.
