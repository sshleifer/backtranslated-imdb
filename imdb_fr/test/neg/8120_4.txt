Dreadful movie about a doctor who goes fishing and catches a mermaid when he is thrown into the sea. She encourages him to bring her back with him. <br /> <br /> Glynis Johns, in the main role, is really an idiot with a hanging tail. <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric but we do not see any eccentricity here. In fact, Miss Rutherford was not allowed to use her real comic gifts. <br /> <br /> Nice to see David Tomlinson in the movie. 16 years later, he would end up with "Mary Poppins", his superior superior. <br /> <br /> Miranda is talking nonsense: two fiancees, a neighbor's fianc√©e and the driver (Tomlinson) fall in love with her. <Br /> <br /> Ask any siren you see, what's the best tuna, Chicken in the Sea! As for this film, forget it.
