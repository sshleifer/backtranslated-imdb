Bad, bad, and did I mention bad? Aside from the comic monster terrorizing the workers, the funniest part of the film was when the surveyors are in the desert and a commentator tells them that they still have an hour of daylight, but you can clearly see through their shadows, only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about consistency. READ THE SCRIPT director! <br /> <br /> The only interesting part of this movie, aside from Clara Bryant's locker of course (as another reviewer has mentioned), is the ghost skeleton horse on which Bone Eater rides. This thing was pretty cool as it sued the surveyors on their motorcycles.
