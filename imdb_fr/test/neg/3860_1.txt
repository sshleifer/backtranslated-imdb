I only looked at Joe Morton in the first role and I sincerely wished that I would not have bothered him. He can and has since done a lot better than this shit. I do not understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but everyone in turn; it's an absolute mess and not funny at all. No wait, ONE line only was funny, while Mr Kent (Joe) and his family were dining with this job, as he was invited to dinner (only God knows why). Pest to Mr Kent: You know what the dog is, you went there. Ms Kent: Not recently, Joe's expression was funny, but a sentence does not make a great comedy and that tattoo is so far from funny that it should be. to be recorded in the nearest garbage truck, that's enough for that. Joe Morton - glad to see you no longer appear in rubbish like this; you are far superior and a great actor.
