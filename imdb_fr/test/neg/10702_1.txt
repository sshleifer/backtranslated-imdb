All I heard while I was high was gender equality. Here we have a film that not only illustrates the imbalance, but pursues the whole concept that sex is better. All this time, I hoped that this redemptive quality would give the viewer the feeling that there was hope for the future, and there was none. I'll admit I did not finish the movie, I had to turn it off at the party where the old fucking man had confided to the genetic man Adam that it was acceptable to be a whore and get, and I quote : "No more tail than any man in the past time" I know that finishing is not a bad criticism on my part, but it is the responsibility of the writer and the team to develop a story which will interest the viewer, and they have failed. This film betrays all the true feminine qualities of the maternal figure and the need for balance. Instead, it illustrates what a lesbian natzis-led America would look like, and I'm not against lesbians. Thank you, Mr Director! Someone please give me a redemptive quality ... wait i have it! There is no continuation!
