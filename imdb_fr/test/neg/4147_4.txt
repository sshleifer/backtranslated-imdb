I really wanted to love this movie, because I love Troma and the trailer, as well as "Ghouls", another Ferrin film. There were almost good moments, like the love song of the old hit on the scene of the car accident, and a scene near the end where the protagonist is closed. But overall, it was boring and slightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The "unimaginable" shocks imagined by Ferrin were really predictable and exhausted. Poop, murder of prostitutes, incest. It could have been good, but badly done. I do not know if he was trying to offend, amuse or both. In the end, we watch movies on Troma because we want films that have heart. This film did not always feel like a heart. There were good scenes, but finally it was dull and unpleasant.
