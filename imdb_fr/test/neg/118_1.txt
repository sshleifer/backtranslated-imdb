Honestly horrible movie, bad editing, awful lighting, awful dialogue and heartbreaking storyline. <br /> <br /> The lighting is so bad that there are times when you can not even see what happens, I even tried to play with the contrast. and the brightness so that I could see something but it did not help me. <br /> <br /> They had to find the script in a bin, the development of the character is just as horrible and even if you just wait for Jean-Claude Van Damme's film manages to reach a record level. You can not even laugh at cheese. <br /> <br /> The staging and editing are also terrible, the whole film follows an extremely tiring routine and fails at every turn as it advances through the weak plot, it's just unreal . <br /> <br /> There is not much else to say that it is really bad and that nothing resembles the previous work of Jean-Claude Van Damme that could please you. <br /> <br /> Avoid as the plate, frankly the words I miss to condemn this "film".
