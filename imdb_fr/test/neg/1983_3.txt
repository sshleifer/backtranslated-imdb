I really like Kinski, he's a great actor. I saw this film because I heard that this film had autobiographical aspects. <br /> <br /> The film is full of symbols, like a piano sinking into a river or impressive paintings of shadows on the walls. Then, the narrator always says abstract phrases such as: "A child sells fortune, but his box is empty now." This is really disturbing and not really necessary, because everyone understands what this movie is about. The film shows how Kinski's character treated the woman and how he kept her under control. If there are really aspects of Kinski's life in this story, then he was really a pig. It is not necessary to watch this movie, unless you want to see Kinski naked or if you like to laugh with sick trash movies.
