The reason this film is nil, did these people even read a Bible? Everything in the movie was about Moses, God stayed out of it. THIS IS NOT ARRIVED! God directed everything, he told them where to go and what to do. Also, people have been wandering for 40 years AFTER their arrival in Canan and have again betrayed God! They did not roam for 40 years, then suddenly found it. It was a punishment for their doubts. Maybe if the people who made the film started by taking a Bible, they would say, "No, we were wrong, try again. Everything in this movie was about Moses. They made God look like a fool who had played with Moses all the time. NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!! God was theirs all the time and he wanted people to know he was taking care of them. How dare they say the opposite, not even near the passage. AND Moses was excluded because he was angry with the people and flagrantly disobeyed God! He sinned badly and was told that he would not be allowed to enter for this. When did Moses run away and shout to God for everything in the Bible? NEVER!!!!!! In fact, read your story before creating what you think is a good idea. Moreover, all this God has stayed out of most people and asked them to do it himself is not true !!! God did everything for people, He provided them with every way and God told them where to go. He was there all the time. Everything we have to do ourselves is true in some ways, but at the time it did not work that way! Yes today, he does not work directly for everyone to see, but at the time, he actually killed people after the golden calf thing! God worked directly with people. Read the Bible Next Time Echo Bridge or do not do another Bible movie!
