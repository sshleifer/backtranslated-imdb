I agree with the comments of other users. Hard to believe that this film was released in 1994 because it screams in the mid-80s. I think it's dubbed because the sound and the image do not always match. If anyone can really say that it's a good movie, it must be locked up. It is so sad to see how much money is so powerful on people that they will do everything to get it. I feel that I lost my intelligence by watching this. I had a little respect for Chuck Norris before watching this, but now I feel bad. I bought this as part of a 3-pack for $ 9.99 and I can honestly say I would have done better to throw the money in the trash. Forgive me Jesus.
