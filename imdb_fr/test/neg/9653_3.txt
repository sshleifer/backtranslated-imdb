First of all, let me say that I do not deny the importance of the subject, on the contrary. I am Polish and have known about the Katyn massacre for quite a long time (in fact, two of my family members have died there), so I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem lies in the script, which includes too many sub-plots and characters, none of which are properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are related, but lack general meaning. In my opinion, the actors do not really have the chance to show their abilities. Andrzej Chyra, with Jerzy, is the only interesting character. I wish the story is more focused on him. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film lacks emotion. Before I saw him, I thought I would be moved, if only for sentimental reasons - but in fact, I was looking at him with a strange feeling of detachment, except for the scene of the final execution. It is well done and its establishment is interesting and offers a culminating end, although the idea of ​​reciting the Lord's prayer in unison by the executed officers seems a bit far-fetched. To conclude, I suppose the film may have educational value for those who are not familiar with the historical events portrayed, but in my opinion, it fails as a movie work.
