Okay, okay, I'm a fan of low-budget horror, which comes with an occasional piece of garbage that even the most assiduous fans of movies in the country can not bear to testify ... TRANCERS 6, directed by Jay Woelfel of DEMONICUS. <br /> <br /> First of all, the series TRANCERS, created in the mid-80s by Charlie Band and his Empire Pictures, is essentially the franchise that it is because of Tim Thomerson and his excellent performance. of the trance hunter Jack Deth. Well, down and because of the reduced budget of Full Moon's features (which, despite what people have said, have brought very high quality features, such as HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING), Thomerson is not income for the sixth time. Courtney Joyner, writer of Full Moon, returns once again and delivers another scenario below the average, in which Jack Deth (played by Thomerson ... in flashbacks, extremely badly inserted ... he has a different hairstyle, like every time he is shown, and some "shemp" lying on a table) descending along the body in the body of his daughter. From now on, you have "Jo Deth" who plays Jack ... but it's a shame that she does not produce the same screen presence as Jack Deth. <br /> <br /> The film, shot in 16mm, is simply an embarrassment for the name of TRANCERS ... no offense to anyone at Young Wolf Productions. I want to say that I respect you for your willingness to make a film TRANCERS without Tim, but with a little more time (even if it is filmed since December 2001), it could have been better. <br /> <br /> However, check out the Full Moon DVD, which is a dual feature with the original TRANCERS, and features trailers for the last 10 features of Full Moon. <br /> <br /> All in all, I probably would have liked it more if it does not have the name TRANCERS, but like anything, you can judge by the opinion of someone and you have to check it yourself!
