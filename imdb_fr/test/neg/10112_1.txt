Hey guys and girls! Never praise, or God forbid, buy this trash. I have rarely seen a movie in a genre as bad as this one. The acting is actually worse than me and my friends did it when we were 7 years old and in category 1 we had to play in front of all the parents and siblings. In fact, we would have been supported for the Oscars, if we had been compared to the actors of Darkhunters. The story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the shooting is terrible, the scenery is horrible, the staging is horrible, etc. what my girlfriend found a little cute. Please, use your money on other things than this movie .... I could not even see the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, it was so terrible .. If anyone really liked This movie, I'd like to hear about you, and I'll try to see if I can get you any advice from a psychiatrist near you. It's certain..
