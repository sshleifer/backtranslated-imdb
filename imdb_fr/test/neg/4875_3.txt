This film is not worth seeing, at least not in a cinema. The story is hard to follow and understand (it starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years ago). It's hard to know if this movie is becoming a comedy or is so bad / strange that it sometimes looks like it. The American sirens and the lights of the Swedish police cars are just one example. The roles of Persbrandt and Bergqvist are good, but I think Jenny Lampa plays Jasmine and she acts very badly. Zara Zetterqvist plays pretty well, she has not been seen as an actor in Swedish movies for a long time. If you still want to see it, wait for it to be released on DVD or posted on TV.
