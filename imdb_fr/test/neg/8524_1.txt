I'm sorry but I can not agree that it was a good movie. Yes, it looked good, but it's the story that animates the film and I must say that the story is fucked. How in the world have they managed to get some of these dead ends to criticism? Better story and I would have given a higher vote, but I could not do it and still be able to live with myself. I've always been a fan of horror movies, and the glimpses really fooled me. All scary scenes have been shown in the previews. And why did the family that was killed stay to haunt the house? Why did the father come back? WHY did he decide to kill in the first place? Why were children the only ones to see ghosts first? To many questions, not enough answers. If I could give him a zero, I would have.
