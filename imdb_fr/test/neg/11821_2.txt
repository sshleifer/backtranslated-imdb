Imagine an exploiting remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other. Describe the story on a Caribbean island where drug traffickers reign and where the revolution has arrived. And ask the black woman to be in Huggy Bear's ladies' stable and the white woman to be a sweetener, Patty Hearst, and you'll have Black Mom, White Mom. <br /> <br /> In these days of decline of the drive-in theater this article must have been a big old hit. All the hot buttons of the 70s are embedded in it. Even if they dress better and get some whistles from the audience, nobody will confuse Pam Grier and Margaret Markov with Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. All right, Halle Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> Margaret and Pam are prisoners where the guards and the guard look lasciviously at the new fish that is coming. Margaret is a wealthy state girl who has embraced the "revolution," while Pam is your highest-priced call girl, who serves the local drug king and is tired of seeing and trying it. to leave the island. <br /> <br /> Margaret's revolutionary companions ambush the bus that carried them from the women's prison to the city, but they get lost in flight. The two programs have different goals, but like Sid and Tony, they can not agree on the agenda of their priorities. It's been an interesting time for the police, drug traffickers and revolutionaries to search for these two unlucky buddies. <br /> <br /> Just so you do not have any misconceptions, the leader of the revolutionaries and Markov's partner is Ernesto and is played by Filipino actor Zaldy Zshornack. The whole mess was shot in the Philippines as they began to create their own film industry. <br /> <br /> It's all that Black Mama, White Mam has to recommend to photograph places. But if you are a fan of very bad black exploitation movies, this is for you.
