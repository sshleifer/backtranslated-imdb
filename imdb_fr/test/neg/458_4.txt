After the turn of NIGHT MUST FALL, Robert Montgomery (for the most part) has entered his best films and performances: HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, they were spent, the lady in the lake, ride the pink horse, the saxon charm, the June bride. Even some of his failures were interesting enough to be observable (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR AND MS SMITH). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and production work. In 1949, he realized what would be his last performance: he played Collier Lang, a selfish movie star, who helped the authorities investigate the boyfriend of a girl. <br /> <br /> Apparently, my point of view of this film is a minority opinion. Most of the opinions expressed are favorable. I thought it was a dull and foolish scenario, with Ann Blyth's groupie heroine unattractive as a character. She admires Montgomery as a star, and it "helps" when he is called to help the authorities, but after a while, I discovered that there was no chemistry between them. The scenario was also very entertaining, although Montgomery and Roland Winters tried. The only thing I still remember today is that Taylor Holmes is Blyth's rich father and he is an admirer of Winston Churchill. So, he still dresses like Churchill, and he's seen wearing a big brimmed hat, smoking a big cigar and painting (Holmes's bald head helps to conceal his disguise). This was the most memorable joke of this movie - not really a memory. <br /> <br /> Montgomery started watching television early in the year and eventually attracted the attention and respect he had always deserved in the movies. His last contact with the cinema was his direction of THE GALLANT HOURS about Admiral William "Bull" Halsey, with his friend Jimmy Cagney. It's a much better movie than this one. For his career in film and television, I will give a "4" to this mediocre film. It seems generous to me.
