Every great romantic comedy needs a conflict between its tracks to give suspense, anticipation and seduction to the plot. This story falls completely flat in this area. There is no conflict - at least none could prevent the eventual union of the two main characters, and the suspense is therefore flat, there is no anticipation and there is really no allure. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is at best the friendship, and with the talent of these two particular actors, I was quite surprised. During the movie, I was more expecting them to play a checkers game and discuss the weather than to see a moving passion. <br /> <br /> Even though I'm a fan of both actors, I really believe this movie was off - or maybe the direction was off the base and it had an impact on their deliveries. The writing was very weak, which could also have an impact on the performances; most certainly, the script could have used the help of harlequin writers who have concrete experience of the heat. <br /> <br /> This film may be worth watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon, cheap shelf. <br /> <br /> (Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).
