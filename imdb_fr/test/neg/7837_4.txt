The maximum risk is quite surprising for a person who has seen more than his films. Director Ringo Lam has produced a medium action movie that can be compared to most other medium-quality action films, which is a special predicate of the movie Muscles from Brussels. He has a fairly classy style, an interesting atmosphere and, finally, the beautiful Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme does not make you cry with his acting, he does his job pretty well. Of course, you can not compare Maximum Risk (oh, what creative title!) To "Ronin", but after watching "Knock off", it's the hell of a good movie ... with special standards , of course.
