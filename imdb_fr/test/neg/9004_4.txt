I had a bit of hope for this one-hour film made up of old Poverty Row footage. Admittedly, he had the opportunity to appear more than just mass commercialized video in the world. Unfortunately, although funny, this film still looks like a movie at home, but with thick archive footage. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns the planned reading of a testament on a liner at midnight somewhere in the tropics. The ship is sinking and well ... it's the movie. <br /> <br /> The film promises Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney and others to release old movies to interact with new images. This is not a problem, but most of the time, we get a lot of new video clips that look like black and white movies, in which new actors are promoting. The old sequences are mostly made for staging, but very few old and new matches, so it's just a bet. This is not very convincing and is very disappointing for someone like me who was looking for a better built film. <br /> <br /> Still if you know and love the old movies of Poverty Row (its very distorted), this might be worth viewing. I advise you to buy it, but you can get it for about five dollars, the price of a rental), so you have the choice (you can however do it without charge). <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
