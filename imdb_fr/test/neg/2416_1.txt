There are good and bad movies and bad and bad movies and movies badly ... it's not one of them. This is a movie that does not realize how bad it is. <br /> <br /> I saw it during a screening on November 14, 2006 at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles as part of the "Grindhouse Cinema" this theater is every month. Hope that presenters Eric Caiden & co. think twice before leaving author / director Lawrenece Foldes again. The guy got up to speak before the movie - you'd think he was Orson Welles talking about "Touch of Evil" or some other lost classic. Barely. Nice of him to devote 20 minutes of his time to the public with his inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> "Young Warriors" has been described as a cross between "Animal House" and "Death Wish", but if you're waiting for something like imitations, like "Revenge of the Nerds" or "The Exterminator" "" You will be in a sad disappointment The script makes no sense The direction is so poor that the actors look embarrassed and what can you say when the best in the movie is to watch a car explode? Poor Richard "shaft" Roundtree In this film, he plays another character with the name "John", but that's about the only similarity of his character with the aforementioned classic. Hope this movie has allowed him to pay the rent for another month Ernest Borgnine and Linda Day George are some of the other actors who seem to want to be anywhere else. <br /> <br /> It's a loss of time, even the audience did not seem to be as much (except for the only Spazz boy sitting in the back screaming "whoa" every five minutes and his girlfriend laughing with the fervor of a lobotomized talkative Barbie every time he opened his mouth). <br /> <br /> For real movies about vigilantes, I would suggest the following: <br /> <br /> Death Wish I, II, III, Exterminator I, Vigil Force, Mrs. 45, Rolling Thunder, the No-Mercy Man (the last two being a pair of movies shown on this theater a few years ago - probably the same budget as "Young Warriors" but both were a million times better!)
