Aside from the fact that this movie was shot (I guess it seemed like a good idea at the time to consider BOTTOM as so popular), the thing that intrigued me about GUEST HOUSE PARADISO is what it has happened to the lighting? There is absolutely no artificial light used in this movie, and I watched it on the network TV not to watch a fishy tape. In fact, the film was shot so dark that it was impossible to see what was happening. But if it was a dialogue, maybe it's not a bad thing
