When I was young, I got up early every Saturday morning not to watch cartoons, but to turn on the local channel for what was called "Kung Fu Theater". It was not like these movies were works of art. It's not as if these films were all from China, Japan, Korea, or any particular country; if history had to do with fights ?? Whether swordplay or punches ?? and if the fighting did not look like anything that happened in an American gym class, that was enough. It was not like they were really good. They were great action movies with incredibly dramatic music where the hero took revenge on a crowd of villains, then the credits rolled. <br /> <br /> "Sword in the Moon" looks a lot like those films of my youth, probably a bit like a well-received thematic return by tangling characters enough to make it more and more difficult to distinguish the wicked from the good. <br /> <br /> Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as "the human butcher". He quickly and mercilessly kills in the name of the Chun Dynasty, the main bodyguard of an emperor who spared his life and the lives of his men in exchange for his services. However, an equally ruthless rebel and his adorable companion appear in the countryside and start murdering imperial ministers, and Yun agrees to find and kill these rebels. His task becomes a personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend of his past) and his old love, Shi Yeong. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Sword" does not have much to do. to distinguish oneself from other action films. A breathtaking cinematography is almost completely ruined by poor quality editing. Parts of the film have been assembled so hard to believe that it is inevitable that what the film has managed to do passes to the film. While the atmosphere and narrative tend to sink into a dark atmosphere, the tone is almost sacrificed to the endless parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters gets a story in good health. What should have been a quick and easy action movie is weighed down by too much personal baggage and the film suffers. <br /> <br /> I read that this film marks the first real incursion of Korea into the world of art works of art house like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". Next time, I would strongly suggest producers stick to a little more "martial" and a little less "art".
