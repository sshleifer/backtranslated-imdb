What was the purpose of this boring movie? At first, it seemed very interesting, but it quickly fell flat. it's supposed to be based on a true story, but to shout, are there no more writers in Hollywood? man iv'e seen these guys in some of the best movies ever made, defoe can play pretty much anything and when i see he's in a movie i have no problem renting it but i start to ask me.redford also great actor is also slipping; maybe their hard or just lose their senses. the dialogue was long and terribly heavy, especially at home with the family. I wonder if the actors thought to have a success here? maybe ... uh ... an Oscar?
