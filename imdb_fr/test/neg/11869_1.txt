OK, I'll be brief. This movie was not only bad, it was really bad, with phrases like "if you're dealing with the devil, you're sure you do not have shoes", you know your hideous movie territory. After watching this movie, I wanted to kill myself and kill all my family. It gave me such a sense of disgust that I wanted to commit murder. do not watch this movie. I will kill again. but when I do, it will be terribly mounted with a pathetic soundtrack and action plan for renting action sequences and bad shirts. Fortunately, there is a setback, this is the first action movie to present a three-door ford. <br /> <br /> unfortunately, his roof eventually breaks :( <br /> <br /> Ps: worse than the sniper
