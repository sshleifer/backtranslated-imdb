Rob Lowe must have eaten the entire budget, but I can not blame him for running with that money. Even if he had to agree, this movie was not good. Filming, editing, staging, dialogues, sets, make-up, writing, casting (especially the girl and the pedophile child psychologist), and history were all the worst. I have never seen such a horrible movie. Pass this one for any other rental or find yourself screaming about bad comments on TV. Dead Silent should be silenced forever.
