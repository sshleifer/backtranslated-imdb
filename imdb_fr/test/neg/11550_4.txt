"Escanaba in da Moonlight" is Jeff Daniels' first presentation for his writing and directing talents. <br /> <br /> I had a harder start, but this one is not that good. <br /> <br /> "Escanaba in da Moonlight" begins as a decent parody of this part of American culture. As we follow Rebuen Soady (Jeff Daniels) on the eve of the 1989 Deer Hunt season, he is getting closer to the record of the oldest Soady ever to win money. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in the highlands of Michigan and has all the normal clich√© characters. But there is a heat that tells you it's not mean. <br /> <br /> Well, Reuben will head to Soady Deer's camp and before his wife (Kimberly Norris Guerrero) gives him an Aboriginal American necklace, his lucky hat and two liquids you do not want probably not know. Anyway, she's really the only one to believe in him. He finally arrives at the camp where his father, Albery Soady (Harve Presnell) is waiting and his brother Remnar (Joey Albright) will show up soon. <br /> <br /> Okay, let's go fast. Here, there are bursts of laughter, a few moments when I laugh loudly. But most jokes here are used from time to time. <br /> <br /> But the biggest drawback is the spiritual events / Native Americans. By the time you settle in with the characters, these strange things are happening. But the special effects are so cheap that all it is is a big flash of light, then the head goes up quickly. <br /> <br /> And the end, well, it's worthless. <br /> <br /> The movement itself was not bad, the original character and the fun parody were good. But that should have stayed that way. Instead of having stupid spiritual awakenings that look like rejected scenes from a movie about demon possession. <br /> <br /> I give "Escanaba in da Moonlight" a score of 4.5 out of 10.
