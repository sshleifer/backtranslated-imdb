"The Polar Express" was a horrible movie. What makes this film worse is the hypocrisy of presenting itself as an innocent, sweet and safe tale for children about the "real" meaning of Christmas. I have never read Chris Van Allsburg's book with what he inspired, but the most disappointing is that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, the same who directed the great "Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? ", An excellent film where he proves that the animation could be appreciated by children as well as adults, whereas in this film, he seems to have been the victim of his own ambition and to give too much importance to create a level impressive detail compared to an interesting story. I'm sorry to say it, but "The Polar Express" has so much artistic level that a video game or toy advertising campaign. Everything in this movie seems to be so lifeless: the characters might look like humans, but they have nothing of life on them, and they have a malicious touch in their eyes. <br /> <br /> But the worst ... is the "message" in this movie. You can see it in some parts of the film and, believe me, it was bad. Take for example a scene where a child refuses to enter the Polar Express. Note that the character who looks like Tom Hanks makes a gesture like saying "you're stupid not to accept my offer". Second, when the girl says that the toys are so "hot" and things like that. All of the films that children tell us about how much the gifts Santa would give them would be important. There is even a song about gifts! The vagabond is an unimportant and weak character. And, in the last scene, the character seems to "discover" the true meaning of Christmas: and what would it be? What do you think ? gifts ! many Christmas movies are close to saying something like that, but "The Polar Express" is a hymn to materialism and greed. Seriously, I refuse to call it a "children's movie" because if that's what kids would learn, I do not want to think about what our future would be like.
