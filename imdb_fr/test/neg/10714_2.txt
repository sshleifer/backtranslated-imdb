Maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe the one who was able to get a maximum of 7 years has a soft spot for children with AIDS. But really people, manic laughter and chaos during the withdrawal scene? Did not you see that coming? I'm surprised there was no baby crawling on the ceiling and that sickboy is talking to the camera. The acting game was good, of course. But for me, this is just an example of a film taken from a time when situations and subjects could pass to the cinematographic language. Things are happening, but that's it. There is no glue or pattern that can be detected on the screen, allowing the subject to use preexisting emotional links to continue the plot, without the script doing so as it is supposed to do.
