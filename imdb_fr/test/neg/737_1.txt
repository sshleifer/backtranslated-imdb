We really do not know where to start when we talk about this movie. But let's start with the plot. We sincerely suspect that anyone who has written / produced / directed this film has ever read the book. Because they missed the whole point. SATIRIQUE, no horror. Just a clue. Second, the bath scene. Enough said. Third, the added characters. The French French Gothic and his black page who likes to hold hands and wheel. We do not understand where it comes from. And then there was the casting. All were really unpleasant. We were very upset that Catherine and Mr. Tilney had ended up together because they were so unfriendly that no one would want to see them happy. And the music. We think the BBC producers ran out of money, so we raided their grandmother's attic. And they found old records. Saxophone, moaning female voice and occasional electric guitar. * thrill * <br /> <br /> What's more, the best phrase of all time: "Since you left, the white rose has died of sorrow." If anyone has an explanation, we would like to hear it. Because it makes absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> We are still wondering what all the people involved were thinking about getting out of this pathetic excuse of a movie. We think that should be considered a federal offense. Torture is illegal. <br /> <br /> This movie is by far the worst we've seen so far. And I saw a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> Our recommendation: give this film to anyone you hate. They will watch it and want to kill themselves. And we agree with a previous post, we would give this 0 stars, if possible. DO NOT LOOK!! And we strongly suspect that all those who have commented so far in favor of this film have been involved in its production. Or were mentally crazy. This is the only reason we have been able to propose a favorable revision.
