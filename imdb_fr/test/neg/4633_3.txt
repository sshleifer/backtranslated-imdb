I note "The decline of the American empire" just below average because it was not terrible, but not great. I liked the very open conversations of so incredibly selfish and ugly people inside and out. It was probably the most original aspect ?? a small sexual film to dialogue with people extremely far from the models. That aside, it seems ironic that these French-speaking Canadians have a film about a neighboring society that is in a state of "decline" when their own actions are their own demise. A group of female friends and male friends spend half the film laughing at their infidelities and their acceptance of such behavior and the other half "intellectually" to say how powerful they are for their speeches and their actions. These are the usual targets of typical sitcoms, whose main characters make fun of evenings held mainly by university professors. Unfortunately, it's not their "intelligence" or their mastery of "history" that bothers me. It is their pedestal made of ego and an attitude more powerful than you that pushes me away and no character can tell me or love. When we cry, I do not care ??? it's your bed. When we complain, I barely flinch. What made me skirmish is a character, uh, who's pissing red. (Another example of playing with fire.) Of course, I understand that this happens to some people, but it was hard to watch. And I sincerely hoped that he washed his hands because he had no problem going back to the kitchen for everyone. In contrast to educators, they present a stereotyped nomad. It made me back away that nobody seemed real; everyone was as superficial as his laugh about society. Unfortunately, since there is no one left at the root, you are as empty as the souls of this character.
