I feel very generous to give 2 out of 10 to this film. Okay, I noticed that the special effects are "agree" and Renny Harlin has made my favorite film, that of a genetically modified research station of genetically modified sharks than you may know -be like Deep Blue Sea. In addition, the opening credits are pretty good with a remix of "more human than human" WhiteZombie and it fits well with what is in the context of this "film". But enough praise, let's see why this movie It sucks so much. <br /> <br /> Not since Uone Boll in Alone in the Dark, I never felt that the special effects of a movie were totally ruined. Our story begins with four guys from four different families. , each one of them has a power never fully explained, coming from a family context never completely explained, which has made an art of the trade of witch never fully explained. Oh, and for some reason, these descendants are all 17 years old, all go to the same school, all are enrolled in the swimming team and all, for one reason or another, sit in bed with their shirts, sweating and talking on the phone.I have nothing against gays, gothic or 13 years, but this is the purpose of this film. at ... a 13-year-old goth who questions her sexuality yeah there are girls inside, who are sitting on their bed, in their panties or anything else, but how come- they do not take off their shirts? hey his only fair. <br /> <br /> Anyway, we tell the characters in this film that at 18, they will go up and be granted new powers, almost divine. But before going any further, I forgot to mention that when they used their powers, they slowly grew old and became more and more dependent. This explains why they played 17-year-old players to players in their twenties. Oh, and if something needs an explanation, do not worry, someone will explain it in a big piece of dialogue. God, this film is void ... Where was I? oh yes, the ascension part. <br /> <br /> OK, apparently, there was a super secret-alpha-one family that others have forgotten or s # * t like that, I do not know, I was dozing in it Stadium. But they were written how, and the new child at school who befriends the group is "secretly" one of those descendants of the fifth family. And I say "secretly" because anyone who has seen one of the extracts of this film knows that this new guy is the bad guy. He has more power than others because he is older, I think. Anyway, Bob Loblaw (say it out loud), things happen and we get to the last fight of the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was ready for a witch battle. You know, like Saurmon against Gandalf, or anything that looks like a magic battle, because you know, it's about witches and the like. Now, when these two witches collapse, it's a bit like ... how can I say it ... a very, very shitty version of a Dragonball Z-type battle. They throw objects at each other on others, speak, throw objects, speak, throw things, speak, etc. When I say "throws objects", I say it only because I have no idea what the F #% k are throwing at each other. It looks like big pieces of sticky water. Anyway, this movie is nil, when our main witch "goes up", it does not become very powerful. It just throws larger amounts of slimy water. Things happen and it ends in a way that you, as a spectator, know that it will end. The good witch wins the bad witch. <br /> <br /> You know how a movie is crap when the villain says something so incredibly stupid, "I'll make you my Wiotch" This is where I wanted to hit myself face to be sitting through all this ... thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit that the fact that witches fight, use modern powers, seems pretty cool, but when it comes so bad, I really wanted them to do NOT this movie. Maybe if she was rated R, if she had had the tits and added more dead with a pinch of blood, it might have worked ... might have worked. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching this, do not buy it or even rent it. Wait for him to come on TV or borrow it from your friend who bought it. Just do not waste your time with this hacking movie. If you spend money, there is a good chance that you will make an effort to have Uwe Boll's sequel, The Covenant 2: Alone in the dark with the house of the dead.
