Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a director of bloody horror movies who begins to feel the effect of filming too many bloody scenes. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he loses his marbles. it turns out to be a bad idea, because the psychiatrist is actually a mad murderer responsible for a series of horrendous murders. Seizing the opportunity to make Fulci his fall man, the nosy nut doctor hypnotizes the horror by making him believe he is responsible for the recent series of murders. <br /> <br /> In appearance, Cat in the Brain seems to be a fantastic feast of Lucio Fulci, the god of spaghetti splashing. Brimming with chainsaw dismemberment, ax attacks and many other bloody murders, the film reveals enough purity for the most enduring dogs. But when you take a closer look, it turns out that a lot of macabre scenes are taken from earlier movies (mostly Fulci's "masterpieces"); remove them from the equation and you end up with a clever basic plot idea that's totally ruined, a welcome nudity, and dreadful performances of Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as a shrinking shrink. <br /> the film progresses, it turns into an incomprehensible disorder, with the film "borrowed" gore inserted at random, without trying to integrate it convincingly in the story. If you've ever seen Fulci's Touch of Death and Sodom's Ghosts or Mario Bianchi's Secret of Murder, you've already seen the best pieces of Cat In The Brain. <br /> After long killings, the film ends rather quickly, leaving the viewer puzzled and a little deceived. Watch the movie if you are a Fulci Completist, but I would suggest looking for the movies where the "good pieces" come from.
