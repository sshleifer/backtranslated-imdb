This movie is really bad. I like to nap on TV and this movie seemed to sleep, and I was wrong. My body literally woke me up from sleep and said, "Hey ... this movie is awful ... you have to watch it." I like bad movies with bad actors and stupid intrigues. Something about involuntary comedy makes me move forward. This film is really bad. I really do not know how to express it correctly, except to recommend that you only look at it to see how bad it is. I mean, seriously, you should look at this with people. I made the best jokes during this movie and no one was there to hear them. <br /> <br /> Worse than Swimfan. It's so bad.
