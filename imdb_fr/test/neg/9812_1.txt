Hilariously inept - like "She wore a yellow ribbon" redone by five-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Spoilers to come: Despite its title, and the high number of people, "Slaughter Trail" is actually a musical with Injun Battles instead of dance numbers. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered what Ed Wood could have done with a B movie budget, this movie should answer your question. Some decisions may have been bad only retrospectively, such as filming in the ephemeral process of Cinecolor, which had the effect of changing the tint of the faces in the same plane. Terry Gilkyson, who later wrote the movie "The Bare Necessities" for Disney's, "was ultimately badly inspired on the main set of the film, a cavalry fort that appears to be partly a Norman castle." The Jungle Book ", provides a complete score of original songs that would have been wonderful for a cartoon but would suit Western action like a fuzzy slipper stuck in a stirrup.A song tells how" the hooves of horses hammer and that their melody sounds like a serenade against the hoof "... during a mortal scene of a cavalry patrol.Other songs literally tell the story, filming the characters, describing their moods and gestures - such as they show up on the screen - and even stop to announce the Cinecolor process (!) <br /> <br /> The script sends ferocious Navajos the path of war to avenge the murder of two of their group by a trio of outlaws At the end of the film, a hundred Navajo and horsemen have bitten the dust (thanks to repeated images of the same characters dying incessantly). is that he saw the trio of massacred badguys. While the singer usefully informs those of us who have not paid attention, the Navajo move away, their battle is canceled. The captain of the cavalry, surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades, warmly welcomes his appreciation. <br /> <br /> Management could very well be described as wood, or more accurately, Wood-en. Navajos are systematically shot in pairs, never by one. Virtually all red-footed men die by throwing their hands in the air and collapsing. The film also uses Hollywood's most cautious stuntmen, who crouch before leaving a one-story roof (and still can not glue the landing) or turn to look behind them as they slide "dead" "on a rocky slope. <The star is Brian Donlevy, who surely deserves an Oscar not to blush. After the endless final battle scene - "climax" is almost no word - he scans a list of the dozens of soldiers he has killed, and shrugs. "It could have been a lot worse." Private Andy Devine sings and Gig Young, the thief and the murderer, laughs at Andy's antics ... leading a character who was caught by masked bandits to miss the scene: "I'll know it anywhere " <br /> <br /> And so that everyone does not forget how Howard Hughes could be an unpleasant job, remember that as RKO's president, Hughes was the first on the blacklist of the original star Howard Da Silva when HUAC denounced him. Hughes would take another six years to finish running this once-famous studio, but that did not help if he insisted that every Da Silva film be included in this film, replacing Donlevy. <br /> <br /> Almost ten years passed before Da Silva could once again work in Hollywood. But all things considered, to have him out of "Slaughter Trail", he should have sent Hughes a thank you note.
