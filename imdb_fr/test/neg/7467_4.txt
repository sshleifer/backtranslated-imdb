It's not a terrible movie - my 10-year-old boy loved it and he would be part of the target population, so I guess they were up to it. Rather boring for an adult though. <br /> <br /> Difficult to understand animated lego characters, even those of high technology. <br /> <br /> I thought of the choice of the three great virtues of the Bionicle the world was a little strange - unity, duty and destiny. Am I the only one who thinks it sounds a bit fascist? Especially destiny. What about freedom, equality, justice, etc.? <br /> <br /> Well, that's going to sell Lego. A bit boring for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute ad. It would have been a lot worse.
