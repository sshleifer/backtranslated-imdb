This film is not funny, and I imagine that I would be quite offensive to the Jewish people. (and I'm not Jewish) Why? First of all, the whole film portrays the protagonist Zucker as a cheater / lover who runs a shady business, while his son is gay, his daughter is lesbian and his niece a slut. Then there is the incestuous relationship that happens in the family, first his daughter with his Joshua and Jana, then his son with his niece. Two incestuous relationships going on in the family. I'm surprised they did not add the intrigue of having a mental handicap in the family ... Now, that would really complete the Nazi subhuman ideal! (gay, lesbian, jew ...) <br /> <br /> Film totally disgusting. I am surprised that this film receives no response from a Jewish community.
