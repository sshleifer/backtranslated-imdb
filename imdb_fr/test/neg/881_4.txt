Richard Gere and Diane Lane play in a crime novel with the kind of denouement that makes me really angry ... just say it's not my cup of tea, just like the Dime Store romances are not my cup of tea. <Br /> <br /> The plot has a doctor who stopped at an inn and met a woman with whom he has a deep but brief affair. He goes to meet his separated son and returns to his life. <br /> <br /> Well done and well done, the filmmakers forgot to have a real plot. It's the business of romances in coin shops that makes women pale and men shake their heads in disbelief. I would not be so opposed to the movie as a stupid romance, except that the film takes a turn in the final film that is so out of the left field that it is completely incredible. Why do some types of movies have to do such stupid things? It really messed me up. <br /> <br /> If you like romance, try it, wait for the cable.
