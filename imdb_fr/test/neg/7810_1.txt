I was intrigued by the boss's evil character, myself, and the current boss's daughter was seductive and it was interesting to see Ashton Kushner even younger, but this movie is so childish that I had to turn it off. It was a waste of time to watch him. When people began to pee all over the living room, it was too much to watch. Damn and hideous shit film. If they had just reduced the tone a little. Are there really people who find it funny and who like it? I was relieved to know that IMDb readers rated it so low. The story of the career was intriguing, as was the young man who was trying to get promoted and to win the favor of the bosses. I liked this part. In addition, the opening scene with colleagues on the train was cool because I like the characters of his colleague. If you can support movies without meaning or if you are young enough, then you can support one.
