"The Quickie" tells the story of a decadent Russian bourgeois family living in Malibu and ... well, frankly, this terrible drama attempt is not worthy of a comment. <br /> <br /> Jason Leigh introduces himself to Mr. Mob-guy as "Exterminators of the Pacific" with huge, conspicuous letters on his back that say "Exterminators of the West Coast". Eventually, the guys in the crowd become suspicious because she was exterminating in a bedroom. (Duh). <br /> <br /> In another scene, Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette by giving a whore $ 4000 to bet if he will live or die. She has 5 chances out of 6 to keep the money if she bets "live". Well, she's betting "die". (double duh) Later, she complains that it's not fair and wants to play again. (Triple duh) <br /> <br /> The list of flaws only gets longer, while this insulting film by the intelligence stinks and sinks into a quagmire of ugly music, poor camera work, bad direction, boring history, etc. on this loser. (D) <br /> <br /> Note - The barebones DVD I rented did not have English subtitles or closed captions.
