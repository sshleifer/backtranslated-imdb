WARNING: SPOILERS Dear Roger, <br /> <br /> During your brilliant career, you have offered a wide range of entertainment, some good, some not good. "The night of the blood beast" falls into this last category. It's not as terrible as saying "The Phantom of 10,000 Leagues" or maybe "The Horror of Dunwich". Nevertheless, one of my most critical critics of this film is that I could have done it for you faster, better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the foreword and the headlines. Roger, the rocket sequences look like something from Disney's "Man Into Space", not as good, of course. The futuristic spaceship looks like nothing in 1958. We did not just use a Vanguard launcher, Atlas or even Viking. Better yet, why not go all the way out of the pitch and start with a crush and the capsule floating in? That's what I would have done for you, Roger. Second, why did the spacecraft crash when it came back? Even a college physics student could have told you that your astronaut would have arrived on earth very crisp and largely boned. I would have shown your astronaut becoming "possessed" by the monster (perhaps by using this awesome "negative / positive" material you used in "The Satellite War"), losing contact with the land and landing in the desert. This would also explain how your "blood beast" could permeate your astronaut during the overwhelming heat of re-entry, while being destroyed by fire. Even with these nonsense. The first half of your movie is pretty good. If you had spent a little money on music worthy of the name, it would have been as good as a mediocre episode of "Outer Limits". But, again, your author describes Ed Nelson as the designer of the landing system, then gives him a stupid dialogue on magnetism. The biggest problem of the second half of "The Night of the Bloody Beast" is Michael Emmet. He is terrible as a convicted astronaut. You should have fired him right away and replaced him with Ed Nelson. You could have combined Nelson's responsibilities with those of John Dunlap and saved on the cost of an actor. I do not know if you really paid for one of these people; but at least you will save the cost of catering three meals a day. I also gave up the "burnt parrot" costume and spent the extra money on make-up so that the astronaut became the "blood beast". It may have been a little too close to "The Creeping Unknown" for you, but it would have contributed greatly to the rhythm of the second half. if you are going to have a "blood beast", would not it be a good idea to show some blood? Yes, I know the title comes from the embryos in the blood of the astronaut, but Kowalski could have done MUCH better for you if he had poured a little chocolate syrup. After all, it looks like blood in black and white. What did it cost you, maybe two dollars? I would have used close-ups too. For some reason, tasteless dialogue and bad acting do not seem so bad in close-ups. Watch almost 70 TV shows and you will see what I mean. Oh, finally, Roger, a note to your author. You can not use a fluoroscope to show a poor con filled with extraterrestrial embryos while you have no electricity. Remember, you fried the generator in the first reel? Oh, and I almost forgot. Roger, could you not afford a fake knife? You know, the kind where the blade enters the handle. I had one of those when I was 9 years old, which is also the year of the "Night of the Blood Beast". It cost me two more dollars. I think I knew enough to make you a better movie. I know I know enough now to do it. So, Roger, if you decide to redo "The Night of the Blood Beast" or if you are looking for a screenwriter / director to work with you on ANOTHER PROJECT, I am your man. I will work at a low price because I really want to make a film for you, Roger. <br /> <br /> I give a "3" to "The Black Blood Beast". SPECIAL NOTE: If you like watching kitschy movies such as "The Night of the Bloody Beast", the DVD I bought for $ 3.99 was of very good quality. You can also get "Night of the Blood Beast" with a lot of other horror / scifi movies in places like Bestbuy for about $ 6.
