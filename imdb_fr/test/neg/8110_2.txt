I found this film as a total loss of 96 minutes. Jones was a strange kid and is badly damaged! According to my memory, what might be wrong, was he not only 16 or 17? ** Spoiler ** Why did he leave college and rent an apartment with two crazy girls fighting for boys for a hobby? and the cowboy who lives under jones scared me too, how he knew what was happening in the apartments did not float in front of me for a minute. I do not understand his thoughts about the girl who took pictures for fun and stayed in her room when Mandy Moore was still finished and it was obvious that she wanted to be more than friends with him. I do not really find this movie funny, neither artistic, nor dramatic, nor anything, I found it stupid and a total loss of time (D- F +)
