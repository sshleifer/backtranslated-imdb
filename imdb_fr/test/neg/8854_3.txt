This film is about a gap between the real world and the world of the dead. There is a lot of gibberish about the Internet (ie if you install a program on the computer, you will see people who have died - a bit like playing a videotape, you will die in RINGU ). Frankly, most of that seemed pretty stupid and lost me. What I found interesting is the idea that the dead live in their own separate existence - that they are totally alone for eternity. It was disappointing and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I love Japanese movies and have seen a lot of them compared to most Americans. However, a genre that has become popular in recent years and that I simply can not understand very well are these horror movies. I know they are very popular - especially since they seem to have been redone so often in the United States. I saw RINGU and THE RING, JU-ON and THE GRUDGE and I was rather ambivalent despite their popularity. SESSION is the only recent horror movie I really liked in Japan. This is a redesign of the great British film SESSION ON A WET FOUND. And what, do I think, made SESSION different? Well, unlike other movies and KAIRO, tons of money have not been spent on special effects or scare the public. The focus has been on history. The bottom line is that these other movies look a lot like American movies like HALLOWEEN or Friday 13 - with scary things coming out just to scare the audience and the plot is purely secondary (at best). For me, I want a story - not chills or cheap ghosts as the film's main focus. <br /> <br /> With a relatively high score, I know I'm in the minority, but I just do not find it's a very satisfying film. Too often, there are minor things that might surprise someone - but the characters start screaming and crying and behaving as if to say, "This is the scariest movie ever, so you'd do well to start shaking "Well, I think it's been too much effort and I wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the movie and on the progression of the plot - and not on alarmist tactics.
