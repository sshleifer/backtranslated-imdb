It was awful and simple. What was their message? Where was the movie with that? It contains all the ingredients of a movie of quality inferior to B. From the plot without intrigue to the bad action to cinematography slow-mo cheese. I'd rather watch a movie I've seen, like Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, or even Grease. There are no nice characters. In the end, you just want everyone to die already. Save 2 hours of your life and skip this one.
