The only thing that makes this film visible is Corey's performance as a lunatic killer on the run. What remains is an impossible account of vengeance and marital discord. During walkie-talkie scenes, I felt that Cotten was clutching a sweet potato and not a communication device. Alan Hale (the skipper of "Gilligan's Island") is not yet so big, and he can still give up under the waist. Other than that, there is not much to recommend here.
