In the mid-1800s, the Irishman Dennis Hopper (under the name of Daniel Morgan) emigrated to Australia, seeking a share of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hopper finds himself scarred and thrown into a tortuous prison; there, he is raped by a gang. Upon his release, Hopper meets an aboriginal person, David Gulpilil (Billy), with whom he seeks revenge for the sadistic Bill Hunter (Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (Detective Mainwaring) and others. Finally, revenge becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by the people, and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities. The "barely human" performance of Hopper certainly corresponds to the disjointed sensation of the film. Mr. Gulpilil is leading a strong distribution. The staff involved in "Mad Dog Morgan" not only deserves a look, but also a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> *** Mad Dog Morgan (1976), Philippe Mora ~ Dennis Hopper, David Gulpilil, Bill Hunter
