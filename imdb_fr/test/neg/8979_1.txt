It's by far the worst British comedy of all time. The way he spent the first episode, not to mention the pilot, is beyond me. The acting is weak from the main character played by Ben Miller to Sarah Alexander (fantastic coupling) throughout the cast. The intrigues and stories were unpredictable and very funny, using a lot of used ideas. A very painful series to support but unfortunately to put between two excellent shows. to describe it as the British answer to "Meet the parents" is a disadvantageous service to "meet the parents" and is as fresh as an old shoe that hangs out with the family dog. Great Britain should have learned that scams from other countries never work if we look at America's sad attempts.
