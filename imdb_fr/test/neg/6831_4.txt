I'm normally a fan of Bruce Willis and, despite playing the cold-hearted professional killer, I considered him the most attractive character here. That said, his character so ruin his professional activity, it's incredible that he was never trapped. The plot is so thin as to be absurd. The end was no less boring and insulting to the fact that it could have been predicted after about 20 minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> ** The defenders follow ** In Hollywood morality, the good always win, with some wounded on the way, and the bad guys die, or at least head for justice by the end . The breathtaking insult of the film is how our terrorist IRA, who has become a kind of cuddly and touching character, has a new life. Like his former terrorist playmate (who is now a wife and loving mother). <br /> <br /> Who is the biggest villain? The former terrorist (and, as far as can be said, unrepentant) or the hired assassin? I do not see much to choose between them - in real life or in the film. <br /> <br /> This is the poorest movie I've seen this year.
