Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story begins well. Her husband cheats on her and she discovers him on national television. She must rebuild her life. Here, it could have become interesting or structured in a story, but it bothers you so much. She returns with her parents and Harry Connick Jr. who plays the role of Justin begins to flirt. Both have no real chemistry at all, yet you're supposed to feel that Justin is in love with her. The film ends as you think, but you wish you did not finish like all the others. They had a good start with this movie and could have turned it into something visible, but it's more of a movie you definitely want to miss.
