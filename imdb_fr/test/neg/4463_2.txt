The film begins very well in 1872 with a violent and bloody fight between Dracula (Christopher Lee) and van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula is impaled and dissolves into dust, but Helsing also dies. Someone gathers the ashes of Dracula and buries them in the enclosure of a church. Cutting until 1972 - here is where the movie breaks up. <br /> <br /> We are immediately hit on the head with 70s loud and bad music, HORRIBLE modes and silly dialogues. When that was done, Hammer was losing money and decided to try anything to get a shot. Putting Dracula in the 1970s was NOT a good idea. The fashions, the music and the dialogue are horribly dated from the film. We are introduced to a group of annoying children in their twenties who decide to have a black mass - "for a giggle". Naturally, they have it at the church (now abandoned) and revive Dracula. It's good that a descendant of van Helsing is present ... but Dracula attacks his niece (Stephanie Beacham) for revenge. <br /> <br /> Lee and Cushing are brilliant, as always in their roles and on screen, the film receives a vital energy boost. The opening and ending battles are the highlights of the film (although the end is spoiled by reading a lousy 70s music). Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame) is also the primary caregiver for the children. It's a really stupid name that goes back to the 1940s. The movie also shouted Queen Caroline Munro look absolutely awesome. The film is well made and not badly played, but the plot is stupid, the incessant flow of the 70's fashion, the dialogue and the music become annoying very quickly and I was bored basically. <br /> <br /> Most Hammer fans agree. - It was one of Dracula's worst movies - his sequel (Dracula's satanic rites) was the worst - and the last Hammer Dracula movie. This gives a 2 - just for Cushing and Lee.
