Which movie is it ??? A horrible film with the old boring concept of infidelity that has already been realized by the "Bhatt camp". The film stars EMRAAN HASHMI, UDITA GOSWAMI AND DINO MOREA. The film has "no basis". It's okay ... Dino and Udita are married and live in a rich manor house. However, Dino does not like Udita deep in his heart because he wants only his wealth. He loves someone else (Tara Sharma). So, he bribes Emraan to have an affair with Udita so that he can catch them and finally separate from Udita. How boring! However, Emraan falls in love with Udita and vice versa. Finally, when Udita is imprisoned for killing Emraan, Dino pretentiously tries to save her by showing her false love. Udita, on the other hand, does not understand that and thinks he really loved her. She lends all her fortune to Dino. Finally, Dino leaves the police station and goes with Tara with all the wealth. What fraud !! The songs are good and are the only good thing in the movie. Now, the individual evaluations: (out of 5) Emraan: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dino: * 1/2 interim: * 1/2 Direction: * * History: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final rank: * 1/2 Bad performance and bad casting ....... Music: Good ... I rate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (Do not waste your time !!!!)
