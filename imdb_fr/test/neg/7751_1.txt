This film is a strange fantastic tale that, I'm sure, is not suitable for people over 10, but is too strange for children. The plot is stupid and the acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Kathy Ireland, 25, is a teenage girl who behaves like a nine-year-old girl. She seems to have gotten the voice of her character while listening to Alvin and the Chipmunks. Her shrill, screaming baby voice becomes annoying the second she starts talking. All the other actors are bad, but Kathy Ireland is by far the worst. The plot is also awful and is a bit of a mix between Alice in Wonderland and Mad Max. Wanda Saknussemm (Ireland) receives a letter saying that her father, who left her a long time ago, has fallen into a bottomless chasm in Africa. When she goes to look for him, she falls into an underground world peopled with strange accented Australian. This is one of the most secret movies you'll see, with terrible lines. <br /> <br /> The effects of this film on the development of characters are annoying. Kathy Ireland is a nerd who does not want to do anything or go anywhere. She flies to Africa .... wow, what a development! She drops her glasses and does not need them anymore. Why drop his glasses does not represent them becoming a nerd. This should represent his descent into blindness. It's just stupid. The only good thing I can think is that there are some good special effects and a good camera work, and that the musical score sounds good. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a ridiculous family fantasy that will not please those who film. <br /> <br /> My note: 1/2 on ****. 84 minutes PG for the violence.
