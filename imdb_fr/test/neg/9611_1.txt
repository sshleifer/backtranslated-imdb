What happened to shows with united parent figures? The parents of this show are almost as irresponsible as the kids. Instead of punishing the youngest child for handling, they let her get away with murder. They can never agree on a plan of action to care for children and do nothing to the contrary. Yes, good plan. Just ignore their behavior because they are "cute". This show tells pre-teenagers who are already manipulators who look at it that the "divide and conquer" technique is the best way to "give up" their parents. Older children are constantly raging and ending up in all sorts of impossible situations, but their actions have no consequences. Yes, good TV, all right.
