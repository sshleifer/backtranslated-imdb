George & Mildred - The Movie lacks the talents of his television writer, John Mortimer, who brings to life the opposite class war of George at the Fourmiles. <br /> <br /> The plot is carved in a standard thorny fabric. - Hit-Man / mistaken identity - and has as little tension as there are laughs. The producers should have taken a sheet of Rising Damp (1980 also), which was also bought on the big screen after the disappearance of the television series and has kept much of the story in a familiar setting. <br /> <br /> Yootha Joyce died in 1980, but she should not be reminded of it for this squeaky work, cluttered with her illness. Mildred lacks the sharpness of her incarnation on television; cutting off side and faded looks mainly at Georges lack of libido. George's sputtering disbelief is also lost in the larger sets. That does not mean they had a lot of reason to shout. The budget of this film is tiny. a restaurant they are visiting is clearly a new semi-hungry house with Christmas lights adorning the front door. <br /> <br /> For British comedy fans of the '70s or those who simply want to revisit a former TV comrade of their youth this movie adds nothing to the experience and they should just stick the first four television series on DVD.
