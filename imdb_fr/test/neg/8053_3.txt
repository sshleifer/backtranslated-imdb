The unexpected turn of director Todd Verow in sentimental dramaturgy gives a predictable result: nothing new to see here. Attractive but unconvincing tracks - these 20 years are supposed to be in high school? - Dribbling banalities on the confused sexuality of teenagers does not seem to me to be the best way to explore Anonymous's promise, which was just as self-contained, but honest, raw and, by comparison, not all that hot. I have no idea what to do with this dull film and no interest other than to hope that Verow finds another career. Of course, it's unpretentious, but so is Mike Huckabee. <br /> <br /> No single attribute, however, is as awful as Jim Dwyer's electronic and chintzy score, which plays continuously and throughout the length of this film. If I had seen that and heard that in a theater, I would be out. Fortunately, on my laptop, I could rub and mutate.
