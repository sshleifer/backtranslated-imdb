OK, for starters, this movie did not look like the book at all. I read the book when I was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. When I wait for another book to come out, it is the book I turn to to indicate the time. I have 3 copies for God's sake. Anyway, I knew it was not going to look like the book, but come on! They could have done a little better than that. I mean seriously if I wanted to watch an American werewolf in Paris or London, I would watch these movies. They took a very good story and twisted it to make a copy of a story that has been told over and over again and, frankly, I'm tired of watching it. I mean hello the best part of the whole ***** g story (sorry) is that she ends up with Gabriel. He does not die What was it? And he's old in this movie. Gabriel is supposed to be only 24 not 44 da ** le. Awww. And Astrid who had ** the idea that Astrid was Vivian's aunt no no no no. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. Awwww. In any case yes, it was my small incursion seriously disturbed. hope this helped.
