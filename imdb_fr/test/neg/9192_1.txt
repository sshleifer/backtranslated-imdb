One of the worst films ever made. Let's start with the superficial: Joaquin Phoenix is ​​at first too big to be a beginner firefighter. The NYFD does not recruit pasty Pillsbury boys. John Travolta has a bad job of dyeing and the strange glint in his eyes throughout the film made me think he was on some kind of Scientology banner extended. The plot strikes all the tropes and clichés of what Joe usually looks like, the life of a firefighter: they all get drunk, argue, have trouble expressing their emotions, their wives stay home crying, they have father problems, everyone has a Boston accent, et cetera. An execrable piece of schwarmerei that plays on our cultural hero worship after the attacks of September 11, 2001 - which was, by the way, a cultured cultural hero's cult. Unfortunately, this film does not present any credible heroes to adore.
