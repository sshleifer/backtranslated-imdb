The advertisement for this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational. Well, we, opera lovers, see strange scenes in opera theaters, so we are not shocked by the Duke of Mantua who is urinating when La Donna Ã¨ Mobile is taken over, and he is not sensational to see Gilda sing Caro Nome in the bath. It's just rude and boring. What emerges from this film is its lack of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk installs Duke's Palace in a shabby pool. In fact, he's not the duke, he's just a character named Duka. It is therefore difficult to understand why he has many hangers and his own jester, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a boardroom furnished with an orange sofa and adorned with polka dot wallpaper that is rigorous among avant-garde filmmakers. Duke, sorry, Duka's heavy loads roll in scooters (yawn). <br /> <br /> The concepts imposed on an opera like this one can produce an unexpected and unintentional humor. What can we do about Gilda having a maid, even if she lives in a boardroom? When it is announced that Monterone is taken to prison, we see him out of the pool by two attendants in pink shorts. We imagine that he will be accused of urinating in a public pool. <br /> <br /> It was common for opera films to be lip sync 20 years ago, but there is no excuse for that today. A doubled opera is like soft porn. You do not believe in what's happening because the performers are not doing enough. The actress in the role of Gilda does not seem to have learned her lines properly. She barely moves her lips when she is supposed to sing. When she sings Caro Nome in the bath, she lies back, legs slightly apart. It's hard to tell which hole the sound comes from. The Duke later finished singing while chatting with Maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase that sings in the canyon. <br /> <br /> The mood of the sound never seems right, the orchestra sometimes sounding as if it is played by a transistor radio. It is best to use rather slow tempi for the final result to be a karaoke in your local pub. <br /> <br /> This is a film from an Opera Spanga production. Spanga is a village in Friesland in the Netherlands. They normally occur in a tent in a field. If I had watched this performance under a tent in a field in Friesland, I would have been pretty indulgent. By filming this production and giving it a global audience, villagers are also open to global ridicule.
