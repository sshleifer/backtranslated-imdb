This film stinks. No money, no action, nothing. I caught it on the night of the 3pm movie and felt compelled to comment. This film has nothing to recommend. I can not believe it was ever broadcast on American television! No one in this film can get out of a paper bag. The lame comedy attempts fall flat, the special effects consist of a "monster" like a worm. ... I can not even begin to tell you how radical this production is. It seems that filming costs about $ 50,000, but only because it's in 16mm, and it's probably a generous estimate! Anyway, I quickly lost interest and had to just look at "Matlock" instead of finishing it. That's how bad this movie is !!!
