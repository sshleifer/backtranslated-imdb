I had to rent some movies for my little cousin for the New Year. She chose The Swan Princess: The Mystery of the Enchanted Realm and The Little Mermaid 2 and we just watched the two movies. While she was sleeping, I thought I could get some comments. :) Although this is a very cheesy cartoon, it really was not that bad. You have to admit that for kids, these intrigues are new to them and that this could be a great introduction for them. <br /> <br /> Odette discovers that Derek has secretly kept Rosthoe's magical secrets and she tells Derek to destroy them immediately, but being a guy, he does not usually do it and tells him that nobody could realize magic without his help. When a witch named Zelda puts her hand on them, she discovers that Derek has torn the last words of a spell she wants to use to destroy everything, and she kidnaps Odette to retrieve this information. <br /> <br /> Swan Princess: The mystery of the enchanted realm is stupid and predictable, but for kids, I would honestly say it's an essay. It's so rare that we have these drawings cut well by the day, so I'm going to reduce the shooting time. It was strange to see all the voices change suddenly, I grew up with the first, so I guess it was just stuck in my head. <br /> <br /> 4/10
