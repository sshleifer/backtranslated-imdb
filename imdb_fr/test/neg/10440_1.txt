It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is not an ounce of historical accuracy, in reality the reality is reversed. Just an example: Morgan tackled the little Chinese ethnicity he met. The acting is excessive, the script is a badly written lie. I have never seen fake beards worse. <br /> <br /> Hopper arrived in Australia and would only make the film if the script was totally rewritten to become a hero. The scenario is composed of ten pieces on the fly, it is possible that the film explains how the film is disjointed. <br /> <br /> Any movie on Ned Kelly is much better than this movie.
