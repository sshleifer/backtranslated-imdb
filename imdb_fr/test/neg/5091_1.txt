For weeks, I was anxious to see this movie, but I was extremely disappointed after the war. In my opinion, the only good thing that River Queen has had is the beautiful landscape used as a backdrop. The screenplay was everywhere, Samantha's character, Sarah, was very difficult to understand and what were the many close-ups of her face all about? There is absolutely nothing in the story - if there was one! A better actor for the role of Boy could also have been selected, for me, it sounded like he was reading his lines straight from the screenplay while turning his scenes. really bad because it could have been such a good movie.
