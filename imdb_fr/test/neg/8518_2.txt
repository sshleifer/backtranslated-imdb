Eddie Fischer was just bad. The worst scene may have come early in the film when he punctured a spontaneous song and dance number centered around a piano and a few well-placed employees. The song was totally stupid ... I think I could intoxicate a few lines on a sheet of paper that would exceed it by far and probably win a Grammy. Then, as if the writers did not find a better way to escape the ridiculous scene, Fischer said something like, "Do not say (insert the guy's name), he does not like music" and smiles. . I can not describe how bad it is, I felt a little embarrassed. And the guy Debbie Reynolds is working with and who is still wriggling her is so annoying. I can not even imagine that someone like her is losing a fraction of her time on him. The jokes were delivered without any kind of chemistry between the characters who scrolled the film. At least the baby had pretty hair. The two stars are for Reynolds, who was like a swan among naughty ducklings. <br /> <br /> See the single mother instead.
