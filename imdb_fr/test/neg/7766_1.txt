The first time I saw this, I turned against HORROR in front of what was presented as a modern, liberated woman. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I can not relate to the groaning idiots whose life revolves around sex without love and the acquisition of Gucci. , Prada and Louis Vuitton. What is troubling is that some people may think that this is how career women live in New York. It really is not. These women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and, as another critic has said, they act like gold hunters. It's not a liberated femininity and I'm glad it's gone. 0 stars and simply AWFUL
