If no film has ever made the Italians look bad, then that's it. <br /> <br /> Duke Mitchell - which university. Duc Mitchell, I'm on your grave. Considering that virtually every person murdered in this film by the cowardly Mimi is black or belonging to another racial or ethnic minority, it's hard not to be convinced that the guy ultimately owes his allegiance to the Kl Kl or the skinheads of the Ku Klux. Awww, but he did not shoot the little black boy in the elevator in the opening sequence, so that means he can not be quite bad, right? FALSE. Typical sweet sentimental tripes. <br /> <br /> Although I understand why some people might be struck by and even, to a certain extent, admire the daring and totally non-PC verve of the film (it's certainly not shameful of its own hate and the meaning of self-involvement), but that does not change the fact that the main character, Mimi (and, by extension, Duke Mitchell), is a completely disgusting human being who does not earn a single penny of empathy or of interest, especially since Duke Mitchell is a full-fledged interpreter. But what do you expect from a guy whose main claim to fame (aside from that dog of a movie) was to be a second-rate impersonator, Dean Martin?
