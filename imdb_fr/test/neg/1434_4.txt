It sounded like Silence of the Lambs or Zodiac or something, but it was not. It was really like a Halloween movie without all the jump scenes. It was a bit like Plan 9 Outer space in that the main villain continued to make foolish speeches that made me want to go for a snack without pausing. The idea of ​​a person who is so crazy about taking people away and torturing them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea, but the execution was too much for television. I must say it was better than I expected for a movie written and performed by Dee Snider. A good first effort. Maybe he will learn a few lessons and his next effort will be less awkward.
