"Nero" as the title of the film is in Germany is another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, better known as Nero. Although this attempt at least tried to show a Nero more accurate than the historical, amusing and completely fictional, Nero, Peter Ustinov played in "Quo Vadis!" it's always a major failure. And to IMDb commentators who still believe that Sueton and Tacitus propaganda is true, please read a book on Nero published less than 20 years ago. Nero did not burn Rome, it's proven! He did not murder Britannicus. He did not torture, kill and mutilate for pleasure, he was the first emperor to ban gladiatorial fighting. The film still shows a lot of mistakes and is actually done in a really cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looking like a villa, the city itself looked like ... well to a cheap set. The acting was between good and mediocre, the music was almost insignificant and the film deteriorated quickly after Nero became emperor in a hasty and poorly edited mess with no clear narrative structure. So there is still potential for an epic biography of Nero showing the real Nero, who was one of the best emperors who led Rome, despite the lies of Sueton et al.
