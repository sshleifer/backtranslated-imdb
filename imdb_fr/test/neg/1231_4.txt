Okay, so I forgot to watch and only picked up the last episode, thinking it was the first or second. Honestly, I thought CM would have at least one other payment to solve the field problems. The Rangers are left stranded in the plains ("We'll have to eat horses"), for one thing. Little Newt is private, for another. What a decent end! But my biggest complaint, esp. if it was the finale, it's because the episode had no suspense, no big climax, no dramatic confrontations. Even the last fight between Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was badly organized. The entire episode had a frantic pace, which motivates a Westerner. Steve Zahn was observable, Karl Urban (an interpreter of Johnny Knoxville) played Call as a man with a lockjaw terminal holster. All sparkling looks, spurs and chin protruding. And what's up with the Rangers? They talked a lot about cleaning up Texas and getting drunk right in the city center. And how nice of Hal Holbrook to have lent his wig and stach Mark Twain to Val Kilmer! The whole of Austin was like the fake Rock Ridge of Blazing Saddles, all facade. I admit that I was drawn into the plot, but it's mainly because there are so many things that I did not understand well, thanks to my late arrival in the story. If I had watched from the beginning, I might not have seen episode three. Now I have to watch Silverado to clean my palette.
