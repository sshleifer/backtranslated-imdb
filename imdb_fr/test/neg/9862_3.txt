I write this note both as a chess player and as a movie viewer. I watched the Kasparov-Deep Blue 1997 games on the Internet. I know something about the issues that have been raised. Other chess players will come and want to know if this movie is worth seeing / buying, and I talk to them for the most part. However, I will try not to ignore those who are not "in chess". <br /> <br /> This film is about the 1997 match between Garry Kasparov and the computer "Deep Blue". However, the first image you see in the film is not that of Kasparov or the computer, but that of "LA TURK". This is an "automaton" that was built in Europe at the turn of the 18th-19th century and played winning chess against all comers. I put the word "automaton" in quotation marks because it was, as everyone knows now, a fake. There was a man inside. <br /> <br /> If you do not like to see "THE TURK", you will not be able to support the movie, because "THE TURK" has as much time on the screen as Kasparov, maybe more, both in modern sequences and in black-and-white footage of an old film. The reappearance of "THE TURK" every few seconds underscores Kasparov's accusation that "Deep Blue" had human assistance - that it was (to some extent) a fake computer, that IBM had cheated, that there was "a man inside" working behind the scenes to help him win. Kasparov does not just believe it, but the filmmakers seem to believe it too. And so it's not really a movie about chess games or programming a computer. This is a propaganda article about a big company supposed to misuse a helpless grandmaster. Really, it looks a lot like a "negative advertising campaign" because it is full of sinister music, evocative photographic work, spooky sound effects and innuendo ("we never knew what was behind this locked door ") and the always present. "TURK". <br /> <br /> Most chess players are virtually convinced that IBM did not cheat and that it was Garry's paranoia at work. To begin, for a human to help "Deep Blue" to beat Kasparov, it would seem that you would need a human better than "Deep Blue" AND better than Kasparov. Since there was no such person, the idea is a bit suspicious from the start. Moreover, by the time this film was shot, there were computer programs on your PC that could beat the big masters. Today, much more than in 1997, we assume that a computer can do something unexpected. And we are less likely to regard as a monumental human tragedy the fact that a computer beat a chess guy. (And in fact, Kasparov fought with two serious mistakes, including the removal of the second part in a zero position.) <br /> <br /> As for the chess games, you see very few little. A few comments from masters and commentators briefly explain how they unfolded, but in reality, you can hardly see strategy or tactics at all. Naturally, as a chess player, I consider this a major gap, but I think non-players are also deceived. Imagine a baseball movie, for example, in which you will hardly see the game. Just one commentator saying that "in the fourth game, the White Sox defeated the Astros with such a score". Nobody would make a movie like this. But here, for example, we are told that Kasparov made a serious mistake at the opening of the decisive game 6, but we are not aware of the position on the screen, nor of the reason why it was an error or what he should have done. instead or whatever. We see only a few seconds of Kasparov holding his head in his hands, then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work. <br /> <br /> (Since I saw this on DVD, let me warn the chess players of this DVD.) The jacket promises that the extras include the games "with analysis" This big master analysis, which people like us might find interesting, is NO, it's the automated synthesizer analysis of voices from a version of Chessmaster, which tells you when a piece is attacked and a piece is isolated and you are in the "Caro-Kann Line of Defense, Main Line." Blahhhh.) <br /> <br /> Someone could then come and say, "Well, clearly this film is intended to dramatize the match for the non-player, and so it's unfair to be impatient with it. "But in reality, it does not do a very good job of reaching the non-player either - it flies over certain points that a true novice would really like to have to explain. For example, it is said that Kasparov could have had a "perpetual control" in the second game, but that does not explain what it is (or does not show how it would look like the painting, which would have been interesting ). This is reminiscent of Kasparov-Karpov's matches but does not explain why they were two, who organized them, etc. I did not need this information myself, but I know it well. If you do not already know chess, there are places where you will get lost, and this is just a flaw of the movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, I can not recommend the film which, like "THE TURK" itself, is not what it claims to be (a documentary), but rather an illusion of theater .
