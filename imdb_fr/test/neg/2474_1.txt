No, * Hitch * is definitely NOT a romantic comedy about Christopher Hitchens, a former leftist-reactionary-reactionary pundit turned bilious (and ambitious), even if it would have allowed for a funnier movie. A stupid little Englishman, teeth stained with cigarettes and Guinness, barking advice - and scathing political comment - addressed to charming men: "Look in his eyes when you talk to him, idiot! And remember: call someone "neo-conformer" makes you a de facto anti-Semite! Can not you understand anything, liberal pantywaist? "<br /> <br /> Oh well, instead we get Will Smith, whose continued success remains a mystery to me, at least. In this respect, Smith is the most powerful man in Hollywood at the time of writing: Americans simply can not help but throw money at him, and I find his sufficiency unbearable, unsatisfactory by a scene here (spoiled by the caravan) where he has a drastic allergic reaction to seafood. We know that Smith will regain his bland beauty and too muscular, because there is a big sit-com actor (Kevin James) We're supposed to laugh hysterically every time the slob dances like a moron (CC Music Factory's "Everybody Dance Now!"), but why would a straight arrow accountant behave this way I have been working for many years with many people I can tell you that if, according to Norman Mailer's memorable phrase, "the tough guys do not dance," right-arrow accountants do not do it either. Am I taking all this too seriously? Or - and here's a daring thought - maybe writers could not conceive of a character logically drawn to save their lives? <br /> <br /> Speaking of writers, they have an ugly idea for Smith's sake interest: a writer for a tabloid (Eva Mendes). Since when do tabloids deserve love? In what universe am I? - Everyone here at IMDb is gushing out of this guts Either you all need to raise the bar, in terms of entertainment value for your money, or I'm just a skunk at the garden party. (Me and about 150 million other boyfriends and long-suffering husbands.) Anyway, if I can imitate Smith's Hitch and offer my male readers some shrewd advice: when you're dragged to see * Hitch *, say your best Half, "Hey, that was pretty good" after the end of the movie. Do not be too excited; Do not give a damn about that - she'll know you're lying to her. Praise him in a slightly surprised way, as if the movie was better than you expected and was not the agonizing loss of time it really was. But what am I saying, huh, guys? - We all know the movements. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10
