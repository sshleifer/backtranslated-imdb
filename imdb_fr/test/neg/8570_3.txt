The title describes it exactly. This movie dribble was nothing more than the typical group of teenagers who accidentally killed someone now that someone haunts / kills them 20 years later, a shit thrown into our throats for decades. The only twist is in the place of an ex-classmate or an adorable psychopath / loser, she was a nun. Nun wants to eliminate the sin of the girls, blah blah, the girls accidentally / voluntarily drown the nun, blah blah, the nun haunts the girls, the people die, the film ends. The only thing that made it visible was the death scenes, which were pretty cool (especially the one with the elevator door tearing the arms of this fat lady), but even they could not make an excellent movie. Brian Yuzna should lower his head to focus on this waste. I'm glad I rented it and not bought it, otherwise I would be furious beyond belief. If you want a non-exploitive movie to please the senses, go see Demonia or something. Stay away from this garbage.
