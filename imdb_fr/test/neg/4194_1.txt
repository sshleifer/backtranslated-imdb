Totally agree with other critics. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I watched the review on another site and found that it was not even a real sequel. It was after I slowly walked away from the television with the remote control in my hand, the jaw falling lower and lower. <br /> <br /> The quality of the shooting exceeds the small budget. It does not even look like a terrifying film. If I watched "personal" video footage of a documentary, I would wait for them. <br /> <br /> In summary: Avoid, avoid. Boooo Lion's Gate! <br /> <br /> Completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and I hope I saved others from renting or possession.
