I bought this because it was $ 1.99 and Harry Carey was in it and one of my friends was there, and for $ 1.99, how bad could it be? Then I read a few comments about the movie and I started to get excited - maybe it was a lost jewel, one of those awful little B movies that everyone had forgotten but deserved to be resurrected. FALSE! I do not know how anyone else can praise this thing, but I found it one of the most boring and flagrant movies I've ever seen. And I'm not talking about Richard Carlson's hokey texan accent (straight from Georgia, I guess). It's just silly. No one in the movie behaves like a real human being. Nobody. And nobody does anything interesting or credible. It's not even a clich√© festival. There are only about 80 minutes of pictures left. He even managed to make Harry Carey, Maria Ouspenskaya and C. Aubrey Smith boring. Now, it's amazing.
