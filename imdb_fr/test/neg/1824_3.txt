During her posting in picturesque Italy, Lana Turner (under the name of Fredda Barlo), a singer punctuated by the lips, meets the older singer and Prince Ezio Pinza (under the name of Mr. Imperium). Both fall in love while enjoying the beautiful Italian countryside. Unfortunately, Mr. Pinza is called on his father's death bed, leaving Lana in embarrassment. Twelve years later, Ms. Turner is a Los Angeles actress about to make a film about falling in love with a king. Turner is in romance with co-star Barry Sullivan, who wants to marry her - then, King Pinza reinstates his life ?? <br /> <br /> "Mr. Imperium" is an exhausted tale for the sex symbol Turner and the first bass singer Pinza, appeared for several decades with the New York Metropolitan Opera. Pinza probably earned his career at MGM after appearing in the highly successful theatrical production of "South Pacific" (1949). The casting album and Pinza's "Some Enchanted Evening" gilded single sold for millions. Supporting actors Marjorie Main, Cedric Hardwicke and Debbie Reynolds give the film an even greater sense of wasted resources. <br /> <br /> *** Mr. Imperium (1951) Don Hartman ~ Lana Turner, Ezio Pinza, Barry Sullivan
