I will start with some quotes from other critics who describe it best. <br /> <br /> "It's easily one of the most overrated movies of the year and probably the worst film Tarantino has ever made." "The only good thing about this film was Mr. Waltz's performance." <br /> <br /> "So I was really disappointed, and seeing this movie instead of 40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only one thing about that, it leaves me speechless "Now for more details, go read reviews of" I hate him ". <br /> <br /> One thing I hate in a film is when it treats its audience as a stupid group. (Spoiler to come). Now, I know that Tarantino's style is based on fantastic and fictional intrigues, but hey, Adolf Hitler and 200 senior Nazi officers will attend a movie premiere in occupied France and you only have two guards in the theater and in around? Where also an African-American walks freely with steel pipes locking the doors and firing. These 2 guards are then executed in a few seconds, opening the door to our 2 "heroes" to kill Hitler at close range with about 100 moves ... very stupid. At least, defy our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (Go look at Valkyrie). In addition, the usurpation of a British general by Mike Myers is more realistic and more authentic than the type making Hitler; Just imagine it. <br /> <br /> What ruined him more is that the only intelligent and powerful character that the film, with its psychological and psychological questions, ends up being easily duped by the most stupid character of the movie. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I sympathized with the Nazis, who were described as having more bravery and humanity than our Basterds !!! Imagine that. <br /> <br /> My recommendations: if you have insomnia, you lose 2 hours 33 minutes or if you want to give a break to your mind, go watch this movie.
