This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was a complete waste of money. If I had not been to the movies with my two young cousins ​​(who also thought it was disappointing, but not as bad as I thought), I would have left the cinema. There were two points in the movie that made me almost laugh, but the rest was either boring, ridiculous or painful. I thought it would be a parody on all superhero movies (which I love), but in fact, it was mostly based on Spiderman, with some oblique references to other superhero movies such as Fantastic Oven and Batman. I really can not think of a good thing to say about this movie. Do not waste your money with this movie, there are many other movies of better quality!
