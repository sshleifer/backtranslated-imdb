At first glance, I must already say, look at The Contractor, 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. A better action movie and with a more dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> The Detonator has a dreadful plot focusing on some kind of atomic bomb, located in Romania and with a frightful staging for an action movie - there is no excitement of moments and a movie action causes boredom. <br /> <br /> Really, what do you expect Wesley Snipes to do, when terrible scenarios like this one are on offer? Do not blame him, he needs money. <br /> <br /> It was the first impression when I saw the film, 3 years ago. But I will never see him again. Screw it. That sucks. The. I said it. <br /> <br /> PS: I do not think I've ever said that "this film was nil" in an IMDb review. Thanks Detonator!
