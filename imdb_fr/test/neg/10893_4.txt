A young couple decides to flee in sunny California. They never reach their destination and decide to stop at the rest area. <br /> <br /> After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on stopping. When she is ready to leave, she comes out of the bathroom to find that her boyfriend has disappeared with her car, leaving her trapped in the alleys of Texas with only an abandoned motorhome to keep him company. <br /> <br /> Stop is one of those cheap and dubious horror movies that could become a cult classic. Will Stop Stop Stop become a cult classic? The three essential elements to become a cult classic are gore, sex and artistic merit. Rest stop stop has lots of gore blood, and although I do not want to give too much, it contains tons of nakedness full of blood. This film has it all, the villain who runs several times on the legs of a policeman with his car, until he uses a pneumatic drill on the leg of a girl. Sometimes it can be as bloody as a movie. In the first minutes of the film, there is also a free and yet intimate love scene. Therefore, sex is covered. Now the hard ?? does he have an artistic merit? You never see the face of the villain? you see glimpses, profiles, dark silhouettes. It is a faceless, implacable monster that stands out for its artistic merit. The film contains very few characters apart from the main protagonist ?? Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander). Since she herself spends much of the film, she can not reveal her thoughts during a conversation, but has to say them out loud so that we, the audience, know what she's thinking about. This can sometimes be slightly irritating; However, it is a brave step on the part of the writer (John Shiban) and it works for the majority of the film. As the public knows, being completely alone and isolated from civilization is scary enough, even if you are not pursued by psychotic killers. <br /> <br /> So, will Rest Stop become a cult classic? This will probably be the case, because along the gore, sex and questionable artistic merit, it also has a lot of chills, an interesting and inventive plot and gives rise to a lot of shouts on the screen because the main character is full of things not to do. running from a psychotic killer. (What pleasure are horror movies if you can not complain about the stupidity of the victims?)
