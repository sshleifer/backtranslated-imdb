I will say one thing for Herman, USA: he will probably always play well for the Minnesota public. I can not imagine there is another place in the world where a reference to Bemidji's quick life or a phrase like "I knew there was something wrong with Iowa" would make the house fall. In fact, I really enjoyed the first hour or two. Basically, a group of lonely peasants take out a personal ad and discover their assaulted city of female contenders (are the contenders a gender-specific word?). It is not progressive, certainly, but it is rather charming. Too bad the filmmakers felt the need to tackle a complicated plot about a gold digger and her violent husband. Overall, it's too disgusting for its own good, but you have to give some props to a movie with the courage to give a guy with Kevin Chamberlin a naked love scene. I will always applaud the description of people who do not meet the usual standards of beauty as benevolent and loving human beings, but that is not enough to buy Herman, United States. To paraphrase Jello Biafra, it is nostalgia for an age that has never existed.
