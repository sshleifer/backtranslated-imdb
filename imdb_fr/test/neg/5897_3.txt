I tried. Lord help me, how I tried. But there are just people almost unable to create quality. Brett Ratner, Uwe Boll, Britney Spears and Asylum. To their credit, the "9/11 Commission Report" seems to be an honest attempt by society to move into a more sophisticated state of storytelling and filmmaking. But for all intents and purposes, this is like another movie really in their gallery. At the opening, the warning informs the public that all the names have been changed, but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same. A man named Mussaui tries to learn to fly a plane. With an icy grimace that would instantly make someone uncomfortable, this "infiltration" agent is able to learn to fly on a small computer. And you have to wonder, not how he was able to register so easily with this program, but how did these people not even ask questions; because this scene is so far-fetched in its presentation and the actor who plays this man is extremely excessive. And you can see that director Scott is trying to emulate Paul Greengrass with a bright grain photograph followed by a terribly dizzying and irritating hand-to-hand direction that, throughout the film, is trying to take off shooting techniques from guerrilla gung-ho of Greengrass. <br /> <br /> You can feel Scott imitating the Greengrass technique for realism, but he's getting pretty crazy halfway. Meanwhile, the film runs minus a "traffic" takes off, and more a takeoff of "Law & Order" in which we will have the warning telling us that the names have been changed, the logo almost recalls the logo "Law & Order ", then ninety minutes of the actors pampering their chest and discussing politics. <br /> <None of these elements is ever as convincing as it tries to be. And then, when the movie seems to want to be an adult drama, Scott relies on his flawless old movie, The Sex Scene. Scott's new film seems to really want to be considered a low-budget "Munich", but it is not, and it manages to be disappointing at every opportunity. "The Commission's report on 9/11" falls flat, because of its limited attempts to emulate other films. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the ambition inherent in the camera, this new perspective of the events that preceded the 9/11 is flat and dull. As difficult as being a low-budget "Munich", it's just as entertaining as a normal Dolph Lundgren movie you'll find on Cinemax.
