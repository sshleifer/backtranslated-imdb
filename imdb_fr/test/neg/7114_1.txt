When you first sit down to watch this movie, remember that you are going to see something you have probably never seen before. Keep in mind that this is a movie in which they obviously spend a lot of money for explosions and not enough to play a role or anything else. The crazy thing I noticed is that each character is completely over-portrayed, and it seems (mostly anyway) that the movie was "sped up" so that the characters move faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version has been dubbed too?) I understand that the cartoon had this, but it does not work for the live-action. It seems strange ... as if the film crew had decided to act because she could not afford real actors. <br /> <br /> The English version is horribly dubbed and the character's words do not match the lyrics at all. . I would have preferred subtitles, but as it is a children's movie and some children do not read well, I let it go. But there is something extremely strange in this film. This is supposedly a children's film, but there is a lot of material on SEX, VIOL and STRIPPING that does not quite address the young Western audience. (In the East, they have different laws and sexuality in children's movies is much more accepted). But parents are warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, several scenes where they say "sex maniac" and a scene where this Japanese girl incredibly melts a sexy dance for one of the "sexual maniacs" and shows her her breasts! For whom was this film made? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the special effects are laughable. You can say that the things that bomb the village look like spaceships are cardboard cuts (or animations, I was not sure) that do not seem convincing, even for a child. The directors of this film left many interesting things in the cartoon, simply because they could not predict the kind of money they would need. I did not like how the names of all the characters were changed ... I wondered if this movie was shot by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it not really. movie to anyone. Children, adults or Dragon Ball Z fans. It's just a bad representation of the cartoon, and of course, we can say that this film was rushed and nothing was done. I will not even start shooting ... wait for the end credits for the photo that stays there for 2 minutes ... most of the shots are not framed correctly ALL and the film seems simply made by amateurs. Granular film quality too. <br /> <br /> Simply horrible !!!! <br /> <br />
