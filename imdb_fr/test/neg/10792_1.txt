The plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the African jungle / plains. His turkey and the few. What is really these are very mismatched pictures of first sound and dumb movies, mixed with recent badly shot images (at the exit) of men during a safari. There are scenes of a man in gorilla costume, natives of the South Seas at sea (representing people from central Africa), women in bikinis, horrible stories and a guy in loincloth covered with makeup on the insensitive body I think so). It's a movie you do not care about, but only with lots of alcoholic drinks and witty friends. At any other time, it will be a chore to accomplish. It's a bad bad movie. Beyond that I'm speechless
