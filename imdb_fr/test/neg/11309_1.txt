After watching this film, I felt stomach ache and if I had seen another minute, I should have rushed to the bathroom and vomited until dawn. A sick movie that was NOT funny and was not worth the money, no money at all. If anyone wants to see this movie, do not do it! Your children will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week. So, if you value your child's education and want to stimulate his or her mind, please do not see this movie. I beg you, DO NOT!
