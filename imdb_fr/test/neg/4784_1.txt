I watched the first 10 minutes of this show and I think I'll have fun now! One of the worst shows on television. It's not even funny. It's so bad that it's disgusting. I gave him a second and third change could not even last five minutes. Do not waste time. This is one of the many programs that have to bid farewell. Speaking of regular nocturnal emissions that have to leave. All shows on CBS. All shows on ABC. All shows on FOX and Joe Buck. All broadcasts on the new CW network. All programs from the NBC channel (Accept the Law and Order series). All talk shows in the morning and afternoon. All TV shows of the Court. And every reality show! Every stupid game show. period the end! All the home improvement shows! And all the news from the media. It's a 24-hour loop of bad news. Yes, I have Favorite Monk, The law and the orders, that's all for me.
