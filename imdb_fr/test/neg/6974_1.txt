"Glen or Glenda" was Edward D. Wood Jr's first attempt at making a feature film. For this, he chose a subject that is close to his heart: the travesty, "art" of a man who wants to dress as a woman. To his credit, Wood tried to treat a subject that was largely taboo in 1953. Unfortunately, Wood had neither the budget nor the know-how to make the film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a prologue of Bela Lugosi makes little sense, then goes on to discover the dead transvestite Glen / Glenda (Daniel Davis, aka Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot) with the help of psychiatrist Alton (Timothy Farrell) tries to understand why a man would want to live (and die) in this way. <br /> <br /> Glen is engaged to Barbara (Dolores Fuller) and hesitates to tell her about her obsession. And that's all. We see countless archive archival plans, ranging from highway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach, interspersed with shots of Wood walking down the same street dressed in Glen or Glenda, and enviously looking at women's clothes in the street. showcase of a shop. Poor old Bela, who has been unlucky and befriends Wood, does not stop appearing throughout history. I'm not 100% sure, but I think Bela's scenes have been added for her name after the movie. <br /> <br /> To add to the confusion of Lugosi's story, Farrell, Dr. Alton, provides off-screen narration. Lugosi keeps saying, saying, saying, saying ... take care, take care, and gibberish about snakes and snails and puppy tails. <br /> <br /> The story also speaks of a transvestite who is successful sex change and tries to explain the difference between this person and the character (s) of Wood. The dream sequences are laughable. A wedding sequence in which a person dressed as a devil appears is a good example. Wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors (?) Fully clothed, but leaving little imagination, risky for 1953. <br /> <br /> This movie with the other "classics" of Wood was so bad that they have become adopted by the public as cult classics over the years. Because of this, they have survived to this day.
