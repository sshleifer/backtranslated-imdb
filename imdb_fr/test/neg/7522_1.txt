After reading the novel that lasts about an hour, watching this movie has become a disappointing and disappointing experience. As in Prince of Egypt, Simon Wells managed to direct a screenplay that removes all the drama and mystery of its source and makes it a homogenized nonsense. Now, I'm a sucker for the cheese and the camp but this film was meaningless. There was no joy in performance or humor. There was no thrill and this idiot book holder with Addby's character, Filby, tossing his hat up, was the last straw for hack writing. I felt very violated when this film was finished and I still refuse to believe that it only lasted 90 minutes. I was wondering how the studio and the director could have such an ugly screenplay, but my friend introduced me to the film exactly as it was and I said wow, that sounds great, but what is it? happened to the movie?
