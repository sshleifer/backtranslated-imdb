I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad. I am surprised that anyone takes this seriously. The characters are one-dimensional, even the good and especially the bad guys. The only credit is that it's so bad that it's funny. In fact, for me, there's the added benefit of being shot in a state park not far from my home, so seeing some local sites on the big screen is a shame. <br /> <br /> The main character is a cop outside of work hours, and insists a lot on making a man understand that self-defense justice is not just a bad idea. is against the law. Imagine how long it lasts ... <br /> <br /> Most of the characters in the Northern California film are Hollywood balls dried in the fresh air, which seem to have never been to argue. The scenario is totally predictable. This film is ripe for tarnishing the MST-3K. CAMP value only. I'm pretty forgiving movies in general, but seeing the old positive reviews, I had to speak up. It's a dog. I give it a 3 out of 10, and only then to laugh.
