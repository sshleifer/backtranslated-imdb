What a travesty of injustice in the cinema - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this. People are a lot closer to a 3.0, I will even go to a member and say 4.0 where I put it. Come on, how can you have a movie on a static electricity network surrounding the Earth and extraterrestrial amorphous cellular structures and not give it at least 4.0 for creativity? Then you have a wonderful dialogue like, "Dave, look at the composition of this mud." You know, I do not think they're back to that mud. It does not matter, it's the kind of film for which the zealous movie 'Z' lives, and I can now be quiet. In fact, I saw it a few years ago without the proper appreciation, with Corman titles such as "Attack of Giant Leeches" and "Wasp's Woman". I do not know what the fascination could be, but to quote a character from the movie - "Whatever it is, it works fast!" <br /> <br /> Back to this extraterrestrial amorphous cellular structure - I liked the idea of ​​a third element competing with your standard red and white blood cells. When astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) came back from the dead, I had a vision of a scene that could have been a precursor to "Alien" of 1979, but that should not have been. Instead, budget restrictions limit the image to a chipped Big Bird, even though this concept is not yet ready within ten years. Who knows where one idea stops and starts again with another? <br /> <br /> Look, it's not so bad. Not so good, but not so bad. Whenever you can connect astronauts to the emergency landing with extraterrestrials determined to conquer the Earth, you get a winning combination. Add the monster cheese factor and you're on your way. Just remember, "A wounded animal of this size is not good."
