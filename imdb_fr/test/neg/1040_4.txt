Where to start is one of the most frustrating films I've seen because it makes sense, but it's totally stupid. A film on an inhabited ghost bed ?? The first 2 minutes of the film show a black-and-white flashback of a bizarre, weird domineering on a Fabienne of the winner of the Pulp Fiction resemblance contest and strangling her with her tie. This is supposed to define how the bed is taken into account in the story. Nevertheless, if you want an opening to keep people interested or send them back earlier, having strangulation is the way to do it. Until now, a married couple moved into an apartment with a friendly owner and began to store his things, for now everything is normal. Then, one night, while they are doing the hippity massage on one mattress, they realize they need a bed frame. This is where things go wrong, why did not they bring or buy a sacred bed frame before going there? We learn that the door leading to the attic where the first two minutes took place does not open, but when the couple realizes they need a bed frame, the door opens like magic. They go up into the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it down. Their days of love life are saved ... or at least, they thought. The rest of the film is centered on the fact that they are both haunted by the bed structure. The woman is an artist so she starts to draw the macabre images of which she dreams and the male is a photographer, so he begins to imitate his models as if they were tortured or tied up (one of them has hair gray and appears over 50 years old, yuck) The woman is increasingly scared and discovers that her house was once a haven for serial murders and murders that led to the end of the film. They find the friendly owner murdered (which makes no sense because the ghosts have to take a human form to kill) and decide to get by. While packing, the husband climbs morally into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy and fat guy and the woman gives him a bullet in the skull before the cops show up and takes him to a psychiatric ward where she kills a guy who tries to flirt with her. <br /> <br /> Well, if you've read so far, you have to think of one thing ....... WHY IT'S REALLY THAT I JUST JUST OFF THE BED FRAME ABOVE FROM THE WINDOW ???? Seriously, they never said anything about the haunted house, just read it ... so why not get rid of that damn thing and move on? That's why the movie is so frustrating because it's a good plot and the actors do the same, but there are more holes than Sonny Corleone at a tollbooth. The couple tried to leave the city as claimed by another film that has the old ploy "oh, give this place a chance, darling," so the props are there. However, my boyfriend who watched the movie and I continued to repeat every 5 minutes ... why did not they just throw the bed? Especially once they learned that it was haunted it would have been a good time to set it on fire or something like that. <br /> <br /> In short, it's an almost visible movie with a lot of pornographic scenes like bed and a credible plot (to a certain extent) but the solution is so simple that you scratch your head at the end of the movie by asking how much the married couple can be stupid? The highlight of the film is that the husband asks the 50-year-old model to spread his legs and his assistant tells him he can not film it like that. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 porn The Man Show would like)
