'Nuff said. A police officer infiltrated from the state capital is sent to a small county where the moonlight race is endemic. He ends up getting off the road by local drivers who do not know he is a police officer under cover (so they leave as if nothing had happened). He is soon supported by a woman and her three daughters who all wear high necklines and short shorts (I must love the 70s). He falls in love with one of the girls, but in the meantime, he still has to discover who makes all the spark and leads to all the bars and restaurants in the region. He also has to deal with a big sheriff and his incompetent deputy, who considers himself a fool because he is new to the city. <br /> <br /> Life in a small American town, in the style of the 70s. YEE HAAAAAAAAAAA.
