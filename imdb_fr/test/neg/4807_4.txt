I am a big fan of prison dramas, which translates into the fact that OZ is my favorite American TV show of all time. I guess the appeal lies in a type of enough voyeurism that consists of wanting bad things to happen to the buttocks of the bad guys, but I found Don Siegel's RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 show rather disappointing. Okay, I knew that since its creation in 1954, it would be devoid of vulgar language, graphic shankings and gang rapes, but it's still a rather weak film compared to the portrait of a prison in previous films like EACH DAWN I DIE and WHITE HEAT. The problem lies in the film's goofy tone, with Dunn, the anti-riot leader, being a sort of prison reformer. Yeah, that sounds ridiculous, because he is a violent anti-hero rather than just a salary, but that's what he wants in essence, he wants to see rehabilitated prisoners reintegrate into society rather than suffer. There is also a problem of making a film B with such radical themes (rather ironic that Siegel later makes DIRTY HARRY where the only good criminal is a dead man) and that is that the casting is not very good with Emile Meyer as a particularly irritating goalkeeper in his performance. as I said a disappointing movie
