I can not say enough about the seriousness of this film. First of all, what a waste of legendary stars although they are old and unconvincing. Fred Astaire, well, I guess he had to do a big favor to someone because it was his last role in the movie. The screenplay is messy and the movie seems terribly dragging. I guess if I saw that when it came out (1981), I might have thought it was decent. However, seeing so many good horror movies was one of the worst. The only thing that could really convince in this mess was Alice Krige's very young and pretty species. The young main character was trying to do his best but was absolutely terrible. I did not know too much because of his lack of skill or the lack of an understandable script, but anyway, he was just bad. Do not look unless you want to see a group of old guys get a little scared.
