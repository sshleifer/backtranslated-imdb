Unlike most critics here, I hated this movie, simply because the writer / director's bloated ego was a potentially interesting topic. Too many moviegoers equate "EXTREME self-indulgence" with "GENIUS movie!", But I do not adhere to this cult of personality. A film should be about it, not about its director (unless it's a Woody Allen movie, of course). * SPOILER * (which is just as good, save your time ...) There's nothing great to show you the you-know-what of the pornstar foot-long in the last picture, this which is actually called a sticky maneuver that SCREAMS hackism film school. <br /> <br /> The film set has obtained the status of "great film" thanks to its indulgence and its indulgence towards the public ?? who is above all the writer / director. But the rest of the public should also despise the brutal and brutal nature of the porn industry. The film had an opposite angle to the porn industry, watching every player he could hit. Whatever, like your writer / director. Love these steadicam segments of four minutes, which are supposed to show the energy of the moment, but which have somehow the verve of a switch. Love the story, no matter how annoying it is, about the sordid rise and sordid fall of a porn star. But despise him too, of course. While the subject has the potential to be fascinating ?? innocence, money, degradation, beauty - your venerable writer / director has managed to give it all the air again, DULL. Partly because of its execution time. Here's something your author hero DOES NOT try: Give a dimension to the characters. Or soul. Anything to laugh about, except Genius That Paul Is, of course. But I do not buy. I do not buy in indulgent hacks with an amazing hype. <br /> <br /> Another piece of relatively long author hack, with fifty times more hype than quality. I know some of you agree. Others will probably see this indulgent film again. Not my problem.
