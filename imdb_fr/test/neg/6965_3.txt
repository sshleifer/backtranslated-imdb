There is a part of me that would like to give a high score to this movie. Considering it was made in 1953, it is a very brave film about transvestites, addressing the issue in a fairly serious and sympathetic way (and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject) and striving not to stereotype. The film clearly shows that transvestites are not homosexuals and that in addition to wearing women's clothing, they lead a relatively normal life. It's about not being accepted in society - the plot revolves around a police officer (Lyle Talbot) who desperately tries to understand the issue because of a transvestite's recent suicide. So, you have to thank everyone involved in this film for addressing such a controversial subject (in the context of 1953). <br /> <br /> That said, I'm also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely terrible. In trying to portray the pain of Glen / Glenda (Edward D. Wood), the film falls into stupid fantasies (and sometimes surprising - again considering the time - sensual) that make the story very difficult to follow . The acting game is at best wood. None of the dialogues seems real; the actors look and feel like people reading speeches written by others. And - worst of all - there was no point in having Bela Lugosi in this movie. This was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles that this poor man was assuming in the latter stages of his career. "Pull the strings, pull the strings", the character of poor Lugosi (called The Spirit in the credits, but who really looks like a mad scientist) kept crying. And none of what he did seemed to really have a strong connection to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> For its artistic value, the film does not deserve more than 1/10. However, for the courage necessary for its publication, I will give it a 3/10.
