What can I add more? It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting, a silly storyline, a tedious look - even visible microphones hang from the top of the screen. I could go on, but I really can not be bothered. I watched it for 90 minutes before the feeling of losing the desire to live became too big for me. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the first comments and votes were made by people associated with the promotion of this insulting film to the making of British films. <br /> <br /> And even worse, I had to buy the Mail on Sunday to get it :-) The only reason the DVD was not redeployed as a coaster is that it now occupies a place of choice in my collection Top 10 Worst Films Ever. <br /> <br /> Decidedly, a work to avoid.
