I attended the Prime Minister last night. The movie started with a bang (perhaps because of the excitement before the prime minister). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes, then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting sleep. This movie can not be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or any of Guest's works, unless you mean that _Sons of Provo_ is a terrible mistake. He just fell flat, he died, it was painful. The story was going nowhere, the jokes were bland, even if you were a Mormon and you could have all the jokes from the inside, it was a waste of time. There were two qualities that redeemed: Kirby's acting was perfect! And the songs were very clever (for an LDS audience only). So, my recommendations ... Avoid the movie. And if you are Mormon, buy the music CD.
