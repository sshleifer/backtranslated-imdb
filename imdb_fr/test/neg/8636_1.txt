Ignore this Hollywood version, a real trash. An inexpensive insult to the brilliant original "Spoorloos", or by the English title also called "The Vanishing". It lacks the typical Hollywood grotesque fashion brand, usually due to a bunch of unsophisticated bean counters who do not have a clue about something art, just looking for the "hit formula" and want it applies to everything. glean a profit. Just like the unlikely 1995 "The Scarlet Letter", which had so distorted the original story to please the MacDonaldsland crowd, it had become an aberration, not even a bastard, but a heap but not like even remotely resembles the spirit of the original. Except that this movie had at least Gary Oldman, which is interesting to watch in everything he does. This dog has nothing to envy, even the very talented Jeff Bridges is embarrassing. A great tragedy is neither should nor ever be "the film that feels good of the year" but instead takes one or more of the tragic events that are unfortunately all too common in life and allows the reader / viewer to make sense of better understand the human condition. Do yourself a great favor if you are looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage can and pick up the original made as part of a Franco-Dutch collaboration in 1988. This is an excellent movie. It's a horrible mess.
