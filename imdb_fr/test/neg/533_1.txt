As a sci-fi and casual fan, Angelina Jolie, I thought this low-budget movie might be worth watching ... maybe it included some scenes or a scenario that would make up for all of her other defaults. In addition, it could be interesting to see Angelina embark on a star career. <br /> <br /> Oh, I was wrong. One thing I learned: at 18, Angelina Jolie could not act. So, to put it at ease, the producers shot all this film with people who could not play. Seeing this, Jack Palance (who can really act) has decided to outdo himself. Just look at it for 10 minutes to make it burn your eyes. <br /> <br /> Add to this horrible game of actors and your tactics a senseless scenario, an insipid dialogue, an insignificant cinematography ... all in the back of the barrel. <br /> <br /> The story presents Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate lords as a murderer. She escapes from the company headquarters with the help of her combat instructor. The company sends bounty hunters to pursue them. Stupid things happen. The end. I'll tell you more, but I did not want to lose my life watching this mess. <br /> <br /> I beg you, it's not worth watching. It's not even worth thinking about watching. Save yourself the pain and move forward.
