My brain was screaming, "Why do you keep watching, turn it off and go to bed!" But the sofa potatoness won, and I watched until the predictable end. I guess when it's Bruce Campbell, I have to give him a chance. <br /> <br /> I can not complain about a low-budget movie just because of the budget ... over and over again, we see a small budget of movies proving that a good story , good writing and good interpretation are enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce started their career with such a movie, but they did not seem to have learned from Sam that it took a little more than slapping him to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It's sad too. because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70s and 80s, I simply can not believe that such bad movies are still in the works. Bruce, I'm really disappointed.
