"Delusion" is what you feel when you watch this movie and then think you have seen something worthwhile. This film, about a trio of semi-psychopathic travelers who have no value, somewhere in the California desert, is amateurish and just stupid. The film suffers from a horrible story, a lousy scenario and a terrible direction to name just a few of the deficits. If the film has something to offer, it's the very performance of the movie B diva, Rubin. Do not waste your time with this turkey. (RE)
