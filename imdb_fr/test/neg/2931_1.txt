I think this film was a huge waste of time, and I would know it after watching it 5 times in class. This film does not show what happened to perfection. no one can really say that these things happened to the letter. the actors, even if they were really shitty, would read the script without expression. rather boring. I would rather watch school play. so I really would never see this movie again in my life. it's a complete waste of time, unless you want to waste your time and want to have an unrealistic view of what happened in 1981.
