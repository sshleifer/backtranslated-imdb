I thought the dormant cell was interesting and exciting to watch, until the last episode, when nothing happens, his F ****** BS, you, the Americans, portray Muslims as terrorists and Americans as Heroes, it's the opposite, I hate when every American TV show is predictable, I was hoping the bombs would fire in this stadium, but I knew it would not do it, it takes away the joy of watching it when you know that the good guys are leaving to save the situation, again, the Americans are the biggest terrorists, and Bush is the leader of all, he is to blame for September 11, and I'm glad you continue to we launch these broadcasts, which are all the same ****** same! I have a good show on terrorism, it's called "The Whitehorse" and Bush himself the head of the cell. Same thing with 24; as never before 24 was good, the cell-bed is a replica and should never do a season 2, it's a F **** joke! and you too are American producers.
