It starts as a very serious social commentary that quickly makes you think of other Clark movies such as Kids, Bully, etc. Who is the main character? Is it a serious movie or a kind of Gregg Araki-esquire about the best goofy movie? Is it a documentary about skateboarding with inserted moments of dialogue? I have no idea. I found myself looking at the clock and wondering when that shit was going to end. I kept thinking that there would be a shocking climax that would never have happened. I cut 20 good minutes of the movie by quickly advancing unnecessary skate scenes. Yes, this illustrates the changing landscape between the haves. I got it early. Kids and Bully was designed in such a way that I really felt like I was observing the realities of this group of friends. Wassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and worse and worse. Teenage Caveman, whom Larry did not write but directed, was terrible. But at least it felt like it was supposed to be a terrible movie that did not take itself seriously. Wassup Rockers was just bad.
