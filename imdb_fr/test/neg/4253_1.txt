I do not see why everyone loves this movie so much. True, it has good intentions and a sense, but you can not compensate for such a poor script. Woody Allen is a brilliant filmmaker, but I'm afraid it's just a waste. It is extremely predictable and the subject is too visible. I am a big fan of Woody Allan and I like most of his works, but I can not recommend him.
