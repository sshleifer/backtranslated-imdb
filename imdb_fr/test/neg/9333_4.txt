"Solomon and Sheba" was the kind of movie you had to see in the late '50s, when I was a child: a spectacular biblical epic with well-known performers, unusual costumes, many extras and battle sequences . So I went to see him; but I remember that at the time, "Solomon and Sheba" did not impress me at all, which was a strange thing since I really liked "The Ten Commandments", "Quo Vadis", "Helen of Troy "and others. The fact is that when you are a child, you neglect the images that adults do not make (bad actor, for example) and you are easier to satisfy with warriors in their armor, their battles, their duels with the sword and their actions. not impressed then something is wrong with a product like this. <br /> <br /> This film, although it presents some of these characteristics, is certainly standard and average. Yul Brynner's wooden representation as a Hebrew king does not even light up as he has Gina Lollobrigida voluptuous and half-naked dancing around him provocatively. She is better and makes a game acceptable. George Sanders does not seem interested in what he's doing and Marisa Pavan (Pier Angeli's twin sister) adds nothing at all as a kind of Brynner consciousness. <br /> <br /> The final duel between the sword between Brynner and Sanders is just for the plot and lacks interest and intensity (he had to film, that's all). <br /> <br /> Not a good goodbye to the director King Vidor, Salomon and Sheba will likely be remembered as the last unfinished Ty Power image.
