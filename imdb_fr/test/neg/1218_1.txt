It's the worst Italian movie of all time, probably the worst movie of all time! Joe D'Amato is of course not a film genius, but many of his films are interesting and watchable. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. It's nerdy and boring .... waaaaay boring. If you want a movie in MST3k, get Troll 2, if you want a movie to put someone in a coma, get some blood!
