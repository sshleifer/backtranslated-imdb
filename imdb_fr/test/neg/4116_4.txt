Yeah, of course, the visual effects of the movie were already horrible and unhelpful, but the premises and distribution seemed good, so I was still expecting to be entertained by this movie. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The premise is good, but the story is full of improbabilities and is logically flawed. <br /> <br /> This film is potentially screened in the bathroom. The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. It's good enough to make a good adventure movie from what you think. However, this film does not manage to entertain and I think it is the biggest defect of this film. Maybe this is taken too seriously and a little more humor would certainly not hurt the film. Instead, it's nothing more than a lame and cheap movie, filled with one improbable event after another, which also steals a few too many other more successful movies. Mainly "Jurassic Park" obviously. <br /> <br /> The characters do not contribute to make the film more convincing or at least interesting to watch. I still think that Edward Burns did a pretty decent job as the leading "heroic" principal. However, the rest of the characters are really lost in the movie and become very uninteresting to do. The film is based on his visual, which is extremely poor. Catherine McCormack also plays a very irritating character. Basically, all she's doing is complaining and saying how right she was and the rest oh so fake. His character is just not nice. And the rest of the characters ... well, I've already forgotten their names, I think that says enough about them. It is true, however, that Ben Kingsley's performance alone makes this film interesting to watch. He's really good in his role as a naughty businessman, but from the moment he disappears from the film, the film deteriorates quickly. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is extremely poor. It has awesome CGI effects and they could not even get more convincing "blue screen" effects in the movie. The sets are also awful and inexpensive, as they can fall and collapse at any time. <br /> <br /> The film never becomes tense, exciting or adventurous since the story is presented in the least interesting and engaging way possible. It's a very distant film with far-off characters that fail to impress. There are many action sequences, but all are so ridiculous and so impossible to believe that they never become tense or sufficient enough. <br /> <br /> This film is therefore fundamentally lacking in all that is needed to create a genre. movie like this one a good and successful one. It is sad to see how much director Peter Hyams has fallen in recent years, after making good films in the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> 4/10
