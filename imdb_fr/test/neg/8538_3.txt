First, the editing of this film had a major flaw which I do not understand how it had been forgotten: you constantly see the microphones suspended in the film. The first time I saw it, I just said "well, there are mistakes" and I swept it away. After about 10 times, he began to become incredibly irritating and distracting. If you have not seen the movie yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone; could make a pretty interesting game. <br /> <br /> Now, about the movie. This film started with the stuff of a beautiful story of "ghosts"; however, the plot in the end completely destroyed it. You begin to watch the film assuming, as suggested by television commercials, that the haunted house is made up of ghosts that only children can see. especially young children, making the situation even more bizarre, as they will not be able to effectively warn the family of imminent danger. The opening scene did a good job of cheating the audience by saying it would be the premise of the movie. ** (SPOILER) ** The film starts with the harassed family and is finally killed by an "invisible" force at home. The idea that only children can see these ghosts gets in motion when the girl, at the beginning of the film, asks her little brother to tell her where "it's" just before "that" catches her and drags her screaming in the cellar. . The boy is also witnessing the murder of his mother by an "invisible force" after she asked him to hide under the bed. After his family has been killed, the boy tries to hide and disappear. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie started with the stuff of a rather spooky film in which the family was hunted down by an "invisible force" with their only hope of survival based on the observations of a two-year-old child. It started to be ruined half-way through the film as the girl was also starting to see the ghosts; Complete illusion of the illusion "only children can see" presented by the commercials and the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film did not really "ruined" until the end of the film. The man who helped the family grow the farm turned out to be the murderer of the family at the beginning of the movie. Suddenly, after being attacked by a swarm of crows, the man cracks and tries to kill the mother, the daughter and the son while making a psychotic crisis in which he believes that they are his family. that he killed at first. <br /> <br /> The plot at the end of the plot just created a whole list of unresolved issues and let me do it. First, why were the souls of the family trapped in a house? If the director turned to a Ju-On approach (The Grudge) in which the family, after being angry, haunted the house and killed the one who entered, why did the obsession stop after the "capture" of the father by the ghosts of his family? If the ghosts only wanted to kill the man who killed them, why did they attack the new family? Here is another one for you. It takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants bloom in time for harvest. It tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning, the man to whom the ghosts seemed to resent the entire movie, lived on the property for months. All the while, why were not the ghosts just killing him? <br /> <br /> This movie had many fears of "horror movies", as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies. However, I tell you, this movie could have been good without the plot at the end. It's as if they just ran out of their budget and put together something to end it. For this film to be a success, they should have stayed with the premise "only the children can see them" and end either by the loss of the family, or by being killed as the family at the beginning (would have open the door). for a possible suite too).
