The only time I laugh at watching this show is when I do not care. Jamie Lynn Spears was named an actress only because of her older sister, and I do not think anyone can argue with me about it. There is no expression in her face EVER (even when she smiles) - watch the show and you'll see what I mean. Let's talk about the show now. Zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows I have ever seen! As many people have already said, Zoey Brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves her, she's a straight A student and all the boys think she's "sexy". The PCA is a boarding school filled with affluent children that offers all students a flat-screen TV and laptop, serving sushi for children from the sushi bar. In one of the most recent episodes, Zoey is completely helpless and thinks Chase is not in love with her and acts as if she does not even want Chase to like her. Then, when she enters Chase's dorm to prove her friends are wrong, she finds Chase kissing this girl named Rebecca. Zoey, of course, panics, probably because she likes Chase's attention. Anyway, watch this show only if you have nothing else to do and Zoey 101 is the only thing on TV. You can at least have fun laughing the way it is unrealistic!
