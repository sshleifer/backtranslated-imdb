I'm very interested in animal children and I've read many novels by Edger Rice Burroughs - but this horrible film could not interest me, nor could I endure all these absurd and unrealistic scenes. I only managed to get through the Africa part and John's first days in Scotland. Let's talk about "unrealistic" and "downright stupid"! The actors in monkey costumes looked like very big chimpanzees rather than big apes (there is a difference). They did not move with the grace of a wild animal. (For comparison, see some of the best films from The Planet of the Apes where they trained their actors to move in the same way). Monkeys eat big pieces of meat - it's not a common practice among great apes to my knowledge. I'm a sucker for animal stories, but the script did not make me care for the monkeys. The great white hunters of the expedition who discovers John Clayton are entirely charicaturish. Clayton's parents were wrecked on an ocean beach, but one way or another, the descent of the river is very long to reach the coast. Give me a break! Let's talk about "slow". Even people who think it's an excellent movie admit that it's not an action movie. Far from there. This is a character study - unfortunately, the most ridiculous part is predominant! I did not read Burroughs' Tarzan books, but many of his other series - they were filled with meaningful action and heroic purpose! This movie is just not there.
