"Problem Child 2" was a total loss of time. The original movie was not very good but it's a classic compared to this movie. The first film went beyond the stage with its scenes of a devilish child devastating the lives of all his relatives. Here, it goes even further. And a scene from this film proves this theory. This carnival sequence was too difficult for me. It's horrible. This film should not have been done. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
