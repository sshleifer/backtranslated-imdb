I liked the sober character that Laura Linney played in "Love Actually" and she is very good in "The Man of the Year". <br /> <br /> But wow. Robin Williams does not give such a performance, with few exceptions it was weak. Laura Linney may not have been taken at random, but either editing has violated her character, or a sad performance by director Barry Levinson. <br /> <br /> And I think Barry Levinson has aged. Both poor performance and unequal results must be the fault of management. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum play the supporting roles very well. Goldblum plays a sinister side with taste, and the combination between manager and commentator for the Walken film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> But the story is clich√©, the presentation seems to have been (should) have been very good image and too many actions are without conviction. The pace, the history and the direction are all weak, compared to, say, "headquarters" (parody of "secret of my success").
