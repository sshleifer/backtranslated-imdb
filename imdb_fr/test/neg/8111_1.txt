Having loved Stephen King's novels and short stories for many years, I, like most critics, have been constantly disappointed with the film adaptations of his printed works. Some notable exceptions are "Stand By Me" from "The Body", "Carrie" from the novel of the same name and "The Shawshank Redemption" from "Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption". This film is by far the worst thing ever produced with the name of Stephen King. It is not surprising that Mr. King has pretty much denied any connection to that. I think what hurt me the most about this misdirected, cheap, and hideously directed junk is that they had the audacity to change the ending COMPLETELY. Do not waste your time or money on this incredible feature film! !
