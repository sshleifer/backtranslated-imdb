Coltrane and Idle are members of a gang of bank robbers who double their leader on a robbery. They hide in a convent school and disguise themselves appropriately so as not to be detected by the crowd and the police. A lot of Catholic humor and slapstick, but the scenario is a little thin as are the laughs .. There is however a good shower scene ... on a scale of one to ten.4
