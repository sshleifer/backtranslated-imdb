I saw this film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2005. <br /> <br /> This film was compared in the EIFF program at Sideways - which I liked - so I was waiting with impatience this movie. I also liked Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite, etc., so I recently had good experiences with slightly strange Indian movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found that Puffy Chair did not compare favorably to any of these films. . <br /> <br /> I sat for 35 minutes waiting for something fun, witty, insightful or even slightly interesting to happen. That's not the case - and the shaky video camera made me sick - so I left. <br /> <br /> This is only the second movie of my life (the first was "Showgirls"), which is slightly disappointing. I probably could have lasted longer if the nauseating images in the picture did not look nauseating - but nothing in the first 35 minutes made me feel like I'd miss anything. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
