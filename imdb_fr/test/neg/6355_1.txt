In the wake of the matrix, this parody of a movie with loose links to virtual reality has been reissued with the slogan "The Matrix just received Deadler!", In a box with a very matrix cover (also called "Expect to Die ") though). Because of the choice of the font, the tag-line looks like the word "Beablier" to the whole world. Anyway. <br /> <br /> To complete the Wondabe Matrix transformation, they simulated a virtual reality battle scene with a Morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. It may be important to know that this character is not in the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a parody at every level. Jalal Mehri is an awful actor and does not impress with his martial arts. However, his partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie, who in this film is simply the worst actor I have ever seen. Clearly, it was chosen to give Jalal a beautiful appearance in comparison. The worst movie I've seen in a long time.
