This film is a waste of almost complete time. I study the book for my level of English A, and the film contributes only one way, and it is obvious that the whole scenario is set in a rural idyll. The acting is wooden, the filmography is laughable and the drama scenes of the film had the majority of my class (including mine) sneering in their lyrics. The book, although it's not my favorite literary choice, is worth more than the movie, and the soundtrack is just irritating. Watch this film only if you are looking for a timeless and quality storyline turned into a senseless media waste.
