I saw Roger Moore fingering scenes that required running or exercise. It was a James Bond who would be more comfortable sitting in a bar telling stories with his fellow British Knights. Nothing against older people in age-appropriate roles, but how realistic is it for a fragile-looking 58-year-old man to fight on airplane wings, hang from a train , to swim in a swamp with crocodiles, etc. ? Aside from the fact that OCTOPUSSY was incredibly stupid, tasteless and weak, the fact that a frail old man had participated in many deadly stunts made it so much easier to make fun of James Bond. In 1983, Roger Moore clearly looked his age and he was far from being able to fight with younger men. I saw this film in the theater and laughter was numerous and very frequent. Any credibility that James Bond had acquired had disappeared after OCTOPUSSY. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was missing at OCTOPUSSY was Benny Hill and his actors. Another weak point was that the incredible Louis Jordan was half of the Axis of Evil. Jordan helped make the concept even more laughable. And the Russian general was a total blunder. OCTOPUSSY works better as a comic parody similar to SPIES LIKE US. <br /> <br /> Even the fight scene in the train is just a dubious copy of the same train scenes made in many other movies by better actors. Take EMPEROR OF THE NORT (1972), where Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine fought all over the top and bottom of the train to give it an exciting and real appearance. <br /> <br /> Roger Moore had a thin and fragile body in 1983 and yet his stuntman was clearly a younger, taller, sporty and muscular man. Even the hair color does not match. It only made his fight scenes more comical. Moore's waterfalls were like those old, low-budget Kung-Fu Chop-Socky movies, especially with the wrong editing. The director seemed to try to improve bad actions and bad stunts by offering several views of the same stunt. This only accentuated the differences between Moore and his double stuntman. The fact that the train scenes with Moore were shot inside a studio can be perceived by the lighting when Moore was in the plane compared to the outside shots of the doubler in a real train. Even though a lot of Bond movies have to be the worst of all time to edit their stunt fights. You can usually see clearly that the actor Bond is not fighting. All in all, OCTOPUSSY must rank among the worst films ever made and by far among the worst of the worst Bond movies.
