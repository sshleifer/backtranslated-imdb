I found that Dominion was an ugly attempt to continue the success of the story. The original film was a story about evil and how it could infiltrate our lives. <br /> <br /> Schrader's version is lacking. Viewers do not feel a sense of terror, fear or even appalling apprehension. The Harlin version offers obvious harm, shows violations of the sanctity of the church and builds a convincing and plausible story, given Father Merrin's antecedents. Schrader's story leaves one wondering exactly what happened. Dominion does not evoke the emotions felt by the spectators to sympathize with Father Merrin and leaves him wondering exactly why he was troubled. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in a suite at the height of the original should see Exorcist: The Beginning.
