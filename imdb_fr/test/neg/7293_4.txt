Because Disney most often ignores the quality of the animation and the need for a good storyline in their aftermath, it's actually a good surprise. I do not know why Disney does not pay more attention to their aftermath. The graphic quality is always lower. no background worthy of the Disney name, absurd intrigues, and worse dialogue, with little or no attention being paid to the actual story, and the cartoons' drawings are almost always worse than the Saturday morning cartoons in detail and in quality. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is always mediocre compared to the originals of Disney and the dialogue is rather banal, the scenario and the execution in general were really very pleasant. <br /> <br /> Even if he is not so captivating, he does not completely fail to capture the charm and / or mystery of the first. There is a hint, hidden here and there. <br /> <br /> Children will love, anyway. <br /> <br /> He gives a rating of 4.5 / 10 to ... the demon :.
