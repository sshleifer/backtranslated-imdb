This film really misses the mark on most fronts. The accents are ridiculously weak, the theater lover and the comedy are weak at best. <br /> <br /> They have a good idea, it could have been particularly nice, but for the reasons mentioned above. <br /> <The writer seems to think that putting the word f * ck in each sentence will make it funnier and that the main character seems to be trying a little too hard. It's not true that it's safe. <br /> <br /> Get at least one cast that can keep the focus on the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It's a crime to compare this to movies like The Business, Lock Stock and Snatch.
