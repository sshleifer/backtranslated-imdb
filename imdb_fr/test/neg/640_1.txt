It's a really awful movie. Lou Diamond Phillips just calls this one. The use of miniature models of the train is laughable. The plot seems to be developing on the go (there is a stranger on board, oh, and an ecological terrorist is on board too, oh, and the driver is dead and the train is out of control; another train an hour in advance, oh, and this train contains nuclear waste ...). I mean, really go! Extraterrestrial monsters are not scary (even if they are numerous) and the acting is catastrophic. Check out the guy who plays the "next president" - do you really think he could be president? For God's sake, he spent his entire acting career playing villains!
