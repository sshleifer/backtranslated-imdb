Being a big fan of Tale of Summer (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/), I was expecting to be impressed by another romance on the French beach with a lot of honesty, realism and humor. Same director, same actress, what could go wrong? Unfortunately, Pauline in the plange is a huge disappointment. It's very slow and talkative, which would be fine if the dialogue gave a glimpse of the characters, was meaningful or original. But this is a typical soap opera alternating between unrelated speeches with pillows and jealous accusations. The only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least a "character change" regarding Pauline. The source material is the standard fare (sex awakening during a beach vacation), but it could have been a decent film if one of the characters was interesting enough. Unfortunately, it is not the case. Although Rohmer's season cycle has other shortcomings, most of his latest films are significantly better than this one.
