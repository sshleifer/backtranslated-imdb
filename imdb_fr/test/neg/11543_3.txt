In the Philippines, Lethal Panther 2 is a martial art film from the early '90s that sees a reckless cop chasing down the evil criminals who killed his wife. A production rather cheap and almost without artistic merit, this film is based on the quality and quantity of its action. But if the punches, rifle fights and explosions are not lacking, the quality is simply not at the rendezvous. Endless battles are hopelessly lacking originality or enthusiasm, with mediocre editing and banal direction, making this film a real chore to go through. <br /> <br /> The impressive Yukari Oshima, which is generally impressive, is totally lost. by an atrociously bad wire. The ballistic action scenes are an unimpressive mix of idle heroics, delusional stunts and countless villains lining up to get shot. <br /> <br /> so many better examples of 'girls and guns' are now available on DVD, I suggest you leave this one alone (unless, like me, you do not have to endure any hogwash to be a completist).
