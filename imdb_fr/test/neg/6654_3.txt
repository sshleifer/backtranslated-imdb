Well, the plot is entertaining but it's full of blunders. To sum up, the policeman / dad wants to save his son from cancer, but the only way is to get the criminal's transplant (Michael Keaton). <br /> <br /> The transplant was underway and the police and the police are not allowed to fire on the criminal to save his son. (dead criminal - no transplanted son) <br /> <br /> Well, the police in this movie have no brains, in case she never heard of a TAZER able to defeat the criminal without killing him. End of the movie, as simple as that. <br /> <br /> But that's when everything crazy and stupid, including the death of 2cops and some doctors was very badly burned.
