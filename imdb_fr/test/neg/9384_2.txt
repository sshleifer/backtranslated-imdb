Talk about goose bumps. If you really want to sit and watch this episode where the girl who was in Firefly later is kidnapped, there is entertainment for you, but only if you like that kind of thing. To be honest, I think this episode was terrible. Fortunately, this is one of the few episodes of Season 3 and the only episode of Charles Grant Craig, so you do not get much of that stuff in Season 3. So, general verdict? Just read the summary at the top. It's a powerful suitor (Hell Money says hello!) At the worst episode of season 3. To be honest, I had not really expected much. I would like to be able to completely marry this episode. That's one thing they were right: the title.
