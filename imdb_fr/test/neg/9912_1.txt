I was expecting this film to be broadcast before the election. The last shot of CBS to throw a whip at Bush. This movie was horrible but I still watch it. ** Minor spoiler ** I think CBS had the same people who "provided" the memo to make the cut in half sequence. What happens with the scenario of a bad boyfriend? Can the acting game be more artificial or the dialogue more like an Ed Wood movie? Whoever has proposed this script, do us a favor, stop writing. If you want to see decent B grade disaster movies, see Earthquake, Flood, etc. Tip for CBS to avoid showing us this shit. Give us re-executions of CSI instead. Act better and more credible.
