In this horrific mockumentary attempt by Blair Witch, a group of people travel to Africa to investigate a creature called Half Caste. It is quite obvious that there was no script and that everything was improvised. It can work if you have good actors, what this movie did not do. <br /> <br /> This film tries to gain points of originality by exploring a darker myth and an exotic culture. As a result, there are many scenes in the bush where characters make "weird African things" like eating elephant dung. There are also very good pictures of lions eating (from National Geographic's point of view), but there is not a single fright in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Cannibal Holocaust or the Blair Witch project, this movie does not surprise you, and you can probably watch better lions on the Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> Certainly a half-hearted effort. <br /> <br /> For the filmmakers, make us happy, and save the movie "How I spent my holidays in Africa" ​​next time for your family and close friends. Nobody else wants to see him.
