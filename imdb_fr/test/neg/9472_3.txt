Roger Moore, an elderly man, is back in the shoes of Bond. This time, he is trying to find out why Agent 009 was killed and why he falsified a Faberge egg and where it came from. He travels to New Delhi in India, then to East Germany, after discovering a Russian general trying to blow up a nuclear bomb in a circus, hoping that NATO will push for complete disarmament in order to take control from Western Europe, the world. <br /> <br /> Despite appearances, it's really more of a romance between Bond and Octopussy than an action movie, but also fun and entertaining. But there are far too many attempts of humor in this one; it sometimes seems like a comedy. Timothy Dalton would also have been better than Roger Moore in this area, so there would not have been such an age difference between Bond and Octopussy. <br /> <br /> Useless Anecdotes: The small plane used by Bond in the pre-credit sequence is now hanging up at a Quaker Steak and Lube restaurant in Clearwater / Largo, Florida, USA. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 on ****
