This film is perfect for any screenwriter, actor or aspiring director. As you watch this film, you will see all that is wrong with the film industry as it is today. There are so many clichés that it hurt me to go through this movie. Nothing is original about it and every line of speech was torn from those cliché films that we all saw in the 90s. Although it has some cheap laughs, all in all, it's fake, fake , fake, fake, fake, fake. I was so bored and the movie was so predictable and pathetic that I noticed how much makeup had been made up on Tara Reid's face to hide those huge bags and wrinkles from her endless party. Seriously, she was wearing so much foundation that you could literally take it off and fill a whole bottle. <br /> <br /> What shocked me is that so many talented and popular actors are committed to this piece. junk food. And I do not know how I ended up with Ashton Kutcher's horrible scream, do you know when he's angry or something and shouts his words in that annoying way? Ashton "speaks" of horror, Tara's face being ten shades darker than her neck, a drugged owl, a scenario that looks like a three-year-old job ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, in my All through life there was no movie I watched that I could not enjoy, no matter how bad it was. It deserves a price to be the first. BAD BAD BAD ... I do not think there is a single word in the English dictionary that could possibly describe this trashy movie. Today, I was trying to watch it again, but I had to turn it off after ten minutes, because I was about to cry because of the profusion of clichés. <br /> <br /> Do not even bother to rent this to your blockbuster, it's not worth a penny, in fact, I'm willing to pay anyone who is considering watching this movie for them to do something decent with their life.
