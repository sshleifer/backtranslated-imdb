How can things like that still be made? Seinfeld, Arrested Development, The Office, etc., did not they kill that old wild shit? Apparently not ... <br /> <br /> I'm really a fan of Michael Rappaport and I enjoyed his different cameos and side roles (Copland, Friends), but in that he fears but everyone will have trouble to read this scenario. <br /> <br /> My wife benefits. But she is Brazilian. And if you've ever seen a typical Brazilian sit-com, you'll understand why she would find it so funny. <br /> <br /> Just to show how predictable the show is and to prove a point with it, I guessed what the next 3 or 4 developments / lines would be watching for a moment and were accurate almost word for word! I felt very satisfied. This annoyed my wife because she hates when I do that (I can understand why but I felt good, so fuck you!)
