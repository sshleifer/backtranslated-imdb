I like Kevin Bacon and Cathy Moriarty, and I love Mary Stuart Masterson, but the movie was not good at all. There was no nice character on the picture and the plot was almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> Masterson is an excellent actress, but she just could not get the character out of "hard girl". (She had similar problems with her character in THE SECOND DAY OF CHRISTMAS.) Perhaps she should avoid these characters, especially those with an unpleasant child to play. Evan Rachel Wood was unimpressive. His character was a kid, clear and simple, and no young actress could have given Harriet a positive feeling. <br /> <br /> In the interests of complete disclosure, I could not even finish looking at this picture. Forty-five minutes of my time is enough to lose.
