I loved so much Bellocchio's latest film, the masterpiece "L'Ora di Religione". There was an excellent screenplay, excellent actors (well, I must say that Castellitto is so much bigger than others), a brilliant use of light for excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> Well, Buongiorno Notte is a different story. Ridiculous scenario provoking tons of morality (and we could talk about weeks of politics, you know we are Italian ...). Bad cinematography (it's too simple to represent the dark years of the 70s with dark colors and dark lights, make efforts more people !!!!). Misuse of music: What is the use of using psychedelia to represent the tragic rationality of Brigate Rosse? <br /> <br /> And to all those who have claimed the main prize in Venice, I answer: "Are you crazy?" ?? "Maybe the Russian movie was bad but not as bad as that. <br /> <br /> I'm with the P. Do not believe the hype !!!!
