The film begins with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a businessman who has just finished his lunch in a neighborhood grocery store. It seems he does not have enough money to cover the check. Instead of looking for his plastic, he glances furtively to see if the coast is clear and the ducks leave the place without paying. Unbeknownst to Charlie, "Lulu" (Melanie Griffith) was watching him on the other side of the grocery store. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is adorned with a brown page in what had cooled in the 1980's -coupé boy. She follows him to let her know that she has seen what he has done. He tries to deny it but can not escape his accusation. Thinking that he is inside, Charlie is surprised when "Lulu" says that she does not work for the deli and offers to go back to work. <br /> <br /> When she heads in the opposite direction, begins as well wandering on the middle Atlantic coast. <br /> <br /> We are supposed to be amazed by the fact that "Lulu", a very modern model, puts Charlie in humiliating situations. It does not matter if the two consenting adults are bored a little in a motel room but baffled when they try not to pay the check in a family restaurant. Stealing the work of hard-working people is not my idea of ​​"wild". Charlie is a fool. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is an idiot idiot. She begins to pass Charlie as her husband. First to his mother (who happily tolerates the charade), then to his ten-year high school meeting, a fitting moment (an event later used by another film too cool for his own good "Grosse Pointe Blank"). <The "wedding" is a surprise for the real husband of "Lulu" (Ray Liotta), who has just been released from prison for armed robbery. Ray gives a good reception to both and shows them how bad the crime is. <br /> <br /> I can not add any irony in writing that I saw it for the first time while sneaking into the movies. No, I do not do that kind of thing. I recorded it on the cable TV and I assure you that I look at it strictly in the privacy of my home. <br /> <br /> So I wondered why I recorded it when I did not like it a lot and I concluded 20 years ago, I was playing reggae and the soundtrack of "Something Wild" puts ahead reggae. The closing credits start with Sister Carol's treat as she plays her version of Wild Thing.
