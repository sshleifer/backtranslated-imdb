The insane dialogue in this series has been mentioned by others and I agree. <br /> <br /> If Mom and Daughter were really as quick-witted, they should be queen and princess of the universe, not in a small town. <br /> <br /> I really tried to watch some episodes, but when the spiritual jerks of the pop culture starts, I return the channel. <br /> <br /> I watched a new episode a bit to see if something had changed (for the best I hoped) but no, even old "we are so smart with our references to culture pop "that I almost flayed. <br /> <br /> Longtime fans who are not happy with the new seasons might just be getting up and getting sick of the regurgitated pablum that never stops.
