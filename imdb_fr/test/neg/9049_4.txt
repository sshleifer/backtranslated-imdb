Eaten Alive plays like a bad rehearsal for Cannibal Ferox the following year. The characters are universally bland, the places are underused criminally, there is no attempt to create tension or suspense, the physical effects are either ridiculously bad, or stolen shamelessly in other movies, and the scenes ubiquitous tribal rapes are barely worthy of a PG 13 Even scenes of "cruelty" to animals are more tedious than usual. The only slightly shocking scene involves Jonas crazy, a little Goldfinger, brandishing a dildo soaked in blood; a scene that's just weird rather than graphic. My beloved wife, she from the 'Romeo and Juliet' Collector's Edition, watched this movie without even a hint of disgust! And this is called a Cannibal movie! In short, a pretty lame effort that completely betrays the cannibalistic tradition. Cannibal Ferox, Luci's sequel, is a much superior example of the genre.
