Glamy rock from the '80s is like house music from the' 90s or current boys' groups: it's boring and it has neither idea nor ideal. The only thing that makes it a little "cult" nowadays is that a long time ago, so we can laugh at its foolishness. Too bad, "Rock Star" has nothing to laugh about, it must be one of the most boring movies of recent years. <br /> <br /> Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is the singer of a tribute band to Steel Dragon. At the same time that the real singer of Steel Dragon gets fired from the group, he becomes the next main singer. You already know how it's going to be at that moment, with Chris losing him with sex, drugs and alcohol and forgetting his long-time friend and manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> too much music (boring) in this standard pretext for a movie and should be avoided at all costs. Watch the movie (overvalued but still more fun) Almost famous, or even better, about real people playing real music with real emotions, That Thing You Do. <br /> What a whore. 2/10.
