Critics were like "a movie that will break your heart" etc. So one of my friends and I had high expectations when we decided to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I will make it short and leave it to others to write about its content. This film tries to touch you, to reach your heart. But it fails. At least for me. And for my friend too. <br /> <br /> Everything that happened only happened on the screen. It was always there, not here, where I am. I thought most of the time "hmm, something is happening on the screen, but it's only on the screen, it's not real." <br /> <br /> Films that MUCH better managed to reach me: East of Eden (1955), Terms of Endearment (1983), Jerry Maguire (1996), Babe (1995), Mies vailla menneisyytt√§ (2002)
