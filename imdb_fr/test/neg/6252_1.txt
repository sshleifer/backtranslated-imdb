Okay. I'll admit it. I am a big fan of b-movies. At the time when Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens were the law. And at the time, even bad movies were always good. Unfortunately, it's a bad movie that's just bad. Even a little cameo from Brinke Stevens (taking over her role as Linda in "Slumber Party Massacre" 21 years ago) does not help this one. A group of cheerleaders take refuge in an elegant cabin after the breakdown of their van. A psycho harasses them one by one and catches them in different states of undressing. Wrong scenario, bad direction and horrible acting make this one completely bad! Skip this turkey and go rent "Slumber Party Massacre". 1/2 *
