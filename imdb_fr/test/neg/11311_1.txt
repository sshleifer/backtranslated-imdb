I left the theater and I was only 10 years old. That's how it was afraid. The plot was awful and the acting was worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed of himself and the person who directed this film should do the same. I was only 10 years old when I went to see this disaster with a friend and even at this innocent age, I did not make fun of the movie. We (me and my friend) still laugh at the seriousness of the film. We ended up going to the movie 'R' in which my parents were registered. In summary, this movie was very frustrating. Mr. Magoo - more like Mr. Ma-who? This film could have made a mark on me if I had watched the popular cartoon on television when I was a child, but luckily I had never seen it.
