I hesitated to see this film, having really appreciated the original, "Especially Martha". What a desappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress but it was not her film. The original had poignant moments, perfectly punctuated by an incredible soundtrack. No reservation seemed to be connected. The food, the characters - nothing seemed passionate. In Mostly Martha, food became alive - each scene was filmed in such a way that you could taste it with your eyes - smells, textures. The food in "No Reservations" was in the background - we rarely had a close-up of the preparation; the characters were not real enough to carry the film without him. It was difficult to finish the film - many scenes were embarrassing. See the original - it's a really nice movie; the soundtrack incredible.
