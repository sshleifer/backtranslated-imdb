I was expecting some high expectations for this movie. I have always thought that Tom Selleck's less known films (Runaway and Coma) were well above those for which he was more vocal. Maybe the producers should have had a little more knowledge about the former major league baseball players who became stars overseas. The majority were players too good for a triple baseball, but not really major league equipment. I admire the idea of ​​putting the saddle character in Japn, as opposed to the cliché of playing in the minors. Sad to say, this film, like the title of the ticket, is blocked in the third row by a film that seems to work on the autopilot. I would not mind seeing a sequel, and I hope the producers would learn from their mistakes. The premise is far too unique to be left alone with this uneven film
