It was on television last night. I laboriously forced my way through, and barely succeeded. First of all, with the exception of Leroy, Hilary, and maybe Coco, none of the other students we are supposed to care about have any perceptible talent. It's like HSPA has no standard, just sign on the dotted line and you're in it. <br /> <br /> Scenario lines were squeaky and obvious. Doris was incredibly horrible. The gay was such a shot thrown (funny as this school had only one gay, no ...). I liked the character of Leroy, but calling your teacher as an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent Leroy packing. Lisa seems to prefer being anywhere else, and since she had no talent, I wonder why they kept her. <br /> <br /> I would have noticed this star (horrible), but the music was not so bad and I liked the premise. It just would have worked better if the students had been attractive and had talent.
