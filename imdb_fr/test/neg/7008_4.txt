The female cast of this movie is great: you have Linda Blair (who matures nicely), Julie Strain (who does not have many lines of speech - it's a good thing), Rochelle Swanson (as convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as a girl possessed of evil), Toni Naples, and the most beautiful of them, the magnificent Kristina Ducati (how the dumb figure, Larry Poindexter, deserved to engage sexually with any of these women remains a mystery). However, beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and sometimes talented women, the film has little to offer. The plot is disjointed and does not really begin until the last 15 minutes or so; and when Wynorski finally manages to create a suspense, a ridiculous "ridiculous" end comes and ruins everything.
