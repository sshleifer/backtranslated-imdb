This film gave a new meaning to this worn-out phrase: "looking at dry paint" because it was "watching dry paint in the middle of a monsoon". <br /> <br /> I was drawn to the film's location on the west coast of Portugal that I visited. It's a hilly place and black and white introduces a new dimension to beauty. It was the only good thing. The story was terribly banal and, frankly, you must have one. <br /> <br /> A film crew is no longer in stock and the entire team must wait. Well, wait is wait. I can wait for a bus number 15 on Princes Street in Edinburgh, I can spend hours in a remote station in the middle of nowhere cold winter afternoon. However, a wait is boring and, yes, that wait was boring too. <br /> <br /> The leader went to America to complain to the film provider who reprimanded for not having everything in color. After several arguments, two blessed bullets sound from everywhere and the long-awaited end finally arrives, and not before the hour. <br /> <br /> Yes, I would see this movie if someone would arm me with two or three boxes of color film so I could run them on the screen.
