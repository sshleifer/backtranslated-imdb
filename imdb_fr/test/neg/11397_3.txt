They said it would be a bigger film than Turks Fruit. How dare they <br /> <br />? It's not even 10% of this classic. Bad game The only character I felt sympathetic for was <br /> played by Angela Schijf. His game was the best of all the film. The story could have been interesting, but it was not. Some scenes were very beautiful filmed (lights and camera), (<br /> <br /> the opening scene for example), but the misinterpretation made disappear the magic <br /> <br />. <br /> <I really do not understand why so many people voted so well for this film. <br /> <br /> Good.
