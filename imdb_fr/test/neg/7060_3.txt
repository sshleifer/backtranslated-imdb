I really like Myrna Loy's movies. This film was produced before the personality of his actor was developed. It would be an acceptable short film that seems to last forever in its complete form. <br /> <br /> It seems that Myrna Loy is told what to do with her acting and does the work. That's about all you can say about it. <br /> <br /> Her gypsy character is of poor quality and the film has many flaws, such as that of the jewelry store. <br /> <br /> interesting for Myrna Loy fans but even as such is something of a disappointment.
