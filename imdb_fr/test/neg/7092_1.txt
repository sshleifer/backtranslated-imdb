The last time I checked, the Nazis did not win World War II - even if you noticed it. After all, the Third Reich had a lot of weight in ordering and cold and robotic obedience to the people, and that's about what we're facing today. But the way orders are delivered has changed. Instead of being barked in a German accent through a loudspeaker, they are disguised as expert advice and float under your nose every time you turn on the television or open a newspaper. There is a continuous background, a message of middle class personal improvement, whispered in the wind. <br /> <br /> "You are eating too much, you are eating what is wrong, you are drinking, you are smoking, you are not exercising enough, you probably can not even * beep * correctly, you will die if you do not change your habits, your health will suffer, do you have no self-esteem, look at you, make me sick, I pity you, I hate you, we hate you all, God hates you, do not understand. you're sad, what you do to yourself, it's so sad, it's the mantra, and it goes without saying that the people who recite it are systematically described as saints. Last year, the media knelt down to give Jamie Oliver a collective fellatio about his School Dinners series, in which he campaigned for healthier school meals. you'd be forgiven for thinking that he personally saved 5,000 kids from the mouth of a pedophile . <br /> <br /> Anyway, the series was a huge success. In reality, there was only one drawback: it was not recorded. After all, when you once saved every child in the nation from certain death, you can not really do it a second time. The only solution is to find a new threat, which brings us to Ian Wright's Unfit Kids (Wednesday, 9 pm, C4), a weekly "entertainment-program" in which the former footballer and renowned foe of grammar forces a group of overweight youth to participate in extracurricular educational activities. <br /> <br /> It's essentially an exact copy of Jamie Oliver's show, with more sweat and fewer student shots crushing fresh basil with a pestle: an uplifting fable in which Wright forms a group of unsuited to a slender, nasty machine - fighting apathy and lethargy, facing lazy parents and trying to turn it into a national problem that will force Range Rover moms to knock their panties out of an absolute sanctuary between trips to the Conran shop. Oh, is not it just terrible, what are these blob people doing? It's not our Josh that you understand: he only eats organic spinach and attends the practice of lacrosse six hundred times a week. <br /> <br /> It must be believed, the little thing yes, it is comforting to see soft children who are embarrassed to transform themselves. with a bit of simple activity ... but there is something in the underlying message "eat your greens" that really sticks to my heart, in case you would not have guessed it. <br /> <br /> What happened to the concept of CHOICE, you * beep * So, a little jogging could increase your life expectancy - so what? That equates to a few more years in the retirement home - that's what people do. And then, I'd rather be dead tomorrow than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with a lot of enough draws trying to put each other in poor health. <br /> <br /> In the second episode, Internet video games are called bad in the war against fat: it makes children too sedentary, you see. Curiously, television, which is also sedentary and which, unlike these two activities, actively encourages you to let your mind atrophy with your body, escape without fear. This is funny. <br /> <br /> Listen, Channel 4 - instead of forcing children to eat ferns or doing squats, why not teach them to think more broadly, so that they reject the sneaky nature and cajoling programs like this? Or would it be a campaign too far?
