There were so many classic movies that the main characters were amazing liars and yet they are made to be beautiful. I never bought in this stuff. "Screw comedies" were full of this stuff, as were many of Fred Astaire's films. <br /> <br /> Here, Barbara Stanwyck plays the role of a famous country magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years and feels that she must continue to lie to preserve her personality (and her work) . She even lies to a guy about getting married, another subject that has always been trivialized in classic movies. <br /> <br /> This is a New York woman who claims to be an excellent cook and someone who knows how to handle babies, etc. Obviously, she knows nothing and lies accumulate so fast that you lose track. I guess all this is supposed to be funny, because lessons are learned in the end and true love wins, etc. etc. Pass the backpack. <br /> <br /> Most of this film is NOT funny. Stanwyck was much better in the genre of film noir. As for Dennis Morgan, well, go back to the bag again.
