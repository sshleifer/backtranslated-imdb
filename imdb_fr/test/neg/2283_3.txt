I bought a tape of this movie based on the recommendation of other IMDb users and I must say that I was very disappointed. I am a university professor and I showed this film to my class. they unanimously voted that it is a terrible film. I guess if you like the old Dark Shadows series, you might like that. (I loved Dark Shadows when I was a kid in the '70s, but now I think it's awful). The first half hour or so has at least the virtue of a certain fidelity to Wilde's novel. After that, the story deviates enormously at least compared to the 1945 version of MGM (which won two Oscars). Nigel Davenport, as Lord Henry, is actually the only thing we can look at in all the production. Many of the other actors are bad, the music is melodramatic and the look of the movie is terrible. In fact, it's not at all a film - it was obviously shot on a video and has that typically claustrophobic look of the BBC. The opening scenes are particularly poorly lit, the women's costumes are terrible (the men seem to be fine) and many characters - including Dorian - seem to have a 1970s hairstyle rather than a Victorian one. The film does well to include many of Wilde's dialogues, but the voice-over narration in Dorian's voice contains a lot of garbage that directly contradicts Wilde's character. I am a big fan of Oscar Wilde and I'm afraid he turned back to his grave when this monstrosity was created. His only improvement over the 1945 version is that the homosexual subtext is much more noticeable without being heavy. I have not seen any of the most recent versions yet, but if you want the story to be well told, I would have to recommend the MGM 1945 in black and white in relation to this one.
