At first, I thought it was bad because I had high expectations for this film, but after thinking, it was also bad. I was almost caught in the hk promotion of bad stars in bad movies. The new generation of hk actors and actresses, not to mention the bad writers, is bringing down the industry. For the moment, I'm still trying to understand how he releases such a depreciation. Normally, you can not lose in a movie with Donnie Yen and Ekin (forget Jackie, he's past his peak). but then I should understand when the twins were on the cover. it's nerdy, camper, very nerdy, I try to laugh at some of the jokes, but not only the effect is very minimal, but the jokes are very recycled and not funny. I'm sorry I bought the movie. The only reason some people think it's so good is because they've been brainwashed by the hype that the twins are cute, everyone loves them, and all that they make is good and fun. and if you love twins, then you know ... <br /> <br /> sigh ... I miss the movie days when the movies Jet Li and Stephen Chow dominated the box office .. <The films from Mainland China are much better than that and they are shot for smaller budgets.
