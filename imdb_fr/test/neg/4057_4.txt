It's amazing what you can see if you wake up at 2 am and turn on the TV. I did not know they had shown movies like this. I immediately thought of Roger Corman, who reused filming locations or other filming locations for his own films. <br /> <br /> The marks of this film could simply move the angles of the camera and add a little time. XXX movie. <br /> <br /> There was no story, just a minimal dialogue that led to striptease and sex. I bet there were not 100 words in the whole movie, but there were certainly a lot of big busts and hot lesbian action. There was also a male / female action, but that accounted for only about 25% of the film. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing came to mind when watching this movie that might interest those who buy high definition DVDs. Sony has refused to license Betamax to adult filmmakers and adult films have been released in VHS. You can guess what has happened to beta max since the adult film industry produces millions of videos. Sony has again refused to license the Blu-ray player to the adult film industry and has just signed an agreement with Toshiba. You can guess which high definition system will disappear.
