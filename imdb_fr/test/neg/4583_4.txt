But like the Disney film of two generations, this film also fails in the precision department. But at least, Disney used a Skye Terrier. <br /> <br /> Is the true story trivial for film producers? I do not think so. There are many documents to accurately describe their true story instead of the fictional stories we had to undergo. <br /> <br /> One day, a movie will properly portray Bobby's owner, John Gray, as an Edinburgh policeman, and correctly represent Bobby's license paid by Lord Provost. When that happens, I'll be at the movies.
