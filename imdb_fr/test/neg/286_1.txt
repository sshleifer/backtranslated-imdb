I had very high hopes to enter this film. After all, Ocean's 11 was really a great Hollywood product. His quick jokes, incredible star power and tight screenplay have made it one of the most entertaining caper movies I've ever seen. Of course, with all the money, a suite was being prepared and I was excited. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the movie completely dazzled me. Blown away by the way horribly bad things can go. This film had everything to please; the return of all the original actors, the same director, new stories of crazy antics. How could it go so badly? <br /> <br /> It starts immediately with one of the most difficult and useless opening sequences of all time and goes downhill. After short, rather zany scenes between Pitt / Zeta-Jones and Clooney / Roberts, the film spends several minutes watching Andy Garcia waltz from one scene to the next, telling everyone in Danny Ocean's original eleven that he wanted to get his money back. Believe me, these scenes are only there to improve Andy Garcia's racing time, because without these ridiculous shots, his projection time would be less than five minutes. <br /> <br /> That brings me to another great qualm. I had with this movie. The pace is so uneven that the characters are completely removed from the story and are sometimes not reported until later. The character of Bernie Mac is very early removed from the script and never comes back, except for 2 short scenes without dialogue. Garcia appears for the first few minutes and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end. Roberts appears for about 5 minutes at the beginning and is not even mentioned until there are about 20-25 minutes remaining. Even Clooney himself spends much of the film in prison. <br /> <br /> All that would be excusable if the movie was funny. At all. 90% of jokes fall flat and those that work are not worth laughing. The "plot" is undeniably useless and left me feeling cheated. At one point in the film, the team occupies a position worth $ 2.5 million out of the nearly $ 100 million it needs to collect before Garcia's two-week deadline. Several characters even recognize how absurd it is to waste time doing this job, but they do it anyway! More than 30 minutes of the film revolve around this work that they should not even do, and it seems that this part of the plot was simply added to save time. In addition, the equipment they use to do this work clearly costs millions of dollars to fund. Wait to see what they are doing to find this job and realize that it would cost a lot more than $ 2.5 million. Obviously, for this reason, they must create multiple jobs to make money. The beauty of the first film was that one big problem had been committed and that it was ingenious and complex. Here, they have so many jobs, so many different ways, that they all rush to explain, because their explanation would give several hours to the film. <br /> <br /> We all know that it's useful to get into this movie. will be a big twist at the end. This is the nature of the caper film. The twist at the end of Ocean's Twelve made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because I could not believe how much I felt cheated. I will not give in because I know most of you will be stupid enough to throw away the money to see this movie anyway. <br /> <br /> What I am going to say is that the film takes advantage of the maximum of two hours. you have already gone completely unnoticed. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to see this movie, having absolutely loved Ocean's 11. I left the theater with the feeling of being a victim of a real big enemy shot by the cast. and the crew of this film making me believe that this film deserves to be watched. I have never given a 1 to a movie on IMDb.com, but there is a first time for everything. Do you consider yourself warned .... 1/10
