(PETITS SPOILERS) I just bought the DVD of this movie yesterday. I saw it with my friends and I could not believe what had happened to me. <br /> <br /> In the first 3 films, the creatures had at least a sense of humor (especially the 3rd movie), but not just the critters have barely made their appearance, they were not funny! They never made me laugh. I must admit that the story has started well. After an hour, I remembered that Critters' films were always very short. So I thought, "Where are the $ ^% # $ creatures?!?!" They were hardly in this movie! If that did not make me crazy enough, the boy named Ethan was sitting on his bed after Charlie "murdered the ship" and he knew the critters were still on board! In the first film, the Brown family was scared. But here, Ethan did not even care! It was as if the creatures were not even a threat! <br /> <br /> Now, what I'm about to say is going to ruin the end, but I'll say it anyway. In the first film, in the end, they had to face the giant creature for a final battle. In the second, there was the big bug ball. In the third movie, the burned creature made a spindash (Sonic the Hedgehog) and was going to attack the little child. But at the end of the fourth (that's what made me the most angry), the bald creature attacks Ethan, and Ethan kills him as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> understanding was what happened to Ug. He was one of my favorite characters in the first two. Then, after 50 years, he is perverted. It was very disappointing. Not only that, but was he not a faceless bounty hunter? Why was he still "Johnny Steele?" Plus, he seemed to have a different personality. He seemed a lot smarter and not as monotonous as in the first two. <br /> <br /> Being someone who really enjoyed the first two creature movies and who loved the third one, I give Critters 4 a 2/10
