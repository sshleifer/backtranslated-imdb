I can see what this movie intended to do. Unfortunately, this never completes the agreement completely. The "crime of reality" aspect works well and the shots are all first rate. In fact, many scenes are incredibly evocative in a gloomy way. Notably the figure of the detective talking to the battered woman, the scene of the detectives searching the trash and the father who attaches flies. Occasionally, some scenes get bogged down in too many dialogues. Instead of showing the viewer, the writer treats him too much like a book. But the real problem lies in editing. The story does not flow. He can not make a whole with the sum of the parts. In the end, you are confused as to what is really going on. Those who love this kind of detective film like to follow, assembling the puzzle at the same time as the main characters. With such a mediocre edition, it is difficult if not almost impossible to do so.
