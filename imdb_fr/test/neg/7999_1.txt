Anyone claiming that this movie is a classic ninja movie must have seen this movie before the mid-90s or it was less than 10 years old before seeing it. Otherwise, I can not explain this title of "classic ninja movie". <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes of this film are simply intolerable. Instead of making Franco Nero the ninja, they could hire an experienced martial artist. In any case, the acting skill is not important in this kind of film. Nero's fighting ability is barely comparable to that of a street fighter in a bar. His kicks and punches are lame. <br /> <br /> There are enough old action movies with good action. It's just a waste of time.
