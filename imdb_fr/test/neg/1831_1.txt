Anatomy is not really unique in the horror genre, in fact, it's not even scary at all. It reminds me of his American cousins, horror slashers. It's just a copy of any other horror slasher and as a German movie, it's too American, nothing to add. In fact, Anatomy is too predictable and boring, its plot is neither intact nor coherent. This involves stupid scenes that are not even part of a horror movie genre. Fun sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear. Why do they need to have everything in one movie? They should have made a cheap German adult movie instead. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone because it is too boring.
