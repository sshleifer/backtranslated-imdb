It's one of the least romantic movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Casting: Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles. Diane looks a little impatient to please and frowns as usual, but she does not seem convinced by the romance itself. The support cast is not too memorable. <br /> <br /> History: The medical drama he faces is not convincing and is not interesting. The story is weak - there is not enough money to make a movie. There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here. <br /> <br /> The frame is a little dark and the house in which it is installed is unattractive. <br /> <br /> NOT meant to be a big one to remember.
