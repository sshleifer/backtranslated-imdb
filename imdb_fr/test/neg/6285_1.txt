The perfect recipe in 6 steps for a boredom in the middle of the road movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Take an ex-policeman outlawed, burned, who has a bad attitude and who remains sensitive (pianist in concert with a domestic cat); <br /> <br /> 2. Add some cool retro gadgets like a rebel Porsche 356, a roaring bike, a very patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the sole; <br /> <br /> 3. Shuffle some "free spirit" locations, for example. a trendy beachfront apartment and a dedicated office counter; <br /> <br /> 4. Add some spice to "deep" socio-romantic themes, such as a traumatized ex-wife, but who finally remarries after the divorce, a secretly admiring and therefore forgiving waitress, a couple of former co-police-only-a-who-is-really-a-complete-jerk and a best-friend-slipping-on-a-suit-full-of-illegal-$ $$; <br /> <br /> 5. Let it simmer for about 90 minutes in a "quick" but not necessarily logical or consistent sequence of mediocre action scenes, tender moments and slow fears; <br /> 6. Serve with a comfortable pillow to sleep straight in bed or something a little more interesting (do not worry: even the yellow pages will do!).
