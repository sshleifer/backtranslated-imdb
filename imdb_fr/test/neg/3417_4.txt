Aussie Shakespeare for 18-24 years old.with blood, blood and more blood and a good dose of nudity. it will not be for all levels, too violent for some too cheap for most. On a budget, they try to do their best, but it only works sporadically. Although most people do well, you do not put yourself in the head. the best performance comes from sweet gary and the weird mick molly. If you like Shakespeare, see it, but if you like your ripe cheese, you'll love it. It's not a bad movie but it's not very good either. Sam Peckenpah would like it, that is to say if it was filmed in western. I was expecting a lot of that because I loved Romper Stomper. but it was a vacant effort.
