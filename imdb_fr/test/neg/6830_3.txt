I would reject any temptation to see this movie, it is just boring. The characters are predictable and stupid. The assassin is not very enigmatic. There is no tension, no fun, no style or even a glimmer of originality in this train wreck. And the quagmire of Hollywood clich√©s suffocates. Oh, and you have a movie that makes the hero a terrorist of the IRA. Cute. And now, I have to talk a little more to fill the ten lines. And a little more Is it enough? Not quite, now? No, a new confabulation should be enough, but The Jackal is really not worth ten lines of exposure. The original was great anyway.
