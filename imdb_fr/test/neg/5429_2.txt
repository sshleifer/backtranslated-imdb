It's one of Crichton's best books. The characters of Karen Ross, Peter Elliot, Munro and Amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting, complex and fast throughout this impressive novel. <br /> <br /> About 99.8% of these were lost in the film. Seriously, the script AND the staging was horrible and clearly made by people who could not understand what was good in the novel. I can not blame the actors because frankly, they have never had the opportunity to live this turkey at the height of the original work of Crichton. I know that good novels, especially those at the forefront of science fiction, are difficult to present on screen in a way that is faithful to the original. But this is perhaps the worst quality difference ever seen between the novel and the screen adaptation. The book is really very good. The movie is just terrible.
