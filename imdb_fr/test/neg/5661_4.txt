The first time I watched this show, everything was fine. There were fun times and I laughed a lot, but this show gets worse and worse. Carly and Sam's web show is NOT the least fun. They play stupid video on the Internet, scream at the camera and make very bad jokes. And then the laughter goes off ?! A problem with the series is that none of the main characters are funny. Carly is not funny. The acting of Miranda Cosgrove is at best dull. His role in this series is in no way comparable to that of Drake And Josh. Her friend Sam is very rough and brutal and the show is written so as to make it look like a hillbilly. I mean they make jokes about his mother driving an old rusty truck, her mother crushing an old television with a bat, and then there are jokes about Sam failing at school, constantly detain and flee the cops. None of this is funny. Then there is Freddy who is a computer geek. He is not too funny unless his mother treats him like a baby. Carly's brother, Spencer, is the only funny and full-time character in the series. He makes funny jokes and does some pretty funny things like pretending to drive a spaceship making spaceship noise, toppling the scare cookie table for revenge, while they did the same to him. His equipment is the only thing that is worth laughing at. Aside from the characters, other things make the show bad too. For example, the fact that two children doing a local web show in a Seattle apartment is a worldwide success and allowed them to travel free to Tokyo? Another thing to do is how an unemployed 26-year-old single can afford a two-story apartment in downtown Seattle, raise his 13-year-old sister and pay for a room full of cameras and audio, including included a remote controlled projector and a green screen and an HD camera? This seems to have been written by a 10 year old child. The worst thing is that the series contains quite questionable content. There are a few times when Carly (remember a 13 year old girl) appears on her web show in top bikini. WTF? Then I saw an episode in which Freddy told Carly and Sam that he had "just slept in socks the night before". I mean WTF? Then there's an episode where Carly's rival, Nevel, blackmails her against her website and agrees to give it back to her for a kiss. Creepy! And I just saw an episode where Carly meets a boy who has just moved into their building. He has some kind of back injury. He takes off his shirt and Carly remains motionless. I can not believe Nick even lets them show this stuff and I can not believe it was created by the same Drake and Josh manager. This show is not appropriate for children under 12 years and it is even debatable. iCarly is just another addition to the long list of Nick's awful programming.
