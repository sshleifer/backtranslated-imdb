It's a big disappointment. The main problem is the acting game. Sylvestre Touzel is quite poor as Fanny, and the rest is not much better, everyone is on stilts and unnatural. The camera is also very 1980s, that is to say choked and agitated, compared to that of P & P, for example, in 1995. <br /> <br /> The script is, if something too much true to the book, and some expressions should have been cut. <br /> <br /> In all respects, this is far inferior to the recent version of the film, which, although it took enormous liberties with the book, seemed far more faithful to the book's spirit and was well more agreable.
