This film was released in the UK as Blood Rites. It has been totally banned and has never been submitted for publication. <br /> <br /> As The Ghastly Ones, it would have been a hit for the hungry locals of New York's famous 42nd Street Grindhouse. If you are looking for a bloody horror, you will find it in this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Colin (Hal Borske), a developmental handicapped, crunches a live rabbit, you have to endure A capricious camera work of 16 mm that gives Ed Wood an absolutely wonderful look. <br /> <br /> Three sisters have to spend three days on the homestead with their husbands before the old man's money is paid out. Naturally, in such a situation, people start falling dead. Family secrets are exposed and a lot of blood is shed, especially during a terrible dismemberment. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the rabbit against which the British opposed, I knew it.
