Not one of the best Monogram entries (which does not try to be fun here either) Chan. The Shanghai Cobra has many strengths, but in the end, it is far too confusing and cluttered to be too satisfying. The film begins with a murderer named the Shanghai Cobra who has already hit twice and is now in a scene at a restaurant. We have a guy, a girl and another guy who have an implicit connection when a guy dies on the street. Yes, I'm simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, because it's at the heart of this movie's problems - there's too much to do without real and satisfying explanation. I did not even go to the cook who has some involvement and a juke box that speaks to you and has a screen and everyone does not seem to have any problem with that! All this is in the first five minutes or so. Then Chan enters the cinema working for the government and goes to help a friend. He also has the right to check a bank's radium stock and search for a man wrapped in bandages that he helped stop in Shanghai many years ago. I found the plot very involved, as previously stated. Toler is back as Chan. He is always affable. Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland are also back. Both are doing a good job and are quite fun. But the complicated plot just did not convince me, and much of the movie was watched with a weird questioning look. This is not a bad movie, not just very interesting, except for the most devoted Chan fans.
