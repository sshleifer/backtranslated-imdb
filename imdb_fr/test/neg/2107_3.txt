For their credit, this is one of their most competent garbage, and because it is extremely good gore and it is interesting to decipher "Snakes on a Plane". But if there are more examples of inconsistency behind Asylum's latest scam, it's the two early characters who are illegal immigrants who do not understand or speak English to a Texaser who sneaks them through the border. in a train and meet a friend, they begin to understand and speak perfect English. <br /> <br /> In addition to being a very bad representation of a Hollywood formula, "Snakes on a Train" is quite boring. At least, with "Snakes on a Plane", we had the chance to watch comedy actors and try to become very interesting. The installment of the Mallachi Brothers contains some of the most boring characters I've ever seen, from an electrical engineer (I wonder how it will be useful later), to stoner surfers, to the two main characters who are trying to fight. The curse of the snake lying in wait for the husband's wife. <br /> <br /> "Snakes" are never fun, and even when they are very bloody, they are still not as good as they are lucky to be, because "snakes" this could have been a fun short film, but instead, he takes himself far too seriously and never camps at all times. Instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can set a precedent, they instead force their small budget to work against them in these imitations. While the Mallachi brothers seem to be trying, the train looks incredibly artificial. <br /> <br /> It almost looks like a play with these incoherent and terribly bland elements that are desperately trying to look like real train cars, from time to time, it shakes, the bottom of the windows is blurry and the noises disappear from time to time to let us know that they are in a train; without forgetting that in a train of this size, there seems to be only about ten passengers. And beyond the fight in the train and a very long sex scene, we are forced to submit to a conspiracy that makes no sense. And even filmmakers can not help but think that the "deadly" snakes on this train look far from venomous or dangerous. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie stumbles on just a minute of snake carnage. and a bad sub-plot of a former drug officer trying to assault a passenger. All this dull exhibition ends with a really ridiculous climax in which a poorly computer-generated snake (I saw a better animation on Super Nintendo) completely swallows the train as a whole and is then distributed according to a method that should have been exercised from the beginning. Asylum marks again. <br /> <br /> Asylum marks once again with a haunted, lazy, horribly realized and boring scam from another better movie. "Snakes on a train" is taken too seriously, which is why it's never entertaining or memorable.
