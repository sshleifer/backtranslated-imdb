Certainly, HOTD 2 is better than the first suburb Uwe Boll, but it's like saying drowning is better than being cut into pieces. OK OK, I'm a bit of a mess with this one, it's just that Zombie movie game adaptations always leave a bad taste in my mouth. Resident Evil was fine, but its aftermath is hogwash. The first HOTD was entertaining shit more than anything else; Uwe Boll has taken care of that. And HOTD 2 was ... better? The entertainment was at the rendezvous, the hot girls were there, the gore was there, but ... is that it? The script, even though it was below average, was better than the first one. But in the screenplay, horribly written characters, stupid action sequences, clichés and a dragging end reach a level of ridicule that would make the Bollmeister very proud. But it could have been worse, right? <br /> <br /> HOTD 2 stars Sig Haig (Yes, Sid Haig) as a foolish doctor looking for a cure for death. As you can guess, everything is fine. A nearby university campus seems to be the center of the zombie epidemic (or hypersapien?) And, as expected, a group of commandos and two zombie scientists are trying to save the world by neutralizing the problem. Their main goal? No, it will not explode. Instead, they need to get a zombie blood sample in order to heal the deadly virus. Between this and that there are bland interactions, an insupportable amount of clichés (but hey, at least, the Black is not the first to be killed), and decent Zombies. <br /> <br /> The acting is passable. Who would have thought that Sticky Fingaz was a fair actor? Not me. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn shine a little in the lead. And the support distribution was equally passable. Everything was passable. <br /> <br /> The makeup effects on the Zombies were ok, it could have been worse as in the first HOTD: just guys running in dusty mom's outfits. The gore was good too. Economic fears and even less expensive tensions are almost non-existent in this film, which is a good thing. The action sequences were stupid, but at least there was no sword fighting the zombies or that ridiculous idle bullet effect. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will only appeal to zombie fans, arcade fans and those who want to rent a cheap horror movie for the weekend. Apparently, there will be a third as the end indicates, but I will not count on it. Unless Uwe decides to do it. A 4.
