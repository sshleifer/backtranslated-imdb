I was an extra on this film, in the part filmed at the airport during the first 15 minutes or so; I was one of the fleeing Bangladeshi refugees (mainly Mexican) crossing the Ryan Field runways in Tucson. At one point, in front of our turbans as we waited for another shot, one of my fellow students turned to me and asked me what it was. I told him it would be a remake of Lost Horizons, only as a musical. There was a long pause, then he said, "Dude, this movie is going to be bad." Pretty insightful of him, I thought. I had a good time and earned some money, but even with some interesting personal memories related to this movie, I can not miss out on all that. <br /> <br /> If you have already seen the movie "The Swarm", you can understand very well. You meet a lot of famous and talented people spoiled by an idea that, at first glance, is bad. The idea seemed to be that if you invest enough money in a film and you hire enough big names, a good story and good writing is not necessary. Just turn the big crank to get the product. It's just not worth looking at.
