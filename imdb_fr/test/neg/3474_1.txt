Perhaps we are too attached to great shows when we hear about antiquity presented on screen. Maybe we are expecting too much of these films. However, if we, viewers, offer far too little, what happens next? <br /> <br /> That's what I thought after seeing IMPERIUM - NERONE by Paul Marcus, part of the series of productions on the Roman Empire. AUGUSTUS by Roger Young, the first IMPERIUM movie, included at least Peter O'Toole, but what does this movie include? <br /> <br /> There is hardly anything precise. The historical errors are so serious that the film changes the facts and is rather a distorted image of the Roman Empire than the true story. Throughout the film, we see Nero Young: a young man during the so-called long reign of Caligula, a young man during the reign of Claudius and finally during his own reign (historically 14 years old). And ... he dies the same. According to the film, Nero, born under the reign of Tiberius, lives more than 40 years but seems to have reached the end of his twenties when he dies ... Continuity combined with an invented story is the biggest problem of the film. it is hardly logical, not to say reliable. Nero loses his father, is raised by slaves. At that time, his mother, Agrippina, is exiled by Caligula. Later, however, she suddenly marries Emperor Claudius who already has great children and has just married Messalina. At these moments of the film, we see Nero's mistress (Rike Schmid). Okay, it's historically "accurate"; yet no source proves that it played such a determining role in the rise of Christianity in Rome. In the film, she is not only a devoted Christian, but even a witness of the miracle of St. Paul (he brings a girl back to life, Marzia). Moreover, there has never been, in the course of history, anything like Nero at the court of Caligula since he was born at the end of his reign of 4 years (BC 37-41 ). I understand that movies can change something, but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable! And many other shortcomings regarding the content, hard to list, but after 30 minutes of watching this movie, I wondered if I was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy. <br /> <br /> As for its artistic features that provide us with entertainment, they are just as lame as the story here. The performances are artificial, the distribution simply has beautiful faces but weak acting abilities. Maybe I'm too attached to Peter Ustinov or Charles Laughton in the lead, but Hans Matheson does not fit Nero at all. He might have some good moments as an actor but never as a famous Roman emperor. Is he an artist who burns Rome for a song? Is he a cynic who disguises love to his loved ones? Is he a cruel leader who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people in the name of "pretended justice"? None of them. He's just a young man who does not know how to govern and, in the long run, starts to release the fire that burns in himself ... John Simm is out of place in this movie as Caligula and absolutely inferior to other representations of the character. Elisa Tovati is only sexy like Poppaea; yet she could have been much better. The costumes are inaccurate and the sets are not surprising. The low budget has little effect and, therefore, little animation. <br /> <br /> But what made me most angry in this film is why I give him a tenth of the absolutely unacceptable moments: <br /> <br /> - the death of Poppea and St Paul's conversation with Nero on his corpse, <br /> <br /> - Claudius's mention of Britannia's ongoing conquest at the party and his death (he conquered Britannia while Messalina was his wife long before his death), <br /> <br /> - Tigellinus murdering Agrippina (Laura Morante), mother of Nero, <br /> <br /> - Nero's arguments in the speech to Senators, <br /> <br /> - finally, the death of Nero - a calm day at the edge of a lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a so-called deed morality: "Let us forgive him" <br /> All in All, this film is a waste of time and is absolutely useless as a new production concerning the Roman Empire. Better to make a good movie in 30 years than ten minors in 5 years. 1/10 - should not have been done at all.
