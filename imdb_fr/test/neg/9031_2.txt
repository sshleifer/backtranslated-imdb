"Escape from Hell" is not done with enough art to hide what it is: a grim exploitation. Management and writing are both neglected: for example, the work of the camera during the fight between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can barely understand what is happening; moreover, if the doctor, alcoholic but generous in heart, had not killed the guardian, the guards would never have followed him, nor the girls after their escape - the plan "false plague" had worked well until then, but he just had to ruin himself. I would have given this film a 4 out of 10 (the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and Christina Lai has an incredibly beautiful face and body), but a particularly disgusting scene of abuse forced me to cut again 2 points. Of course, some sickos will take this as a recommendation. After all, what is even more disturbing than this film is that some people have reserved positive reviews!
