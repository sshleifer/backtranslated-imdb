At first, I was excited about this movie and I really expected it to combine Equilibruim and Farenheit 451. Unfortunately, I was continually disappointed with the lack of depth and interest in the plot and intrigues secondary. In the middle of the film, I made fun of the characters and the scenery so as not to have to disable it. I appreciated the beginnings of a future with merged cultures and a separation of the haves and the have-nots. What could have been a clever and intelligent look into the future is transformed into a painful and semantic midnight movie on a SciFi channel with horrific scenes, inexpensive sets and a free last shot of Tim Robbins vagina. Maybe he should stick to his socialist political speech - everything is down since Shawshank.
