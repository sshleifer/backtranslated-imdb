It's a known fact, Mr. Seagal can not smile, he can act, he can bang in the buttocks, there are light smiles, no real smiles, no big laughs and no reason to look at this confusing film. We see excess weight in Mr. Seagal, Dr. Wesley Maclaren, who desperately needs a haircut and where his real daughter Ayako made an appearance as an office assistant. Story: Ok, so Wesley lives in another sacred hinterland with his sweet daughter Holly. They sit down and enjoy their red flower tea and omelets. At the other end of town, an overweight militia leader decides to make the whole city sick by spreading a virus that spreads by air and kills in two days thinking he can survive he had an antidote. Problem, there is no antidote and the one that exists retains the virus for a while. The CIA is contacted and even she can not help and one person is not sick, Wesley's daughter, Holly. So she gets chased thinking that the cure is in her blood. Wesley manages to catch his daughter and take him to his grandfather, who is a native Indian. With his sister-in-law Ann, they go to a base where there is a hidden laboratory to find a cure, but even the soldiers who work there die slowly, as do others if they do not find treatment on time. And to abbreviate the moment, neither Ann nor Wesley are infected with the virus ... hmm. A weak fight scene. A terrible movie and all the men on it are in desperate need of a stair master.
