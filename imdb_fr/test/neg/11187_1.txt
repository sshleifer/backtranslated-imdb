When something can be what you want or what you want to say, he is obliged to register as someone special. But just as the form of a cloud in the sky can appear to one of us or remind us of a battleship, and to another of his aunt's backs, and yet to another nothing but a cloud, it does not give this cloud meaning. except for the interpretation of the viewers. Anyone who wants to throw a stuffed giraffe through a bright, or worthwhile window, without telling it in a particular context, may just be trying to impress us with his intellectuality. <br /> <br /> this film, as the dreams of a madman do it pretty well, especially since there is no standard or expectation as to what those dreams would be, and even if we were crazy we- same, it would not give us any healthy benchmarks for comparison. A love affair with this film carries the same risk as seriously interpreting Nostradamus. Whatever the actual meaning was then conveyed, it could be buried in private jokes, meditations or provincial minutiae of its time, and for some chosen radical intellectuals! However, despite my limited abilities, I spotted a little diary. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely anti-fascist and, to some extent, anti-Italian. I noted that although the years 1929-1930 were years of major public works and urban renewal in Italy, any clue seemed to be avoided. In addition, (the avant-garde university spinners take note of it for your next class), the man with the very short hair and the mustache, in the party segment at the end, is a caricature of Victor Emmanuel III and his big companion, Queen Helen. , formerly Princess of Montenegro. Without an understanding of potential historical relevance, even irrelevance seems beyond the reach of intellectuals or other lay intellectuals who would let themselves be impressed. <br /> <br /> I will gladly add my own buckets of paint to the shades of this cinematic joke. But in an adaptation of the famous word by the little boy; The film really has no face (to disfigure). The painting would help him burn.
