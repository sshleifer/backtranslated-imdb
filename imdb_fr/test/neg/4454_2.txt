Many of Alistair MacLean's books have been shown on the big screen. Some of them (The cannons of Navarone, The fear is the key, Where the eagles dare) have been fairly well translated; some (Breakheart Passage, Zebra Ice Station, The Secret Ways) were quite passable; some (River Of Death, Bear Island, The Way to Dusty Death) have been quite rotten. Caravan To Vaccares is another film based on one of MacLean's most popular bestsellers, but alas, it's another movie that deserves to be added to the "rotten" list. Populated by uninteresting characters who find themselves in uninteresting situations and escapades, Caravan To Vaccares is an absolute failure, both as thriller and as entertainment. Its only qualities of semi-redeemer are: a) the film is shot in very attractive places of Provence, and: b) Charlotte Rampling seems to be an absolutely beautiful character (with completely naked scenes) as the main female character. > Neil Bowman (David Birney), a disillusioned American artist, travels aimlessly across France when he meets British photographer Lila (Charlotte Rampling). They decide to accompany and meet the mysterious noble Duke De Croyter (Michel Lonsdale) during their wanderings. The duke persuades the couple to help protect and escort the Hungarian scientist Zuger (Michael Bryant), who is wanted by various dark parties because of some information he has in his head. The secret kept by Bowman and Lila is the fact that Zuger has discovered a secret formula for using solar energy as an economical and inexpensive energy. The Hungarian desperately needs to bring his formula to New York, but leased guns have been put in his tracks to capture him. no doubt to be able to bring him back to a ruthless criminal lord and torture him to reveal to him his invaluable secret, which he can then sell to the highest bidder. Bowman and Lila meet with their terrified fugitive on the run in the French countryside against their deadly opponents. <br /> <br /> The film looks terribly cheap and amateurish, almost like an independent film with a very small budget directed by a non-professional cast and the team. Yet the film has been widely spent and everyone involved has, at different stages of their career, done a much better job. Therefore, it must be assumed that the film is bad simply because it was written, interpreted and realized with a flagrant lack of care and interest. The pace is extremely slow and the plot becomes so laborious that the viewer has to put in too much effort without reward to follow the thread of the story. Birney's performance is not implied and Rampling only creates a stir because of her nudity scenes. the character himself is an absolute boredom, and the actress seems to be bored rightly. For those who manage to stay in the film until the end, there is an unusual scene with deadly clowns and a fierce bull (!) Who, without being particularly exciting or well executed, is at least different from the norm. Caravan To Vaccares is a very disappointing film in many ways and, once again, a powerful novel by the prolific author has suffered during his transition on the screen.
