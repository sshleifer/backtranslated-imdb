Cultural Vandalism Is the new Gulliver's Travels production an act of cultural vandalism? Not literally. After all, not a single copy of the book is engraved. But if that's the only thing that Gulliver's people are exposed to, and for many, it will not be, these people will not have anything like what Jonathan Swift had planned. If Jonathan Swift was alive, Hallmark could be sued for violating moral rights and they would lose. It's a good way to think before you start a project using someone else's ideas. <br /> <br /> Swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity. Through his hero, Gulliver, he goes to places where he feels big, small, heckling and ?? Human. The people of Lilleput are small in every way. Small and stupid, they fight, big and small, the endless wars of annihilation on which their boiled eggs are ending at the breakfast table. It looks a bit like us. <br /> <br /> I forget most of the others: I have not read them for years. The TV show reminded me of some things and, on the positive side, it made me want to read it again. <br /> <br /> This gift to humanity was launched, as Gulligan under the branches under the vulgar yahoos, and Danson, Steenbergen and especially two great actors, Peter O'Toole and Edward Fox, should be completely shameful. A "creative person" had the brilliant idea of ​​focusing on "the star:" Gulliver, played by Ted Danson, whose game is simply bad. He describes Gulliver as crazy. All his journeys were invented. Weeeeel. Yeeeaaah! Of course, Swift invented Gulliver! Naturally, the countries he visited were imaginary: this is called fiction. His goal was to talk about humanity and our often terrible relationships between us. The travels of his imaginary character on imaginary lands are his method. But these people treat the imagination as a disease and anyone who has a moment that Hallmark could not turn into one of his harmless cards is suspicious. <br /> <br /> I can see why Hallmark would produce this shit. It's so serious that O'Toole, always deep, seems as little as his lilliputian character. He is in the character, of course, while commenting on the character simultaneously, as many, if not all, big actors do. Inform the character shines on it. Our light completes the character. It becomes three-dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation. Most actors do it very subtly, like Hopkins in "The Remnants of the Day". Others, like Nicholson, in most areas over the last twenty years, play a very different role in both roles. Nicholson actually plays on the relationship between his two points and with us too: with him, it's all the cradle of the cat and he, chuckling, holds all the strings. Very funny, as it is O'Toole. But something is missing here. He screams in a megaphone (as big as ever) and all that one feels is an empty shell standing under him. <br /> <br /> That's because it is. Look for "anodyne" and there should be the word "Hallmark" as a synonym. Inoffensive, bland, harmless: Hallmark is the doll that can not pee because it does not have genitals: it's the norm, the average, the person without distinction. The trademark is not to have a trademark. I have never suspected that such people despise those who have so much imagination. Suddenly, Pound's "Disney vs. Meta-Physics" stands out in bold. Or Einstein: "Mediocre minds will always violently oppose men of genius." Indeed, anyone of this mediocre type who has an answer to a question other than "a)" or "b" is suspicious. Who more distinctive than a man who travels to the darkest places of the human soul and shines his little flashlight to illuminate what can be found there? Hence the act of vandalism. The Taliban have destroyed the Buddhas in Afghanistan, the Palestinians the world's oldest synagogue in Jericho, the barbarians the great statuary of the classical age and these acts are obviously vandalism. Hallmark strives to protect us from foreign enemies by undermining our own culture. the one who feeds and supports them. And U.S. <br /> <br /> Get a copy of Gulliver's Travels wherever you are and read it. Or order it online. I like using ABE Books.
