"Jaded" offers a premise with potential as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and asks the question "when is not rape a rape?" Unfortunately, the film seems to be in a bad direction as it slips into legal detail while trying to weave a kind of story with a handful of rude and misrepresented characters, to end abruptly. "Jaded" is lame only for the wide-eyed couch potato in the mood of a dark drama.
