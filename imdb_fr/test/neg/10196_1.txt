This movie was terrible. It's not something that people should pay to see. It looks like a group of Christians has managed to convert people. I do not understand why it was released in theaters and not on television. <br /> <br /> It started as an old science-fiction B movie of the 50s, but quickly changed. About 30 minutes after the beginning of the film, the characters begin to talk about "God" and "Do you believe in Jesus?" It moves quickly in territory of pure religion. <br /> <br /> I was thinking of going to a sci-fi movie. The film has a bad acting game; bad camera angles and is amateurish. <br /> <br /> AVOID IT!
