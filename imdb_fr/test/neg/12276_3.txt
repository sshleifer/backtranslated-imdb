Slight damage below. <br /> <br /> The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the opening scene of European refugees to the final prediction that Nazism will be the death of millions of Germans, this film is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There is not much interest in entertainment here, although the images of the dust bowl are interesting for those of us who are not old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is quite memorable with Herr Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and his daughter assimilating to America with Wayne's help. Aside from the dust scenes, the only memorable aspect of the film is the one that is best seen with hindsight. Coburn's speech comparing Nazism to a malignant tumor worse than cancer and describing (then actual) successes as a momentary burst of energy from a patient just before his death was strangely accurate and Dr. Scherer de Varno was playing with precision to film after the war images of impenitent Nazis justifying their actions. <br /> <br /> From a historical perspective, some aspects of TET are interesting. If you look at it for entertainment outside the perspective of World War II, you will have to say that this is one of Wayne's less successful efforts.
