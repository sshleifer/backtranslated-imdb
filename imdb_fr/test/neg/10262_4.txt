Having seen this last night and as a fan of the first demons, I had hoped that the sequel would have the same playful and phantasmagorical spirit as its predecessor. This is unfortunately not the case. The editing is similar to the first one, in which a horde of flesh-eating demons emerge in reality coming out of a horror movie being projected ... (The first was a cinema, this one takes place in apartment and on television.) Once the demons are released, madness and mass carnage ensues. That's about everything about the development of the plot. It worked well in the first part because of macabre makeup effects, fast pace and unpredictability. The rest, however, does not cut it. The first problem seems to be that there are too many characters that are not really interested. If they were boring or idiotic, there would be at least some kind of gratification when they are inevitably slaughtered / demonized / eaten alive ... but these people somehow expect to be slaughtered. In addition, the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the building (and outside of it) is constantly back and forth between them, which keeps drawing me from the story . There are some fun elements, courtesy of splash and campiness effects. Like a constant stream of blood dripping from one floor to another, as if it were extraterrestrial acid ... The first demonic possession of an unpleasant birthday girl leads to the destruction of his entire group and a terrifying demon child making his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with a child. However, this sequence is transformed into a ridiculously ridiculous baby doll puppet that springs from the chest of the human child who constantly flies over the room to the victim of his choice. I have some laughter from this scene, but I do not think it was Bava's intention. The scene would probably have worked better if we had just kept the child demon to attack the woman, but hey ... Other little things like the overzealous play of most characters and the bad dubbing do not help things. In summary, I managed to see the unvalued version on DVD, and I can not imagine having to sit throughout the version previously rated R, because the effects of makeup and gore were the only thing I had. . Note also the early role of the future hottie girl producer Argento, Asia. In fact, she probably gives the best performance of the entire cast and she is barely on the screen. Argento / Bava fans may want to take a look at it, but will probably see their watch, as I did. Gore fans may be kicking some personal effects, but will laugh at their chair in front of the most clumsy puppet since Dead / Alive's Little Selwyn. You could do worse, but that certainly does not match the original.
