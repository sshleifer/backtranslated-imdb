Sigh ... what can I say? <br /> <br /> Why is such a horrible scenario approved in the first place? It's not wrong to have a complicated plot, but it's not explained properly to the public! <br /> <br /> Ask the woman to explain the plot through flashback is bad, bad, bad. Having a montage as tight for the fight scenes is bad too! Such a whimsical edition only appears in the trailers. It depreciates the look! <br /> <br /> And who are the Russians at the top of the film? Who is the guy who is tortured? Is he with the CIA? <br /> <br /> This film deserved not to go out in theaters. But that does not deserve to be produced in the first place. It's a joke in Hollywood.
