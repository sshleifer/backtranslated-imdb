It may be one of the worst movies I've had the pleasure of watching in my life. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people. I watched this movie with 3 friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. The character of Ben Kingsley is just stupid but not funny at all. It's a miracle why an actor of his talent would be involved in such guts. Tea Leoni makes a good impression of Hillary Clinton throughout the representation of the very cold and uninteresting female leader who has all the endearing qualities of a broomstick. Add a useless and unexplained sub-plot and a horribly disgusting montage, and you end up with a loss of 93 minutes (60 in my case). Avoid this movie at all costs!
