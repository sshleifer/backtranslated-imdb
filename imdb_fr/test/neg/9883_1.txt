There were only two redemptive reports on this film; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, and the way they described the transformation of the human form into a wolf. Forget the plot or the story of the book - they are completely absent from this film. In fact, about the book, only the names of the main actors are included. Even then, you will hardly recognize the characterizations. If the filmmakers had made a good movie, even unrelated to the book, I would not have been so disappointed. Unfortunately, they did not do it. The plot and scenario are typical of low-budget horror movies, the acting is wooden and the efforts of management are commonplace. Oh yes, the way the werewolf bows in front of their leader is a pure deluge. I suppose a sign of recognition is due to animal handlers. The wolves were beautiful animals and well managed in their roles.
