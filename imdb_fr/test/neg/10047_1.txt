This failed exercise of satire or commentary on the human condition easily gained a place among the 10 worst films I have ever seen. I seriously consider buying a copy, if I can find a very cheap one, to hunt an undesirable company. It's honestly this bad. I consider it a kind of anti-personnel weapon. If you're the kind of person who just needs to see a train wreck to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. To be fair, Kelsey Grammar's character has 1 line that works almost, but not quite. Apart from that, everything in this film strives to be insightful, but misses the target by approximately the distance between Earth and the pair of closest colliding galaxies. I usually enjoy a book or movie where the protagonist suffers from a kind of existential angst, but the anguish presented here is so incredible and overflowing, and the film does not even address the nonsense it presents. in a valid way. If you know the word "vomit", you may get a picture of cinematrocity. Oh, and the narrative structure is poorly designed, pretentious and amateurish. He failed on style and substance. If you really hate someone, invite him to participate in the double production of this film and "The Terror of Tiny Town", a mid-size western of the 1930s, and to force him to the constraint, the forced eyes of the style "A Clockwork Orange". But this probably violates certain provisions of the Geneva Conventions.
