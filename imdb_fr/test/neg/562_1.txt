Bogart's man is preparing to exploit the nostalgia of cinema-era viewers from the late '30s to the late' 40s. This fails miserably for several reasons. First, Sacchi, while reasonably resembling Bogart and even speaking like him on occasion and using his manners, has absolutely none of his charisma or ability to act. It's really obvious every time Sacchi does not clearly imitate a scene from one of Bogart's movies. Secondly, the film does not have the character of the first order that Bogart could work with characters. Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet do not appear in this one, dear friends. Of course, we have performances by Victor Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft, among others, but they are simply not of the same caliber (or do not have enough time on the screen or are misinterpreted). Third, attempts at "modern" humor fail. All the jokes about underwear, Marlowe having pretty much * never * removed that damn hat and trench coat (even though Bogart would have it), and so on. Fourthly, I have never heard a more gofier song on this side of Mitchell. Finally, the fake reverence of the film for Bogart (and the work of other classic actors) is really irritating. Bogart almost * never * played right hero, he was then a hero. He played complicated characters. This film makes Bogart a moralist and happy trigger. This may have been true for some of the characters in the film, but Bogart's characters rarely fit this bill. It's movies like this that make people who are not exposed to the movies of the past think that everything is hokey, "a good guy beats the bad guys and gets a girl" with low production values.
