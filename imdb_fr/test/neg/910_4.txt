Julia Kerbridge (Catherine Mary Stewart) works hard to become a doctor and suddenly Julia is the guardian of her young niece, Amanda, after her parents are found murdered Julia has a new neighbor, the mysterious Kevin Finney (Rob Lowe) Her hectic life crumbles when it becomes apparent that young Amanda holds the key to a terrible secret, because she too is now the target of the killers Julia must find out if Kevin is his friend or his enemy and pierce the mysterious mystery before the murderer strikes again ", according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> This thriller crumbles gently, but it's interesting from time to time. Stalker's background scenes Sean Devine (outside the police station) and Mr. Lowe's violin (restaurant) are intensely played. But in the beginning, it's hard not to lose sight of the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers deliberately sets foot in the red to paint. Unfortunately, this is not a complex point of intrigue; and, there is worse story stumbles on foot. All in all, "Dead Silent" is not a bad way to spend time if there is nothing better, or if you like Lowe and her co-stars. <br /> <br /> **** Dead Silent (1999) Roger Cardinal ~ Catherine Mary Stewart, Rob Lowe, Arlen Aguayo-Stewart, Larry Day
