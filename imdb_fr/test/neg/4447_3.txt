Seriously, all those Satan movies coming to Earth always involve Catholics. Why does Lucifer never joke with other denominations? <br /> <br /> The plot is qu'Asmod√©e (played by former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) has a plot to become human (but was not he always a demon) by putting this girl who is his sister pregnant with his child. Except maybe she's not his sister. The plot is not clear on this and they intermingle these scenes where he sees his problem shrink. <br /> <br /> The main girl gets pregnant while she is still a virgin, with an incredibly scary scene. his father gave him a gynecological examination to prove that his hymen was still intact ... Eeeewwwwww. His sister (played by Denise Crosby, who has been washed and looks much worse) concludes that it is a sign of heaven. To be praying! <br /> <br /> Well, the demon baby takes her mother's body for a ride in joy and removes a truck driver, her friend's boyfriend and her friend, all of whom are being watched by a former military priest whose mission is to kill the baby when he is born. We discover that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic cardinal who directs everything. <br /> <br /> The end is almost incomprehensible, and if you could go so far straight, you have a stronger stomach than me. . (I paused in the movie several times, it was so awful.)
