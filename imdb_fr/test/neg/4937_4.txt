"Shuttle" is an independent thriller featuring four young adults traveling late in the night on a shuttle to realize that the driver is a sadistic psychopath. <br /> <br /> Although some scary sequences and unconventional plot work, some aspects just do not do it. Bad dialogues and unlikely characters give a good reason not to worry about it. But often, the suspense works and asks you the question "What would you do?" and what you would normally do is not what these shuttle idiots do. <br /> <br /> If you're waiting for a stupid and bloody horror movie, you'll be wrong. It's a movie that makes you use your mind, but unfortunately until the end. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten.
