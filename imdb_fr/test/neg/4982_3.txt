First, there are good things to do: <br /> <br /> Underdog's voice was FINE. But Jason Lee himself being great, it's really not a surprise. <br /> <br /> Peter Dinklage (Barsinister) also behaved well for the waste he received. He acted shockingly. It was the same for Patrick Warburton, the feeble assistant. Now he was a silly character, but he did so well that I liked the character better than the protagonists. The lines given to her were childish but spiritual. <br /> <br /> However. Alex Neuberger has done a lot of pain and hopes he will never act again. His "Scream" was so wrong. Silence. Silence. "Aaahhhhhhh". In the scene where he hears the dog speak, a "oh no, impossible!" that would have been enough instead of the false pathetic cry. <br /> <br /> And then there was the girl and her dog who chased the character of Patrick on the roof. At first, that makes sense, she is a "journalist". A school journalist but always a curious mind anyway. But why, WHY did hell take away her dog? It was worthless and this damn dog did not even say anything other than a "Oh, oppressed heartless!" His presence was extremely useless. <br /> <br /> Overall, the script was pathetic. The only reason I give a 3 to this film is Barsinister, his help and the voice of the oppressed.
