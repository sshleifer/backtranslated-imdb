This was one of the slowest movies I have ever had the displeasure of attending. After the introduction where we receive the story of "something" that kills a few people in a farmhouse, we discover a looser, white family who moves to a farm - AND NOTHING stops for a long time. Then they meet this wanderer who helps on the farm and nothing new happens for a very long time. Finally, FINALLY, the daughter of the family has intrigue problems. Then something else happens, the guy drifting goes crazy and the movie ends. Between the two, it's about how this family had to move because the girl had some trouble at home and she has no money and it's LOW to do it so much that I do not care about those pathetic people. I can not believe that I actually went to the theater to see that! Not only was this movie nil, but some answered his cell phone, stupid idiots made noise AND the movie was nil. THAT'S WHY THEATERS SUCK - Bad movies, expensive shit food and idiots at the theater, I stay at home and watch DVDs, at least I could smoke if I was at home watching this stupid movie. Stay home and cook a pie rather than going to the theater to see that typical piece of shit. Stupid stupid shit.
