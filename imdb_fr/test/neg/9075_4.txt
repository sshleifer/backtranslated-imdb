I chose this film because I was looking for a friendship triangle between a girl and two boys. While I lived this situation and I lost myself in it, I hope that a similar story will inspire me. <br /> <br /> My main concerns are: - Why (a) and how (b) triangle shapes? - Why (c) and how (d) does the triangle degenerate? <br /> <br /> (a) The film offers a simple answer: "because it's better!" <br /> <br /> (b) Here is an open triangle: the three share things. Mine was closed: everyone knows others but never the three are together nor talk about the missing one: <br /> <br /> (c) The film does not offer explanations, but prefers them visual and emotional assumptions. The end comes with the sensuality, the sexuality that goes up in the triangle, or more exactly, when for a member, the deep feelings are related to the intimacy and that for the latter and for the first, they can be divided. I agree with that. <br /> <br /> (d) In the film & in my story, silence is proof that something is not right .. And in an ironic and painful way, the tool of these difficult times. , is still the phone: I lived this awful phone call planned: "Remind me: I'm waiting for you" ?? and when the time comes, the phone is silent ??. A variant is also indicated, when the line is connected but that one refuses to speak ?? All these scenes were very difficult for me to see. <br /> <br /> If the movie was a big help in this way, it also had many flaws: <br /> <br /> - I zapped on the boy's family problems > <br /> - why is the shower scene on the DVD jacket cut off in the movie? <br /> <br /> - How did Mickael finally enter the hotel? <br /> <br /> - Does Clement still see Salome? he says "no" but has his address; and who is the girl with him at the bar: his girlfriend? how can she know the address ??? <br /> <br /> - what happens to Vanessa: the ring on the last shoot is proof of commitment ??? with whom ?????
