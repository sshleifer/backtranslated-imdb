Saboteur was one of the few Hitchcocks I had yet to discover and I was less half-out. The French title "The Fifth Column" (ie The Fifth Column, a very evocative expression of clandestine espionage and sabotage organizations) placed my expectations at the highest level, as did the images of the final on Statue of Liberty. <br /> <Basically, Saboteur is as light as the 39 steps (note that this is another evocative phrase, even McGuffin as the title), but it lacks most of the humor (so the characters are rather earth-to -terre) and it's definitely not so fast. As a pursuit movie across the United States, from Los Angeles to New York, Saboteur is dragging from one sequence to another. The sequence in the ranch of the villain? Lovely ranch, lovely nasty but pretty tame overall, it does not do much. The meeting with the blind, the mix with the circus people, the Soda City sequence, the sequence of the New York ball? They fall flat, bringing more characters with very little extra suspense. <br /> <br /> A big problem that I can point out is the relationship between the main actors, Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, which did not develop like that of Robert Donat. and Madeleine Caroll in The 39 steps. This is why the whole narrative structure floats, depending on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes only bring us closer to the end because it is not clear if the hook is the fact that the hero escapes the police, the bad guys or his action to put an end to sabotage. In the 39 steps, it was clearly written 1 / Escaping from the police (so you know that the hero could not go to the police), then 2 / ran for his life and after the bad guys to prove his innocence. <br /> <br /> If you want a better Hitchcock of the wartime propaganda of the 40s, I would advise you to choose a foreign correspondent rather than Saboteur. These are both hunting movies with a catchy finale, a captivating take and not just a Foreign Correspondent's tourist visit, as well as wonderfully effective scenes (the crowd of umbrellas, the tulip fields, the strange mills ... ).
