This film was a total yawn festival that took forever to start, but never did. It was just boring to watch, so much so that I could never really get in there. This film is not a horror movie, but the cover of the videotape has made one. Instead, it's a thriller movie with some horror elements to make the movie more interesting. Of course, it does not help this film at all. All I can remember is that this movie looked like a 1970s movie called "The Deep". Group search for treasure, rival groups, that kind of thing. There are also supernatural twists, but to tell the truth, I was so bored watching this film that I sort of zoned and can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were. I kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea, so maybe it was some sort of undead, or maybe I was thinking about Lucio Fulcio's "Zombie" movie, which was kind of a Horror movie taking place in a tropical island. as weird as this one was a lot more fun than this movie. That day, we learned a valuable lesson: never rent a movie based on his cover art.
