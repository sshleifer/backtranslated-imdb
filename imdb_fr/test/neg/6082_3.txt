The movie was awful. The production company should be required to pay a fine for the waste of electricity that passed on this nonsense. <br /> <br /> There were too many holes in the plot. Why would the DOJ send a killer to murder a world leader? If they were not the DOJ, why would they send someone who, in their opinion, would not do the job? To quote Butch Cassidy, "Who are these guys?" Apparently, the director does not know either because he never told us. <br /> <br /> The characters were incredible. They did not behave in a way that seemed to match what they were supposed to be. With the exception of the doctor, none of the characters were particularly convincing and friendly. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste money on the electricity needed to watch this movie, do not hesitate. Otherwise, run in the opposite direction.
