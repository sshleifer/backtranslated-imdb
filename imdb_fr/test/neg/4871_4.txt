1st viewed 25/02/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-George P. Cosmatos): Predictable action thriller where any frequent viewer could guess what would happen next. Charlie Sheen is the good old boy of the president who is not appreciated by the rest of the presidential staff. Of course, he is involved in a situation in which he is incarcerated again and again and he has a friend in the White House, played by Sutherland, who of course does not stay that long. Her other friend is a reporter played by Linda Hamilton (who has very little to do or say in this meaningless role) and, of course, her greatest friend is the president himself (Sam Waterston) who remains his boyfriend until the end despite everyone. if not be killed around him. Tribe insane and yet meaningless, despite a lot of talent (much wasted).
