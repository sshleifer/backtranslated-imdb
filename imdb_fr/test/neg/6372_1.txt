I have been collecting Iron Man comics since the early 70's and have always enjoyed the character who is far from the ordinary hero and his many and varied enemies. There have been no less than three attempts of an animated series for Iron Man and only the original and part of the second have ever done justice to the character. I was hoping that this new version would be good. Boy I was wrong! The art of DVD is very misleading and presents an image that is not the film. Punch on the good, the little that there is ... The art and the animation are well drawn and the writing and the dialogue are generally good, although with notable exceptions. The character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well played. Now for the bad ... Unfortunately, the writers have chosen to screw everything up with the origin of Iron Man and especially with that of Mandarin. On top of that, they decided to make Iron Man and his opponents in CGI. Bad CGI. This makes them stand out almost as badly as actors in a cartoon would. The work of synthesis is often repetitive and glaring shortcuts are sometimes taken. CG battles are also awkward, further reinforcing the fact that CG and line animation do not mix well. The film would certainly have done better if they had chosen to draw all the characters. Another problem is that Iron Man is in his traditional red and gold costume for a battle! And it's not even the big fight at the end. All this drags the film and he never answers. <br /> <br /> ************ SPOILERS (or warnings) CAN FOLLOW *********** * <br /> <br /> The film begins by an unusually interesting sequence of stop motion credits from machines, welds and gears. Then we discover what looks like a Chinese temple being restored and a statue of what fans will recognize as Mandarin. Things go strangely, preventing progress in temple restoration. James Rhodes, Tony Stark's long-time friend, is his supervisor. It seems that they plan to raise the temple of the earth, despite the opposition of a group that insists that raising the temple will cause a terrible disaster. Rhodes is captured in a raid. Stark, presented in a spa with a lovely lady, is aware of the problems and plans to personally supervise the project and rescue her friend as her father deals with board leaders who want Tony removed from office . Tony only arrives to have his armored escort ambushed and broken into pieces. Tony wakes up later fatally wounded in the heart and prisoner of the rebels. He is saved only by the quick action of Rhodes and a scientist. Ultimately, Stark must build the prototype of gray iron armor and manage to escape, but only after some loss of life. While meeting the rebels, he meets a troubled girl named Li Mei, and the two fall in love. The Temple is high and four elemental beings (all completed in GC) appear and proceed to begin collecting hidden power rings. Stark and Rhody face problems at home but manage to confront the elementals without success and really stop them. First using the Aquatic Armor, then the more classic red and gold armor and finally everything returns to the temple and Stark is back in the thick gray armor for a final confrontation and a confrontation with what could be Fin Fang Foom (also in CG). Here, the story takes a major turn because it turns out that the Mandarin needs a host body to manifest itself. This leads to a somewhat tragic final battle spoiled by the fact that Mandarin is little more than a ghost and is not seen before the last 5 minutes of the film. uh ... <br /> <br /> If you're an Iron Man fan, you probably will not be able to enjoy this outing. And even non-fans can very well find the film a bit lacking or not.
