Rabbit fever is one of those quirks. It's a pleasant 90 minutes, which requires few viewers, and offers as much, and on any terrestrial television channel, even at prime time, I think Rabbit Fever would be rather well received. Which makes me wonder why he was pushed into cinemas. <br /> <br /> The film is filmed as a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women who have an addictive relationship with the Rabbit Vibrator. The film is mainly focused on finding a quality that is supposedly addictive to the famous sexual aid product. The story is 100% tongue in cheek. <br /> <br /> The story is strong, an introduction to well rounded and friendly characters, an exciting story, peripheral characters and situations evolves into an engaging story, and pleasing conclusions. Unfortunately, nothing seems intelligent or new. Rabbit fever has strong moments, a few switches that hint at what writers are capable of, and all the credit they deserve, it's not just 90 minutes of pimple gags and innuendo, I could probably watch it with my mother. But some scenes are lazy and paralyze, these moments are gone, you're up for it, when you want it to be outrageous, and you get a big spoonful of sit-com. <br /> <br /> I chuckled, I left the theater with empathy for the characters, but I also left with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90-minute reel for television, a light entertainment and had tried to integrate it into the national cinema. <br /> <br /> I think Rabbit Fever realizes what she was supposed to do, it's a strange subject, a complete storyline, a well-presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes. But nothing in all this can justify the extravagance of a film environment. On the contrary, some commercials would have given the viewer a chance to take a breath of life that seems to lack rabbit fever.
