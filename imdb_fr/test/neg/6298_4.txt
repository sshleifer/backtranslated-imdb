Terence Stamp can carry everything, but it's still a one-dimensional shallow film. It's nice to watch - just like the actors - and if you like drag-queens, you may like a lot, but the plot and characters are as fine as cardboard. It is one of those politically correct films that distorts everything so that the "lifestyle of a minority" seems warm and cuddly. That's a lot of bitch talking, which is fun in this disinfected form, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Ninety percent of the action scrolls in garish costumes in incongruous situations. Dramatic content is a symbolic appendage - they try hard to make you take it seriously.
