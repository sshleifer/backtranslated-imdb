This is one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen, probably surpassed only by the appalling Blueberry. How can Harald Zwart even put his name on this shit? I feel that every ounce of respect I have for him has faded. <br /> <br /> What makes him so poor in this film? Is this history? Yes. Is it the actors? Yes. Is this all the "look and feel" of the movie? Yes. </ P> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> </ p> p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> in c, it's as clich√© and predictable as one would expect from a 14-year-old drunk man on his article "What I did this summer". The atmosphere of well-being that the authors are trying to achieve collapses from drowning completely as we undergo another embarrassing trick in the story. <br /> <br /> The actors are amateurs, I know, and we can not expect them to be the same quality as the professional actors. But for this to work, characters MUST be charming and / or funny (preferably both), so viewers do not worry about cheeky games, or even add to characters. In this case, not even close baby! You start to dislike the characters in moderation and at the end of the movie (I think it takes about 90 minutes, although it takes 4 hours), you really want to hurt someone to make you think of these guys stupid and stupid! It should be impossible to find the successful humor attempt of this movie unless you are really yourself like those stupid suckers. Their lack of talent and credibility as an actor only makes scenes stupid and too simple more difficult to knock down. Even the family of people involved will find it hard to find anything but very, very embarrassing (I would rather have my sister make fun of American Idol). <br /> <br /> Finally, why cram in a group of lost Norwegian celebrities? They seem even more out of place than the actors, if that is possible. These celebrity cameos only add to the film's cheap feel and are in themselves a pretty, well-visible plan in the dark to try to improve something that was broken even before creation. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to emphasize how much I prefer to watch dry paint than ever watch this movie again ...
