I have to start by saying that I LOVE watching bad movies that are entertaining. This film offers 100%. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. There are lots of shabby archive footage in a city (pedestrians, traffic, skyline, etc.) that do not bind to anything. There are also too long "sex scenes". These involve a lot of hugging and frequent rubbing socks on the bodies of others. These are by no means erotic and are the closest thing to the horror you will find in this movie. This is especially true for the shower scene where two of the "barely legal" girls who could not be over 40 years old were bleeding blood, but there is also a member of the crew who is squirting blood from the outside while one of the girls continues to smile at him. Nobody had to memorize the lines of this film. If they do not read the cards clearly, they have a magazine in front of them that they watch constantly as they struggle in difficult dialogues. Then there is Mr. Creepo. He launches the name of Ed Wood as he can compare it, but he is far from this quality. He walks into a graveyard chatting about things that went wrong in the film, which really contributes to the film's lack of fluidity. We could not stop laughing during this movie (except during the sex scenes where we were disgusted and sometimes horrified) <br /> <br /> I give this film a 1/10 to have so far exceeded all my expectations for a horrible movie.
