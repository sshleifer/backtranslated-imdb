The premise of Bottom crossed with Fawlty Towers sounds good! However, Ade Edmonson and Rik Mayall have managed to create a film that barely raises. Ten years ago, Rik Mayall's furious look and Ade's idiocy were amusing. They are now embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The film had promised - even though the most horrible hotel in Britain is not a new idea - failed to deliver. Simon (Peggy, Big Train), Peggy and Helene Mathieu played the role of savior. The film only lasts 90 minutes. Sorry guys, but you really hit the bottom
