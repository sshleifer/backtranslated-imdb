My first question is NOT about the horrible actor, nor about the horrible writing, but about the staging. The choices that have been made about cinematography are some of the worst decisions I have ever seen. Why does EVERY single have to die in slow motion? I was about to fight with a rubber hose. The shots make sure you do not see what's going on. I was just about to close the movie because of Jalal Merhi's accent, when he came on the sex scene, so I thought it could get better, well it was not past. If you evaluate special effects on a rating scale of A, B, C, should I place it around W or higher and did I mention the acting? Wow, it was bad !!! And the worst part of the "Expect to die" experience is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover, which is: "THE JUST MUTANEOUS MATRIX". comparing this film to the matrix is ​​easily the worst comparison I have ever seen. If you have not seen this movie, do not do it unless you are looking for a good reason to hit your head against the wall.
