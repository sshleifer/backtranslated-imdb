Seeing that this piece has not been broadcast in the theater world anywhere else in the world, it only reminds the careers of these talented ladies, Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich. It's also a particularly naughty kind of movie, of the kind that thinks it is intelligent, funny and original while being poor in every way. Brian Burns, the scriptwriter and director of this boiler, can be blamed entirely. His scenario takes a little original situation and is not going anywhere with it. Situations develop completely without any internal logic, except that of a desperate screenwriter. The characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts, behaving stupidly and without any real motivation. This is nowhere more evident than in the inclusion of Ms. Richards. We do not believe his relationship with the character of David Krumholtz for a minute and the way it is put back into play after one hour is particularly pitiful. Why would anyone fall for an egocentric, egocentric and arrogant b ** ch like this at the beginning, let alone a second time? Especially after supposedly finding his ... uh ... true love? And if one of these things is not enough to completely sink this film, the central couple will be. The coupling of Krumholtz and Jovovich is only slightly more credible or developed than that of Richards-one, but to no avail. There is no chemistry, no spark, nothing we can freely accept as a credible couple. Worse still, these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating, doing boring and irritating things that ultimately do not interest the viewer. <br /> <br /> Overall, this representation is very poor. Even rom-com comedians may want to pass on this one because there are dozens of films made with more talent or more charm.
