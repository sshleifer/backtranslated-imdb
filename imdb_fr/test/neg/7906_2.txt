"Soul Plane" is a horrible comedy attempt that should only attract people with a thick skull, bloodshot eyes and furry pawns. <br /> <br /> The plot is not only incoherent but also non-existent, the acting is usually sub-par with a band of characters extremely weak and terrible thrown for bad measure, the jokes are often seen at the before and almost never even a little fun. This film is devoid of structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old, even in the 50s. The only thing that really matters are pretty ladies, but really, if you want you to praise something to "Adult "section. OKAY? <br /> <br /> I hardly see anything here to recommend, because you will probably have a lot more time and time chasing rats with a hammer or inventing waterproof tea bags or whatever. <br /> <br /> 2/10
