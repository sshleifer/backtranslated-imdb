I bought it on VHS under the name "Terror Hospital", and when I got home, I checked IMDb and it was like OMG, it's the legendary "Nurse Sherri" !!! Here is another representative of Al Adamson, who had clearly learned a tiny amount of film since the days of "Dracula's Castle Blood". Where this previous effort is a more or less totally sclerotic block, this one mixes it a bit, adding a definite element of variety and surprise in the midst of incompetence. Of course, half of the film is a blind post-op football player pulling the breeze with his nurse stacked, but at any moment we could be cut to the disconcerted head of the Satanist brain, or nurse Sherri running a farmer with a pitchfork, or a tiny abstract piece of student film to go with the pulsating blob effects in the possession scene, or the most gratuitous piece without a cap, heartless, or god knows what else (j forget, to be honest). When the nonsense goes bad, it goes to the high end. Congratulations, Al.
