Where should I start with this movie? All I know is that it's a mess. Be the scenario, the story or the actors. First of all, this movie is very disappointing on the part of Salman Khan, who already introduced us to Dulhan Hum The Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega. Second Rani becomes really boring, appearing in all stupid movies since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (happy that Saathiya stopped this nonsense). The story is stolen at The Wedding Singer, but ruins the fun movie. The dialogues are missing. I may have laughed here and there, but entertained? NO!!! Salman Khan was tolerable in the movies mentioned above, but here he is crazy. His character is badly written. One minute he's poor, and the next minute you wonder how poor he is. Rani Mukherjee looks like a simple jain and made no effort. She happily bought out her career with Saathiya because her career was going around in circles at that time. Pooja Batra has put a little charm here with her looks but it's still not enough. Jackie Shroff is wasted. The beauty and the game of Kashmira Shah fled because she had chosen such a horrible scenario. Raveena Tandon is beautiful, but puts little performance. Mohnish Behl receives the best actor award (he needs Razzie because there have been terrible films in India). He says stupid dialogues, dances terribly, looks odd and is not in his usual form. Just to tell you, there are more than the actors who are so terrible. Without the superb beauty of Raveena in Aa Meri Life Bana De, I would not give a point to the film. Otherwise, Salman's dance was terrible. Pooja Batra danced like a wind in Savariya, otherwise I would like the costumes to be metamorphosed and the rest of the actors (and their dancing monkey) were blown off the wind. The good song of the album was O Priya O Priya which does not have a pretty good image. Same thing for the title song halfway decent. Otherwise, this movie (and the rest of the songs) is a no-no for everyone.
