This is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the movie Total Reality, do not waste your time and money renting this lame excuse for a movie. This is, without equal, the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I have had nightmares of this movie since I saw it. The acting was terrible, and any amateur filmmaker could make a more decent movie. The film blatantly snatches much higher sci-fi movies, such as TimeCop or Total Recall (whose title seems to have been derived). I'm sorry, but I just think it's more entertaining to look at the side of a cardboard box for two hours. If you've ever seen this movie, I'm sorry for going through what I did.
