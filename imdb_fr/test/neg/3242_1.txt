Oh, if one day you want to see a supernatural thriller that turns out to be a comedy, watch this movie <br /> <br /> This movie was a shock because it had so many actors in it, but what do they do and how do they fit in? <br /> <br /> The treatment of the scenes of the college is like a play where each person comes to speak, then the next person comes across <br /> <br /> Good reasons to laugh the film: 1 ) Akshay, Suneil, Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor, Arshad Warsi as university students 2) Akshay carries a firearm in college 3) some pathetic stunts and SFX <br /> <br /> there are still several flaws like why does not the snake save his lover from being raped and come so late? also why he does not kill them all together only? <br /> <br /> But after all, they must make a movie of more than 2 hours, so you have a movie about the tortorius <br /> <br /> The film is painful to watch The film was made by Rajkumar Kohli, who was an expert in the making of such films and has had many successes, such as JAANI DUSHMAN (1979) and NAGIN Rajkumar Kohli wants to help his son's nonexistent career Right from VIRODHI (English only) 1992), Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and QAHAR (1996) all strived to promote his son and he also launched great stars for his son to be noticed, but nothing could help him in his son's career < br /> <br /> The film presents several comic scenes such as death scenes, how the actors after being beaten by the snake are so apt to fight it again and the climax <br /> <br /> The realization of Rajkumar Kohli is bad The music is bad <br /> <br /> That brings us to the distribution Akshay Kumar - ordinary stuff, he does not have much to do instead of turning down Suneil Shetty - the terrible Sonu Nigam - the worst deb An absolute reward comes back to him, he gives a new meaning to the comic. Aftab - Arshad Wars terrible - nothing to do. Sharad Kapoor - Aditya Panscholi- irritates Sunny Deol - is comical in the scene when he comes to save Sonu LOL Manisha Koiral-ordinary Rambha - Kiran Kumar, Akshay pair, Raza Murad are as usual Raj Babbar- hilarious for bad reasons, the girls are awful Which brings us to Munish Kohli This guy has a huge physique, he is even stronger and taller than Akshay Kumar He presents himself sadly as Akshay of the poor man His voice is awful, his expressions are painful The only thing he has to do in the film is to wear glasses and pout, Rajat Bedi is awful
