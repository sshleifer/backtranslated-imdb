The other reviewer was completely correct about this one. The writing was awful, the acting was awful, the subject was awful. The actors seemed not to be really in the film, as if they almost had to be there. There were unique camera effects, but they were not really related to the story (or story), and they were not produced particularly well. <br /> <br /> I guess they were trying to build on the success (can I say that?) of the other eschatological films (Omega Code, Left Behind). And yes, it makes Christians embarrassed when these types of films are produced. I would not recommend this film to anyone, especially a non-Christian.
