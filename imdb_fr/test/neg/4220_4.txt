I read the book "Scarlett" and was expecting a good movie the first time I saw it. I am afraid to say that I was disappointed. The movie did not follow the book and made many changes that I did not like. <br /> <br /> One of the changes for which I did not like the way Lord Fenton was described. It made no sense to make him a bad man. The way Lord Fenton and Scarlett put an end to things was very different and their relationship was too intimate. <br /> <br /> There was much less confrontation between Scarlett and Rhett in the movie than what was written in the book. The film sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross each other often enough to give the impression that there could still be love between the two. A good movie, but I think it certainly could have been better than if he had been more faithful to Alexandra Rippley's book.
