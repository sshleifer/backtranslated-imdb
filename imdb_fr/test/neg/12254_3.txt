Although it must be the nadir of season six, this schmaltzy episode is neither badly written nor acted. It's just that most of us have been looking in X-Files for some gripping tension and thrillers that end up with no easy answers and that are moving towards dark but unfathomable plots. Season 6 gave us a stream of tasteless comedies that undermined the continuity of the series and, frankly, gave the special look of the Simpsons Halloween Specials a fantastic thriller. <br /> In this episode, Victoria Jackson of the fame SNL plays the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who stands as a rainmaker. However, his meteorologist is the one who really loves him and Mulder ends up having to give him dating advice to get out of the city. <br /> <br /> There is fun with the chemistry between the agents and fun but not too sophisticated characterization of Midwest hicks. It's nothing you would want to see more than once! <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand Season 6. X-Files creator Chris Carter seems to miss the whole story of the film "Syndicate Conspiracy" and gives up all responsibility. black comedy writers.
