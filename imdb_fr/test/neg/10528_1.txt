This film is sometimes a bourgeois sex comedy of the 80s, others a sweet romantic ... Then there are dramatic moments, then shines of science fiction ... It is so unequal that it is almost ridiculous . <br /> <br /> But I would not say it's one of the worst films I've ever seen, except of course for the filming of Peter O'Toole. <br /> <br /> He has absolutely nothing to do for him. work with here. Bad dialogue, mediocre performance on which to work, all mediocre ... And yet, it is fantastic ... It is not good and yet, it makes it work, if only by the pure charm. <br /> <br /> The fact that he was able to achieve so much with so little light showed how much everyone in this movie had failed, making it even worse than I suppose in Reality ... <br /> <br /> If another actor had played the role of O'Toole, I would have forgotten this movie as a shit and I would never have thought of it again, but a great performance of Peter O'Toole, despite all the difficulties, assures me that I will remember this film for a long time. the time has come ... If only as a film, it might have been a good thing if someone involved in this film was almost as good as Peter O'Toole.
