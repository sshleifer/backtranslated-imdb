I do not usually watch the dribble Hollywood, but friends took me to see this one, which was fun in places, but totally devoid of originality. Do not worry, you will not have to think. The scenario of Tarantino leaves enough clues too obvious to allow us to predict correctly where it will be about fifteen minutes before each "rebound". good enough for a Hollywood movie but it would have nowhere to go at its peak. And then, my fears came true - the YMCA could not save this one, but Liv Tyler almost did it. I guess being a man and I'm in my twenties helped, but she did a very good performance - she obviously did not have to do much except for an absolutely gorgeous look but what she did worked well! McCOOL'S will certainly not be considered one of Hollywood's big hits (or should I say "should not" because the traditional American film industry is not going anywhere, and since at least a decade, hit like AMERICAN BEAUTY, TITANIC and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and even those with major flaws), but if you're a teenager, do yourself a favor and see Liv - she's a sexy girl. Rating: 5/10. See also: all about Quentin Tarantino, all the American teen movies of the last decade, all that counts sex as the main selling point.
