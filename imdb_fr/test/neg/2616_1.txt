Very disappointing 7th chapter of this series slowly dying. It is obvious that the budget was extremely low. This film was made for one reason and only one. For Sale Puppet Master Toys! Fans, such as myself from the series, have decided, from what I have read and heard that the only worst of the series is Curse of the Puppetmaster. In turn, we turn away from the series. <br /> <br /> Choosing to make this movie a PG-13 movie, for whatever reason, did not work favorably. The plot seemed almost there, but was easily lost in the constant stream of nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only movie in the series to watch, also directed by Decoteau, is the third part - The revenge of Toulon. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I prefer the landscapes of the film. <br /> <br /> Yuck!
