Good idea ... too bad for the movie. Would you like it to be a little more scary and explain more about the characters and the exact identity of the wicked woman? If she tortured these children, why did they help her kill without helping others kill her? It's a bit of a Malcolm back in the middle! <br /> <br /> I think it would be beneficial to be a bit longer and to go into more detail with the characters, although after about an hour I wondered it would end! <br /> <br /> It would have been better if the characters who killed them were not computerized in reality, it made them a little crazy. And what happened to Frankie Munitz's character? He fell into a bed of wild roses so he should be safe, but the video game showed him to be a finished game, that is to say dead. The next thing he appears with this irritating blonde to rescue the guy scared by the fire who, I noticed, did not hesitate to return the lighter when the demon pursued !! <br /> Too many contradictions in this movie to really enjoy it, however, could make you think twice about playing this new computer game !!
