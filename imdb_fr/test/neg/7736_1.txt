Hero's message is very clear: the idea of ​​Greater China is more important than the death and suffering of millions of people. At a time when China is shifting its war toys on Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to support this piece of over-produced dogmatic garbage, sponsored by the government. <br /> <br /> The promotion of this piece is particularly surprising. liberal media film.

Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote about the film's "sanctimonious traditionalism" and about its "glorification of ruthless leadership and the sacrifice of on the altar of the nation ". "For my part, I sign my name under the last statement of Hoberman: Hero is none other than" a fascinating fascism. "
