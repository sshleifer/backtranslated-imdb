The best thing I can say about "Quintet" is that it's not as bad as I remembered at first. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean it's good. <br /> <br /> This strange sci-fi thriller is unlike any other film I've ever seen, which I suppose gives it at least the stamp of novelty. But it's a disaster at the limit of a film, and one of the worst ever made by Robert Altman. In the DVD titled "Quintet", it is clear that even Altman did not know what the movie was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> It is in the distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age. The film was shot on the abandoned site of the 1967 Montreal Expo, and I must admit that it gives the film some interesting production design elements, although much of it seems to have been filmed in an icy mall. . Paul Newman, seemingly lost and completely uninterested in everything around him, and Brigitte Fossey, play the dinghies wandering in this futuristic city in search of Newman's brother. Soon, Newman is involved in a mortal game of "Quintette", that all the bored inhabitants play for want of nothing better than nothing, and whose rules are never clearly explained to the public. All we know is that the goal of the game is to kill everyone else you play with and to be the only person alive. It gives these nihilist inhabitants their only thrill, because, as one of them says at one point in a psychobabblic monologue, it is only by being about to die that one can appreciate 'be alive. <br /> The film is slow, ugly and really uncomfortable to watch because of its flawless gloom. It's almost as if Altman deliberately intended to make a movie that no one would want to sit on. There are no characters - of course, the actors scroll around the lines of conversation, but none of these lines really makes sense, and the impressive list of Altman international actors gathered for this register has nothing to do. Only Bibi Andersson gives the closest result to a memorable performance, as one might find in a movie like this. Nevertheless, he manages nevertheless to create an atmosphere, even if it is a real horror, and it is curiously fascinating to see watching a man starve slowly would be fascinating. <br /> <br /> Altman really hit a drought after almost a decade of superb movies. "Quintet" followed closely the atrocious "A Wedding" and was followed closely by the not bad but especially forgettable "A perfect couple", the terrible "Health" (which I have never seen because it does not is available nowhere to see) and the disastrous "Popeye". Thank God, he bounced back. <br /> <br /> Grade: D-
