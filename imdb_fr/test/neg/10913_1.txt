Not me .. If it came down, I could kick a dog's ass, and that's why this movie does not work for me. If it was me against the extraterrestrial, or Jason .. or .. hell, I do not know .. ANY OTHER ANTAGONIST OF HORROR MOVIE, then there would be no challenge and I would get swallowed my ass except a divine intervention. A horror movie works because it puts people in a situation with a creature, a person, a being, an entity, anything, who is more powerful, resourceful or intelligent, and then people say to themselves: "And if that happened to me, they're scared - and that's why it's a horrible idea for a story. I can not imagine myself being terrorized by a dog, so I'm not afraid.
