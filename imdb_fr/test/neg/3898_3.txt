I consider myself a fan of Jess Franco and his trashy films, but almost every time I see one, I see missed opportunities and intrigues that are not going well. This film is unfortunately no different. The film certainly had a lot of potential, since Franco has merged the intriguing theme of the classic movie "The Most Dangerous Game" with its usual brand of slash, but the plot is lost here too often and it takes forever for Franco to get around the main point of the film. This film is later franco, you could be forgiven for thinking that the director would have improved, but in reality, I found that the opposite is true; like this and the terrible "Killer Barbys" are two of his worst films. The plot focuses on a stripper and his shady boyfriend. The couple is invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover. However, they quickly realize that they have not been invited there for social reasons because they are "released" on the island so that the rich woman and her friends can track them down for the sport! <br /> <br /> What attracted me in this film is the cover and the fact that it was directed by the king of sleaze movies. You would think then that I would be happy that the film presents a plethora of scenes of sex and sleaze in general; but I am not. The reason is mainly that the sex and the film in the movie are really boring and most of the time only serve to give me the condition known as "quick itchy finger". However, my desire to see everything until the end forced me to regroup. There was a time when I did not think girl on girl could be boring, but I've been proven since I was wrong. The only good thing I can say from the movie is that the soundtrack is very catchy, and despite being stupid as foreign pop music. actually mixes up pretty well with sex scenes. I enjoyed the last ten minutes; it was then that the plot finally began, but it was a case of too little, too late and, unfortunately, it is an extremely dull film. All in all, I only recommend this film to those who want to see more than 180 French-language movies ... everyone should watch Vampyros Lesbos, Faceless or She Killed in Ecstasy.
