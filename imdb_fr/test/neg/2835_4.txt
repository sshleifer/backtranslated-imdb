A young doctor and his wife are suddenly waiting for a child. Both are disturbed about a two-hour memory delay the night of the design. Interesting twist on a tired history. Very good F / X and interesting editing. Jillian McWhirter is notable in a cast starring Arnold Vosloo, Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif. Brimley brings normality back to the weird. Congratulations to director Brian Yuzna.
