There was no 0 in the voting option, so I was forced to use the next available figure. <br /> <br /> It's a sad day for Bollywood when such a type of movie with star actors is nothing. are that a lot of juvenile actors, and a terrible scenario. <br /> <br /> This film is far from being called a clone of Hitch. Salman Khan with his usual take-away shirt theme and Govinda with his humorous laughter. If someone had said two decades ago that I would write a comment about Salman (after his success with Maine Pyar Kiya), I would have criticized him.
