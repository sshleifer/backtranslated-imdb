Recap: Not quite aware of Macbeth's story in Shakespeare, but I guess it's pretty close to the original, it's only in the present tense. It tells the story of Macbeth, a member of a crime syndicate in Melbourne (?). He is a hit-hit man and is in favor of Chief Duncan. But he and his lady have higher ambitions than that and plan Duncan's assassination and any competition from the throne. It is a story of treason and cold and brutal death. <br /> <br /> Comments: A very interesting idea, I must say. To use the story but change the setting to the current time, while keeping the original dialog (?). This establishes an enormous contrast between classical poetic work and violence. Promised extremely violent, it is a promise he holds, but not in the notion that I imagined. It's really bloody, but the violence is slow. Not only figuratively, it's calculated, it's also, but literally. In reality, a lot of action is slowed down and this is what puts the film on its knees. <br /> <br /> What could have been a unique force, the contrast between superfluous and poetic dialogue and extreme violence, is now turning into something else. Now both of them slow down the movement a lot, so much so that it becomes really dull and boring at times. <br /> <br /> In addition, I can not understand the context in which the three witches act. In accordance with the present time and the reality, I told myself that such magical magic had no place in the film. Apparently, yes, but for me it seems completely out of place. Not a secondary plot, but a complete sub-story with its own rules, completely different from the rest of the movie. Seems completely irrelevant. Of course, it should have been possible to convert this part into something modern too. Drug-induced hallucinations perhaps (what, I suspect the director, an allusion, but he left far too much witchcraft to be credible)? Now, they bring only portions of the movie that are clearly out of the story and I just waited until the real movie started again. <br /> <br /> A clear disappointment, but maybe something for Shakespeare enthusiasts? <br /> <br /> 4/10
