I watched this movie tonight and I must say it's horrible! I was expecting it to be great, because you know, generally, we do not have a lot of movies about Asian vampires mixed with Asian culture; but at the beginning, it had already started badly: the introduction of the film did not seem to have an end! The plot is so weak and if you remove the fights and the soundtrack, you really have nothing useful! The director of this film does not seem to have important notions about the time it takes to introduce and flashbacks, for example. (Not to mention other things yet) <br /> <br /> To watch a good movie about vampires, I really recommend watching '' Lost Boys '' or '' The Interview with the vampire ''.
