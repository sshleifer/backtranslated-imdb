Jessica is a virgin, very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch. Jessica is also a powerful medium capable of dowsing, retro-cognition, precognition and esp. When young and handsome Gordon Hawthorne comes to visit him, he is immediately skeptical about Jessica's powers ... until his talents discover a lost wristwatch and bring to light an old treasure chest. However, the treasure chest contains the severed head of a dead satanist named Gideon Drew, whose powers are far more powerful than those of Jessica. Despite his warnings about the evil around them, Drew manages to mentally enslave any unfortunate person so she can look him in the eyes. But Drew especially wants Jessica. He needs his dowsing skills to unearth his body so he can resurrect the dead and rule the human race. Will Jessica's powerful fleur-de-lis, combined with Gordon's love, move away the old evil before he can destroy them all? This film is not very interesting. This certainly could have been the case. The basic story is interesting and imaginative, but the acting is realistic and everything moves too slowly to generate interest. Jessica is also too innocent - almost boring - and Gordon, her love interest, is wooden, stiff and totally emotionless. None of the characters are very friendly, and the small budget is painfully obvious. A hasty ending does not help things. Avoid, unless it is the MST3K version.
