My wife saw this film in the aisle of a local video store. From the cover, it looked like a sci-fi movie, but after shooting the movie, my wife saw Rebecca St. James become part of the movie, realized it was a Christian movie and suggested we watch it . We are conservative evangelicals, but we also know that "Christian" films have a bad reputation in mainstream media. Nevertheless, we decided to make a projection. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are a few things I liked in the movie. The musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was pretty good. Cinematography was also good considering that it was a low-budget film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the virtues of the production of this film was lost in a regrettable scenario. The film begins with an interesting premise - the UFO kidnappings - but halfway through, the plot turns wildly into an evangelical crusade led by the two main characters of the film ... which then turns into a treatise on the removal. At least the film "The Visitation" (inspired by Frank Peretti) (which was itself a deeply flawed film) had an end game that linked the premise of the film. "Unidentified" does not end anywhere, not even very close to where it started, which is a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Regarding the acting game? The acting goes from decent to awful. (Rebecca St. James plays a little role and is passable.) On their side, some main characters are quite skilled. Unfortunately, their talents are wasted in characters as one-dimensional as their personalities are incredible. The "protagonists" are anything but you know it's a shame when two Christian viewers find the most telling character of the most annoying movie. <br /> <br /> A final note on the evangelical tone of this film, which will interest more Christian than non-Christian readers. In a word, it's embarrassing. Other Christian films such as Carmen's "The Champion" and Peretti's "The Curman of The Hangman" have been able to communicate a truly uncompromising portrayal of the Christian faith without appearing to be predictive or oppressive. This film, on the contrary, is a hammer-hammer that feels so hard and tactless that a non-Christian would find it hard to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I really believe that the filmmaker is in the heart at the right place, and I applaud the efforts to create a good Christian movie. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. If your church is planning to screen a good Christian movie, consider "Mercy Streets", the aforementioned "Champion", or (if you are Pentecostal) the provocative "The Apostle" of Robert Duvall. <br /> <br /> As for "unidentified?" Praise it if you must, but filter it before showing it to a non-Christian audience or wider audience.
