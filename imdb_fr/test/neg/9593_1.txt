Laugh my ass, but probably because I was stoned. That aside ... it's by no means a horror movie, there's absolutely no horror in this movie and the holes in the plot are so huge that even a person with a IQ below average would think it's stupid. On top of that, I've been living in Denmark for the rest of my life and I can assure you that Denmark is a country too small for which you need GPSS cards and cards to be able to find your way back if you are lost. I think that if you do not make an effort, you could never be further away from the city or other people than 3 hours maximum on foot. Secondly, I do not think that any part of the film, with the exception of two Copenhagen shots in which no actor is present, was recorded in Denmark. The swamp woman speaks Swedish and not Danish. The helmet on the first bog body is brand new. The girl they find in the forest hides under a type of rock that does not exist in Denmark. It's just stupid.
