The so-called least funny comedy I've ever seen <br /> <br /> Not a patch on the naturalism of the hilarious town Twin City <br /> <br /> Vegas I: I like it but this scenario is so terrible The English was at least commensurate with the commitments made, Scotland with Braveheart and Trainspotting 2 is distinguished by great movies and Wales had Twin Town, Zulu, Last Days of Dolwyn, Torchwood , Doctor Who and Under Milk Wood, etc. <br /> <br /> The comedy is composed of numbers, the actors are dead men who walk because there is neither characterization nor originality and it is so funny <br /> <England is late no matter how many dark films they produce in the North. This is the old class system that destroys English films. Oxbridge graduates spew endless texts about clichÃ©s about working-class people they have never lived with. It is pathetic. Monty Python was not funny, nor anything from Oxbridge. <br /> <br /> Let guys like Jonny Vegas and Peter Kay, Rob Brydon, Billy Connolly or write their own dialogue and forget the archaic class system that has failed class people and the real talent that goes on to through the system take up the writing correctly and the British and English film industries will re-emerge, what next prince Edward to write a Oliver Twist of modern times?
