I recently watched a copy of this (under the title 'Eaten Alive'). Talk about terrible! All the films that Ed Wood has put on the market look like an Oscar movie compared to this laughable tosh. To be honest, a few lines of the script will remain in the memory for a long time, such as "These people (Cannibals) do not buy frozen meat in a supermarket like us, they get it everyday fresh from people like you or me" Classic ! The crazy guy from "Jonesville" in the jungle was the best character in the movie, he really looked like a fool. I think he was the only actor not to be dubbed (bad), if these Italians must have American characters in their films, why not force the Americans to double in the dialogue instead of the English trying their best to look like Annie Oakley. I'll give 3 out of 10, I'll give 3 because it's really funnier than most comedies nowadays.
