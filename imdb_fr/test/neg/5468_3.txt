Here are some paragraphs from an essay I wrote for a university about TBOR. <br /> <br /> "The Book of Revelation is an erotic thriller about the sex, power and struggle of a talented dancer to find his identity after having unfortunately raped by three women in a cloak. three women who raped her all have distinctive marks on the bodies: one has a giant birthmark on her buttocks, another has a butterfly tattoo on the bottom of her belly and the head of the ring has a small circle So he lives his new life in search of these marks, and to find them in these intimate places, he does what every sensible man does when he needs to see as many naked women as possible to solve a mystery, he has sex with them One hour and ten minutes after the beginning of the film, you have the impression that he has almost had a piece of every woman in Melbourne. <br /> <br /> The film is a huge pretentious piece of celluloid, it's as if grandiloquence is repeating itself At one point of the film's final climax, Kok's Kinos give a scene the same energy and strength as his first feature film, Head On. Like many government-funded films, the film takes seriously, the screenplay and its execution seem to be chores rather than presents and, unfortunately, for the talented thespians, their brilliant performances (especially Tom Long as a fractured protagonist) ) are stuck in the confines of a pompous wan k party ".
