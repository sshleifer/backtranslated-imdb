Spoiler with explanation of the plot: a poor family is thrown in the middle of a war between the villain (who emerges from nowhere, without asking questions ...) who went crazy, and Casper, the friendly ghost who tries to avenge his death. With each image, the film becomes more and more predictable, a big disappointment. Ending completely silly seams, it has nothing to do with the film itself, I think someone is short of ideas or stops at the point that the film is such, so that he has a stupid end. Loss of time, resources and money. The acting is very poor. If you think about dialogues, you may discover that family conflict is artificially reinforced by poor communication between characters. Some scenes seem random. In short: boring, predictable, poor, pathetic. Loss of time and money.
