Beware, my beautiful (1952) Director: Harry Horner <br /> <br /> Production: The directors / Photos of the radio RKO <br /> <br /> Thriller of the credibility of the producers of Collier Young and Ida Lupino, aka The Filmmakers (with Lupino mingling with uncredited management). <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan is the "danger" and Ida Lupino is the "woman" of this entry in the style film "woman in danger". Ryan plays Howard Wilton, a psychotic handyman with a tight wound (noooo, Ryan, I know, hard to believe). Lupino is the lone widow of war, Helen Gordon, who hires Howard to work around his house. The situation deteriorates from then on, when Howard makes Helen a prisoner at home. <br /> <br /> Howard has an ugly secret, not that he can reveal it. You see, consciousness is a real challenge for him. To maintain it is. He has the bad habit of coming to see his dead employers. This is part of the problem of the film. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is almost impossible to believe he was free to roam freely from city to city, even in 1918 (at the time of filming). He does not remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. Its violent, threatening and antisocial tendencies are emphasized by the smallest and most common of things (a girl flirting, war-related inadequacies, being dismissed for service). I do not know how he managed to pass the interview with Helen. There are other improbabilities. If you were locked in your house with a madman, but you were left alone for a while, could not you find a way to escape? <br /> <br /> Ryan, I think, is defeated by the material. It feels like he's playing his hand too much. Her series of twitching and spasms and tightly wrapped bursts of dementia all have a sense of being-there, robotic. At this stage of his career, he had probably played this character, to a certain extent, ten times and it shows. We are encouraged to empathize with Howard (I did not do so) through illustrated fragments of humanity, as if he were stopped in his tracks by a music box and was referring to a group of children who would not judge him. Lupino must simply act in a haphazard and distressed manner, which she is more than capable of and does. <br /> <br /> The photo had a purpose; What would be the final resolution of the conflict? There was, of course, a disappointing, abrupt and ineffective end. <br /> <br /> A recurring motif that allowed the camera to catch Howard's reflection was of minor interest (mirrors, water, Christmas tree decorations). This indicated that something was going on or was going to continue in his head. Horner (Vicki in 1953), who has earned a reputation in the design of production, is very successful in giving the house the feeling of being a prison. To you too, RKO's always reliable art department for housework. In the end, the work below the standards of the directors, who all have better films to their credit. <br /> <br /> * Â½ out of 4
