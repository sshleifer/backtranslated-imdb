Bardem is great. The actresses are great. But Amenabar did not have to do it like that. It is good that he defends his position on euthanasia, an extremely delicate issue. But doing it like that makes him lose his point of view: the film is a fake, offensive to the intelligence, full of tricks and even sometimes extremely boring. Some scenes are advertising material, more than a movie. Women are incredibly attracted to this man suffering from mental illness who wants to do someone to kill him, without understanding the implications of that. He seems to care about no one and thank them for their concern, love and attention. I think that Amenabar might have inspired people to think about this issue in a different way, but I do not think the way he chose to do it is incorrect. He could have made his argument more powerful by exposing the flip side of the coin without making fun of him.
