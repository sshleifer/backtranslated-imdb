... And this is not a very good documentary, the American MOVIE seems to have let some people believe that it was a parodic documentary ("Mockumentary"), and even some television news programs have described it as such. I will not laugh hard because it is easy to confuse this documentary with a big comeback, IT IS A SPINAL SUPPORT <br /> <br /> What seems to have caused confusion is that the documentary is centered about the aspiring filmmaker Mark Borchardt who is .... How, yes, but it's not necessarily a bad thing, because if we did not have dreams, we would still live in caves and the fact that Mark is obsessed by horror movies should not be considered a criticism. Sam Raimi (yes, that one) and Peter Jackson (yes, that one) have both started doing low budget horror comedies, so it's not a criticism, no, it's just that Mark Borchardt (yes that one) is a parody of American trailer. <br /> <br /> Remember that there is something about MA RY Ben Stiller gives the lift to a poorly equipped hiker ("Come to my office because you're fucking on fire")? That's what Mark and most of Jerry Springer's guests look like. It is therefore very easy to understand why some people thought it was not a real documentary. It's also not a very good documentary since Mark and his teammates gave me goose bumps. Did you know someone thought Mark would become a serial killer? Does anyone else think there is a lot of time left for this to happen?
