I love bad movies: Showgirls, Plan 9 of Outerspace, etc. And this film fits perfectly. Do not believe those who tell you it's a good movie. It's downright awful. Tim Curry's accent ranges from German to Portuguese and Hungarian. There is a person in gorilla costume who is supposed to be able to communicate with a glove that interprets the sign language of the monkey. There is a scene with a killer hippo that moves around a river like a great white shark. There are people going up and down the mountain. Kilimanjaro as if escalators were installed on it. This thing is ridiculously ridiculous. So ridiculous that I rolled on the floor. It's totally implausible. I loved every minute.
