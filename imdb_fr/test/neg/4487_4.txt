I could not wait to see two bright young actors appear in "Dear John", but it was very slow. and I felt that the script and staging hampered the flexibility of the main performers. I generally appreciate the cinematic adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I found that the film did an excellent job in describing a realistic military action. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was very effective in passing through love letters, focusing on a key word or phrase in each letter. I felt that Channing Tatum was bogged down in what has become a series of very "lagging" expressions in response to the loss.
