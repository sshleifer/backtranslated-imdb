I must be honest, I like romantic comedies, but it was not what I had hoped for. I thought Ellen Degeneres had the biggest share, which should have been because I did not like the two bed partners in trouble. It was horrible. Poor Tom Selleck !! He had to play with someone who was really in the picture whereas it should have been him and Ellen to be in most of the movie. They were the only ones credible. And the only really fun parts were playing them, not Kate Capshaw and this guy from Everett .. Cool that mom is coming out of the closet, I thought it was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> I'm just happy to have seen him on the cable and not having paid money to rent it.
