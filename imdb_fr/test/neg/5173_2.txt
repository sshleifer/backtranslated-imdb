After having more than a few friends suggest that I check Rise of the Footsoldier, I finally got it last night. Without a doubt, the story that Colton Leach has to tell (and did in his autobiography) is a captivating story that tells the story of a man climbing from Terrace Boot Boy to a wicked connected demon. This film is sadly compromised in quality by broadcast errors, appalling accents and a deplorable acting game. Ricci Harnett, in Leach's lead role, reasonably succeeds in shifting the passage from brutality to crime, but his accent is omnipresent. While his voice tells stories, it's something that, after ten minutes, drove me crazy. Terry Stone as Tony Tucker provided the unintentional comedy with an ill-fitting wig (or the worst dialogue between Barnett) that was so complicated that it became a juvenile and extreme vehemence in online distribution reducing Tucker to a parody. What troubled me most about this film was that the events that preceded the filming in Rettenden, Essex and the formative years of Leach really interested crime fans and fans of hooliganism, while this story was sabotaged by a lack credible accents felt that an opportunity had been missed. Roland Manookian and Frank Harper provide films with the only source of authenticity. On the positive side, some rhythmic and building films have flowed well and caught the eye. The violence was well choreographed and, apart from the excessive use of red syrup for projectiles for splashing blood, was on the whole realistic. If you enjoyed the movie, visit Essex Boys who tells a similar story from a fictional angle and stars Billy Murray.
