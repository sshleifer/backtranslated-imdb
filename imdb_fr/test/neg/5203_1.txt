As a big fan of the original Operation Delta Force, I thought I would take this movie. I thought it could not be too bad. However, here is a list of what I learned from watching Delta Force 4: Deep Fault. <br /> <br /> - Although it is the elite of the US Armed Forces, the Delta Force is usually made up of slightly overweight men. 30s and early 40s. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, although the elite of the US Armed Forces, wears standard police guns or AK-47s as part of its most important missions. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, although the elite of the US Armed Forces, has not learned that on stealthy missions, wearing bright red skiers and running in open spaces are not enough to hide you. <br /> <br /> - When you drop a Molotov cocktail into a tank, it explodes outside like a grenade. <br /> <br /> - When you are hit by a tank shot, you can run away, although the smoke may cause minor difficulty breathing. <br /> <br /> - You can die with a standard shot, but you can also live despite being repeatedly hit by a sniper rifle a few times by an AK-47. <br /> <br /> - In hand-to-hand combat, members of the Delta Force, although an elite of the US Armed Forces, are routinely beaten by railroad agents. <br /> <br /> - If villains approach you while you are on a slow train, do not worry - between the 4, they can not find a way to automatically fire an automatic weapon , let alone hitting anyone under 50 meters with at least 50 attempts. <br /> <br /> - If you run out of actors, recycle them - the villain of Operation Delta Force 1 plays a well-known type of Mac in Operation Delta Force 4 and the player who played Mac in Operation Delta Force 3 now plays the role of Skip Lang, a much better guy. <br /> <br /> - It's not acceptable for The Delta Force to fire an unarmed terrorist, even if he tries to reload his weapon to kill you. <br /> <br /> - Grenades explode under impact with the ground when thrown by members of the Delta Force. When launched by personnel other than the Delta Force, they explode exactly to the point where the Delta Force members threw the grenades at the criminals. <br /> <br /> - Tanks can drive faster than conventional trucks. <Br /> <br /> - Militia and personal armies use exactly the same helicopter used by the UN in Operation Delta Force 1. <br /> <br /> - When a helicopter arrives, a villain from this helicopter can not see you if you lie face down. <br /> <br /> - Shooting a person several times in the chest will cause minor damage. Hitting this knee will kill her within 5 seconds. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force steals cars from seniors to move to foreign countries because the US military does not provide them with any means of transportation. This may also explain why they took public transport. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is not really the best time to make a film, but it's a good way to laugh.
