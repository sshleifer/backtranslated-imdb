One hundred and seventy-five million dollars represents a huge sum to spend on the biggest blockbuster of the summer. Even Michael Bay did not have such a large budget for Transformers. The way Universal Pictures spent so much money to win Evan Almighty is a mystery. They certainly did not spend it in the screenplay, the film is not a classic comedy, it's a Christian flag waving and barking one or two quiet little laughs. You will probably spend the entire time wondering where the budget is going. went or why Steve Carrell felt the need to reduce it to zero in a resolutely average film at the exact moment when his star profile began to increase. <br /> <br /> Following Jim Carrey's comedy, Bruce Almighty, this movie sees former supporting character Evan Baxter (Carrell) climbs the ladder up to the main player's slot. The story begins with the fact that he leaves the press office to become a civil servant and settles in Washington with his wife and his three generic sons (a puzzling puppet for primary school, a keen schoolboy and a teenager looper). Evan's attempt to change the world through politics, however, is of paramount importance when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and asks him to build an ark. <br /> <br /> In other words, this is an update of the old story of Genesis. , with Evan fighting cynicism and opponents to build the huge boat. Unfortunately, although the principle is reasonably promising, it does not provide much laughter. It's a little fun to be entertained in the early hours of the game, when Evan's right-winger MP tries to reconcile public service requirements with the unwelcoming groups of animals that follow him and with a beard that resists any attempt to shave it, but as soon as possible. as he accepts his divine mission, the film plunges into his nose. <br /> <br /> From that moment, it turns into a message movie. Evan begins to preach with alarming regularity and Morgan Freeman continues to be wise while gently pushing his chosen ones in the right direction. Without Evan's resistance however, the only remaining comedy trace is in the form of a few jokes of animal excrement garbage and the role of John Michael Higgin as Evan's exasperated right arm. Higgins may be showing the same comic potential he once had in Arrested Development, but his enthusiasm can only save the sinking ship, especially since Carrell has all but put his formidable improvisational skills into improvisation. 'background. <br /> <br /> In some ways, it sounds a bit like the Passion of Christ, but unlike Mel Gibson's film that encouraged everyone to believe in God through blood and guilt, Evan Almighty tries a softer approach. The film simply tells us that we should have faith in God because he has faith in us. Unfortunately, this film may make you laugh as much as Passion. Carrell is on autopilot, jokes do not exist and Wanda Sykes is trying to become the most annoying person on the planet. It may be sweet, but someone has thrown $ 175 million into the sea.
