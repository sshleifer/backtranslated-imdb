Surrender Cinema is known for its extremely erotic and almost explicit sci-fi movies. Although they usually do very well in these places (Femalien 1 & 2, Virtual Encounters), this entry in particular seems to be only a reworking of the old band. Any number of girls - some recognizable and some not - are in this film at all stages of nudity. There are also several excerpts from other films that are exceptional, unless you have seen these other films. There are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things - some playing basketball, others talking, others playing with themselves. The last scene of this tape is for only value: an erotic but erotic scene with a very enthusiastic and funny Sandy Wasko and a more moderate Tammie Hainum. Not strongly recommended.
