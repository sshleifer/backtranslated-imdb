Well, it was never going to change the world, and it was bombarded at the box office, but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those movies I fell in love with as a kid (the BBC showed it a few times in the 1980s and I. passed a high quality VHS tape into the machine - lucky, that!) and watched endlessly. I watched the DVD last night and unfortunately the weather was not nice for this so-called blockbuster. Either that or I just out of this kind of wide and doped humor. Come on, when Schlesinger is so desperate to laugh, he gives us close-ups of fancy underwear with "funny" slogans, what can you say about the cast or script? <br /> <br /> Certainly, it's ambitious, interesting, unusual and sprawling, but it's never a funny laugh. I would describe it as a children's movie with "adult" accents - you can let your kids watch it safely, despite the 15 certificates. They will not get the drug references, so do not worry. I was pleasantly surprised to realize that I had forgotten how catchy the title song and the 'Everybody's Going Faster, Faster' song of the truck driver was, not to mention the patriotic anthem of the Ticlaw city. All the distribution offers laudable performances, the photography is clear and perfectly reflects the atmosphere of the different places, and the real atmosphere in capsules on the mode, the cars, the gadgets (in particular the drum machine mounted on the board of edge), the interiors and references of pop culture - I was more than a little surprised to hear the bank nigger say aloud to everyone "I'm OJ Simpson!", especially now that Simpson's legal troubles have overshadowed his sporting achievements. The problem is that there is almost no plot to speak of, it's all too obvious to be spiritual and not funny enough to cause a lot of sincere laughter. I would have liked to leave this one as a pleasant memory.
