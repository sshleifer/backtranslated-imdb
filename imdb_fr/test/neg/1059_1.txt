Well, this film shows us that Mark Griffiths and the producers think we're all idiots. If not, how should we understand this: <br /> <br /> American pilots take off on Mig-29s. Suddenly, all planes turn to the F-16s. Ha, a magic! After an action ... Migs disembarks. The magic again! <br /> <br /> Oh, did I ever mention that the F-16s were marked with Israel? <br /> <br /> Another magic: unlicensed L-39 coaches are bombarding their enemies. <br /> <br /> And even more magic: although all the films are located in Europe, you can see a desert in almost all the scene flights. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the director has lost all his magic above all else, because the action scenes are incredibly chaotic and the explosions seem terribly as if the pilots were bombarded of molotov. <br /> <br /> OK, OK, it's a movie. I should write about his story ... wait. A story? Yes, there is a story in this movie. And it's horrible too.
