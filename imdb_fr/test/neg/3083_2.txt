I saw this film because Calexico made the score. A real disappointment. Boring and fashionable scenes, with urban hipsters and their lifestyles clich√©s. Stereotypical Mexican border culture (mystical grandfather with rattlesnake and potions, granddaughter in his mariachi style restaurant). Some laughs, but hipper-than-thou, and sorely lacks vision and basic talent in film.
