My only regret is not being able to assign a 0 to a movie on IMDb. "A Cena ..." would certainly deserve that! AT LEAST. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER? * The film begins with a group of people entering a crypt to wake up an old vampire. When a guy cuts himself and his blood drips on the putrid and dried corpse that is supposed to be a leech, the metamorphosis takes place and the vampire, in an effect similar to that of an ANIMATION (do you believe!) , Quickly takes a more human form, only to reveal that he is wearing a tuxedo and a bow tie! A bow tie, yes. Red, if my memory is good! I tried to check random scenes by jumping a bit, but it was not better than the opening sequences. That's when I turned off the film, cursing him for making me hope to see a movie about Vampire. This is certainly not the case unless you are 5 years old and do not take this stupidity seriously. So, if you like Vampires and you do not want to feel revolted or even disgusted, learn from Do not even try to see this trash!
