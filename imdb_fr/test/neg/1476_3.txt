The concept of this film is unique, but its execution is less than special. When I arrived at the cinema and realized that there were only about fifteen people in the crowd, I thought I was wrong. However, the real mistake was made in the slightest details when the film was finished and I knew I had lost two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Without the cruel recordings of the old man and his stupidly funny friend, this movie would have been rated at 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This movie is special, because it's probably the worst movie of all time to be made public. <br /> <br /> There is the question of whether you can call that a movie or just an advertisement for the "North West" probably shabby. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of watching this movie for intrigue, humor, filming, location, then do not do it. On the other hand, if you like to experiment both ends of the spectrum of film production, just take a book, a little game or just something new.
