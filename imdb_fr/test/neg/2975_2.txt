Well, I'm Singaporean and I would like to say that it's time to stop stereotyping Singaporeans and make such films. Some actors / actresses actually have talent, but unfortunately, this has not been shown much in this movie. I was shaking in my seat when I looked at it, being quite young at that time, my parents dragged me to see him. Honestly, I could say that I was going to fall asleep. And there was this arrogant westernized boy who annoyed me. All in all, a boring movie and a general waste of talent of actors. I have seen better Singaporean films than that. The chicken rice war was good. However, I can not believe that it would be considered a better Singaporean film. Sorry, I would not recommend it.
