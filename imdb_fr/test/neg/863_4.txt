I have seen this movie on TV late at night. I saw the opening credits and I thought it looked good. Well, I was very wrong. Although not terribly bad (there were some funny and tender moments), it lacked cohesion. <br /> <br /> It started pretty well with the character of Kathy Bates who had a midlife crisis when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered. But Kathy played these unhappy women so well before - think of the fried green tomatoes. The problem was not Kathy, it was the scenario devoid of secrets that wandered everywhere. It was as if writers had to think about what we will do next. The script also seemed very artificial. <br /> <br /> Some others who posted comments on this film wondered why he was not getting a movie outing. The main reason in my opinion would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered him. <br /> <br /> Having said all I thought, the little woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie, not to mention the beautiful girl.
