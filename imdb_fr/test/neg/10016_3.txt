Many people are standing in front of the house and some women are crying ... Men standing in close groups are talking in low voices ... two guys come in and discuss the sexy appearance that their daughter might have today ... Soon, you will know that someone in the house has died ... The deceased's wife is worried about having to prepare meals for so many people, her friend sitting next to her gives an idea of ​​making things easier by preparing simple sabji roti ... the girl is busy putting on makeup ... her mother suggests she wear salwar kameej, but the girl is more interested in her beauty when so many people are going to visit their house and therefore, he prefers jeans and t-shirt over salwar kameez ... another son asks his mother to finish all the kriyas and also tells him that he should not be expected early from the office ... Then the camera is slowly focusing on the dead person ... the white sheet covering the face is slightly moved because of the wind, revealing the face ... His Anupam Kher ... suddenly the alarm rings and he gets up from the bed ... Is this? his dream or a flashback? You will not have an answer before the end of the film ... Well, it's a comedy for the director Dibakar Banerjee !!!!! Later, you will discover that this scene has nothing to do with the movie itself and so it is obvious that everything that was previously described was a dream. Is it a movie comedy? Well, he is supposed to belong to this category ... But this is not the case! there is nothing that can be associated at a distance with the comedy in the film !!! More on the director gives the message that no one will get justice from the police !!! so everyone must cheat the cheaters !!!! or forget the justice !!!! The music of Bapi-Tutul & Dhruv Dhalla is fine ... Nothing to say about other sectors ... A bad scenario destroys everything ... even the performance of Anupam Kher fails to make at least one paisa vasool ...
