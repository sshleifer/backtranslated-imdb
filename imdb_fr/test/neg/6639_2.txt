There is no humor in this loser of a movie. Carrot Top is a surfer inventor who charges the rent for his useless inventions. Then he helps a broken old man by the side of the road, and lo and behold, he inherited a big business. And, again and again, jealous parents, humanizing society, hostile takeovers, the obligatory love interest ... aargh ... let's just say that this film is almost unassailable. What Carrot Top has accomplished is to convince me never to go to his shows.
