I am a big fan of the original Enterprise crew since the age of eight. I watched all the movies and enjoyed each other for what they learned from the old series and to further develop the characters (and the Star Trek universe in general). Even in "The Undiscovered Country", I thought that the aging of the characters was well managed and that the story deserved a theatrical release. However, that said, "Star Trek V: The Last Frontier" is unquestionably the worst of the series featuring the original crew. I agree with many that Kirk's camaraderie, Spock and McCoy is well managed, but the whole scenario, the direction - by William Shatner - and the special effects deserve nothing more than a television episode. This is a "boyfriend movie" and sometimes almost unrecognizable as a Star Trek movie. The action sequences are not supported and therefore create little or no tension. The dialogue is weak, although it provides some laughter, wanted or not. The Klingons seem to have been thrown after the fact. The whole concept of "Sha-Ka-Ree" is just silly and Laurence Luckinbill, a good actor in everything I've ever seen, is inside the absurd in this movie. The scene where Sybok evokes images of Spock's pain and that of McCoy destroys the image of the characters as we know them. Spock would never be associated with such stupidity and McCoy, who tries to save his father, is overflowing with tasteless and redundant dialogues and totally ruins DeForest Kelley's acting abilities. The whole scene is ruined and shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see of these characters. I understand that Shatner did not have the luxury of working with ILM for special effects and that the budget of this film was tight, but that does not allow such a bad story. In some ways, I think this story fits the old series, but the movies, including "Star Trek: The Movie", are all much better than this one. It's a pity that most other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie. The focus on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is nice, but far exceeded. The old crew really does not seem to be a character. I liked the former General Klingon and the sensual Romulienne bar. I liked the humor and the idea that Spock has a half-brother, but that's about it. If it was a TV episode, I could accept a lot of mistakes. As a film, it's just a bad film making. It's a shame too, because I want this film to be good. Even if it was the level of "Star Trek III", I would be happy, but this film gives the impression that all the other films of this series resemble works of Shakespeare.
