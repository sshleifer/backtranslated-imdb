You have to start worrying when you see that Michael Madsen is leading a cast of a movie. I will not go through the list of shame that characterizes his film career. <br /> <br /> I watched 45 minutes and I was still not sure what was really going on. The film consisted of a love hate relationship between Madsen and Argento, which was essentially an insult to Madsen, a threat of violence and usually treating her as a filth. On the other side, she loves him, so she does not like him, then she loves him, she wants him, then she loves him again ... what's wrong not with your wife !!!! <br /> <br /> The scenario is awful, a ugly soundtrack and an unfounded rough and rough sexuality that I think has been added to appeal to some viewers, as the film has little to offer. I would have given the film a 1 but it has pretty much managed a 2 with a little excitement in the last 20 minutes. He has actually answered a question in the last few minutes, but I will not share it, I will make you suffer for the full movie as I did.
