I entered this film with very few expectations. I went with my girlfriend and my two friends and none of them could explain to me the story of the Grudge 1. Well, if the first one could not leave an impression on them to explain the intrigue, so I doubted it would be better. <br /> <br /> Let me summarize what the trailers let you know: The Asian woman is back and Sarah Michelle Gellar too. Fortunately for her, she does not stay very long. This decision may have saved his career. <br /> <br /> The film has three scenarios, and none makes sense. And even worse, none of them is developed. You are almost beginning to understand, then someone dies and the story is left behind. Killing people can be scary, but I found myself more confused about the attempt to develop a plot that I was afraid of. They come and go between the three scenarios, which are not related ... OR ARE THEY?!?! * SOUND EFFECTTT * ~~~ The timing of the three stories is moved, and you can tell from the beginning that the movie is going to have a turn at the end. BE PREPARED. Oh, wait. Sorry, this is not a Fight Club quality twist or Vertigo, you can see it coming from several kilometers. And probably imagined MUCH better to wring your head ... they should have hired me. Instead of the girl appearing "SURPRISING", maybe it could have been Michael Jackson? This part of Scary Movie 4 scared me. <br /> <br /> Killing sequences have been terribly over. Unlike horror movies of the past, where a killer springs out of nowhere, a closet or behind a door, for example, and everyone in the theater jumps (and then the fat guy behind you drops popcorn in the neck ) - it lacked scary sound UPS. They zoomed in on where the random Asian woman or child would show up, and you knew exactly what would happen. Instead of having a very loud, then silent music, then going out of your mind, the music gave you the timing for the scary scene. If I know it's coming, it will not scare me. <br /> <br /> The film began by explaining what "grudge" is; when a person is killed during a rage, a curse is placed where they were killed. So, why does the damn asian lady by her mother have any significance for the story? And why is the grudge moving countries? This movie was absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> All he did was let me miss my friends for letting me go. We should have seen one of those animated Pixar movies. It would have been more scary.
