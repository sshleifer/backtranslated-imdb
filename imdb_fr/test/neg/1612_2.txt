A malfunction in space puts astronaut Neil Stryker (Glenn Corbett) out of his course and heads for a parallel world, called Terra, which surrounds the sun exactly opposite to the Earth. As a space being would pose a threat to the order of this world, Stryker is restrained until we can determine exactly what to do with him. Stryker, however, begins to be wary of his environment and to escape. With the help of a benevolent nurse and an old scientist who opposes the government, Stryker will attempt to board a spacecraft and return to Earth. <br /> <br /> Stranded in Space (or The Stranger if you prefer) is another. of those 70 television movies that had to be turned into a regular weekly show. In this case, it is easy to see why this has not been done. First of all, there is nothing new in the organization of the series. It has undoubtedly been designed to follow the same formula used by The Fugitive or The Incredible Hulk or Planet of the Apes. You know, a moving foreigner constantly moves from one city to another, holding an unusual job, while being chased by a government agency or journalist. It is a formula that has been made to death. The second attack on Stranded in Space is his lead, Glenn Corbett. Could this guy meet less friendly? I was looking for him to get caught. Without sympathy for the main character, this kind of show would never work. Finally, this is supposed to be science fiction. Just because everyone is left-handed and someone has hung three fake moons on the horizon, I'm supposed to jump to the conclusion that this is a distant planet? So, it's just a coincidence that if they all speak English, dress like people on Earth and drive Plymouth Furies? Yes, it's true. <br /> <br /> The only highlight for me was the inclusion of Cameron Mitchell in the cast. Of course, it's hard to look at it in something as appalling, but you know the old adage - any Cameron is better than no Cameron (yeah, I've never heard him say that either). <br /> <br /> As with many On these 70s TV-made movies, I watched Stranded in Space, a courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I would not say it's a big episode, but there are some good jokes along the way. In the end, while I note the film at 2/10, he gets a 3/5 on my rating scale MST3K.
