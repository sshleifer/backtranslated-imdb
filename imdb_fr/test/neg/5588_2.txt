Wow, what's happening on the shelves of the video rental store in front of me? Nothing but a "continuation" questionable to 8MM. It was not a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive ending and an abundance of much deeper emotional depth than this movie. <br /> <br /> By and large, according to the summary of the plot, an American diplomat, David Huxley and his fianc√©e, Tish Harrington, ventured to Budapest, Hungary, into the sordid world of sex and sex. pornography, to discover who makes them sing with a porn video taken with a prostitute, Risa. The whole story is based on the different characters that make up these different sex clubs and strippers all over the city. The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish discovers that the ransom of the video and (mostly later in the story) of his fiancee, which comes from his trust fund, is essentially back to his future husband. unfolds to the bitter end. <br /> <br /> I did not like the fact that it had absolutely nothing to do with the original 8 MM. The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that he was, the fact that David finds himself with some kind of bondage scammer on him to keep him prisoner looks like the evil world of the first movie, and does it The film was emblematic of sex in almost all key scenes. Otherwise, it's a totally different movie. It was an ugly love story, even before the end was known, making the end more likely because I did not believe the words coming out of David's mouth all the time. But we were warned that he was a liar on most things that could get him into trouble. <br /> <br /> There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the film's "shocking" moments, which tried to stir up emotions. in the audience to encourage Tish to understand the plot so that she can leave this "infernal" sexual debauchery. I counted at least 11 sequences ridiculously filmed while there was only sex to show. Even the menu screen on the DVD is just a movie with naked women on it to make the DVD look totally challenging. <br /> <br /> David was not a heroic person throughout the movie. You might guess that it was the main problem well before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me, which perhaps explains how they managed to force so many of them to undress in order to gain "respect". There were holes in the plot (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted while David was so immersed in this damn investigation to try to find a prostitute?) Like a queen of slavery), and a gay brother character who only showed how the director was trying to imitate Joaquin Phoenix to play this character. The slogan presented on this profile for this video is also complete because it was not even a last breath. Nobody really dies. But they had a good car accident sequence that came out of nowhere ... but it was a good 10 seconds on a one-hour, 3/4 movie. <br /> <br /> Go rent (and maybe buy) the original. This is one of Joel Schumacher's best and most original films. Everything has been improved since this film. I would not recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
