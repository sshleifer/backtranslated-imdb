This film was a movie without interest. It was a story that does not move and that does not make you think of anything else where is all the moving material told by the other critics about the film. movie that you keep watching in the hope that it will improve and that it just is not the case. Last night, I watched this movie and wished we had not lost our precious time (while baby sleeps) watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I plan not to recommend it to my family and friends, as well as anyone who wants to rent it. I was not impressed by anything about this movie.
