In this film, we are invited to observe the descent into the moral and emotional funk of someone who does not like to start. What was the point of making the film, then? To show that it would have been better not to have IN THE COLD BLOOD - a book I admire by the way - to preserve the integrity of our hero? Barely. He behaves at the festival at the beginning of the film in exactly the same way as after his triumphant reading of the book, its degradation is a matter of degree. Are we supposed to be sufficiently preoccupied with Capote to take seriously his claim that he and the murderer Perry Smith are close, the former having all the breaks while the latter had none? Mr. Capote's difficult situation did not affect me at all, I'm afraid, so if that was the central idea, it was ruined. But even if I could understand why the filmmakers visited this useless project on us, the clumsy narration would still bother me. Hoffman gives a performance of bravery without any emotional effects, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that I wanted to have more. Morne beyond belief.
