It is unfortunate that between this film, In the Valley of Elah, Lions for Lambs and Home of the Brave all seem to be based on common stereotypes about veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Alcoholic beverages, fights, short fuses, broken marriages, guys who panic and dig a foxhole in their garden when they are drunk, etc. etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Does this happen - yes, but not as often as you would think after watching one of these movies. I think it is unfortunate that these directors / producers / writers have chosen to grind their ax against the political establishment by describing the soldiers in such an atypical way. In this film, Kimberly Peirce did not even throw a bone at us, like showing new children who were born while a family member was deployed, or the child who grew up in a ghetto and can now pay for education through the GI Bill, or the couple who can afford a house, or start a business, earn citizenship, etc. etc. Instead, we are treated to stereotypes because the film's authors only want to show you the bad side. <br /> <br /> Some problems with the film itself: 1) someone messed up by placing Phillippe for a bronze star with V after leading his team into a narrow lane after being engineered by a shooter in a taxi. Pretty stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) the humvee did not have turret armor, so we are supposed to believe that this is almost the beginning of the war, yet each soldier and his brother have an ACOG and all the possible attachment for their M4? sorry, do not think so 3) Timothy Olyphant as a lieutenant-colonel? It's hard to believe, but I just checked that he was 40 in May, so it's not too late. 4) He strikes two soldiers to escape sending him to jail after declaring he would not return to Iraq (after learning he had been arrested-lost). So he is a fugitive. Then, when he finally gets to the end and they take him back, he keeps his rank and unfolds with the same unit? Sorry, I do not think so. <br /> <br /> I can only describe it as a giant stereotype of the army and the infantry. Some of the events described in this film happen to soldiers, yes. However, in this film, you get almost all the stereotypes in about 100 minutes, and things are not really like that for most returning soldiers. I hope the director wanted to do some research instead of starting with her agenda and then making a movie. <br /> <br /> Among the films I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best is probably Lions for Lambs, which is more a commentary on the sad state of the Y + generation than on the wars in Iraq. or in Afghanistan or the Bush administration. If you really want to watch this movie wait for the cable or Netflix, do not pay money directly to rent it.
