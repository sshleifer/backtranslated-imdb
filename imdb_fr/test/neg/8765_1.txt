This movie was terrible. The game was terrible. The script was awful. What was even worse were the pictures and the sound Half the time, the voices did not match the actors' lips, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different shades. The worst was when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building was to have 50 floors and probably 100 feet wide. However, when the actor was above in another plane, they had "recreated" the top of the building. The width of the building had been reduced to about eight feet wide. How can a building several hundred feet tall be eight feet wide? I know the film was low budget, but it's inexcusable. The film itself was only pushing ideas on a "kidnapping" then on a scenario or a point. This reduced the storyline to mere rubbish, with characters seeming to sell ideas in their lines rather than conveying emotions and moving the film in one direction. It was a total waste of time to watch. The film gives a bad name to Christians if it is one of the best Christian movies of the moment.
