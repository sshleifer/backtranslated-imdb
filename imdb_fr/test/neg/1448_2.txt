The Power began to be promising but soon became boring and tedious to watch. The plot concerns an old Aztec doll who takes possession of those who own it. The idea is "pretty decent" and this movie would have been pretty fun if it had been done better. However, after the first ten minutes or so, it quickly becomes boring; we do not have good death scenes and we have to listen to tons of talk. In the end, one of the possessed men meets his death by melting in front of two girls, but it is not very interesting and certainly not bloody. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend The Power to any horror or slasher. fan because there is little to draw.
