There were beautiful characters here, played by nice actors and actresses, plus a famous band and famous dancers ..... but the movie simply did not work. When it was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialogue was stupid, the humor (mostly that of Milton Berle) was downright stupid and the music just was not on my side. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big-band fan, anyway, and if I hear "In The Mood" again, I'll throw up. <br /> <br /> This was my first look at the famous actress-skater Sonja Henie and I'm not complaining about her. Almost part of the problem, at least as far as humor is concerned, is that it's so dated that it's not funny anymore. Berle, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Red Skeleton, Abbot & Costello, etc., were hilarious for the crowd of the 40s and 50s, but the humor changes, and what was funny at the time is not so today 'hui.
