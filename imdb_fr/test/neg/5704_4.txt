So much for JUDGE AND JURY, who lives up to its absurd title. What is it used for? The lighting is terribly foggy! Another horror movie you ask? Well, it's perfectly explainable. David Keith is actually pretty good at covering up clowns, bosses and other shenanigans, while being the killer who has escaped death row. But overall, despite some twists, it's pretty stupid. Unapix has recently produced ridiculous productions, and this is of little importance. We, the jurors, find this film guilty for its indecent exposure to many of us who sit around us, thinking it's a total waste of time!
