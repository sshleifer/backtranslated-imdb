Kathy Ireland: the body of a goddess, the face of an angel, the voice of a smurf. <br /> <br /> And the acting talent of a shovel full of calcite. If you do not believe me, look at this: "Alien from L.A." actually depends on her to play the 9/10 of the film! Of course, she finds herself in a pretty red bikini and a wrap-around skirt towards the end, but it's too little (so to speak) and too late. <br /> <br /> Seems Ireland plays the daughter of a renowned scientist who falls to the center of the earth to find him. On the way, she falls in love with a guy named Charmin (yes, like toilet paper - make your own jokes) and discovers how "Mad Max" refuses to live. Did you know that the inhabitants of the depths of the earth have Austrailian accents? Neither do I. <br /> <br /> It's bad (it was MST'd, after all) and also a Golan-Globus production, but after all, Ireland looks somehow lost, as if it was trying to find out where the photographers are so she could do a photo shoot instead. <br /> <br /> And I do not blame her. <br /> <br /> A star. And if you insist on watching this, do it with the sound off - record your eardrums.
