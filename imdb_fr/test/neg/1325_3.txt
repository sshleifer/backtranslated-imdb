I do not know, maybe I was not in the mood for that kind of movie, but it was full of mundane melodrama. It was too long and seemed at least slightly disjointed (okay, I did not pay all my attention ...). For a more entertaining description of the Battle of Stalingrad, see Enemy At The Gates. It is true that some pretentious will make fun of him because it is a Hollywood film and do not show "the harsh reality of the war" as this "wonderful foreign film" does, but it is more fluid and more fun to watch. In addition, there are already enough "rocky" artificial warfare movies, and this one seems to have been done by amateurs. But hey, you might like it, so go ahead! it just was not for me.
