This 2.5 hour diluted snoring festival seems to be one of the worst excuses for an adaptation ever experienced. Clearly having a breath-taking budget in Greece, the funds might have been better spent to develop a scenario consistent with character development and clearly defined motivations; Especially since Bill has already bothered to do it. the representations lacked passion and direction, leaving the viewer wondering if he should not worry about worrying about the protagonists' disappearance. which brings out another point: the main character of the original work, Prospero, is not so named in this interpretation, despite the fact that the names of most other characters are used. enchantment and magic are also clearly absent from this piece. in fact, all the aspects that made the theatrical version of the "storm" full of wonder and intrigue were completely eradicated from this complicated version of a pompous and absorbed donkey who does not know how to take care of anything at beyond the blur of his wealth and his power. on the whole, a mediocre effort at best and a brutally poor imitation of the desired inspiration.
