For me, Bollywood movies do not usually have much, although they are still wanted and Bollywood is a big file maker because they have their own fans. <br /> <br /> see how far an American actress could change or affect the logic on which the Indian film was based. Not only did it not change the film's story, but that assemblage also provoked a series of ridiculous events. movies. But as soon as such incidents occur in an American, it makes you laugh. For God's sake, can you believe that a famous American actress is stuck in a hopeless situation and feels helpless. Can you imagine an American actress falling in love with a dance teacher whose fianc√©e has already fallen in love with American's boyfriend and who met at the same time? There were many similar things to mention. the less we say, the better. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was wrong because I was expecting Indian Movies too much.
