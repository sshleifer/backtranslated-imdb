Dennis Quaid tries to prove that Jerry Lee Lewis was an idiot. And he's doing too much to prove it. The TV shows are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white movies. The music is good too, because Mr. Lewis himself sings. But the rest is just a Hollywood B-Movie style, with the Happy Days 50's. I think the only good thing about this movie is seeing the young Winona Ryder.
