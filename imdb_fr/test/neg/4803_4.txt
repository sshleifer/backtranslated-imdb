Although this is one of Tales of Voodoo Volume 1's two films, there is no voodoo or supernatural! The box names it "Hell Hole" but the title of the screen is Escape from Hell Hole. The title is confusingly similar to Hell Hole (1978), aka "Escape from Women's Hell Hole". A group of women bathing in a river and apparently, the worst thing they need to worry about is a voyeur, whom they easily master. No nudity in this scene or in any other scene, however. <br /> <br /> A woman named Cardena arrives in a car and seems to be known and appreciated by all women. She invites Indri to live in town with her and her uncle, Mr. G. Once they have arrived, it becomes clear that Mr. G. wants to take the virginity of Indri. Mr. G. runs a kind of brothel, either he is responsible for a corrupt branch of the military, is a paramilitary leader, or prefers his guards to wear military style uniforms. <br /> <br /> Women who refuse or who create problems are put in prison. Indri is sent there. Women are tortured and sometimes raped by the guards. <br /> <br /> Various unsuccessful attempts at escape or rescue are attempted, but inevitably fail, despite the obvious advantages women have: they far exceed the guards and relatively few guards have automatic weapons - most have semi-automatic rifles or handguns. <br /> <br /> WIP lovers can love it, and the fact that it was made in the Philippines gives it some novelty, but otherwise .. eh.
