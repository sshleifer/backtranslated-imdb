The killer begins in the rainforest of South America where captain Hawk (Casper Van Dien) and his men are attacked by a vampire gang. They can barely escape from their lives. Six months later, Hawk is called to see Colonel Weaver (Lynda Carter) who informs him that other vampires have been reported and that his ex-wife and god-daughter, Dr. Laurie Williams (Jennifer O'Dell ), went on an expedition to study beetles, she fears that she is asking Hawk to bring back a squad of soldiers to South America, and is officially doing service to Captain Grieves (Kevin Grevioux) and his men while seeking unofficially Laurie and not getting killed. by the vampires who decided to come out of the caves and in the civilized world ... <br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Kevin VanHook, this is another original Channel Sci-Fi of poor quality that not very good in all respects. The scenario without humor has nothing to envy to my knowledge. This is one of those modern vampire movies that decides to choose the rules of the "traditional" vampire movie tradition that he wants to use as these vampires can be killed with stakes across the heart and have fangs but can also walk freely in the sun and do not sleep in coffins. The film is moving at a reasonable pace, but it is very dull, bland and lifeless. The story is poor and just stupid enough, the characters are terrible, the dialogue is forgettable and there is very little to recommend here. Slayer also tries to convey an ecological message, because the leader of the vampire says that he is only beginning to kill human beings because of the systematic destruction of the rainforest where they lived in secret for centuries. Unfortunately, no one is convinced there. a disposable line to fill the time a serious statement. There is not enough operational content and is a rather unsatisfactory way to spend 90 minutes of your time. The producers do not even do anything with the jungle scenery, I did not expect Predator (1987) but I was hoping for a little more than that. <br /> <br /> The director VanHook has made several horror films, all of which I'm sorry for, but he does not do anything here and shoot in a film looking and feeling completely forgettable. There is no atmosphere or tension and for genuine fears, forget it. The blood is tight, there are bites on the neck and some blood on the gun, but it's nothing we've seen before or that has a lot of impact. There is also a huge Vampire monster creature at the end, but it does not look impressive and it kills all too easily. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of about $ 2,000,000, this amount had a decent size of money spent on it, but it's still a waste film, it's reasonably well done but nothing special or memorable. The acting is nothing, I'm sorry but that's how I saw things. <br /> <br /> Slayer is yet another poor, stupid & boring movie for the Sci-Fi channel that I simply can not recommend. . Not to be confused with The Slayer (1982), a rather British gore of "Video Nasty", which is 100 times better than this one, so follow it and watch it instead.
