There are no - no qualities that buy this movie. They did not check a single fact - not a single subject. I'm sorry for Larry Miller, and even more so for his agent to be no more able to find him a more appropriate place. <br /> <br /> Adults are all idiots. The effects are tacky and devoid of any sense of reality. The music is honestly old-fashioned. The plot is amazing. <br /> <br /> I want to see something good with your family, nothing else. Take the time to check for mold in your attic. My 10-year-old son makes fun of this movie by watching him. He unfortunately learns that not all movies are worth watching.
