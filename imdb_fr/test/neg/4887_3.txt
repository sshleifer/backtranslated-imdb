I bought this one for a few dollars at the local video store because they emptied their tapes for DVDs. I doubt they replace this one, one way or another. <br /> <br /> I can not say it's one of the worst films I've ever seen, but it's very boring. No real cannibal scenes. Me Me Lai is not enough naked time (only 4 or 5 times). And she is not the Thai goddess I expected. Two of the reasons I watched this movie have been eliminated. <br /> <br /> There is serious animal abuse among those who love this kind of thing. A big fight between a mongoose and a big snake becomes pretty bloody. Animal torture, both real and false. Fortunately, the fake is a bit funny, but the real is just a little disgusting. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a 70s movie - too long, underdeveloped, not as deep as it would have liked to be. . But it's something different, right? ONE AND HALF STARS!
