If you want to experience a truly traumatic experience, then this horrible film (if you plan to call it that) is for you. A movie worse than the postman, sizzle Beach USA, Batman and Robin, Kazaam, the fair game ... that's what I understand. the worst film ever made. I hope that Troma or someone in America will distribute it, so that the United States can experience the French stench at its true value.
