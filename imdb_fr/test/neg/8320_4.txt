The Brave One seems to indicate that the main character, of course, is brave. I do not agree. The bravest thing to do in a situation like this - to be brutally beaten with a fianc√©e who does not live later - is to pursue criminals without resorting to a totally distorted view of society. Jodie Foster's character, Erica, is a radio personality whose niche is to walk the streets and record what's going on. We were not given much depth except "she had someone she loved, he died, the police do not pursue him, she has a gun, yada-yada-yada, she is a little but not really involved with the main detective "In the character, there was something old movies: the code of justice for vigilante, which is to take power alone. But we're never sure if Erica is sane or not, if filmmakers take a stance in one way or another (it's all the way to the end, which is such a stupid message to take when same, dog included as a dominant metaphor), while making today's New York City, which has become much safer than it was twenty years ago, appears to be hit by a knife or to be beat if you go down the right lane or sit alone on a subway. <br /> <br /> There could even be a little better film in the middle of it all - maybe just in the undercooked sub-plot with Terence Howard's detective, who is involved in a battle for the custody of a child who is not his and of a woman who has no connection with a father-in-law who, I do not know what, apart from owning parking lots and being a bad type but we are left to a scenario that is both rigorous and disjointed in logic. It becomes laughable, for example, to see in the beginning the logical side of Erica unable to shoot properly, as seen when he was first shot in a convenience store at the opportune moment of the armed robbery of the husband by his wife, and then giving way to the illogical of his shot fired at a pimp driving a car in front of her and killing him and dodging just in time not to get crushed It does nothing to help that Jordon's style with the camera becomes a bit more unbearable: it's called a stedi-cam for a * reason *, and not because it can come in and out. <br /> Ironically, The scenario and staging become very good, or rather work best in the desired circumstances: when you look at the underbelly beat scene, caught between a point of view recorded by one of the criminals and recorded by the film's traditional camera a rhythm that is perfectly exotic. And when Erica returns for the first time to her radio show, she hangs trying to do her old shtick, and expresses herself with all her heart to say how scared she is - this scene, of Foster's performance at the clear direction and the script, is the best scene of the film. But besides that, there are many postures in a psychology that is fragile: is she a De Niro in Taxi Driver or a Bronson in Death Wish? We have her narration on scenes, some scenes have nothing to do with her radio show, but she is disgusted to walk at night. She has nothing to do with her, but she has to clean the streets. But unlike Death Wish, a more ambiguous film that never ends up giving an answer in a scenario of revenge, the path of endless violence just takes into account a message, which will not be new to those who have seen a second of Lifetime melodrama of the film of the week. <br /> <br /> The actors are satisfied with what is given to them, and in the end it becomes much more frustrating to try to stay with what is anticipated, the old plot, and the old inexplicable plain ( plus the involuntary hilarious, like some expletives shouted by Howard after being shot in a scene), and the temptation to go out gets stronger and stronger. This is a very problematic picture, with only a few moments of genuine interest and a turnaround at the clairvoyant convention.
