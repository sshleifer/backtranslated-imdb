Inconsistent Suite (.. the absurd idea of ​​placing the killer snowman on an island where there is neither snow nor cold weather) brings back the spirit of the psychopath, returning through a scientific experiment providing foreign elements that reintroduce life to its molecules (... it's the best I could do to explain this absurd concept). <br /> <br /> I could explain in depth how he travels to the island to kill many tourists, but I just find no reason to bother you because it would be so exhausting. Anyway, the filmmakers think it's wise to kill the pretty girls not less than ten minutes after their arrival (I mean seriously, why worry about presenting them to us if we can not enjoy anymore of our pleasure of the eyes ?!). <br /> <br /> The scene of the murder of "the anvil of snow" takes the cake. Ice cubes protrude on the sand of the beach to allow the victim to fall. Oh, and another girl is stabbed with a pair of Weenie tongs. <br /> <br /> Listen, I understand what I'm going to know when I sit down to watch a movie killer snowmen .. such a supernatural slasher ridiculed your funnybone ("Oh, it's a movie of wonderfully cheesy horror!) or do you wonder why you are wasting time with such nonsense? Jack Frost has the power to freeze water (so how could they melt it in the first movie?) And cause snow on the island. In one sequence, Jack froze the pool water, covering a swimming pattern under the sheet, the result being his drowning with nowhere to escape.Oh, there is also a reenactment of the "stuck tongue to The Ice Bar "from the movie The Christmas Story (" Cowatonga dude! "). <br /> <br /> I have to give it to the cast, however..they are real soldiers trying to make this content miserable and entertaining. Christopher Allport (.. maybe recklessly) comes back as Sam, to face his old enemy, as does Eileen Seeley, as a woman. The attempts at ironic humor (at least for me) have fallen flat, but the soldiers of the distribution trying to make the most of a very difficult situation, with enthusiastic performances, they strive to overcome the pitiful places. and deplorable dialogue. <br /> <br /> A development occurs that increases the danger for those who are still struggling with Jack, its genetically modified water molecules, thanks to the introduced foreign elements, allowing it to resist freezing coolants, and, worse yet, he can now reproduce ... by indigestion, Jack hackers what appear to be snowballs that hatch to reveal small snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! The killer snowman costume and the little snowball puppets presented later in the film could give rise to belly laughs if you fancy such shenanigans, but I personally found this rather hokey junk (.. This is the goal behind, I suppose, cheap guffaws The offspring of the snowball is an obvious tribute to Gremlins where we have a bar scene where little bastards celebrate in numbers after terrorizing the victims of the station. The weapon against them..bananas! It is explained that when Jack went to kill Sam in the first movie, they both fell into a truckload filled with antifreeze (.. an ice cube emerging from Jack's belly was entering Sam's chest when he pushed them out of the window, and I suppose that by being "bound" by the ice cube, Jack inherited Sam's banana allergy, that's what we're led to believe !) and, in so doing, " ionized "in a sense. <br /> <br /> Whew, such a film defies any simple explanation. It is a movie with effects and a plot so terrible that the presentation can be nice because of its many failures.
