All the while, I thought, "Oh my God, why!" At the beginning, I said to myself "yes, it may be average", but the acting and the plot were mostly atrocious. <br /> <br /> Each part was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed great resemblance to the ring, it was a half-decent film, but it seemed to take all that was good for the first and make them terrible. Some pieces have made everyone in the audience get wet, for example. The part where Geller falls from the building broke me. My girlfriend had to keep telling me to calm down, I kept commenting on what was going to happen, and more often than not, I was right. <br /> <br /> Why enter the house does it come after you it does not make sense. It was a sorry excuse for many murders and no depth was found. <br /> <br /> You can see everything that's coming, which has left you feeling that it's useless to watch them. Oh shes behind her ... I did not see this one coming * yawning *. <br /> <br /> These people have surely thought about ... oh I do not know, wears a knife or at least try to fight, instead of being eaten but someone's hair? At best, during the movie, I was very scared (and I say nicely), I was screaming for the credits, as they rolled, I exhaled a short "Oh, my god." If you have not already done so, do not waste your time and money in this area. useless, plot less, excuse sorry for a sequel!
