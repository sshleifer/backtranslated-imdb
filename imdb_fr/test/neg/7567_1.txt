If I could give this movie less than 1, I would certainly do it. I had read a review of this film in the LA Times and found myself in front of the theater and remembered the criticism. My wife and I were playing and we thought it could not be as bad as the reviewer said - you know the critics. Of course ... Give me a break with the horrible acting, the horrible camera work, the misuse of the budget (which has been mentioned many times as an excuse). I worked on movies with smaller budgets 100 times better. It's the director and the producer who make the movies work - they choose the teams. That's all. If they do not put it together and do not make it work, it just will not be the case. So they did not do it - and that's not the case. I do not think they can ... I just have to take the time to write this review ... even though I'm sure the film crew does not like this review - I hope I make you a service with I wish you to do well, but in another career. Good luck.
