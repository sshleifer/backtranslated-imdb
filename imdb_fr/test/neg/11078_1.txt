First of all, let me say that those of you who voted "10" make fun of yourself and try to get votes of a respectable level ... what this film does not deserve. (The only films that deserve a 10 IMO are the classics ... Godfather, Shawshank, etc. Look at the top rated movies of all time for the full list.) I also noticed that a lot of people have cast a vote positive for their realism. as for what it is in a cave. Although I agree with them about the surroundings, they simply do not consider the film as a whole ... they are enticed by the surroundings but miss the opinion as a whole. It would be like I was voting a 10 for the movie "From Justin to Kelly" because I think the beach scenes remind me of what it looks like in the Florida Keys ... While this may be true, it does not deserve the movie 10 because the film as a whole was rancid. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you that something saved this movie, as usual if something stinks in a horror movie, something else gets up or catches up with weakness. (Ex. - The bad actors are overshadowed by a beautiful plot and / or camera work and great scenery.) We started the DVD and it all started pretty normally. Jokingly, we started to choose who would be the first to die ... After a short drive and hike, they set up their camp for the night. At that time, I touched on some things that really brought me to the rest of the film. I had two main problems: bad effects and an even worse story. The first thing we all noticed was that the campfires were not real ... you can clearly see the "cgi" or fake flames they were all sitting at. For a horror film to have such an obvious flaw, it would have been necessary to tell me what I was in the next hour. <br /> <br /> Only a few minutes later, I was shown how badly this film was written. I do not remember exactly how they got there, but basically we find out that the "Nerd Token" is writing a book about cave exploration, and so on. Another member of the group wants to tell a story about an experiment, but hesitates stating "I do not want this story in your book." The author convinces and persuades the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he will be able to trust it. (A direct quote: "If I tell you this story, you will certainly want it in your book.") At this point, I was expecting a great story of more than 5 minutes, with some backtracking and sincere actor. What I got is a short statement, misquoted (and misinterpreted). I say statement because what he ended up saying was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I do not remember the exact quotes, but he basically says: "We were in a cave, the cave flooded, a girl died while our friend was watching her drowning." You may think that I'm exaggerating too much and that I'm really critical, but it's not far from a line-by-line direct quote from the movie scene. <br /> <br /> In the next 50 minutes or so, the film takes place in the cave and although the lighting is what I imagine to be in a cave, I really could have looked away very fuzzy / fuzzy on the movie, and the camera shake is one of those I have not known how to go for. (I have a very good vision and after watching the main parts of the film, I felt legally blind.) I was emotionally detached from this film, so the parts that probably should have been scary did not were not. Maybe if I had been able to forget the very slow and badly done debut of this movie, I would have been scared at least, but I do not remember anyone in the dark room that even trembled in any of the scenes. 'action". <Br/> <br /> The last scene is probably the one I will never forget, and it's not a good thing. Basically, two women are trapped naked in a room. The "monster" enters to attack / kill the women ... he is arrested when he sees a picture of a little boy. A flashback occurs when we discover that the "monster" was wounded in his childhood and spent his whole life in the cave. Back in the present day, he takes his "mask" (a big skeleton with what appears to be a deerskin shirt). He takes a look at the picture and the two women seem to have found the weakness / weakness of the caveman. At that moment, he stabs and kills one girl before raping the other woman, graphically enough. After about 30 seconds of watching the camera shake and shake as he rapes her, launches the credits, the movie is over. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if I had to do everything and lose money by renting this movie, I could have kept myself an hour and watched the first scene and the last scene of this movie and stay with the same ideas as me about it. <br /> <br /> Those of you who compare this to Blair Witch are like that If ... some of you had read how the director and the writer directed Blair's filming, he would realize how revolutionary he was ... giving each actor a scenario the day / night he was shooting without the other actors knowing what The other actor was a genius. <br /> <br /> If IMDb allowed me, he would get a negative score ... I do not understand how a sensible person can recommend this movie.
