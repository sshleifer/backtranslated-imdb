Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 bottle of wine - without any substance to start with and that only gets worse with age. This film proves that it is completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his last film and that his serious lack of success will reduce his chances of obtaining funding for future companies. It's right up there with "Lightning Jack" and "The Pattersons Save the World" as the most abominable example of Australian comedy imaginable. As it is tragic that with many talents of actors infinitely superior in Australia, Yahoo is offered such vehicles to express its style of childish comedy. And think: he was 7 years old to offer the script. True genius!
