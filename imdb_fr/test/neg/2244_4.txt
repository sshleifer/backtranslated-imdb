The first half of this movie was pretty good. It was interesting and suspenseful. The second half was pretty bad. The story of the revenge of comics has been completed and we see many Nazi characters who make comics and "bad guys" abused who win. There is a lot of violence in this film. I'm not kidding about violence but I think it should at least have some utility in a movie. The violence here was of little interest, except to create a genre film in which we see a lot of people being mowed with rifles. We are supposed to be amused by this. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Reservoir Dogs. There was a movie where violence was used effectively. It was realistic in the world created by the film. There has never been an excessive sound effect. It was a detective film that played it directly. Inglorious Basterds should have played straight, but did not do it. I looked up at how the violence was exaggerated with extra sound effects and bullets to the head and face. <br /> <br /> No story of one of the Basterds is really explained either, they are simply Nazi hunters. We do not like them either because they are too busy cutting the scalp and shooting people in the face. It's about "revenge" and very little else. <br /> <br /> It took two and a half hours to work here, but few Basterds were really examined in depth. It seems to be just a revenge movie pure and simple. We saw this in Tarantino's latest film, "Death Proof", which I did not like either. He suffered the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable. <br /> <br /> Once again, the first half was pretty good. I wanted to see the exploits of Inglorious Basterds across Europe. I was presented with a much more telling film about the resistance movement preparing for revenge against comic Nazis who are all going to a French film premiere.
