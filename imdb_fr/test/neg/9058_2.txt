ARMED AND DANGEROUS is not one of John Candy's greats. This film about a licensed cop who ends up working for a small crowd-managed security system is very weak and is not really a comedy. I liked certain moments, like watching Candy in a pilot suit, but that does not seem to matter much. ARMED AND DANGEROUS is still a dangerously disappointing rat presented by the director of the equally stupid COMMANDO actor. What a sad excuse for a comedy! <br /> <br /> 1 of 5
