This film was a thorough appointment. There was no development of history. Viewers were thrown into the story without explanation and left to their own devices to try to understand what was going on. The action sequences were correct but confusing. They were not The Matrix and they were not Crouching Tiger. It is better to leave this movie on cable TV without having to pay to see it or to convince a friend that he should rent it, then go watch it. As a big fan of Jet Li, I was expecting more. How can a person involved in Once Upon a Time in China put his name on it ???
