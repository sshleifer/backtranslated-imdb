This miserable psychodrama uses every used device of the book to attract the attention and the sympathy on our part for its characters who, with one exception, are not worth to be noticed, not to mention two precious hours of the time of the cinephiles. <br /> <br /> As in "The Ordinary People" by Robert Redford (a superb film that, in comparison, clearly shows the emptiness of "Heroes"), a dead teenager has died, leaving his family in the throes of mourning. In this case, the death was a suicide, an event that almost always poisons the emotional well of the survivors in a particularly corrosive way. We follow these people over the next 8 or 9 months. <br /> <br /> The father (Jeff Daniels) becomes a retired man, practically dumb, usually drunk steep and secretly given permission to leave work for months. park bench all day, and insists on placing a plate full of food at the deceased son's for each meal. He treats all members of the family with unfailing malice. He sees his doctor regularly, but the question of therapeutic intervention in his obviously dysfunctional state never arises. <br /> <br /> The mother (Sigourney Weaver) shouts after the neighbor, among others, is bursting when she stupidly tries to buy "marijuana" (her term) in a specialized store (which adult would actually try a stuntman too) stupid?) and, towards the end, sink into a coma with a lung disease that everyone in the theater assumes as a cancer (she a fat smoker). Mrs. Weaver has a few flips but generally behaves in a way that is too unintelligent to deserve a lot of empathy. <br /> <br /> It's not that there are no people who behave stupidly when extremely stressful circumstances occur. But why make a movie of such a drivel? What can we learn from driving this pair? <br /> <br /> The deceased's older sister (Michelle Williams) is absent from college and too happy to distance herself from the family zoo. The younger brother (played by Emile Hirsch) is the only credible member of the family. His suffering is genuine, his causes are multiple and his behavior is consistent with the circumstances. But Hirsch's character is too sweet, too gloomy and downcast to carry the movie. The other actors, subtle and cute, the unreal dialogue does not help. <br /> <br /> The theme of suicide is evoked almost nonchalantly in the case of two other minor characters. So, what does the author-director, Dan Harris, try to say on this subject? That it does not matter? Why did Jeff Daniels agree to play the sap of a father as this scenario says, only his therapist could possibly answer that question? Avoid this dog. Rent the classic Redford instead. My rating: 4/10 (C-). (Seen the 17/02/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message about how to get to my websites.
