I especially rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this movie, but the plot was nil. The film was not really about staying single after signing a pact when one of Jerry O'Connell's friends gets married. The other friends who raised this money and who is the last to get married get the money ($ 10,000) from all their friends. Anyway, the movie just tries to follow by doing nothing and trying to make it funnier than doing it since then. I'm glad I only paid $ 50.50 for this movie. It really was not good at all. I rated it **** on 10 stars!
