This film is sometimes scary, maybe no more than when a naked George Kennedy tells his girlfriend that he wants a little more sugar. Fortunately, his nakedness is covered with a blanket, but the picture is always more horrible than anything you might find in, for example, Schindler's List. <br /> <br /> The dialogue of this film was inspiring; it inspired me to watch another movie. In one scene, when a flight attendant makes a remark about the male pilots, Kennedy asks, "Why do you think this is called a" cock pit "?" Charming. <br /> <br /> And yes, contrary to what some have written, this film is really very bad.
