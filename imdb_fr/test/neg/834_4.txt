Unlike other spaghetti westerns, this one has characters that almost make sense and can be identified to some degree. He still has the clumsy gun game of other spaghetti westerns. Spaghetti, by the way, is another word for a Westerner without intrigue, without characters that you can interest you, and a clumsy shooting game that does not make sense for the time and that is based on the good music to make the audience feel something. . This one is lighter, like the ones Bud Spencer and Terence Hill did together. They too were superior to the junk done by Eastwood and others, which the sadomasochists have their friends watch for, if they have the chance. Looks like everyone had a lot of fun doing the movie too. It was good to see a giant actor like Gilbert Roland, who was not even mentioned in the movie rental box, but who was clearly the biggest name. His character was very nice. There is a stalemate at the end at the end, which is much higher than the one she is being played on (the good, the bad and the ugly), simply because the characters are at least a bit friendly and a little identifiable. This is not a good movie, but it amuses him a little.
