It's "realism"? If Rivette was trying to give us a ground study of a woman at a particular place and time and how she was able to influence (and was influenced by) the world around her, he failed miserably. Especially because we never understand why thousands of men would have followed her in combat. There is certainly not enough exposure on the cultural / historical context to define the country's need for such a savior and, God knows, there is nothing particularly charismatic about Joan as it is presented here. Unless the wooden postures and readings of Bonnaire's flat lines are supposed to indicate a transcendent faith and determination. The use of the landscape is particularly devoid of inspiration. We never lose the feeling of watching twentieth-century actors wander into a supposedly medieval landscape. And as for battle scenes (which, contrary to what some commentators claim, represent 15% of the screen), they look like history clubs at your local high school that recreate a medieval seat, although children probably put more passion into it. However, I will give Rivette the credit of having imagined a side of Joan left behind by other films: that of a petulant, na√Øve and narcissistic teenager (played too clearly by a woman at least twice the age of the character that she is supposed to play). to depict) obviously unable to understand its place in the movement it helps to create or the existing world outside of its own passions. Joan's indignation against her own sworn soldiers who are astonished by the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience to her are shocking, spontaneous and credible notes (you suddenly realize that such moments have naturally taken place ) in a historical "representation", otherwise insignificant. Unfortunately, they are also used to indicate precisely what is not on the screen - what made Joan SPECIAL? I must say that I also continued to be perplexed and frustrated by some foreign moviegoers who associate boredom and lack of dramatic involvement in the areas of "art" and "seriousness". Does this film really increase our understanding or our involvement in the subject? Or with anything else? 4/10.
