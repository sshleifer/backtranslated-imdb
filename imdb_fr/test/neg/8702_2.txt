I realize it's very difficult to live up to the first movie of The 10 Commandments (which was great and I was not a fan of Charleton Heston personally), but wow ... this film / miniseries was disappointing. Even the animated Prince of Egypt was better. <br /> <br /> The only thing that knocked me down was Ramses. Compared to the version of Yul Brynner, the version of Paul Rhys seemed so weak and so unlike Pharoh. The acting was really not good. For a modern adaptation, I was expecting something better. It did not look as amazing as the first one. I guess they worked on a tight budget or something. There is an occasional voice-over narrator that I found strange and useless. It also interrupted the course of history. And uh ... the voice / lines of God were a little weird.
