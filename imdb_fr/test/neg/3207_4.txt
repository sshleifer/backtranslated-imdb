I had not seen this movie for years. Last time, I was really drunk after five liters of tenant at Witherspoon, but I thought it was pretty awful. this film is quite terrible compared to other critters, the first two were pretty good, 3 was pretty bad but better than those. The story takes place 53 years after the author's third birthday. Charlie, the bounty hunter of previous films, is found floating in a gondola in outer space by a team of miners, space folks, and taken aboard. Once on board the last creature eggs left in the galaxy that Charlie brought with him from Earth, we have critters aboard the spaceship, report a real 'Alien' scam and a lot of terrible FX effects and have you this film in a few words. the only good thing is that when we are introduced again to UG (or so we are led to believe it), who is now a villain and who wants to preserve the critters instead of destroying them
