This is the result of the city of Milpitas, California, who made a film at home and submitted the rest of the world. Legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey, this movie is rightly considered a bad movie. At once comical and monstrous horror film, this film is full of non-actors who do not act. the plot has something to do with a giant monster created from garbage and pollution in the area and raging. The monster, which we will not see before the last 20 minutes, is pretty cool but is not cool enough to warrant looking at the previous boredom. Frankly, even hardcore moviegoers will have a hard time going all the way. This is a stinker.
