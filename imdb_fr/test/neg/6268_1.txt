Do you hear this sound? It is the sound of H.G. Wells rocking in his grave, between this version and Spielberg's film abortion, it was a difficult year for the classic novel. But at least Steven had a few things compared to this crapperella. Hello, the ships were not big insects, they had names. They were tripods and the extraterrestrials worked in threes. Ships and extraterrestrials were all wrong, you can not really see the aliens until the end. Effects and distribution work well. But these actors are much better than this "film" the merit. The bulk of the film, if not all, is the character of Howell who questions the devastation, meeting a person, they join and he loses for one reason or another. There are no more than two people on the camera at one point, but most of the film. It's like they're filming three movies at a time, the movie would be over budget or something like that. So Fat is the only possible adaptation of the history of WAR OF THE WORLDS: the GEORGE PAL version goes back to the 1950s. THE BLACK HOLE.
