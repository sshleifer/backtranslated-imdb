It's a comedy / romance film directed by Andy Tennant, starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Kevin James. <br /> <br /> This is a professional dating physician, Will Smith, nicknamed "Hitch", who helps men to meet currently women with whom they are interested. He is currently helping a shapely and awkward Albert, obsessed with a very powerful, famous and rich woman called Allegra. At the same time, Hitch is interested in a gossip columnist, Sara, Eva Mendes, writing on Allegra. When Sara's best friend has an amorous disillusionment with a man who, according to Sara, is a Hitch client, she takes revenge on Hitch and the misunderstanding causes both couples in a conflict situation. he has a lot of male bashing and hates both subtle and blatant. There are also double standards that should be blind not to detect. Hitch and Sara are both very protected from the opposite sex. Hitch still loves women despite the burns he has suffered in the past and teaches men how to make them happy. But of course, Sara is a sexist bigot who makes frequent sexist comments like "men want to have sex with everything that works". Shes is obsessed with herself and knows she looks like a goddess and knows there are no "real men" on the market. What annoyed me most was the "bad guy" who wanted to escape Sara's best friend, who is the classic example of a defenseless "victim" who, even after being physically rejected by Hitch, gets Sara's pill shot, after which she says, "Now I'm satisfied." Add to that the waves of Allegra's "still oppressed women" who are not allowed to spend their own money after asking permission from a men's table. Despite all the assumptions and generalizations of garbage - Can women always say when you are not honest with them? - This film has the good point that in America, love just does not exist. There are fun parts in this film, like Albert and his dancing habits, but overall, this movie beats very little the terrible movie Honey.
