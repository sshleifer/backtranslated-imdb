I do not come from America, I usually watch this show on AXN, I do not know why this respected channel broadcasts this program in the prime time slot. Jerry Bruckheimer, the money bank in Hollywood, this time he is spending a lot of money on the small screen. In each episode, a group of people with two team members move from one country to another for a large sum of money; where film crews shoot their travels. I do not know who gave this stupid idea for the show. There is nothing to watch for, in every episode where we see people running like beggars, sometimes screaming, crying, beeping, jerky camera work ... but it's dangerous for the eyes and ears. The most disgusting part of the race is that viewers finally know that each of the team members can not enjoy their racing / travel experience. Even if, to add the ratings, the producers had the idea to include Gays in a show, a real American reality show. <br /> <br /> Nothing to watch, it is better to switch to another channel. <Br /> <br /> The Amazing Race = The disgusting show.
