A ridiculous film in which two university graduates move to California and one of them becomes a movie star and the other his manager. <br /> <br /> On the eve of 10 years, the popularity of the star will decrease, so it is decided that there will be a television show where women will compete for her affection. <br /> <br /> The film is odious and ridiculous. The girls fighting over the boy are ridiculed. Only one girl seems to be the choice of the producer of the series. She is really an amateur against some of the other women, but she is healthy and also brings good marks to the show. <br /> <br /> In the third scene, you realize that the manager is cracking for her. We know that Ryan was really supposed to be single. Although the end is a little cute, you really know where this was going.
