Many things can usually be forgiven in period pieces that ask us to recall important historical events and spice them up with enough love to keep the story going. BATTLE OF THE BRAVE tackles the 18th century struggle for control of Quebec (all of Canada) between the British and the French through columns constituting the New America. It has the appearance of an epic of fascination, but unfortunately in the hands of the writer Pierre Billon (whose scenario deserves a Razzie prize for the worst of the season) and the dispersed, fuzzy and confusing direction of Jean Beaudin, this film is a failure. - a tedious movie for two and a quarter hours. <br /> <br /> Even a cast of talented actors - pairing Noémie Godin-Vigneau as Marie-Loup Carignan with David The Hague in the role of François le Gardeur, adding Bianca Gervais for Acoona, the venerable Gérard Depardieu for priest Thomas Blondeau, Irene Jacob, Vincent Perez (ridiculous in vintage wigs), Tim Roth for William Pitt, Colm Meaney for Benjamin Franklin and Jason Isaacs for General James Wolfe - does not help. Such veteran actors like these must have cracked before the raw lines written for their characters! Cover the mess in a musical score by Patrick Doyle and the result is a long film to avoid. Sad to say such bad things on an expensive project, but be warned ... Grady Harp
