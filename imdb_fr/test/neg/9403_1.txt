This is by far the worst film that Al Pacino could have played. The film had no real plot. He takes care of 24 different directions. It seems that the target audience of this film is composed of anonymous player. The character of Matt Mcconaughey is not credible enough to be Pacino's protégé. So he won some bets for some degenerate customers as a sideline to a crappy job recording on a 900 service. Is this supposed to automatically convince an audience of his skills? It was just stupid to think of. The trailer promised to show us how he made his choices, but after watching the entire movie, I have not yet seen what skill he had ever had. If you want skills, try to look at Robert de Niro's character in Casino now, it's showmanship. At one point in the film, Mat's character chooses his winning bets in a jiffy. Everyone can do that. Al Pacino seems to talk a lot and I mean mouth blabber in your face dialogue. I think that style started with Scent of a Woman and worked for him because he finally won an Oscar, but now I think it's just irritating. It seems to be always sermon. It is a nasty act to portray a man suffering from unstable angina (an impending heart attack), which usually reminds him of his role in Godather, Part 3, in which he plays the corleone donation of the aging and diabetic mafia, but Pacino's talent is wasted. movie. René Russo is a pure delight for this film. She has kept the shape and shows it in the tight clothes she wears everywhere. This film is shit. Do not waste your money on it. It's way worse than choosing the character of Mats in the movie.
