One word can describe MR MAGOO - slapstick. Unfortunately, it's not a plane. Looks can decieve, and that's exactly what MR MAGOO does. Based on the old cartoon, Leslie Nielson embodies Magoo, a blind blind man who falls on a pair of jewelery thieves. Now he has to hunt them down using ... essentially blindness. And that's all this movie plays. The blindness of MR MAGOO. Now, maybe they've had jokes about it, but that's about all that one of those "silly smiles on the face because you're too ashamed to admit that you've paid for see this ". <br /> <br /> But Mr. Magoo is not as bad as he was hacked. There are at least some funny jokes, and it's a fun treat for the whole family (Nielson has tried to create a "NAKED GUN" for families in MAGOO, but it's not that good). So see him once, you might hate him, you could love him, whatever. Personally, I did not hate him, but I did not like him, nor even judged him "in agreement". 2/5 stars for MR MAGOO- <br /> <br /> JOHN ULMER
