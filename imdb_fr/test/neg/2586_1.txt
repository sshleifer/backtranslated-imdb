I saw this movie last night and went online especially to see if others found it as terrible as me. <br /> <br /> Certainly, some people see in this movie a lot of things that I have not seen, so you are one of those people, all right - good luck to you. But I am a patient person. I already liked very long movies. But it was an exercise of torture for me. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I felt like it was one of those movies with little to say and it was more about style than substance, but style too, m made me want to tear my hair. Almost everything that is interesting during the film is off screen. It's like a deliberate attempt to make a movie entirely from shots - items that would typically be reserved for the deleted scenes section of a DVD, if they were shown to the public. <br /> <br /> You do not do it. I did not even have time to discover anything about the main character, Fran√ßois. I have no sympathy for any of the characters in this film, except perhaps the violinist & his goat and the old man who believes that octopuses live up to 300 because they are really intelligent. Seriously, I was excited about the shot of Francois holding a gun in his head. I felt so scammed that even her inevitable suicide turned out to be boring. <br /> <br /> Oh, and where was the editor? To smoke opium too? I swear, I shouted almost every time I was subjected to a prolonged blow of absolutely nothing happened, except perhaps someone who was pacing, then FINALLY, there would be a very abrupt cut to the Next scene, and it would be ONE YEAR and we lost everything that interested us was going on at the same time, and everyone was ALWAYS wearing the same clothes BLOODY ....!?!? !! ??? <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, if you liked - great. But this criticism is intended to serve as an antidote to the fantasy "you will love this movie if you like cinema" that I have seen posted here and elsewhere. (You see, I hated the movie and still included a sneaky reference to its content!)
