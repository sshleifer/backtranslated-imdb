It's a poor, poor movie. Full of shots, unrealistic moments: spice up the air in the celebrations after turning off the fire, no matter if someone lost his house and his belongings !!, announcing a pregnancy in a bar with all his comrades before you say in private first, walk on the roof of a building in flames for no apparent reason, the stereotypical funeral and strained relations, the dreary and old-fashioned music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl rescued from her apartment, the very unrealistic explosion of this same apartment! ! Did they have some oxygen tanks in the attic or something like that !! Anyone with an ounce of wit can see that this movie was a joke. Too bad, because firefighters do a great job and deserve to make a good movie about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.
