Is this a pile of waste mismanaged, clich√©? Of course. Those who do not realize that when they pick up the box in the video store, probably do not have the right to judge the movies at the start. Thus, I will now note the aspects of the film that really interest us on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Violence and violence: 4 - For this genre, there are very few deaths, and the Gore is almost nonexistent. Anyone looking for some blood should probably go elsewhere. The only quality that redeems is the fact that children do these horrible things, which raises the bar a bit. <br /> <br /> Suspense: 1 - Well, I feel bad for those who are scared by this trio of dorky looking kids. <br /> <br /> Nudity / Sex: 7 - Many breasts from three different women, one of whom is MTV vj Julie Brown. There are two sex scenes, but they are poorly represented. <br /> <br /> Involuntary Humor - 4 - There are some good laughs with kids trying to scare, but all in all, it's just bad, not funny, bad. <br /> <br /> Overall - 4 - It's not unassailable. There are some fun moments and enough nudity to keep your attention throughout the movie. However, only watch this movie if you are a big fan of 80s slasher films. This is certainly at the bottom of the ladder, but it's not all the way down. The real disadvantage is the disappointing end. It almost ruined the film for me.
