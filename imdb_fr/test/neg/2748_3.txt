Before I saw this movie, I had heard negative comments about it. However, when I looked at it, I thought, "Okay, it's a little slow, but it's quite interesting." As it was constructed, it created a complex moral dilemma leading to a shocking and yet shocking decision with extremely serious dramatic consequences. If this had been followed, it would have been an extremely powerful end and would have given me a very favorable impression of the film. <br /> <br /> However, because of an end that does not only emotionally burst, on a useless happy ending without real emotional credibility, but also in the context of the film makes absolutely no sense because you clearly see one of the characters taking a step that should end his life, but inexplicably. Incidentally, please tell me if I miss something here and there is a reason why she survives because I could not understand how she could logically have this, which ruined me . <br /> <br /> That said, All three lead powerful performances, although the transformation of Kevin McKidd's characters ends up going a step further than is completely convincing and creates a very powerful ethical triangle. <br /> <br /> This film is recommended if you are preparing. go out when the mother and sister are lying on the bed. But look no further than that unless you have only a pinch, but several mountains of salt.
