Oh, how horribly this movie! I do not know if it's a horror movie or a drama, because the story and the two genres are not very well established! The story does not move, it's slow, boring and sleepy from start to finish. This movie really bores me! But I really liked the work of the camera, it is authentic, fresh and clear, the acting is great too, the little boy was the great performer of this movie, but it did not make me leave my square. But this film makes me take a pillow, lie on the bed and sleep until the credits roll ... <br /> <br /> Boring! No need to watch! I tell you, this movie is bad! <br /> <br /> 1/10
