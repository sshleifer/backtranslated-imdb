As I listen to my parents watching this (after spending 10 minutes in the movie), they have absolutely no idea what's going on. When "Charles Dickens" looked at the camera, I almost expected him to become a demon (yes, he looked). Unfortunately, that did not happen. <br /> <br /> This film had several reasons why I did not finish it: one, it was unbearably slow. I mean, seriously, it was SLOWW. You can only understand 10% of what is said and the characters have been misrepresented. <br /> <br /> If you have an English accent and love to talk a lot, no action, a terrible game, bursts of laughter and the same music / sound effects played over and over again, then that is THE movie for you ... <br /> <br /> 1/10 - completely awful. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
