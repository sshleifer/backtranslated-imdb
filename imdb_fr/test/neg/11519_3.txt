Being one of the founding fathers of my area, the Monkey Movie Club (which also includes monkeys, chimpanzees and orangutans), I review this movie from a movie point of view on monkeys. After all, it's a whole summer of monkeys, more than 100 days for the monkeys to do what they do best, cause harm, shenanigans, shenanigans, hyjinx, solve human problems and teach us what we are. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple. In short, the poor boy needs money for things he wants. Fortunately, there are some monkeys (chimpanzees) that have a bonus on the head that would cause the blood of Boba Fett or Dog (Duane Chapman) to flow. As the boy tries to catch the monkeys, he discovers himself, his family, his grandfather, the local nutty, flirts with a girl twice as old and learns that the brazen way to control bullies is to have someone pointed at them. br /> <br /> Therein lies the problem. So much emphasis is placed on the boy that chimpanzees simply do not have the screen time they deserve. Chimpanzees are not as talented as those who play Jack from the M_P trilogy or the legendary orangutans who play Dunstin or Clyde (1 or 2). So, do not watch this movie hoping to find the next big thing in the Chimp genre. The chimpanzees had a nice turnaround, which the film needed more. There is an epic scene of chimpanzees breaking into the homes of poor families and destroying everything they worked so hard for. Serious cinephiles will want to rent the movie only for this scene. <br /> <br /> So, to conclude, this film is not intended for serious moviegoers. I would not recommend this film to families because it encourages the rebellion of children against their parents. I can only recommend this movie as a rental for adults who are passionate about hardcore monkey and well supervised children.
