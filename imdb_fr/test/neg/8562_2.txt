The Nun is a revenge photo in which a strict nun is killed by her rebel semi-trailer accusations and returns years later to surrender even when adults now go to their old school. The narrative plot is predictable with the shovel and does not reserve surprises because it advances slowly towards the end. It's a screamer of a movie with a passable game and a lower-than-average scenario and scenario. Most of the special effects are of mediocre quality and there is virtually no credibility in the final battle. Nevertheless, if you look beyond these symbols, you will notice gems of suspense and actors. If you like crazy cookie-cutters, you'll like this, otherwise you should pass.
