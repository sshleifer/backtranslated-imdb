After the film that represents the apogee of the ninja genre of the 1980s, namely, salivis fans of "The Revenge Of The Ninja" were "treated" to this strange offer that mixes Ninja shenanigans and spiritual possession ... the end result is not of a different nature to this somewhat awful experience when you see a floating human poop nugget threatening you in a public swimming pool. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the so-called "action-packed" introduction that is placed from all places on a golf Course (!) Here we see a ninja dressed in bright green slaughtering a group of golfers for a seemingly discernible reason (although I must admit that the shallow elitist attitude adopted by many participants in this sport in particular annoys me a little ... hmmmm Maybe that's why In fact, later in the film, we are told that one of the golfers was a top scientist, but this story is never elaborated or evoked forever !!! > Anyway, the police proceed to circle the golf course and shoot the assassin absolutely absolutely ... and they must continue to shoot him because he does not want to stay on the ground Yes, literally, hundreds of cartridges are injected into him and, STILL, he gets up for to shoot down the numbers of the police force forever. <br /> <br /> Finally (after what seems to be an eternity), our unbeliever blows up a smoke bomb and disappears .. ... or at least, it seems, because in reality, he is hiding under the ground and when our decidedly ruthless officers leave the scene in search of his body, he crawls out of his hiding place and staggers away. <br /> <br /> We will then see the beautiful Lucinda Dickey, a very beautiful actress and in perfect physical condition, playing here a repairer of phones. From his high point of view, he happens to spot the dying ninja (finally !!!!!). However, after further investigation, the man, supposed on his last legs, suddenly jumps on her and grabs her on the ground. After a little struggle, our courageous heroine manages to break free, but does not rely on the ninja to possess hypnotic powers and she inevitably succumbs to it. It is at this point that the dying ninja really projects his soul into our heroine! His intention is to use his bodily form to kill the officers who killed him (the little he failed to eliminate initially!) <br /> <br /> From that moment, all Throughout the film, whenever our heroine notices any of the aforementioned officers, she is subjected to horribly terrible cinematic scenes: flashing lights, smoke effects and the sword that the ninja bequeathed to her levitating towards her in a very hesitant! <br /> <br /> more complex, a particularly irritating policeman (who has enough hair on his back and shoulders to shame an average yak!) persists in wanting to win his affections (extremely bloody and annoying! !!) ...... Of course, it does not take the gift of preconception to understand that, in a rather weak "shock" towards the end of the film, it turns out to be one of the officers it must kill! <br /> <br /> But wait a little hope! <br /> <br /> Move forward the one and only Sho Kosugi! <br /> <br /> Yes, the ninja himself and look as cool as ever! It is obvious that the information on golf clubs is fast and that after learning about the events that took place there, he flies from Japan to solve the situation (suspecting the worst!). In a brief story (which represents a few seconds!) Sho's interest in this particular ninja turned out to be personal after the murder of his father / teacher (?) And the blindness of one of the eyes of Sho (which forces Sho to wear a banner for the guard of the sword!) <br /> <br /> After stealing the body of his dead nemesis from the morgue, then found our heroine who hosts unintentionally the wicked soul, the climax reigns in an eastern temple (apparently in the middle of nowhere) where our man Sho manages to bring together the two disjointed aspects. <br /> <br /> Now reanimated from the dead, the evil ninja and Sho clash in a traditional ninja style with swords, the winner being ........ yes you can probably guess. <br /> <br /> Really this movie ha There are only two assets: the always excellent Kosugi (who looks absolutely fantastic in the role) and the charming Miss Dickey. What a shame that the material in which they found themselves here is a pile of garbage so rancid. <br /> <br /> Well, to be honest, I've seen a lot worse than that in my time, although I'm definitely still I can not recommend it to those who are desperate to complete their film collections Sho Kosugi / Ninja.
