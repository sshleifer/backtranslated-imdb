Or at least a forced retreat! This movie is horrible, horrible, terrible, rank, rotten, putrid ... well, you see the idea. Do not under any circumstances watch for this rotting trash, unless you want death, because it will kill you for sure. (I only survived because I missed the first half hour.) Carrot Top is a bad comedian and an even worse actor. I can not believe he asked anyone to fund this huge waste of time and money. This just proves that some people have no qualms about thinking they could win a dollar or two (literally ... I can not imagine it would cost them more than $ 2!). <br /> <br /> And please, someone Tell me what is the possible motivation of Courtney Thorne Smith (a decent mid-way actress, certainly above any case) to sign on this pile of smoking manure. Was she that bored during this 3.5-second dry spell between Melrose Place and Ally McBeal? Or does she have some sort of karmic debt towards the most annoying person in the face of the planet (aka Carrot Top)? <br /> <br /> I give it a 2/10, and it's probably way too high. I try to save my films for movies that make me vomit, and as I have not seen all this, my stomach content has remained contained. I do not think I'll look again to see if it's really worth it!
