If you want to make a movie from any book, make sure the characters are compatible with this book. This film not only challenged the Bible story that was told for thousands of years to children, but it clearly took liberties that no adaptation would probably ever attempt. At least the Lord of the Rings is close enough to the books so that people will understand the story better if they read the books than what "Noah's Ark" tried to do.
