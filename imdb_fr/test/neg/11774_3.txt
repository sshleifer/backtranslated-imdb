In what way does addiction incite novice filmmakers to offer their own point of view on the subject? This subject has been made to death. Drug addiction is bad. We understood. Addiction is painful to watch. We get that too. But the dark subject does not give the filmmaker permission to make a sloppy film. Each film does not have to be a Hitchcockian masterpiece of cinematic excellence, or use Orson Wellesian's deep focus, but it's still a narrative film. Truth does not mean pseudo-documentary. Even mainstream mini-DV cameras are capable of producing whites and blacks, and this filmmaker is lazy in not taking contrasting scenes with existing lighting: the subject is dark enough without forcing it artificially with sloppy cinematography. And even documentary films have a sound mix. Vera Farmiga has a lot of talent, given the good material, but the director has over-directed and defeated her whole life. Drug addicts can live in the fog, but they still have emotions, but none of these characters seems to exist off screen. Supportive actors simply delivered their lines without creating real people. Sorry to be so severe, Debra, but some things are true, whether we want to believe them or not. I'm sure your next movie will be better - but please, not another movie about drugs. :)
