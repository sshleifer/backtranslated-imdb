Target tells the story of a special agent who, after executing the order to murder Turkish "terrorists" (note that this is one of those "American movies for guys who love stupid stupid and super-patriotic nationalists "), returning home his ex-wife and two children take hostages. Charlie Snow only has a few hours to do what terrorists tell him to recover. <br /> <br /> It was by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And if I had not seen someone I actually knew (and probably mistaken) out of the video store, I would never have seen this huge pile of garbage. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like any generic action movie story I've ever seen before. In fact, that's the kind of thing they distort in variety shows, that's the seriousness of the situation. I was almost expecting Home Living the Color's "Homey the Clown" to be performed by Mad TV's Will Sasso, who was blamed by Steven Segal for appearing on the screen mid-way, to remind you that it was only an exaggerated action movie. to ridicule how ridiculous it is. There were not even good fight or action sequences. The way things are played out, you would not even think that someone was kidnapped, that there were terrorists or that something interesting was happening. <br /> <br /> Not only is the story completely and completely uninteresting, the acting is so terribly wooden. Just look at the part where Stephen Baldwin, as former Special Agent Charlie Snow, talks to the kidnappers on the phone. They tell him that they have his wife and they put her on the phone. She says "Charlie, help!" Or something to that effect. And Baldwin responds "It's alright, darling" so impassively, you think he was reading the script and trying to sound the words phonetically. I imagine that, despite the fact that this film is ridiculously bad (one of the last 100 on IMDb - a list that should extend to at least 250 films and that should contain almost all of Stephen Baldwin's films), someone with some talent might have at least made the effort not to spoil him so much. Someone. Anybody. I could not ignore the fact that everyone seemed to read a script. Except that, it's the only person in the whole movie friggin who has any talent whatsoever (and should not have been in this area), Deborah Wilson of Mad TV. <br /> <br /> It was the capital cheese festival. It's really embarrassing.
