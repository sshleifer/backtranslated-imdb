I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I can enter romantic intellectual films. This movie just did not move me. I felt it was about an hour too much. Camille is described as a very nice sculptor who loses almost everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad and downcast. If you like tragedies, you CAN like that. I just thought it was too long, which meant there were a lot of useless scenes, which eventually led to about an hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie. If you want to see a good romantic tragedy, look at Titanic.
