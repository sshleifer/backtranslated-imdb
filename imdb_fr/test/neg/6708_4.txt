This movie starts with this scary song that gave me shivers like "Nightmare on Elmstreet"! This immediately creates the mood! The following sequence also shows what to expect! We are informed that a ghost is present! The mystery about this ghost is what keeps this movie together! But the structure of the plot is so complex that it's hard to understand! The ideas behind the plot are quite interesting! Only the way we are told is far too abstract! I understand that the director thought he had to keep the mystery as long as possible! The problem is that when certain things are revealed, you never get a satisfactory explanation! The motivations of the important characters are left out and some questions raised in the film are not answered! Since we do not know enough about the characters, it becomes difficult to deal with it! And therefore, you will lose interest! Only a few scares and a twist prevent this film from becoming a total failure! The twist is interesting but no real shock! The experienced spectator will see it happen! Some critics complain that this movie looks too much like "Ringu" and is not original at all! Well, it's true that some of the effects and alarms are borrowed from this movie! But there is one main difference! The suspense in "Ringu" was mainly based on this turn where the spectator discovers how the characters are killed !! In "Ryeong" (the "Ringu"), the twist is used as a scary effect to accompany another crazy twist! "Ryeong" relies heavily on a complex structured plot and a twist that does not contain enough scares to hold your interest! In simple terms: it's not a scary movie!
