Usually, a movie that starts badly stays bad in a monotonous descending pattern. This bad movie started to look better before diving steeply. The acting, except for the male antagonist, was awful. The plot was essentially a set up for the final main stage, which is probably a good performance, but it was wasted in this movie. I do not know why this movie was made.
