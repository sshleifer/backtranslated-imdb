My poor Tank Girl, they have ignored everything you care about. Why does he have as little to do with comic books as possible? I would have liked a movie that would follow the plot, or at least if the characters were correct. <br /> <br /> WHY was TANK GIRL American? She's Austrailian, damn it! And she does not live in a post-apocalyptic war zone either, she lives in the hinterland with Booga as a savage. She does it because she wants to live that way, not because she has to, because Malcolm Mc Dowell is acting like a jerk. And why does she care for these children? The only children in the comics end up choking violently, it's terrible that they have made a figure of lame mother. <br /> <br /> And my poor Jet Girl and Sub Girl! In comics, Jet is a sarcastic nightmare and a girl Sub is ... another sarcastic nightmare with a strange sense of humor. In the movie, Jet is that little smiling thing and Sub is this middle-aged witch. And Booga does not look like or play anything he is supposed to be. Even though maybe the hot love was it too much for the American box office? The humor was also lame. What happened to everything about the Smiths and that brilliant slang that they used all the time? What kind of line is "Will it take a long time? I do not want to miss Baywatch."? Even tiny children's programs can offer better material than this one.
