No matter what other people have said, you can not watch this movie again without comparing it to the original. If it existed on its own, it would be a 2-3 film out of 5, but it's a remake of a 4-5 movie. 5 film and therefore has standards to adhere to and we need to see if it has achieved these standards. If the film was a retouch or, as in Planet of the Apes, a reinvention of the original, you would be able to watch the movie in its own right, referring only to the original. Imagine this way, if someone took the model in the 'Mona Lisa', put it differently and painted it, you could only compare the framing, the concept, etc. to the original, but if someone repainted it in the position of the original, it would have to be compared completely. <br /> <br /> That said, this film does not fail to be as good as the original film, it fails spectacularly. Whether original or not, one of the best movies made, the shower scene will never be forgotten, the remake was supposed to be a celebration of Hitchcock but eventually degrading it as well as its masterwork. <br /> <br /> The degrading aspects of this picture were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It has nothing to do with the fact that they did or did not act better, is that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really innocent enough, Norman did not really understand the sex, he had not almost no contact with the outside world and when he met the beautiful Marion and watched her change, you feel that he does so partly by fascination, because he does not really understand the sex and its attraction to her, it makes Norman friendly and almost anti-hero, you're on his side because he does not quite understand. understand the world and constantly fights with himself and his "mother". In the remake, the whole dynamic is gone, I must admit that Janet Leigh is not my kind, but she is very attractive and you can see, Anne Heche is really unattractive and if Norman finds 'his' Marion attractive is amazing if you add that Vince Vaughn, Norman, masturbates looking at her and you get a Norman who is waiting for an opportunity to masturbate a naked woman, no matter what she looks like, for whom you have no sympathy, they further destroy Norman's innocent nature by putting porn magazines in his room. It destroys a character for whom we have come to love and feel sorry, it's like remaking "It's a wonderful life" and having the main character a pimp, totally degrading. <br /> <br /> The only other character that I had problems with Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's work colleague. In the original, when Pat Hitchcock said: "he must have noticed my wedding ring", it provokes a reaction of laughter because it makes fun of itself. When Rita says it, it just seems plausible, because there is no other reason for The man would flirt with Anne Heche on her. <br /> <br /> I'm going to admit that I'm very biased, the original movie "Psycho" is my favorite movie of all time, if the movie had been reworked, with an angle, then you could have returned these characters on their heads and that would have been perfectly acceptable. <br /> <br /> Hitch is famous when the film was too much color and would have done in black and white to reduce it. It also made the film more atmospheric and scary in its own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in color. It's a sad statement about how the films make audiences feel that people have said how much the shower scene was more scary in color. (before people think "he can not spell," remember that I'm from England and we spell his color) <br /> <br /> A remake should be just a new copy, it's a fake, a complete copy and a very bad at that. I could continue to compare but it is useless, almost everything is superior to the original. The only thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called "The Stiff" in his back) and Mortensen gave a more credible performance if less friendly . William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors to respect the originals. <br /> <br /> Overall, a film must bear the title "Expensive Echarrassing Expensive Echarrassing.Visplay only if you compare to the original or if the original is unknown to you.But see also the original" The film would have obtained a 3 out of 5 if it was an original reshuffle, but as it is 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen)
