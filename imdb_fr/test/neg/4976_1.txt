The last tribute of Clint Eastwoods to the former Great West is Unforgiven. But while I thought it was going to be good and raise the bar for future westerns, I was sadly mistaken. Ruthless, although simple in the plot, he falls flat on the characters and emotions and I would certainly say that Unforgiven is Eastwoods worst film to date. Eastwoods himself seems too old to play the role of actor and director, which also adds a negative aspect to the film. <br /> <br /> All characters seem rushed and jagged, especially the Eastwoods character. The acting does not seem to flow and contribute to what the characters feel. Management is misled by bizarre shots. So, overall, Unforgiven is not the best of Eastwoods and by far one of the worst Westerns.
