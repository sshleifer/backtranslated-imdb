I should know better. I've seen too much of Rob Lowe's debut to be able to hope for something good in this movie, even if it's about hockey. <br /> <br /> Once again we have another sporting theme exhausted. Kid has a potential for greatness, seems to go far if his arrogant attitude does not spoil things. And, boom, he comes out like a champion of the helluva genre. Is that all we can say about sports movies? Certainly, athletes have to do other feats. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this film must be one of the biggest balls of cheese. Everyone's interactions are downright stupid, and not stupidly-funny. And I can not think of auxiliary qualities that could animate my position. Not the actors (certainly not Swayze who plays Lowe's reluctant mentor), not the story, not the music, and very few skating sequences. <br /> <br /> Normally, I'm a sucker for 80s movies, even if they tend to be a little fishy (North Shore, Karate Kid), but it does not even give a good trash of the 80s. For a good sports film of the 80s, go elsewhere. There are many there.
