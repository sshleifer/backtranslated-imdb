Do not believe the hype. If you have high hopes or anticipated this film to any degree, you may be disappointed. Even the hilarious and talented Steve Carrell can not save this stupid, too long and poorly written spy movie. For the purists (fans of the original television series), this film does not look like the original characters and influence. Agent 99 and Maxwell (with the exception of their names) are just not the same characters. There are several isolated references to the original, but not enough to convince this fan that it is nothing more than a poor shadow of the TV version. For those who do not know the original TV series, you may not be disappointed, but you may get bored. There are also some cheap political moves in Hollywood (really pathetic and so typical for an election year). We left after the first hour and we were not alone. Some left after 20 minutes.
