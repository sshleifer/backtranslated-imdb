Any ambiguity about Michael Myers has disappeared thanks to the chronic tendency of this series to be reconciled with its continuity and to bring its relatives out of nowhere. This entry shows the angle of the pot that it is not just a psycho-killer, but that it is controlled by runes, which appear as a constellation of stars every Halloween, and that a cult uses it to ... well, this movie is far from consistent and I lost track of the plot after a while. The credibility of the film on the haemorrhages is such that it has no more drop in the end. Why does Michael put a victim's clothes in a washing machine? Why does an otherwise empty hallway have a lethal point sticking out of the wall? Is being electrocuted really blowing your head? Etc. It's up to Donald Pleasence, in his penultimate film role, to produce wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogues he's had.
