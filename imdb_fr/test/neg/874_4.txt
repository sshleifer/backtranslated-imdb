Not quite a bomb? The only thing that was missing was enriched uranium. In fact, the "maybe" scenario worked if the lead roles were interpreted by younger actors, but the aging Diane Lane dramatic acting as if she were a teenager (or even a twenties) was too difficult to support. Whenever she (Adrienne) jumped into the arms of Richard Gere and then raised the two heels behind her, one could almost see the grimace of pain on her face while he was probably thinking, "Oh, my back makes me wrong ... this baby, of course, no longer weighs 125 pounds! "In any case, the two characters were distinctly inimitable, especially that of Richard Gere: a self-absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner) who was somehow" soul-searching "after a failed operation that had left him with a deceased patient (a senior woman) and then there was her angry husband and son with whom he had to call to explain what had happened. "Dr. Flanner is about to meet her angry husband (at the request of her husband) when he meets Adrienne She is recently separated from her unfaithful husband (shock) and helps a friend watching her rent her cottage by the beach. where Dr. Flanner ends up staying and they both fall in love (especially after she found out a rich doctor AND a plastic surgeon) Between romantic interludes and the nauseating chant / dance routine that Lane (Adrienne) play listens nt an old album (no CD?), They both try to understand how their lives were totally ruined. Dr. Flanner was not very father and had a son (who is also a doctor) who was angry at him for not being there for him as he grew up. (Of course, Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time than in raising a rash, distracting boy.) To sum up a long (predictable) story, Adrienne helps Dr. Flanner deal with his inner demons and to get angry. the husband and son of the deceased woman on her operating table (after undergoing a "systematic" cyst of the face). Dr. Flanner is finally able to tell the husband (played with Scott Glenn's extreme sympathy) that he is sorry for what happened - even though it is all the fault of this anesthetist. "I told her she was too old for so much juice!" The character of Glenn (Robert Torrelson) seems to accept Dr. Flanner's apology. It's hard to say because his emotional reaction is so passive at this point that you wonder if he even hears the good doctor at all or if he thinks of a certain area he needs to plow. Increasingly circumspect, Dr. Flanner then decides to visit his son (who is currently practicing free medicine in a third world country) to restore their relationship. Unfortunately, that means he has to temporarily say goodbye to Adrienne. Of course, while entertaining the people of Timbuktu, he writes an hourly love letter to Adrienne (who faints almost like a schoolgirl every time she gets one) and tells her that the most difficult he had ever had to do was to say goodbye to him. Of course, apologizing to Robert Torrelson for the death of his wife was the second most difficult thing. In the end, he is killed in a monumental mudslide (poetic justice as in a mud pack?) And he only has memories of what could have been ... hope that no more Gere / Lane sequel !
