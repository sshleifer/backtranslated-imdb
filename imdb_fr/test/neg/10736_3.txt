I think this film lacks so much substance that it's not even worth discussing. <br /> <br /> In the first, the package is really disgusting. Especially stereotypes filming and photographing. Of course, Joe Dante's film style was appropriate and interesting in "Gremlins" and "Little Soldiers", I mean the pretty imaginative and visual story about a Spielberg-wunderkind (I really liked those movies), completely unsuccessful. The attacks of little soldiers and hairy creatures are simply not comparable to the invasions of zombies (dead, stinking and putrid beings who try to kill the living - for no logical reason, just because they hate them). <br /> <br /> Zombie movies are characteristic of simple, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. Nothing to do in Joe Dante's debut. Another point is the boring content: really stupid dialogues between the two main characters, a macabre exploitation of the "elder brother dies and leaves the youngest trauma" and bad behavior. And, by the way, "Finding" is neither scary nor bloody - let alone fun. You see, it's not even a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Zombie movies in the decade before - the late '60s / early' 70s - were revolutionary and provocative (including their explicit content) and subtle social criticism. The original Zombie movie was actually a midnight movie entitled "The Night of the Living Dead" (1968). It's a low-budget film that covers so many controversial themes that it's difficult to name them all: a Hitchcock / Raimi visual style, the 1970s American lifestyle, political distance, the imminent breakthrough of rights Black humans and racism even more imminent on the side of conservative Americans (remember the shooting of the main character black at the end of the film). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies and I want to know more about the most important, I recommend "Midnight movies: from the margin to the general public". <br /> <br /> Avoid the "reunion" and even the "country of Romero" Dead ".
