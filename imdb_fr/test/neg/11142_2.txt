I like underground movies when they have something to say, or to show, by the way. I tried to love "Trash". I tried to see artistic achievements or an interesting representation of life in New York in the early 70s. Or at least be entertained by that? But the film stinks and can not be described as art or entertainment. <br /> <br /> "Trash" is basically an excuse to expose Joe Dallesandro's naked body for 2 hours, while he gets to know about okay, it's a gorgeous body, but no excuses for a whole movie about it, no?). Holly Woodlawn, as Joe's girlfriend, provides some good laughs by the end, but it's too late to save those few hours lost. Lou Reed's classic song "Walk on the Wild Side" is a better portrait of these people and that time, even though it is more fascinating than it actually was. 1.5 / 10.
