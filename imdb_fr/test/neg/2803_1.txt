Rent this one movie if you're in the mood to laugh (for pure stupidity), because this movie would not scare a group of kindergarten kids at a Halloween party! The problem is that there is too much gore for kids, so do not put that in your VCR for toddlers. It starts with a bit of promise, giving you the impression that the box cover artist actually started watching this movie before designing the cover, but then quickly fell into an epic stupidity. "Killer Scarecrows" are clumsy characters who are as scary as the Wizard of Oz, but not as clever. If only they had a brain ...? I had this film for $ 1.20 at a local discount and lock store and even so, I feel a little ripped off. I think with all the other comments posted here, if you really pay to see this, you can only blame yourself.
