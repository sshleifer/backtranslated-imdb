Do not worry - no spoilers here, just saying that there is a very predictable plot. A couple decides to live in her father's love nest to write a book / article / newsletter about her adventure with a famous tragic Hollywood starlet. All this production resembled a high school troupe doing an episode of "Murder She Wrote". The only actor game on which I was sold is the old fog they interviewed for sources in the story. Apparently, the directors thought that the film was getting too long, so in the end, they stopped pointing their camera at some kind of scary image of the star, and hired security agents to complete the film. Do not waste your time - even the tried and true classics of horror / intrigue fail in this movie.
