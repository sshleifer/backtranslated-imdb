Would you be surprised if I told you that this movie is about a plot? No? And if I told you that the leader is a puppet in the shade. What? You do not believe me? ... OKAY. Yes, I invented that. It's a shame, this movie could have used a sense of humor. I understand Charlie Sheen was doing that at the time - another movie was worth more money - like Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... why? Do not even get me started on Stephen Lang. It was so much fun that Party Crasher in 'The Hard Way' and now this bazaar. <br /> <br /> Ah, it does not matter. Everyone involved should be ashamed. If you're shooting a bad movie and you're successful, it's crooked, but I doubt that's what they were aiming for here. Clearly, the story stinks and we are supposed to take this yak seriously. You wonder if this film even had a glimmer of hope. Seriously, I doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings, the way it's lit up with the green goes beyond me. Perhaps even more frightening is the way this horde of dogs found themselves in theaters! <br /> <br /> Oh ... Sam Waterson, you're awesome in Law & Order. Why are you here? To demote you against the role of the President of the United States, to which I could add, is shot by a remote controlled biplane controlled by the gonzo assassin. Once again, it is a masterpiece of George P. Cosmatos who "directs" the credits of Rambo: First Blood Part II, among other jewels. Hmm .... example?
