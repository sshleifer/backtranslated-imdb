It is disappointing to see such a talented actor as Amitabh Bachchan in such a weak role, especially when he was beyond the sensational in BLACK (which I highly recommend). A sentence in the film says, "Sakar is not a simple man, he is a thought and a philosophy." Director Ram Gopal Varma credits THE GODFATHER as a source of inspiration for this film, and that may be the problem. It looks like a battered American movie taking place in India. The index of the left elbow takes into account seven elements of the cinematography - actor, continuity, plot, development of the character, dialogue, artistic sense and production scenery - on a scale ranging from 10 to 1, with 5, average score. The continuity of the film seems high, an 8, maintaining a violent tone steeped in dramas in some places and using justice outside the judicial system as motivation. However, there seems to be a lack of emotion related to the evil of organized crime. The acting game has a 4, it seems too weak, even when someone is beaten or murdered, it seems hoohum. For example, when a character is hit in the forehead, I wondered if, or when, he was going to fall. This is not the case, and like Ronald Reagan, he is placed in a car, his face bloody rocked like John F. Kennedy. The plot considers gangster 5 as an example of American-style gangsterism, headed by a family oriented Robinhood. The development of the characters seems static and the characters look like chess pieces on an abandoned chessboard, getting a rank of 3. The dialogue seems fixed and seems to have to match a Bowery speech pattern - a 4 for dialogue . The production scenery seems to be below average - 4. And, the art is confusing, with too many close-ups, too fast panning and too many group scenes where actors seem too repeated - a 3. For me also a lot of camera movements are disruptive. The average of the Left Elbow Index is 4.4 and, with a slight deduction based on a weak derivatism, it goes to a 4. Two questions continually arise in the film: one, why do so many people eat they so often, and two Does not India have its own form of organized crime? Do films like this have to depend so much on Western cultural examples? Although I like Amitabh Bachchan, I can not recommend this film.
