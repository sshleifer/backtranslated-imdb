Hmmm! is it the worst movie of all time? Somehow, for some actors, it's a shame to see them in such a film, but hey, if it pays the bills, why not, as for the film well. OK the effects are not too bad for such a cheap movie, the music is almost OK again for a cheap movie, the end credits are OK lol <br /> <br /> BAD to many to list, but , casting, actors, sets, script, ending .. that heck, Drac .......... worse Drac EVER !, much more, but can not be bothered to put them all. <br /> <br /> The idea was OK but necessary ten times the budget and more thinking and much better lighting and style and change all the negatives, I say however to see this movie so you can say "What was FU% $ all there was to say" at the time of the credits? It's a bit to see just to see how bad it is.
