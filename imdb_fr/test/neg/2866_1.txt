and one of them is the one who walks around a 14-year-old girl wearing a string swimsuit. I would like to ask fans of this film: would you allow your daughter to walk in a seaside resort dressed like this? And would your 14-year-old daughter be able to handle the men's reaction? If so, I would like to know why, in both cases. A suit like this is a clear invitation to men; it is hypocritical to suggest that this is not the case. <br /> <br /> And on another point, what teenager would she ever claim that her father was her lover, without the excuse of serious mental problems? It's almost as disgusting as the swimsuit. <br /> <br /> In simple terms, some things are neither funny nor appropriate, and they never will be.
