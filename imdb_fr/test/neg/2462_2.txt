"JB" (Black Jack) runs away from home after being spanked by his father (Meat Loaf). Years later, he finally goes to Hollywood and meets the greatest guitarist he has ever heard, "KG" (Kyle Glass). <br /> <br /> After a little argument, the two men decide to join an Open Mic Night in what appears to be a less than popular bar. To their shock, they do not do what is right. <br /> <br /> Back in their less than spectacular apartment, both are trying to figure out what rock legends do not look like while they're looking at some old magazines. Only then do they realize that the guitarists on the jackets have the same pick. <br /> <br /> While searching for a similar pick, an employee of the music store (Ben Stiller, who is also the Executive Producer film) tells him the old story of the "Pick of Destiny", which they seek . This employee, who has long gray hair and big glasses, also tells them that the pick, made from Satan's tooth, is part of a rock history museum. <br /> <br /> Illusions of grandeur embark on a musical adventure to steal the pick. <br /> <br /> Let me say this in advance, if you're not a fan of Tenacious D, who gave us comedian Jack Black, you should skip this one. I'm not a fan of those two and I only watched it because it was suggested by Flixter.com. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, jokes are more silent than silence. I laughed at maybe three jokes and chuckled a few others. Tenacious D is only for a certain audience, which I am not. <br /> <br /> This movie hangs in many places and that's where the worst jokes appear. And let me tell you that when Black and Glass do not work with each other, they are completely lost on the screen. <br /> <br /> All the songs in this movie are from Tenacious D. Perfectly advance the screenplay by describing their adventures at the time of the film. However, I felt that the songs sounded too similar to be distinguished. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this film is that the language will dissuade a lot of people. There are many four-letter words in this movie. There are also drug references. I would not recommend that to children. <br /> <br /> Part of Tenacious D's complicity is that Black is in your face and Glass is mostly in the shadows. It's like that in this movie, and it does not really work. It may have been part of the law, but I got the impression that Glass just did not want to be there. In a scene, he interprets his words (background) at a party and can not work alone. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D is supposed to be a rock fan in real life and has maybe two rock legends in the movie. I lost count because I was so bored with this movie. Personally, I would have liked to see more rock legends and icons in the movie. However, we do not understand that. <br /> <br /> We get a movie full of jokes completely void, foul language, dull scenario. You also get a horrible acting game and a non-original story. However, you get very good songs that sound pretty much the same way. <br /> <br /> The story could have been promising, but many scenes seemed to have been added to the film at the last second. It's a bit similar to The Blues Brothers from many years ago, but the Blues Brothers had a much bigger audience - and two songs on the Billboard music charts. Tenacious D has few followers, with some HBO specials to its credit. And unlike The Blues Brothers, comedy is not well thought at all. <br /> <br /> If you are an unconditional fan of Tenacious D, I suggest you consult it. However, like most viewers at the time of the release of this film in the room, I would say that we should avoid this one. Save your money on this one, the people.
