WOW! What a horrible and ugly waste of time this celluloid atrocity has turned out to be. I remember seeing it years ago and thinking it was fun, but now ... it's just silly. Not to mention that this is a flagrant scam of "The Exorcist" to the point where it was reissued at one point under the title "The Sex-Orcist". The only difference is that the producers have the nerve to discredit themselves further by slapping on the assertion that the events of the film are REAL! Who, in his good sense, would really believe such a bold lie? To make matters worse, there was an outstanding video out with a cover that was blatantly trying to take advantage of the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" by throwing a pair of lips on the cover! How far can we sink? Do not be fooled by false claims, blatant lies or the scam of title, because you will REALLY be disappointed if you do!
