What could have been a particularly frightening topic ends up being an incomprehensible and nutty film that even the filmmakers themselves probably did not understand. If they had shown the satanic ritual or anything more, it could have been more frightening, but in the current state of things, it's a waste of time and brain cells. Does anyone else get tired of all the "little child who draws scary pictures with a pencil"? Could there be a bigger picture of horror? Probably not. I know, I know, it's from a different country, and it's way too sophisticated and sophisticated for me to understand, so I should not expect the "plot" to be spoon-fed, blah , BLA bla. It does not matter. I say again that the film is blowing.
