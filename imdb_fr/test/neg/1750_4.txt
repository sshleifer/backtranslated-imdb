I felt that the movie Skammen, directed by Ingmar Bergman, was very dry. It shows the things that people will do to survive during a war and the shame that flows from these actions; However, I feel that it was not complete or the attention did not hold. He never really immersed himself in the plot or in the depths of the character's emotions or the reasons behind his actions. The only thing that caught my attention in the film was the transformation of the two main characters, Jan and Eva. Several times during the film, only the two main characters were sitting or doing their daily chores without even having a conversation. I understand that it was to show the reality of these people, but I think there are other ways to show reality and to entertain it. I think Ingmar Bergman could have filmed this film in a more captivating way.
