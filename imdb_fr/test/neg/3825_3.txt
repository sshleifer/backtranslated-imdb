This film was one of the first women's movies in prison in the 70s. This film was incredibly violent, with a lot of sadistic torture inflicted on the detainees. The film is happening in the Philippines, which looks like a horribly ugly country. There is no doubt that the producers have used this factor to their advantage to emphasize the terrible situation in which the prisoners were. <br /> <br /> The queen of Blaxploitation, Pam Grier, plays the lead role in this film. She plays Blossom, a renegade who is thrown into the vile prison of women for fabricated charges. His boyfriend, played by Sid Haig, tries to save Blossom. He and Blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction and his incarceration was orchestrated by the corrupt Philippine government. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier and Sid Haig stand out among the lazy cast. The film itself placed too much emphasis on the violence perpetrated against the prisoners. Their captors only used them as objects of their sadism. It was quickly bored. This film could have used intrigues and more interesting nuances. This is not one of Roger Corman's best pictures. The many films about women in prison that followed this one were much better. I would recommend The Big Bird Cage, only to fans of Pam Grier.
