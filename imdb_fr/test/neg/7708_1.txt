OK, I must admit that I liked House of the Dead despite its well-documented failures. It was the worst movie I've seen since Demons at the Door. Compared with the DATD, the effects are much higher. However, the plot is weak, the actor recalls the one everyone prefers, the porn movie, and the decisions and actions of the "characters" are always close to the weak. I want to try Uwe Boll's latest film releases just to get a glimpse of the HOTD2 perspective. I am not saying that it is really the cure, but rather the case of another illness, but when your senses have been insulted so abominably, the only way out is. OK that's it. I managed the minimum of ten lines and I will not waste our time on the celluloid waste that is the House of the Dead 2.
