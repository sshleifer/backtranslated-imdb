I'm sorry to say that I saw this movie at the beginning of its movie release. This is one of the few films I wanted to release early. I did not have a problem with the drug content and I could see how powerful this powerful story could have been. The problem was that the filmmaker, in collaboration with James Woods and Sean Young, had drawn two of the least adorable characters I've ever seen in a movie. I hated this pair and I did not care if they fell straight to the inevitable bottom. Their was not a surprise in this movie. Every event was so painfully obvious that I thought I could write the script myself; Although I like to think that I would have done a better job. Afterwards, I heard nightmarish stories about the shooting incidents between Sean Young and James Woods as a result of some kind of stalking. I wondered if the terrible acting was the result of bad feelings and dysfunction. Anyway, I call The Boost the worst movie I've ever paid for money to see.
