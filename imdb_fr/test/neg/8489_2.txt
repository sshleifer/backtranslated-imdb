I sort of liked this movie, not good, but not the worst ever. Although everyone says it's one of the worst movies ever, I thought it was good. There are a lot of immature jokes. He sometimes wants to be funny, but fails. <br /> <br /> The story is OK. It may be a bit difficult for the younger audience, though. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is a horrible actor most of the time. At times, it's even laughable. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor from here. He's funny when he's supposed to be, but some of his lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the main negative point of this film I hated was the voice of Tim Avery, who owned it. mask. The voice is horrible. In addition, the scenes in which he finds himself are so insignificant that they are almost unbearable. I'm sure they could have cut it, and that would not affect the film. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can live without seeing that. It's a good movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch, though. They certainly could have disappeared without following up, but it's a decent effort. 4/10
