This film is a shame, especially since Andrzej Wajda is not an amateur director, but a professional director. However, this movie does not provide anything you can expect. <br /> <br /> First of all, I'm Polish, so I can tell everything because I read books. But how do you know there's even a war in this movie - lots of people come and go, soldiers scream ... Is it really World War II or soldiers are on vacation? <br /> <br /> Act and dialogue - poor, miserably poor. A.Å»mijewski, D.Stenka, M.Komorowska, W.Kowalski, A.Chyra agree in their roles, the rest of the cast (Polish) is irrelevant (notably, Mr.Ostaszewska, one of the main characters, an unfortunate choice). 99% of the dialogues are not spoken, they are just put there, the actors had difficulties to play and it is not surprising to see what they have to say strange things. <br /> <br /> And that brings us to the most disappointing problem - you can not feel it. Everything is so theatrical, artificial. There is no real life, there is no feeling. There are many original WWII footage and, guess what, the material is much more powerful and dramatic than A.Wajda did. <br /> <br /> I can only see one positive point - despite historical errors (like the acronym ZSRR), it was created for post-1945 propaganda purposes, to please the Polish that the ZSRS was gone, and now there was the ZSRR, but in 1940 there was no ZSRR!) The Soviets (yes, it's a fact, not a controversial gossip). Super, two hours for a scene of 5 to 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, time and potential lost. It is a tragedy of epic proportions, will fight in 1939 (barely shown), not declaring war on the Soviet Union by the Polish authorities (sic, not shown here), imprisonment of soldiers soon after , living in scandalous conditions (not shown here), hope and fear of what will follow (barely shown), then of ... extermination. Hand-to-hand with the Germans - The Soviets exterminated the Polish nation, targeting the people who were the backbone of Poland. Unfortunately, they are successful and the results are still visible to this day.
