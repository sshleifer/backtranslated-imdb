This movie made me so angry !! Here I think that here is a new horror movie, with a sense of intelligence and then the movie starts. The decor, the delivery of lines, the costumes, the false gore, should I continue? There are porn movies with a better dialogue than that. I understand the concept behind independent films, but my God, it was not just independent, it was a high school book report shot with a camcorder. It's a movie that was condemned from the beginning. Maybe if it was in 1982 instead of the new millennium, this movie could fly. But it seems to me that someone hung a rock around the neck of this albatross, which was flowing at a constant speed.
