This film seems a little clumsy around the edges, as if not enough zaniness had been thrown when it should have been. But I especially appreciated. <br /> <br /> The story is more than a bit absurd, no expectation of "something real" should be included in your visual experience. Check your brain at the door. This will not be necessary and could be an obstacle if not. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed Clennon's performance as a true Dr. Baird. His role was perfect to give Aykroyd's character a protagonist. What putz the real Dr. Baird was. <br /> <br /> And Matthau was pretty good as a companion to the main character. Boring at first, but finally adorable. Kind of. Type of. Or at least something that using a bar of soap and a lot of water would have been more than helpful. <br /> <br /> Is it really worth watching? If you fancy a parody of the psychiatric profession, of course, why not.
