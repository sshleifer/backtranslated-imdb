I saw Grande Ecole at its world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival. I had no idea what I was entering and if I had any idea, I would not have entered. It's the most pretentious movie I've seen in a long time. He's trying to be provocative, but deep, with his completely frontal homosexual sex scenes - it does not succeed! This is just another bad excuse to show naked people on the big screen. 4/10
