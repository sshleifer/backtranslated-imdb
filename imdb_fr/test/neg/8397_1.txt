How one of you gave more than 2 stars amazes me. I created an IMDb account just to comment on this cr @ p movie. The actors game is cr @ p and the plot is cr @ p. Without the soundtrack of the descent, it would deserve no star (and yet, there are still some scandalously clown pieces, especially those that contain the oboe and that look like cartoon comedy background music the mood desired scenes they haunt) and a cinematography of quality. The dialogue and plot are about as complex as those of a book by Dr. Sues. These actors are horrible. I'm watching this movie right now and, with every word, I'm stunned that you've all swallowed this shit. The only reason I did not turn off the movie is because I created an account on IMDb and published this comment. I search mainstream movies, stupid and dumb movies, indie retro movies and almost all other types / genres, if they are well done. My brother convinced me to rent this rental because he had heard that it was good and that he usually had a lot of taste in the movies. From the moment he told me the title, I looked at him as if he was crazy. I have a hard time putting an end to this debate because there is so much to complain about. The only way for me to rationalize the good odds here is that you have been paid to give this movie a good rating. It is so badly done and nowhere near dramatic, artistic, complex, well written, well preformed, even bearable. If it was the end product of my hard work as a director, I would be embarrassed to make it public, so I do not even feel sorry for the director if he reads this - what the hell did you think, man?
