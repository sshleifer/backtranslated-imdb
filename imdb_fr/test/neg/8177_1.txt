The humor of the adults does not bother me, but this feature was downright dirty. The first 10 minutes consisted of a Pryor swear against a guy who was taking pictures, followed by my profanations even more. I do not know what happened between the last 5 minutes because I went out. After seeing that, I never looked at Richard Pryor the same way again. And to say that he finally animated a children's show. <br /> <br /> If tasteless and tasteless and tasteless jokes make you laugh, you'll surely enjoy it. But if you are an old-fashioned guy, then do not worry.
