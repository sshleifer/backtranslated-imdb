Sorted is a film that looks promising in some departments, but does very little else. A superficial thriller plot (which is only there to chain the sequences of clubs), a game of variable action and a rather ridiculous scenario, stop making Sorted the showcase that the director Jovy had obviously wanted. <br /> <br /> However, although Jovy is sometimes too indulgent (especially when he uses dance music that is often poorly adjusted), it shows potential, and the absence of an anti-drug message is extremely refreshing. However, overall, the film is a missed opportunity and the prospects for a good movie in a nightclub remain somewhere. Regardable anyway.
