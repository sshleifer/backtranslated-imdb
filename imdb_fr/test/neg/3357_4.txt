Sheba Shayne (Pam Grier) receives a telegram informing her that her father may be in trouble. Sheba, a private detective and former cop, goes to the rescue of his father. But someone will stop at nothing to let his father go bankrupt. An attempt to show that their muscles are going badly and Sheba's father is shot in cold blood. These guys played with the bad woman. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe Sheba Baby, the best I can find is Pam Grier Lite, with a very bad acting. For a film by Pam Grier, Sheba Baby is incredibly tame. It's not nearly as violent as some of his previous films. No more awesome pictures of Pam placing a small revolver or razor blades in her afro. The pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his team can not stand up to some of the real bad guys that Pam has seen in his previous films. It's strictly by the numbers and has almost a television sensation. When it comes to bad acting, the bad guys that Pam faces are as loud as ever in their game. As a result, characters like Pilot do not seem as threatening as they should be to movie works. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that there are no moments or elements in Sheba Baby that I did not appreciate (Pam in a wetsuit and Pam wielding a spear gun), it's just that compared to Pam's other films like Coffy, Foxy Brown and even Friday Foster, the film fails. <br /> <br /> One final observation - maybe I'm just more sensitive to these things after 9/11, but I do not remember a time, even in the 70s of security, where you could take a suitcase full of rifles on a plane. When Sheba flies to her father's rescue, she has an arsenal in her luggage!
