I absolutely despise this movie. I wanted to love him - I really wanted him. But dude, oh dude - they were SO with Sara. And the father who lived was pretty lame. It's straight out of the movie Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend THE BOOK. It's amazing. In the book, Sara is honorable and decent and she does what's right ... BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT. She does not have a nasty bone in her body. <br /> <br /> In the film, she is petty and mean. She does little things to find Miss Minchin. In the book, Sara is above such things. She does not rise up against Miss Minchin. She tells the truth and is not intimidated by her. But she does not do stupid and mean things on Sara's part in the movie. <br /> <br /> It bothers me a lot that a lot of people here say that they liked the book and that they love the movie. I can not help but wonder ... did we read the same book? The main purpose of the book was personal responsibility, respectful and honest behavior, ALWAYS telling the truth and facing adversity with calmness and integrity. <br /> <br /> Sara has a happy ending in the book - not the ridiculous survival of her father, but the junction with her partner who was looking for her. In the book, she is supported by this new father figure who loves him and takes care of her and Becky. And Miss Minchin is NOT a chimney sweep. This part of the movie was really stupid. <br /> <br /> See all this praise for this miserable movie troubles me. We rent a movie that glorifies a mean and mean behavior with some tips from the hat to the kindness? Sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity. I do not even recognize her in the movie ... she's not there. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing that Mrs. Burnett is not alive to see this horrible thing. It is horrible and unworthy to bear the title of his book.
