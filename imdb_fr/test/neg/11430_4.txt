Irvine Welsh's follow-up on Trainspotting appears on screen in the form of three short stories taking place in Edinburgh, all containing some of the Welsh brands, drug culture, depression, the working class and Hibernian football club. Uncomfortable to look in places, it is not less than very well written, 2 stories with a dark and comical twist while the 2nd story is a serious plot (and a shocking realism). Will not appeal to most, including myself at one point, but will probably adopt a following worship.
