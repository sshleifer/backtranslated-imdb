As a film buff, I had heard about this infamous movie a long time ago. I had heard that it was essentially a $ 15 million film about the tyrannical rule of the Roman emperor Caligula, completed by hard-core pornography. What struck me was that it was a porn movie but there were great artists like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren !! ?? A week ago I watched a documentary on Caligula on the History channel. This film came back into my head and my curiosity ended up having the best of me, I foolishly rented the DVD and I even more stupidly observed. <br /> <br /> During the first 30 minutes, I witnessed sexual acts and especially violence that would win an NC-17, even by today's standards. Was it really necessary to have the scene of a man closing his urinary tract, then pour him liters of wine, then cut his belly with a sword (all in very graphic details). And a scene where a guy gets his pussy cut and feed his dogs (again with very graphic details) ... and that only scratches the surface. The argument of this film by those who love it seems to be the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and its excesses. In reality, this film is a real exploitation. From beginning to end, you see only endless tortures, beheadings and every kind of violence and rude behavior imaginable (sadomasochism, rape, necrophelia, it just does not stop). There is no idea of ​​Caligula himself, of what could have driven him to go crazy, from his horrible childhood that turned him into a sadistic to adulthood. This is not a historical film, it is shabby. Even the porn in this movie stinks, and through a lot of that when I was not gagging I was just bored. In the end, I was depressed, I did not really want to eat and this movie does the impossible, it can prevent you from making love. <br /> <br /> What were these great actors thinking about when they got into this? I read that the pornographic footage was filmed once the main shoot ended (which is why none of the main actors are in one of these scenes and the quality of these scenes is so poor). But still, and all these actors had to know what they were engaging in. From the opening credits, it is written "Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents". And the scenes in which the famous actors participate are completely disgusting in themselves. Apparently, director Tinto Brass wanted his name removed entirely from the completed film, as did the screenwriter (Gore Vidal). Even John Geilgud and Peter O'toole begged people not to see this when it opened at the Cannes film festival. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film is disappointing given the money spent by the producers. Everything is hidden and troubled as if the film had been deposited in a marsh before being developed, and that is when you have the chance to see a really clear scene. The sound is badly doubled, much of the music is awkward and editing is awful. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I brought this film about myself. My advice ... do not look at this, do not look at it, do not look at it ...... about myself tomorrow night, I'll look at something lighter ... like DAWN OF THE DEAD!
