This review contains a partial spoiler. <br /> <br /> shallow since the beginning, "D.O.A." at least begins as if it could be a slippery and entertaining nonsense like Fincher's "The Game". His central character (Dennis Quaid) suffers from a succession of nightmarish events that seem to be a twisted and cunning thriller. But the plot is overflowing, causing a dramatic turn midway, when the character discovers that he was poisoned and he has only 1-2 days to live. And this, quite simply, is too big a twist to casually add to a story. Once this has happened, the film's only chance of success is to treat someone's psychology in this situation as its main, if not the only subject, but "D.O.A." continue as if it were a normal revelation like any other you might encounter in a thriller. The problem is twofold: first, Quaid's actions will not convince, as it is likely that what someone is in his situation will do; and secondly, even if they were convinced, it is hard to worry about what will happen when the most important point of the plot has already been resolved prematurely. The rest of the film is quite banal for a film of this type, but made more tedious than usual by the slightly processed situation of the character, which logically houses the events that interest the film. Dennis Quaid, in the main role, do not convince as a tired teacher or as a man doomed to death: Meg Ryan is, as often, pretentious and annoying. The soundtrack of the 80s is another negative feature. Look instead for "The Game", which, from similar roots, remains narrow and character-driven, while "D.O.A. derives in developments that only undermine his own premises. As the premise itself is quite intriguing, it is a pity to see it drowned in a surplus plot too overcooked.
