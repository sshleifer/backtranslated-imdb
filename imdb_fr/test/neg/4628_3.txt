I had a lot of trouble watching this movie. Unless you are really very pro-adulterous and you like to hear people talking endlessly about their sexual exploits, I do not see how you could enjoy this movie. Definitely - most of the main characters behaved like horned weasels and boast of LOTS of unfaithfulness became boring. The only thing I liked was the DISGUSTING scene where one of the characters was urinating and blood was splashing everywhere because he had caught an STD ... LARGE SURPRISE!?! Hmm. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie, watch more, Barbarian Invasions. Despite the unimaginable general nature of many characters, the following is VERY engaging and more realistic - well worth your time.
