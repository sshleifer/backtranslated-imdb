..but unfortunately, no one thought to kill Van to save this doomed production. The only positive thing about him in the film is his beautiful singing voice ... Too bad the songs are mostly tasteless and slimy. Why did I hate Van so much? Throughout the film, he had the impression of doing a third-rate imitation with Soupy Sales - with a lot of aggression, bad jokes and much too much energy spent to make everyone laugh. The worst of these moments came when he "taught" the class - these kids made fun of everything he did. Heck, Van could have read the phone book or show them autopsy pictures and they probably would have laughed! Now, Van was not the only bad casting decision in the movie - it was just the most obvious. Of course, having John Gielgud (a charming actor) playing an Asian was ridiculous, as well as Michael York playing Peter Finch's brother !! In the end, because of these insane casting choices, the movie was doomed from the start ... and the worst of them was the terrible God Bobby Van. Now, in real life, he could have been an adorable person and sad to see that he died so young, but with the material they gave him here, I just wanted to tear his tongue out to do it silent. <Br /> <br /> Now, I also mentioned the songs - for example, those terrible songs !! Frank Capra's original LOST HORIZON was a subtle delight, and not a song or dance number in the movie. So why did they decide to add billions of songs that do not help the movie? They only served to make it look like a gooey mess - like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE combined with LOST HORIZON. The end result is a sweet and sickly children's movie, which can not be enjoyed by anyone over 8 years old. <br /> <br /> Now, if you can remove these problems, you have the basics of a decent movie. After all, the plot is beautiful and remains hidden under all goo. Peter Finch is particularly good (although this is certainly not the equal of Ronald Colman in the original). But, considering that the original was an almost perfect classic, why bother with this sticky confection. Who wants to wade in molasses ?! <br /> <br /> By the way, this film was included in Harry Medved's book "The 50 Worst Films". Even though I too did not like the movie, it was not serious enough to deserve to be included in the book. I think it was included mainly because it was a huge box office failure and because it was published only a few years before the book came out. An excellent book. It's just not one of the best selections from dreck's "hall of the hall."
