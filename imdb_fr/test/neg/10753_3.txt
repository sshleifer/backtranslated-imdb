I found this film completely and completely incomprehensible. I knew some facts about the Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and confusing. The images were oddly interesting, but I was looking for a biographical and / or critical account of Caravaggio's life and works, not a trip for LSD-type addicts. The dialogue was very confusing and the round trips in time via the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes were extremely distracting. If it had been called an "artistic film", I would not have bought the DVD; now I have a DVD that I will never see again and who would buy it? I prefer mainstream movies and not those that require translation or elucidation. Congratulations to this one for me!
