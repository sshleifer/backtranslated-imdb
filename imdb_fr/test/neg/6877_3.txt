He's there. A new horror icon for the new millennium. Better than Freddy. More dangerous than Jason Vorhees. More devilish than Michael Myers. Hard to believe, I know. But his time has come .... <br /> <br /> Ray The sting. <br /> <br /> Yeah, the antagonist, Ray is a complete sting. It's partly because of the nasty things he does. Also because he has a scar (oh, scary) on his face. But mostly because Ray The Prick was hunted down. <br /> <br /> Yes, Ray does not channel the evil. He does not even become accursed, not even by a voodoo spell. No, Ray The Prick has been milked. As DeNiro once said, "you can milk anything with nipples". And Ray was milked. Difficulty. <br /> <br /> How do you treat the harm you ask? Snake nipples, I answer. Snake nipples. <br /> <br /> Why are you asking Ray? Because he's an idiot, I answer. Capital P. <br /> <br /> Beware of the New Line Pictures extravaganza "Freddy vs. Ray The Prick". <br /> <br /> You thought the new savior of my horror was Jeeper The Creeper? And much more now, because Ray The Prick is here. And I'm scared. <br /> <br /> Too bad for the atmosphere without-PG-13, work quality without original film, because Ray is a star.
