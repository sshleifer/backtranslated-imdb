I was in Blockbuster and I saw a movie called "Dark Harvest". The art of the cover looked great, the plot was not that bad, and the slogan (you reap what you sow) gave the movie a beautiful appearance. But I was stupid that day, because I did something that I should never have done. I rented a movie "Straight To Video Independent Movie Horror". With my best rentals, I went home, I released Dark Harvest in the DVD player and it all started. I thought I would watch the trailer once the film was finished (BAD IDEA), but I watched it anyway. NOW to the magazine. * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * First, the game of "children" is zero, and the scene where the 2 main characters speak, the lighting is zero and buildings even look fake! Now they go to this house where Sean Connel's family (I think he's the main character, I do not care) was living there. Suddenly, they all begin to get killed by ... (panting) A KILLER SHAKER !!!! AHHH !!!!! The scarecrow is obviously the definition of the small budget, and the scenes where the scarecrow is computerized look so wrong that it's hilarious. It sounds like dinosaurs and everything! And then at the end ... they shoot the scarecrow with a gun (which is red for God's sake and it looks like he was bought for a dollar from the local family) and he pauses for a moment then ..... BLOWS UP !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Save time, I tell you that this film is bad. If you need to spend an hour and a half, look at the wall, because looking at the wall is a pleasure compared to this disaster. It's pretty fun though. <br /> <br /> General Note: F If there was something lower ** F - ** That I would give it.
