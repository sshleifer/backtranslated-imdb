Mr. Moto's Gamble has a rather simple plot: when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison, it is Mr. Moto even more mysterious to solve the case. <br /> <br /> I'm shocked by the number of positive reviews of Moto's Gamble on IMDb. Because for me ... well, I found it extremely disappointing. I appreciate Mr Moto and I appreciate Charlie Chan, but I can not say that I cared about this mish-mash of both. For those unfamiliar with Moto Gamble's story, it was originally a Charlie Chan movie. But when Warner Oland stepped back, some scenes and actions were rewritten for Peter Lorre and Mr. Moto. As I said, the final result left me uncomfortable. Mr. Moto is not Chan. He is more mysterious, more athletic and more exotic. So trying to put Moto in a Chan movie is like trying to get a square peg into a round hole - it does not work. And listening to Lorre / Moto trying to deliver one of the euphemisms of the Chan brand just sounds ridiculous. Add to that the fact that nearly 10 minutes of the already brief 72 minutes consist of boxing scenes (something I never seem to like) and you get a movie that I could not help but not like. If I have to say something positive, I would highlight the performance of Keye Luke. But even he is not close enough to save me the bet of Mr. Moto in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but a 4/10 is the best I can give to this one.
