This film is anything but the true story of Phoolan Devi. The claims of director Shekhar Kapoor are thwarted by the fact that he shot the entire film without even meeting Phoolan Devi, on whose life this film is supposed to be based! The excuse being this meeting with the woman would have interfered with the conception of the director's story! The film wastes the opportunity to sensitize society to the plight of lower caste women in Indian society and ends up being a stereotype portraying Phoolan Devi as an angry woman whose only motivation is revenge. No wonder, this film by Shekhar Kapoor was a hit in the West as it met their non-bollywood tastes!
