When you watch low-budget horror movies as much as I do, you get to know who participated in the making of the film, with each director adding their own cheese flavor. Such is the case with Jack-O. When I watched this really horrible movie, I had the undeniable feeling that Fred Olen Ray was involved, maybe not as a director, but in a way, and doing some research, I discovered that I was right. Only Fred and a handful of other people could write something so pathetic, and this movie smelled Fred Olen Ray. Unless you like Fred Olen Ray (and God only knows why someone would do it), avoid this movie. If you rent a photo Olen Ray, rent a chain Chainsaw Hookers, it's the only bright star in the dark and gloomy world of Olen Ray.
