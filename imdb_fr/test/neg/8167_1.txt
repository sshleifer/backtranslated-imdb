It is difficult to make a bad film with the sporting theme "The oppressed finally succeeds", but this film succeeds admirably. I do not understand how this film is useless and boring. <br /> <br /> I guess the director could not decide if he was the runner or the coach. This ends up affecting neither of them. In the end, who cares? None of the characters has a nice personality. There is nothing in the film that may interest you. Even the "bad guy" is not really bad. (I think he's in two scenes, and apparently he's on a kind of barbituate.) I think he's asking her, once and politely, to leave the coach and train with him. Then later, he asks him to settle down with him. that's all. Conflict! Voltage! What will she do? !! <br /> <br /> -What characterizes the race? Has the director ever seen a marathon? Christine's form is so incorrect that she is absurd, as is the form of the supposed "champion" with whom she competes (a character without lines.) - Maybe they could have hired, you know, a real runner?) <br /> <br /> -And the speed at which the race exceeds the understanding. Were they running or brisk walking? It's actually laughable. I can literally walk faster backwards than they ran in the big race. Maybe it was too difficult to move the cameras at the real speed? <br /> <br /> Another nonsense: (spoiler, I guess) At one point in the big race, the two women in the head fall inexplicably, in the same way time. What they fell on is a mystery. Maybe they are both exhausted and fallen? -And then they get up, but do not start running for perhaps 30 seconds. Oh yes, very realistic. This ridiculous event does not even add tension, because the other runners are not close and at this stage you have been numb in a state of catatonia. <br /> <br /> -I particularly appreciated the fact that all four of his male teammates, all highly trained athletes, give up the big race because of horse-cart, tendon tie or something else as improbable. <br /> <br /> But who cares? This film has almost no tension, no resolution, nothing. An annoying old trainer discovers a runner without any personality, with a past failure to which he is hardly alluded. They train a lot. She is not happy. They train a little more. She wins a big race. Woopie. <br /> <br /> My description is actually more interesting than the movie itself. I just saved you 90 minutes. Avoid this one like the plague.
