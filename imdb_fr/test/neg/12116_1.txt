TV Award Indicates that half of the time, it is available for nominations in Comic Relief, talk shows, TV shows, game shows, charity shows, Brighton. Just when you end up thinking that you can find salvation in the wireless network, the thrill of good old JR strikes you like a freight train going from Texas to downtown New York. It has lost an hour and is trying to catch up. <br /> <br /> About this show (FNWJR). <br /> <br /> This is a classic chat show format with JR As a host and local band that gathers more than four gay men (ha ha ha, ow my Andy Davis, Season 1 had left or had been fired to give way to Ross's ego. <br /> <br /> Ross will use his guests less as props and will not hear them speak because of his attitude. is my ball and I bring it home ", you also see that the bigger the guest is, the more willing he is to lie and suck, to get in with the big boys (like the weak at school who trolling with the bully). <br /> <br /> However, when a little reality TV star approaches, he humiliates them with joy, asking personal questions about the past and telling them their lack of narrative Nt to get the laughs .. Sometimes he underestimates the popularity of a guest, says something to minimize it, then, when the audience is shocked, he turns around quickly and begins to become the type to fall himself, the best example of this being when the star of "Life On Mars", John Simm came and he said: How can anyone like you find work, your look OK, but not the Hollywood one? (Remember that Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry were in the green room, he was really trying to suck them before they were even on the couch). When the audience was in shock, Ross quickly said, "What, I'm a little light to wear this corset, I do not know what I say." If he has no life on television, he will love the four gay men on the piano with more outdated jokes than his fad. <br /> <br /> It's a different story. when a Hollywood actor or a big television star makes his appearance, he will tell them stories to humiliate them. When an actor explains that he was in a support group, Jonathon Ross says something like, "Wow, well, I'm always going to see a group I was trying to watch for the support group, to make them feel that they were wanted. "with an underlined message:" please, like me, I was probably one of the people who encouraged you when you were in your group ". Add to that an audience of Ross fans so addicted to all the old jokes and all the craziness, it really makes it a mediocre show. <br /> <br /> You'd better watch American talk shows instead, they're more scripted but not nearly as hard to watch.
