This film was a waste of time. It looks nice, nice scenery, a well-done acting, seems serious and seems to lead somewhere so that you stay tuned while waiting for a significant gain. It does not happen <br /> <br /> It surprises me that so much effort can be made in a movie. This is clearly a professional job and a result that seems nothing less than a movie B. <br /> <br /> Save your precious time and watch a good French movie like The Visitors (funny), Jean de Florette or Manon of Spring. I do not remember the language spoken in Europa Europa, but it's another great film - heavy, but worth watching. <br /> <br /> This film seems to promise a lot, but does not deliver anything.
