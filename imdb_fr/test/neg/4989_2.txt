Let me start by saying that I never wanted to see this movie; I had to watch it one day and I thought I could enlighten and appreciate what it is, and that it could be fun. What I thought with this expectation was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without exception. First of all, there is nothing humorous at all. The creators expected the humor to be ridiculous / passable if they included sarcasm in every line that came out of Underdog's mouth and used faded scene after scene, played on aspects that "charmed" the side Playful public, while making them "ooh" and "ah" for more with boring action scenes and tasteless, dull performances that made me want to scream at all the spectators who enjoyed it. The acting was monotonous, the tedious humor and the characters / plot had the impression of spending about 10 minutes creating their entire personality, which left the actors / actresses without interest any latitude to portray their characters with the least depth possible. This film is clear and simply horrible in all areas and only children under 10 can enjoy it, and even if it is the age group to which it was intended, it does not excuse to have been so feel so penitent. Parents, spend your money on Up, Wall-E, the Spiderwick Chronicles, The Water Horse or Hotel for Dogs, recent movies for family and kids, or even Alvin and the Chipmunks, it's better than this junk!
