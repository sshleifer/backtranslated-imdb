"In the sweltering summer of 1958, the Deuces, a group of Brooklyn soldiers, are threatened when the leader of a rival gang, the Vipers, is released from prison." Leon (Stephen Dorff), the leader of the Deuces, tries to guide his boys through bloody fights to prevent the Vipers from entering, but when his brother (Brad Renfro) falls into a sensual - and dangerous - relationship with Annie (Fairuza Balk), the sister of a Viper, and that his own girlfriend is brutally attacked, Leon and his gang are plunged into a merciless war to save his brother, his daughter and his neighborhood! "according to the description of the DVD cover. This is certainly not a "Basketball Journal". <br /> <br /> Think of it as if "West Side Story" was hit in the head with baseball bats and steel pipes, the ball having left Brooklyn with the Dodgers. "Deuces Wild" features beautiful Hollywood sets, 1950s cars, and soundtrack songs; and, for the most part, beautifully photographed by John A. Alonzo. The story and direction never go beyond these assets, which allows the film to reach a peak during its first minutes and go down. The casting looks good when you read the credits, but it translates into a flabby jumble of dummy pompadours, blood and Brylcreem ?? and a scared wig. A feeling of sadness and regret permeates the production. <br /> <br /> *** Deuces Wild (5/3/02) Scott Kalvert ~ Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro, Fairuza Balk, Frankie Muniz
