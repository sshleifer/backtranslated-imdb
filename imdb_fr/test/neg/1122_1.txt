When I discovered that there was a Christmas Vacation 2, I could not wait to buy the DVD. I sent my money and watched it as soon as it went through the mailbox. I love all the national movies of lampoons with a prosecution of Chevy, and I bet he was glad he was not in this one! I could not believe how bad it was, you'd think it's impossible not to laugh at a national lampoon movie, but trust me! . This film probably looked like a good idea on paper with cousin Eddie as the main character. He started to get upset right from the beginning of the movie and became totally insane in the middle of the film and at the end of the film. I was brain dead and could not remember what had happened! .
