"Midnight Clear" has a good idea. A group of overly educated and brilliant GIs are sent by incompetent leaders as part of a vague patrol mission around an isolated farmhouse on the eve of the Battle of Bulge. GIs meet a group of exhausted German regulars in combat, and it becomes obvious that they do not want to fight anymore. <br /> <br /> That's where the problem lies. It's really very simple. If the Germans want to surrender, they do it and that's the end of the movie. If the Germans want to fight, they do it and it's also the end of the film. So, instead of doing either the GIs or the Germans, we play together, even throwing snowballs at some point. Interesting for one or two scenes, but it quickly becomes very annoying. After all, they are GERMANS. The enemy. Nothing in this film makes me think that they should not be taken prisoner or killed. The film does nothing to make them more human. In fact, much of what the German characters did ME made me want to shoot them, including a scene where the German officer refused to deal with a Jew or surrender to a mere enlisted man ! Why should I care about these characters? Shoot it and move on to the Battle of the Bulge. It's a lot more interesting, anyway. <br /> <br /> A good scene: the GIs come back from a position identical to that of the German, where they had the Germans in sight, but did not shoot. While walking in a clearing, they realize that a group of Germans make target their mausers. The Germans are about 100 meters away. The GIs then do something that I have NEVER seen any GI doing in a Sillywood movie. They throw their rifles and raise their hands! As unusual as it may be in the movies, it's a very good reaction to get shot at a gun that distance. Although it seems far away, in reality, the range of these rifles is at close range. I would bet someone working on this movie was a saddler!
