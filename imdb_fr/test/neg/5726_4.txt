This, in my opinion, is a very bad film that announces Arnold Schwarzenegger as a star (although he is the co-star) to sell more copies. Obviously inspired by similar theme films "Conan", this movie does not seem to be so nice and ends up not entertaining at all. <br /> <br /> Bridgette Neilsen performs the role of Sonja, a beautiful woman who was offered an incredible ghostly force after the looting of her village, the death of her family and her rape even by the soldiers of the Queen Gedran (Sandahl Bergman). Gedran is a tyrant queen who wants to control the barbarian world and seeks a talisman protected by Sonja's sister. After discovering what happened, Sonja is getting ready to take revenge and must at the same time save the world from Gedran's anger. Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, tries to protect her, whether she likes it or not. <br /> <br /> The first major problem of this film is its beginning. The events that preceded the moment when Sonja received her powers would have easily allowed ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable film to be made. However, the beginnings are precipitated in what appears to be a short minute "Previously". segment of a television show. If they had really integrated these events into the story and eliminated the filling a little later, they might have been able to buy that movie, but unfortunately they did not do it (I wonder why the director Richard Fleischer has only made two films since Red Sonja). <br /> <br /> This film also features some of the most annoying characters in history, such as Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.), who is a stupid character and only adds an overabundance of camps to the film, which works but in this case fails miserably. It was obviously written in the film for comic relief, but with the film's general absurdity, it was still another costly mistake for ?? Red Sonja '. <br /> <br /> For all his faults, there was good fighting scenes involving Neilsen and Arnie worth mentioning, but these are not enough to save this turkey. The acting is about as good as possible for films of this quality and even Arnie did not seem to care much about his performance. I do not recommend this movie at all; for me, it's a loss of an hour and a half. My rating for ?? Red Sonja '?? 3/10
