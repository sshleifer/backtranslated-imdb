Well, this movie is really "drunk" HAHA It's a bit like the attitude of this movie. The plot is just a copy of Pulp Fiction, all right, that's okay, but do this piece if "PLUMP" (haha)! It's really unbelievable. The story is so pathetic, and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs. He tried to make some jokes from various other movies and failed most of the time. I mean, I have a sense of humor, but that's not really the way to go for fun. Most of the supposedly "funny" moments are completely ironic. The film is quite short and runs around 75 minutes in all. They could have done a lot more funny work, seeming to have made fun of a blockbuster, they were playing, and hey! I think they lost! <br /> <br /> Overall PLUMP Fiction, "PLUMPABLE" is it, but you will not collect much at all! <br /> <br /> Is it worth looking again and again ?: Not once is enough, in fact, it's more than enough! <br /> <br /> Is it worth the rent? Ummm..As I said, it's "PLUMPABLE", but you'll only harvest a few "PLUMPS"! <br /> <br /> Overall, out of 10: a 4 out of 10!
