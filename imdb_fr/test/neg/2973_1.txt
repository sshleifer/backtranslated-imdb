Why instant noodles are not instant, this is the thorny problem I put on the knees of an angry Sherpa on one leg; he replied angrily that the noodles were not his bag, so I answered "What bag?" He looked further. <br /> <br /> Some of you will wonder why the Sherpa has only one lower appendage. <br /> <br /> The sherpa, which we will call Sherpa 5, for data protection reasons, injured toe. "How!?!" I hear you ask, I will continue, as we have learned in the review of Donkey Punch (2002) Irene by sneaky sneaks and dirty winks, etc. tried in vain to teach the angry Sherpas the slight peculiarities of the ladies. Sherpa 5, known for its violent tirades against democratic leaders in the post-revolutionary years of the United States of America and its consequences on the mentalities of its population in the postmodern empire that now exists, through Country invasions smaller than that, washed away in a river of violence because of his lack of understanding of the ladies. According to an eyewitness, he allegedly pushed Mardi Gras like a defenseless banjo string, brandishing a stick with a fingernail across it. After the fight that followed, 5 llamas were left without their left testicles. Bush and Sherpa 5 had the nail stuck in his big toe. <br /> <br /> The sherpa lifestyle is as modest as the nuns', with only rudimentary care facilities at 15,000 feet above sea level. As a result, when the hut first relief was opened, only a debt acknowledgment for a spam box was found. Sherpa 5 was jumping like a dark-haired woman on a noose, until Irene broke loose like a rooster in a henhouse and suggested that she dip her illness into a llama spit. Sherpa 5 accepted the procedure. To calm him down, a bottle of Glenfiditch, aged 100, was produced. Some say she was left behind by an angry Scotsman, who would be the ancestor of angry Sherpas. One under the influence, the toe was bathed up to ribbed, dressed with Irenes slightly dirty diaphragm and some blue adhesion. Some of you may think that this procedure would do no good to the Sherpa and that you would be fully justified to have taken this point of view. Only four days later, gangrene took it and a week later, the leg was removed through the use of even tighter elastics.
