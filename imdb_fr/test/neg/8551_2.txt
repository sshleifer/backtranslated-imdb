Many actors have a multitude of good film roles in their souls. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple. <br /> <br /> Then there is Linda Blair. "The Exorcist". That's it. <br /> <br /> When you see "Chained Chained" and look at Linda Blair in it, you have to wonder what went through her head. <br /> <br /> Certainly not. , "Oh my god: Oscar for Best Actress, I'm coming here!" <br /> <br /> Just another film about women in prison, as they used to save in the 70s, this one actually bears names. John Vernon plays the dean ... I mean, the director (with a spa in his office, I wonder what he said to the entrepreneur?), Stella Stevens appears, even Henry Silva and Louisa Moritz show how much they needed the job. <br /> <br /> And a special mention, of course, for our heroine, Sybil Danning, as a bisexual prisoner who stages poor Blair. To paraphrase Sybil is like Sybil and all that Sybil does is perfect. Make you forget what awful movie you are watching. <br /> <br /> Almost. <br /> <br /> Two stars. One for Sybil and another for trying to make Linda Blair a sexual symbol. What could have possessed them (get it?)?
