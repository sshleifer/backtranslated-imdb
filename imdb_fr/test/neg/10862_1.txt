Oh my god, this movie is so poor, I'm amazed to have managed to watch everything .. <br /> <br /> First, I would like to say that Vinny Jones should only play a rogue in London that ends in history .. <br /> <br /> Pisttolero is so unconvincing that his almost comedy .. Banging in Dennis hopper and David Carradine did not save this movie .. in fact I think it's a total comedy and as a comedy he deserves his 1 star .. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs .. Vinny Oh, my god, I thought I had seen everything while playing this Irishman. Handyman: P <br /> <br /> I think the average viewer realize that this movie is maybe just one will ever be kind of movie .. I can not see how anyone could actually fall that shit
