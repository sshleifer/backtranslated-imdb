If you think it's nice to be obsessive about who you're in love with, then I can imagine giving it a good rating ... but I can not imagine that this theme of obsession and little respect for others (like the teachers who try to help him) are all you would like to teach your children. Yes, the way Victoria treated Paulie is also bad, but guess what. It's life. Is not this a more important lesson to learn to overcome these disappointments and make the most of your life? Or is falling from the roof a better lesson to teach our children? Secondly, when Mary's father did not show up for dinner and Paulie helped Mary free herself from her anger, she even said that she wanted to be dead ... I do not think it's a good message to deal with. your disappointments with anger.
