Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy and Tuscany is beautiful, but this movie is not better than mediocre and it's generous. The narrative is grafted onto a travelogue and has absolutely no implication. <br /> <br /> Located in a suburb of Newark, for example, the plot would be considered ridiculous. The Tuscan countryside and the occasional scenes taking place in Florence and Positano are the only things that save the film. A movie about the variety that is slowly flowing under the sun would have served to better show what it is certainly the most beautiful localities around the world.
