This is Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature film. It seems he was not yet ready to adopt a coherent pattern, shifting from a faithful adaptation of the classic novel to Rebecca to an espionage thriller in Foreign Correspondent, and now to this romantic comedy in the mold of " Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had become coherent to such an extent that it was unable (or at least reluctant) to deviate from it. then it was unwise for him to get out of his usual genre and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate.In Rebecca, it was really great to see Hitchcock forced by his producer and the source text, forced to turn his technique into dramatic gothic, but to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, there is a huge mismatch between form and content - in other words, Hitchcock was not Ernst Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> Let's look at the romantic angle first. best love scenes in Hitchcock's movies were wild, passionate and slightly dangerous ?? "Never fallen in love with someone you should not have?" situation, and it was great to portray that. It's something that makes a much older movie, Rich and Strange, one of the few non-thrillers from Hitchcock to really work. Hitch is not so good though when it comes to a softer and more familiar love story. A soft, gentle touch is required and Hitch does not. <br /> <br /> Second, take the comedy. Of course, Hitchcock's movies could be funny ?? Lady Vanishes is probably the best example ?? but only when the jokes have been sprinkled throughout the story. The master of suspense is simply not enough of a comedy director to create a funny bones movie. He cuts scenes as he would in a thriller ?? opposite angles catchy people talking, close-ups inserted hands and feet, shooting point of view ?? but does not allow for comic timing or focuses on gags. For example, we see a few close-ups of Carole Lombard's costume that burst in front of appearances, but these are timed more as if it reveals a crucial point of the plot and had no comical impact. From time to time, Hitchcock's style roughly coincides with comedy ?? for example, the disposition of the characters in the club scene, where Robert Montgomery tries to make him feel like he is with the sophisticated pretty woman at the next table ?? but these moments are rare. <br /> <br /> Even the actors of Mr. and Mrs. Smith are not up to par. I'm not sure it's Robert Montgomery's strength, and he's boring here. This is of course where the strength of "Queen of Screwball" lies, and yet, even if it plays well, the scenes are simply not designed to capture comic performances. Even Jack Carson, who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to slip in front of the camera, can not improve things. Of course, the screenplay does not help any of these beautiful actors in comedy, even if the basic story is not really bright to laugh, even if the basic story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The comedy that Hitchcock did after that was the problem with Harry, and it worked because it played on his usual suspense. However, it was only when the story could exist regardless of the humor, when the basic frame was suspense ?? as in The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot? Hitchcock was able to do the comedy well.
