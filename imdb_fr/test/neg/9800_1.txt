Once upon a time, in the 1940s, an actress named Veronica Lake. A beautiful young talented woman who has already been very sought after for many Hollywood photos with big budget. Fast forward to the late 1960s, age, alcoholism and bad luck tarnished everyone's favorite actress. Miss Lake now decides that the time has come to follow in the footsteps of her comrades (?), Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, and fall back on the good old Horror. But a feast of flesh? Really? She could not have been so washed. To put it mildly, Flesh Feast is a lifeless garbage bin, probably one of the 5 worst films I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. Lake plays the role of a scientist who plots with the Nazis to bring Hitler back to life, with youth restoration experiments involving worms, yes, worms. Unless you are a big fan of Heather Hughes, run away and never look back !! <br /> <br /> I know very little about this character from Veronica Lake, as well as about 40-year-olds, but to think that such a successful career has become as dark as this one is rather sad. The feast of flesh is almost impossible to obtain, and by almost, I mean absolutely. Directed by Brad Grinter, director of Nudist Camp Pictures, and the man who, by chance, brought us the greatest movie B of all time, Blood Freak, a few years later. One wonders if that's what Blood Freak would have been if Grinter had not co-directed with Steve Hawkes? If so, then God bless Steve Hawkes. You would not think that a religious turkey monster, inspired by the blood-of-drugs, could be THAT much better than experiments involving Maggots and Hitler, but it's really, really. So forget that you have already heard of this one and go find Blood Freak, he is just waiting to entertain you. A few years later, Lake Veronica dies of Hepititas, has broken and has been forgotten. The end. I hate you, Flesh Feast. 1/10
