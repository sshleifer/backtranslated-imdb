One of the worst movies I've seen in the 90s. I used it often as a landmark when watching other movies. "At least, it was not as bad as Caro Diario." Three absolutely useless segments, all featuring the director playing himself - and he's not that interesting. An entire segment on this hypochondriac at the doctor. Another who presents him riding the campaign on his scooter. For three interesting minutes and fifteen other tortures. <br /> <br /> The only factor that buys us is that the scooter scene has been programmed for Keith Jarrett's "Koln Concert". Made me go home and rediscover this wonderful album. The best thing you can say about the director / actor / selfish is that he has a lot of taste in music.
