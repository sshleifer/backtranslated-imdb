A wallflower is thrown into the sea and dreams in a fantasy pirate as a young lady in love with a pirate apprentice. Energetic and good-natured, perhaps, but a poor company; a failed musical mailing of "The Pirates of Penzance" with a cheap backlot sensation, wan bubblegum songs and a constant and exaggerated listening. Kristy McNichol's film career was a success after that, while the great director Christopher Atkins can not understand any particular emotion, his voice faltering in search of a suitable tone. You have to ask yourself, if this is the best title they could offer, what is the spirit level in the script? The film's affection for musicals is not spoiled with its penchant for gliding to the "Airplane!", Though McNichol does overtime sparkling and almost gives an endearing touch. For the most part, it's an embarrassment. * 1/2 of ****
