Is it a game or a movie? In all honesty, I looked at this one outside the "no choice". It is a very big waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> It seems that Hong Kong films are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Try to make more effort and give money to a production and make us want to watch rather than watch what you want to watch. <br /> <br /> The graphics are so horrible that they looked like something from low-resolution games from the early to mid-90s (compared to today's movie.) <br /> <br /> > The way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90s Wing Commander game, the third installment in the series, stop regressing and make sure our Asians look so bad compared to big Hollywood guns. <br /> <br /> Of course they have big budgets and better actors, but we have some of the oldest stories, myths and legends, the best techies and maybe the biggest base of graphics talent in the world, so what happened so bad, did you start using the same companies you worked with so many movies ?! Please, stop wasting our time and money. HK films move so quickly downward. Have not you claimed to be the Hollywood of the East? I do not think so.
