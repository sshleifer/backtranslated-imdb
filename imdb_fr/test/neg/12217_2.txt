Asmali Konak has undoubtedly become one of the best TV series in Turkey. Thanks to its unique cinematographic approach and its visual approach to filming, the series has acquired an important base with constantly beaten scoring records. Personally, I do not agree with the fact that singers become actors (hence Ozcan Deniz - the main actor), but I guess the numbers speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film, it was disgusting to see how much can destroy such a plot. Years in the making, this film was able to oversee every downhill story that existed in the series. Not only that, cultural mistakes were unacceptable, with an idiotic scene involving family members dancing (to the Greek) and smashing plates, which nowhere exists in Turkish culture. <br /> <br /> Some claim that the film should be considered as an independent film and not a continuation of the TV series, but this theory has a significant fall; the film was marketed as follows: it will resume where the series has stopped and conclude the series once and for all. So, with this note in mind, I and everyone I know, would have asked for a refund and agreed to stay outside the theater to warn other victims.
