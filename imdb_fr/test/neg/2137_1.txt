boring and horrible Italian piece of garbage on a scientist who seems to spend most of his time drinking beer (that's what makes him American, no? Our scientists spend most of their academic life Of course, all the very good theories come from), who is studying something (calls from dolphins, models of fish migration, who knows). He hears a strange sound in his headphones, which proves that his radio picks up a station in Jamaica. At the same time, a Jack Skellington girl with one of the worst blonde hair of the 80s I enjoy watching is trying to calm the dolphins of the Seaquarium where she works, because they are apparently upset by the amount of fish she has recently distributed. The beginning of the film was a very badly colored scenario on two very boring and very Italian people whose boat is attacked by something invisible under the water. The whining woman is never seen again (better part of the story) and the body of the boys is found without legs. The weak and alcoholic scientist (who has an inexplicable accent, English-American-Italian) and the baton with hair in hay are beginning to theorize that there is some kind of giant monster hiding under the seas off the coast. Italian coast ... uh. .Florida. <br /> <br /> They use an electrician to install a submarine microphone, so that the monster can sing karaoke. This guy has a beautiful girlfriend, whose only disadvantage is pronouncing Peter "Pey-tah", but for some reason, he is sexually attracted to the anatomical skeleton with frizzy hair, a situation that lets his eyes blink. <br /> <br /> The dubbing is awful, the editor in chief a spaz and the narrative in general a yawn. There are some details about how this strange scientific society genetically engineered this giant mackerel shark-squid-giant thing for some reason that makes no sense, and a really unpleasant, greasy-haired guy kills women , always for no apparent reason. A stupid sheriff and his deputy, accompanied by a female scientist (who, we know, is smart because she wears big glasses). At one point, the woman scientist attacks the huge and terrible monster (yeah, that's right, Ed Wood's giant octopus was more believable) with only a small ax, and she wins the contest. Hooray for the skinny little women, who are obviously the best monster hunters! <br /> <br /> The solution to the problem of the giant thing is to blow up half of the Everglades, leaving a dead zone several kilometers in all directions. Hell with ecology and the environment, no? We must kill this giant monster! In the end, the electrician and his sweetheart leave at sunset on his Vespa, which is OK. since she overcame the death of his colleagues and he is not too angry that his girlfriend was made by the crazy fat-haired. Hooray for true love! Wait a minute, is there anything fishy about it?
