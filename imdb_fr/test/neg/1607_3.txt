Not only did I read the book and watch the movie, but I was stationed aboard the USS John F Kennedy when they filmed this film. Needless to say, film crews and actors can try to attract people who try to do their job. Now, about the movie. As a career marine, I was very upset with the way they showed their lives aboard an aircraft carrier. I could distinguish the inaccuracies throughout the movie (anyone who lived on a carrier could), but it would take pages. One scene that stands out in particular is the one where they were in the CIC (Combat Information Center) and watched a RADAR contact cross the screen. Every time the contact moved, he would beep. Unfortunately, this equipment does not sound like that (I was a technician on this equipment). The book was based on facts, not the film. The next television series was just as bad and the Navy finally figured out that taking charge of this series would just make them look bad. If you are a member of the Navy, look at this to see how a movie about porters' lives is seen by Hollywood eyes. If you're not a member of the Navy, look at Midway or Top Gun, at least these movies are entertaining and fact-based.
