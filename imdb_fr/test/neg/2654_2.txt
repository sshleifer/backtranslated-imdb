I work in a video store, so I try to see the movies that we are about to release each week. I do not have a problem with that. In fact, I think it's a privilege. Not so with this movie. . . After an hour and a half of our hero who moaned and scolded scenes in scenes, I really wondered if they had planned to go straight to the point. I felt I should be paid to watch this at home, during my free time. And if I had known there would be another hour to bear, I might have left there. I did not care about the characters, the shooting was commonplace and Ford gave the impression that kissing was like a chore. Even the score was incongruous and discordant. Such a waste.
