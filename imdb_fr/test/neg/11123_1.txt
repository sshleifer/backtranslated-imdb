Chupacabra: Dark Waters must be one of the most tasteless movies ever. I was expecting at least fair entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved and, after seeing this film, I can honestly say that I have drastically reduced my opinion of Mr. Davies. <br /> <br /> Why? The acting is incredibly poor. An excellent actor like Davies should have asked for more from the cast and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was watching the clock and was hoping the check would not be bounced back. To say that it has just arrived would be a euphemism. But at least he showed himself. The rest of the distribution seems to have been sent by their respective employees to the various restaurants in Los Angeles where they work as servers. You talk about a cast of strangers! This is the kind of casting that never appears in movies again. They act as if they had been auditioned while they were waiting at the employment office. <br /> <br /> What about special effects? Store bought firecrackers, styrofoam, a cheap rubber suit and CGI effects that seem to come from my Atari game of 1980. I've seen horrible special effects used in Sci-Fi movies, but it looked like cut-and-paste done in kindergarten by someone's child. I was expecting Mr. Crabs and Sponge-Bob to come in late to fight Chupacabra. Not to mention that all the stories of the creature describe it as a little beast resembling a Gremlin. It would have been a good movie for a character resembling Leprechaun. Instead, we have a gigantic gigantic creature that is shown walking with accelerated stop-action effects that are laughable. The chupacabra is at one place, then it moves at high speed down the hall and it's worth a laugh to see it.
