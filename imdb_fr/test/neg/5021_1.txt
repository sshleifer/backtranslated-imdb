"Inuyasha" was awful. This series was incredibly exaggerated, but it's nothing more than a tedious group of animated clich√©s. The characters are boring and lifeless, the story is boring and endless. I think it might have been something interesting if he had a better writing, but it seems that the writers of the series have more intentions in the show Inuyasha and his stupid friends fight with monsters and then cry for his tragic love triangle with Kikyou and Kagome and a lot of circles around the same thing over and over again. The script is nerdy and silly and the animation is mediocre. The design of the characters is very ugly, I do not know why everyone loves it, they all have the same face! : Big eyes, small noses, a line like the mouth and the typical haircuts anime. I find "Inuyasha" incredibly boring and silly. It must be one of the most overrated animated shows ever made.
