Bubbling just below the surface of Showtime is a good idea. In fact, this is more like two or three ideas that are constantly struggling for the screentim. This film does not only have its cake and eats it too; he has the whole bakery. <br /> <br /> Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has a media-interrupted drug collapse and a bold, police actor named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is shot and wounded, he angrily takes the camera out of the hands of a harassing journalist, and the tiff unloads him in a new reality TV show produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of many errors and quirks of the film, this wounded partner is never mentioned or evoked for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> De Niro's best gag is his speech in front of a small classroom. Children need to understand how television cops do not behave like real police. The funny thing is, as the movie progresses, her character and Murphy begin to behave more and more like the clich√©s with which they oppose so strongly. In a smarter film, De Niro's diatribe could have been an ironic comment; here, it only shows how bad the movie really is. While a parody of a reality-based police show could be fun, the team of writers and directors Tom Dey (who created the much superior Shanghai Noon a few years ago, see this movie) seems to be on an uncertain foot and instead of slamming. In the television industry, they really leave the light (the hardest thing they seem to be able to say about network executives is that they like to play ping-pong at work). Russo's character has a glimmer of diabolical delight in his eyes, but his dialogue and actions seldom match the actress's enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Having only a few screens to hold my attention, my mind began to wander, which is dangerous in a movie with so many intrigues. For example; if Showtime (the name given to the detective series) is such a success, why does not anyone seem to recognize that De Niro and Murphy are at work? Moreover, if their investigation of the smuggler and his average entourage, Vargas, is televised, why on earth did he not be told that he was on his trail? Again, given the actions of this villain, I should not be surprised; It's the same joker who is very angry at a partner for using his new supergun without approval, jeopardizing an agreement, and then depending on what? Using a dozen superguns to level his entire house, of course! It's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. <br /> <br /> Showtime has fun sometimes, but there is simply not enough for the film, which lasts almost two hours. Worse still, the really smart gags suggest that this movie could have really been something, if only they had added some extra drafts of the script. Murphy speaks and speaks as fast as possible with minimal results, and De Niro seems completely bored. After a totally useless fist fight between cops and gangsters (this does not cause any injuries or arrests), Russo's character shouts, "It's an excellent television!" It may be an excellent television, but it's far from a good movie.
