The previews were so funny that I could not wait to see this movie. I have just arrived home and I must say that I could not have been more embarrassed by this film. Yes, there were times when the jokes were funny, but the stereotyped roles were painful. Joan Plowright is a good actress but the scene with the "ghostwriter" was just bad taste. Needless to say, laughter was rare in the movie theater for a largely white crowd (I was part of a very small handful of blacks).
