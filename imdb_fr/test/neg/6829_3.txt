Let's say you're a producer, you have some money and you sort of have Richard Gear and Bruce Willis, so now all you need is a storyline ... but why 'to worry about it? You see, this movie is really terrible, the acting is very good, but the cast is a terrible equipment and Willis has done his best to embody these characters they just can not play. now, this movie has no plot, or rather, there is something that is trying to be a conspiracy: there is a nasty hit-man (Willis) who is cool dangerous and sophisticated (in fact, there is is not, but from a dialogue between the other characters, you are supposed to have this impression), so this killer has the mission to kill someone, now there is a former IRA prisoner who is Nice and kind and very friendly (equipment) that the FBI releases from prison so he will help them. so now that the FBI is "investigating" to find this man-hit, the investigation consists of a series of unlikely information - as if any person had lost his wallet and someone was using his name to buy a car - this which is always accurate. Since there is no real plot and the script is so shitty, you can not expect real character development or tension, so instead of creating them through the story, they simply add disconnected dramatic music, which tells you that something very dramatic is happening, instead of creating something spectacular. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it's a very bad film and a total loss of time that got an incredibly high score for its level, probably because of the thrown - and it's is exactly what producers were counting on.
