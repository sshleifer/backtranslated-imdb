SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This film was praised as a joke, and what a joke. The film is based on a dog catcher who is looking for El Chupacabra. The catcher dog outfit is so ridiculous. It looks like he has sewn the patch on his hat and, for some reason, shows his "muscles" by rolling up his sleeves. Throughout the movie, especially at night, you can see how bad the lighting was. They are in a very bright car and they drive in black. Often you can see the cameraman's shadow on the ground. The costumes are terrible, the light is terrible and the acting is terrible. It's a good movie to laugh ... maybe.
