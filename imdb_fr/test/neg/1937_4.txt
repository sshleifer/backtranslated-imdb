When reading the comments of other users, the magazine A666333 articulated most of what I felt throughout this film: predictable scenario, clichéd versions of lesbians / heterosexuals (that is to say a woman heterosexual becomes a lesbian while concluding that her husband is violent and aggressive). <br /> <br /> In addition, the score was very disappointing. It was a gentle, sweet and sentimental lift music - another common cliché in lesbian movies. The film would have had some interesting dramatic moments if they had not been destroyed by the music. <br /> <br /> Some scenes about sex and eroticism also struck me as I tried to titillate and elevate the value of the shock, including parts of the final performance scene. The classic "hot and steaming" moments were as boring as the sentimental score. For example, during the pool scene, the women kiss each other, then the camera swings the glass of abandoned wine, the flowing water, the sound of their wheezing over the gentle roar of the waves. <br /> <br /> the elements that I liked were the costume and the acrobatics. They are well choreographed and the development of the attraction between the two characters was very natural during the training scenes. I sincerely smiled during these and during the last scene with the policeman. But they were not enough to balance the negatives or make me appreciate this movie.
