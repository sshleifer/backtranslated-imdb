This film is one of the worst examples of hype. People who read comments on IMDb might be tempted to see this total loss of time, as I was, by fake slogans such as "A return to the horror of the 80s" and so on. This film is nil, from the acting to the realization through the story. Horrible, in all areas. And I really like GOOD horror movies, I'm not at all snobby. It sucks. For reference, I loved The Grudge 1 and 2, Black Sheep, Planet Terror, Texas Chaisaw Massacre, The Others, The Ring, Jason X, Slither, Terror of the Planet and Hated Ring 2, Massacre at the saw make) Wolf Creek, the hills have eyes (remake) hostels 1 and 2, and this movie. Gore does not take over pleasure or originality.
