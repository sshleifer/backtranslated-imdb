There is a good story well hidden and never really used! <br /> <br /> The film is short and too dependent on action and thematic photography; In one way or another, the development of the character and the story has been forgotten. What remains is confused and superficial. <br /> <br /> Turn off your brain and watch, you'll probably find that time goes pretty fast, but unless you're the kind of person who finds the soaps deep and meaningful, this movie will not bring you any satisfaction real. <br /> <br /> Look only if you have nothing better to do and only if someone else pays for the rental of the video.
