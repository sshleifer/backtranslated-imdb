It turned out to be more of a feminine romance-soap opera-thriller than what I was hoping to be ... a live thriller. Yes, the last 20 minutes were full of suspense, but most of the previous 75 were rather boring. <br /> <br /> Ruter Hauer was a little too moderate, not playing his normal and intense character. Natasha Richardson has a silly look most of the time and her character was very unattractive. <br /> <br /> The story is mediocre. It's not as bad as what I'm saying, but it's certainly not what I would look at again, and the back of the VHS describing this movie was misleading.
