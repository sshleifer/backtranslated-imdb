The smart shopkeeper he is, Jess Franco naturally also took advantage of the huge temporary success of psychedelic spy movies like Mario Bava, sensational, "Danger: Diabolik!". Franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film, because he can freely insert so many crazy scenes, kitsch landscapes and intrigues of absurd grotesques that grotesque. And he partially understood that very well, while "The Girl of Rio" revolves around a hateful organization, led by an awesome dressed lesbo, who plots to turn all men into obedient slaves! Unfortunately (for them, at least), the evil plans are in conflict with the daily affairs of the boss of a dreaded crime syndicate, played by George Sanders. All the good ingredients are well presented, but this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfactory adventure movie. The plot is rich in imagination, but apparently only paper, the action is rather docile. The film is also very colorful ... but not too bright and particularly shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. There is a bit of nudity, of course, but not enough according to the normal standards of Franco. All the characters are sick in the head, so the least I expected (or hoped for) were more perverse nuances or frantic themes. Obviously, Franco had a larger budget as usual, and I have to say that he spends this money for more convincing sets and talented cast members. The veteran actor George Sanders ("Village of the Damned", "Psychomania") is one of the best players to have ever appeared in a Franco production. Too bad he can not save "The Girl from Rio" a huge disappointment. A legendary filmmaker like Jess Franco could and should have done more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame ...
