The opening scene of Fircombe Beach, while amusing in itself, unfortunately provides a suitable metaphor for the film - tasteless and faded. In fact, it's not as cheesy as most of the other Carry On series, but maybe that's why it's not really fun. It's a safe bet that the title will appeal to fans of the Benny Hill series, but those looking for pretty women in bikini and miniskirts, even if they will see some, will probably enjoy some of the other titles in the series, such as that "Carry On Stranger" or "Carry On Up the Jungle" more. The emergence of feminism in the early 1970s is used as a conspiracy that seems rather counterproductive.
