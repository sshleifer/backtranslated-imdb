I just watched together the latest film of Atoll K-Laurel and Hardy, known here in the United States as Utopia-on Internet Archive, hoping to see additional images since the IA version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. It turns out to be essentially the same version I had seen before on the Goodtimes Home Video VHS tape that ran in the basement and lasted one hour and 23 minutes (with the exception of no placement of the Welch's Grape Juice label inserted when a bottle was displayed) with the rest of the run time spent on the black blank space. Although Stan feels like he's going to die soon, he still plays a good physical comedy with Ollie for most of the first 45 minutes. Then the intrigue of taking a yacht with a stowaway and a man without a country on board - not to mention a charming French singer also coming to live on an unknown island where they all end up being carried away with possible complications that remove the comedy down and never really recover despite the familiar ending of Ollie saying for the last time to Stan: "Here is another nice mess in which you trained me!" before Stan cries uncontrollably before fading. In other words, if you are a hardcore fan of Laurel and Hardy, it is recommended to watch this movie at least once. Anyone wishing to get acquainted with this team of classic comedies should look for the work they did previously for Hal Roach from the 1920s until 1940, when they completed their latest film, Saps at Sea. Well, even some of the L & H Fox movies (which have not yet seen the two they did for MGM) in the 1940s are better than this one ... Update-8/29 / 09: Just watched missing scenes appeared in the Italian version on YouTube. Cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the captain. In another case, this captain's wife fires a weapon at Cherie. In another article, Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is doubled in treble here!
