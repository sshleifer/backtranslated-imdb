A show about an unbelievably stupid man-child and his wife hot and cunning. 99% of the plots revolve around the fact that Doug does something incredibly stupid, followed by a variable: a) either he hides it from his wife, or b) says to his wife, she will emasculate it, then it is to the father-in-law (Arthur: the transtypic character of Seinfeld) to aggravate the situation. <br /> <br /> And the writers dare to say that he was influenced by the "Honeymooners" (an absolute classic) and that the intrigues are drawn from real situations, unless you live in a cave, you know that it is not true. <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's just say it. If Kevin James had been thin, the show would have been canceled by the pilot. If you're 12 or if you like big jokes ... be my guest, watch this show (or one of Kevin James's movies for that matter). <br /> <br /> I noticed the comparison of several posters. this parody of top quality shows like Friends, Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond - I still wonder how could anyone do that
