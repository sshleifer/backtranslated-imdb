This is the best example I can think of to prove the theory that when Hollywood lacks good ideas, they do terrible things and ruin the first. Now, do not get me wrong, I love the first Beastmaster; I even liked the third, but this film is atrocious. I'm a big fan of fantasy / sword & sorcery movies and I hated seeing such a terrible sequel to a classic like the first Beastmaster. So why do I hate this movie so much? Well, where do I start? First of all, the very idea of ​​the film is ridiculous. Dar and his evil older brother Arklon (who was not mentioned anywhere in the first movie..Huh?) Penetrate into our world via a very practical dimensional portal. You see, Earth is on the same interdimensional parallel plane as Dar's world. Whereas with the first movie, you think that the film is in the past, but with this one, we show you that it's a different world ... it's just one of the many things I do hated about it afterwards. It did not work with "Masters of the Universe", and it does not work here either! Films like this one should take place and stay in their own schedule and their usual environment. For Christ's sake, what's next? Hercules in New York ... uh, uh ... bad example! On the way to ... <br /> <br /> Arklon after a device called neutron detonator to use as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom. So, it's up to Dar, his ferrets, his eagle and his tiger (not the one who is painted with the bomb) to go save the world ... but on the way, they have the help of a young, cool, and the trendy girl of a senator who is caught in all this bazaar and makes him visit Dar, takes him on a ride in his BMW and helps him out of difficult situations, here and there. How practical, right? And speaking of practice, I found it extremely convenient and easy for Arklon to sneak into a highly guarded military base and run away with a stolen and highly destructive nuclear weapon ... even with half of the US Army and from LAPD after him ... waaaaay to easy, even for an evil barbarian wizard of another world. There are so many holes in the plot that I do not know where to start; like why did Arklon go to L.A. Zoo at the end of the movie?!? He has absolutely no reason to go; and would not it be the last place where you would attract your greatest enemy who has the practical ability to control animals? <br /> <br /> And do not you like that kind of movies where the police are portrayed as a fool and even with half a dozen policemen firing on a guy, they still can not hit him? The font in this film belongs to the series "Police Academy"! They are as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind! Even the title of the film does not make sense: "Beastmaster 2: Through the portal of time" ... they never went through a portal "time" because the film is not in the future of the world of Dar but in a parallel world along ours in the astral plane, so that they NEVER go through time, only a dimensional world along theirs; then NO time travel is involved at all! This film tries to sound funny and it does it ... not because of humor, but because it's so bad ... and that's an understatement. The acting, the dialogue, the plot, the characters and the end are so cheesy that it's hilarious. What more can I expect from the guy who brought us "Return of the Swampthing"? We miss very much to Don Coscarelli and to his wonderful sensation of staging and seriousness of the first film !! Avoid this smelly waste like bubonic plague and stick to it first and maybe third if there is nothing better on T.V.
