Although Charlie Chaplin produced some excellent short comedies in the late 1910s, others do not quite do it. Examples like His new job and Shanghaied come to mind, and I would also say that the Floorwalker belongs to this category. <br /> <br /> Charlie merges with the director of a department store (and vice versa). This director tries to steal money from the cashier and runs away. Charlie is an honest customer, but is blamed for missing items stolen by other customers. <br /> <br /> There are not many. laughs in it except the last minute with some nice scenes on the escalator. For the rest, quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
