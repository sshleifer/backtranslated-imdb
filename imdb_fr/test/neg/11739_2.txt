A remake of a successful movie can be at best a tricky affair. to redo a true classic, especially one that is truly the definitive film of a director like Alfred Hitchcock, is something else. And after watching this version of "Psycho", directed by Gus Van Sant, two things immediately come to mind: what's the point, and what were they thinking about? Especially in light of the fact that Van Sant used the same script (from Joseph Stefano, from Robert Bloch's novel) that Hitchcock used. The final result highlights here some of the most subtle aspects of the art of cinema: first, a "remake" should simply be that; a retooling of the original, rather than a "copy" using new readers; and secondly, taking colors, using more blood and being a bit more graphic does not hurt the impact of the film. Although it was Van Sant's noble effort, ironically, he finally suffered from the same defect with which Norma Bates was afflicted: "the spirit" of the film was divided; half was Hitchcock, half Van Sant. And both, although met, will never be linked. Van Sant, even from the original screenplay, would have done better to make his own film - all along - rather than trying to replicate exactly what Hitchcock did with certain scenes. The movie's opening film, for example, and in particular the "shower" scene, is undoubtedly one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema. Copy Hitchcock, from the shots directly in the showerhead to the drain, and use the same skree! Skree! Skree! sound effects, even in tribute to Hitchcock, again, distracted only from history. And if you take into account the performance of William H. Macy (as Private Eye Arbogast), you have yet another split in the film's psyche. Macy is a great actor - one of the best players in the industry - and his performance is excellent. but, as positive as it may be, the attitude and the result are pure, David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times), and apparently out of context with respect to what Van Sant does. The film ends with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. I felt like I was watching "House of Good Will Psycho Games". <br /> <br /> As far as performances go, Macy's is as strong as herself and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) was successful in creating an original character, escaping the trap of attempting to imitate her. Janet Leigh. The weak links were Viggo Mortensen (Sam), who made Marion's boyfriend so smarmy and so unattractive that one wondered why she had nothing to do with him at first; and Vince Vaughn, who - to put it mildly - was just awful like Norman Bates. All his performance was that of an actor playing a role (and not very convincing about it); Affecting the effeminate mannerisms and punctuating his speech with "spontaneous" flashes of maniacal laughter, his Norman was more caricatural than caricatural, quite incredible and pretentious. This gave the film the impression of reconstructing a "True Incident" that you would see in a television show; This would have been entirely in keeping with the sensitivity of Norman's film-cut sitting alone in his living room to a picture of a sober-faced Peter Graves, intoning: "Such was Norman Bates's mentality about this fatal fate, rainy night when Marion Crane got out of her car and came into her life-- 'The following actors are Julianne Moore (Lila), Robert Forster (Dr. Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Anne Haney (Mrs. Chambers), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rance Howard (Mr. Lowery), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (police officer) and James LeGros (Charlie the car dealer). "Psycho" Van Sant is at least a curiosity that proves that having a good director, an excellent cast, and a proven storyline do not necessarily guarantee success, but in the current era of psycho-babbling, "American Psycho" and Hannibal Lecter have somewhat mitigated the advantage of a personag like Norman Bates, but there is always a special intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between Norman, his mother and his victims, which will always remain disturbing and terrifying; but Van Sant is unable to convey this feeling of terror, this fear that stifles the throat, with this film. If ever a film was shot that should have been directly booked to the video, here it is. Better yet, he was never born. I notice this one 2/10
