This film does not have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be. There are good moments when Stewart is on screen and they give him some lines to work with. It works best as a romantic comedy at first, but the story continues to move towards a more dramatic territory and gets lost in the process. In the last fifteen minutes or so, the twists and turns of the plot are nothing more than a series of dramatic clichés. <br /> <br /> The part with the plane looks like remains of a spliced ​​film. <br /> <br /> The main reason I can think of looking at it is if you want to be able to tell you've seen all of Jimmy Stewart's movies.
