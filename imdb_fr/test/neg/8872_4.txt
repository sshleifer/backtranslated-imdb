Of the thousands of films I have seen so far, this is the first one that made me think of the term "wasted talents". I had never seen so many excellent actors give performances as appalling (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein, etc.). The "aging" makeup is quite horrible and, to make matters worse, illuminated in a general way. The use of music (for example, love at first sight for the young aide-de-camp) is sometimes so caricatural that I can feel the smile of most of the spectators around me. So far, Antoine de Caunes has been a good actor, but seeing this one and "dawn bites", I think he should start thinking about quitting. Please Antoine, leave this project "master of balantree"; I doubt you deserve it.
