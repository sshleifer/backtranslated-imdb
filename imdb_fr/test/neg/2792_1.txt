Wrong script? Check. Horrible effects? Check. Horrible actors? Check. Blade direction? Check. <br /> <br /> After seeing the DVD box at a blockbuster and being a fan of the horror genre, I placed $ 4.28 on the line and rented this "movie". My girlfriend was out of town and I was bored so I figured it would be the perfect time to watch what looked like a horror movie (from the cover art of the box) . What I had instead was the worst film ever made. Until then, I had always declared "Slumber Party Massacre 3" the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> If you are the type to want to see a movie because you've heard how bad it is, it's for you. If you do not want to waste $ 4.00 and save 80 minutes of your life, avoid this garbage. <br /> <br /> One more word: I noticed that some of the "actors" came here and posted comments. on the bulletin board. How can you boast of being in this movie? You were all horrible. I mean really bad. If there was an American Idol for the actors, we would make fun of you in the first episodes. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Sutter Cain
