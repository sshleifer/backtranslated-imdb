The film begins with a narrative of the protagonist explaining some crimes committed throughout the city, then we learn that the hero is a police officer suspended or probably retired. I did not have the patience or the interest to check the above before commenting. If there is a stereotype that narrators must have a deep, sleepy voice, it is time to end it. I fell asleep seriously and did not bother to close the movie. I'm still trying to understand what the movie is about and why there was no outdoor shoot. A television series of the third category will have more scenery than this bullshit film and I always pity the actors and producers involved in this huge bullshit movie. It should have been produced as a regular television series or perhaps even as a local play instead of being broadcast on the big screen. Total loss of time and money. The film was supposed to be in production for a long time and it would have been better to leave it that way. With a redundant sleep inducing dialogue and scenery, this is the worst movie I've ever met.
