First of all, the first thing that came to mind after finishing this movie last night was "Why the title of 8MM 2?", Because I saw the first one obviously, and that Does it have to do with the scenario of the first film? The only thing that was alike was the fact that the couple had to get into the porn industry and that the plot did not even need it, because after seeing the end that I would not waste, it had not any sense. . <br /> <br /> A diplomat and his fiancée are in Hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool, she is very attractive. So when they see her in a club, they decide to have a little fun and have a hot threesome. But things get extremely intense when the diplomat receives photos of their business in the mail, fearing that it will become public and jeopardize his career, they pay back the guy who sent the photos, the diplomat panics and "kills" the guy , leading in a murder case. He and his fiancé decide to find the girl with whom they had this liaison, but things get worse as they deepen what they have been immersed in. <br /> <br /> in an unexplained film and not well thought out, which was sad. As I said, the title really has nothing to do with the first, so do not fall into the trap. It's just a sexual thriller that does not make sense, but it's good for those nights, because frankly it's one of those movies where it's so close to porn that it might as well be qualified of soft core. <br /> <br /> 4/10
