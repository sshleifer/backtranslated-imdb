The weather has not been kind to this film since the transition days of the sound of silence. The plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the violinist from his stroke of luck that she loves. There are of course complications. The problem with the film for me is that it has not aged well. The representations are omnipresent and some emotional scenes seem so ridiculous that they are laughable. A late exchange where Carol Lombard threw someone out of her room made me scream with her singing song delivery. There are other moments when the film becomes static, a sign of the limits of the microphones. This is not a bad film, it's just that the technical limitations of the film prevent a real pleasure. Normally, I forgive, but this time, I just could not follow the flow (again, the copy I saw was absolutely horrible). It's worth trying to forgive (and remember that Robert Armstrong actually did more than play Carl Denham in King Kong)
