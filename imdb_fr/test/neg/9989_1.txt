It's a rare feeling to meet such an embarrassing film that you feel the need to turn away from the screen. But when you see a noble actor like Sir John Gielgud surrounded by naked and mated couples, you'll just want to do it. Add to that Peter O'Toole as a Tiberian Emperor and Malcolm McDowell, who has syphilis, raising his finger up on the anus of a male victim, and you begin to understand that Caligula only concerns drug addicts disgusting and scandalous movies. <br /> <br /> The film traces the life of the notorious Roman emperor Caligula (McDowell), an extremely disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, beheadings, betrayals, murders , incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Although Caligula is totally crazy in real life and has probably succumbed most often to his basic instinct, the film remains an inexcusable impasse. Sex in the film is not used as one of the aspects of a multilevel story - sex is history. After a while, all the nudity, the thrust of the hip and the sucking of the nipple become tedious because of the pure repetition. The performances are totally undisciplined, especially McDowell who launches caution against the winds and gives a performance that stands in a raging posture. O'Toole seems to treat the scenario with the contempt he deserves (he is purely in the money for the money ?!). Rumors abound that additional pornographic scenes would have been added without the director's consent during the post-production, but in truth, Caligula does not have a minute of worthy or good workmanship. It is unlikely that the time, talent and money spent will be redistributed to a porn movie. Caligula is a unique experience. On the other hand, it's so horrible that maybe the fact that it's "one of a kind" is a blessing in disguise.
