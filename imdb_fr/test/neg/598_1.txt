This movie probably started with a good idea but that's it. When I read the cover of Blockbuster, I thought it was promising, but it was based on the general idea of ​​the film. The film started with a teacher explaining how, in the future, we will be able to see creatures of other dimensions. There was no explanation as to how this would happen, but it does not matter. I thought it would be developed in the movie. It was not. In the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with sealed tubes in their heads. Beside each of them are two attractive women. Men start asking "Do you hear that" or "Do you see them?" We conclude that they think they see ghosts or other creatures that seem invisible or hallucinate. Women do not see these creatures. It was good for the first five minutes BUT THIS SCENE IS CONTINUING FULL TIME. It is briefly punctuated with flashbacks that have no correlation with the so-called "plot" of the film. We are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appears to be terrorists from the Middle East. What does it talk about? We never discover. Flashbacks lead us to believe that terrorists force the man in a blouse to do diabolical experiments on these young people, but we never understand why. At the end of the film, terrorists finally do what terrorists do ?? they blow up the lab, but why? What purpose? We have no idea. This film contains so many thoughts and ideas that are disconnected that there are too many to list, but another notable point is the fact that the man in the lab coat and the terrorist enter and leave the room throughout of the film and not once men try to escape or even leave the tables on which they are sitting even if they are not tied! The film's authors have also made appearances of cockroach cameos on several occasions, but again, we never learn what this has to do with the script. Sorry, but this movie was a $ 4 loss and the time I spent driving to the rental store and watching it. Follow my advice. Do not rent it.
