Jeff Powers (Lou Diamond Phillips, "Young Guns 1 & 2"), a police officer with a history of brutal criminals, is recruited into a clandestine elite division of the LAPD. Kelly (Chelsea Field), the girlfriend of Jefferson's reporter and journalist, is looking for a story in the team. Soon, Jeff's conscience prevails over him, which puts him in conflict with Dan Vaughn (Scott Glenn, "The Red October Hunt" and "Backdraft"), the leader of the unit. <br /> <br /> It's a rather banal routine, dare I say, banal, police action / drama that does not reserve any surprise thanks to a cookie-cutter plot that just goes strictly from one point A to point B. The acting is perfectly suited to what the actors have received for work with however it is not a real reason to watch the film. A bit sad to see that Mark L. Lester's previous six films, just before this one (from the 1984 promotion to Showdown in Little Tokyo), were all extremely entertaining vehicles. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: The Chelsea Field Becomes Briefly Topless <br /> <br /> My Note: D +
