My wife and I could not even finish the movie. Really, it was rather painful. <br /> <br /> First, historical accuracy is compromised not so much by the events themselves as by the ridiculous dimensionality of the characters. For example, Augustus assumes the "burden" of power with great reluctance. Indeed, he is described as if he was a kind of great humanist and believer in democracy. <br /> <br /> Second, the camp! My lord, the dialogue is horribly bad. I remember the soap opera that my mother looked at when I was a child and the dialogue was better Constant exposure and pontifications scratch the ears like nails on the board. Ugh. (OK, I'm exaggerating a bit, but the dialogue is really bad.) The HBO Rome series is better than nothing because its characters were at least credible, regardless of their historicity. <br /> <br /> Rome was also wise enough to know that they could not stage epic battle scenes. The creators of this film did not do it. When Caesar attacks Munda, the scene of the battle is practically ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I will concede that the costumes are perfectly good. The sets are good, although their CGI decorations can be a little jerky at times. The sound is bad, however, both in terms of music, film work and dubbing of so many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, its rental is absolutely not worth renting. As a history specialist, I was hoping for a different approach from Rome's Augustus than HBO, which, in my opinion, failed to capture his general "feeling" as well as what they did to Caesar or to Antony. Instead, I should have kept my reading.
