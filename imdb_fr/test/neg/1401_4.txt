A bit funny how the comments for this movie have come down regularly, now add mine. I think the script could have been saved by better acting and action by a better script. Together it was difficult to watch and I do not fear such a subject. <br /> <br /> Sigourney was the best part (I thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only novelty this movie offered to her kind) but even she dragged on. I can not blame him, who knows what was left by the director and / or the editor in the editing room. The whole movie had a feeling of "OK, I'm fine, let's move on" when I KNOW that the actors and the script had to extract more, which had good lines and interesting themes. <Br /> <br /> I do not think it counts as a spoiler, but a perfect example is the scene where Sigourney goes to the house of the alleged executioner of his son and has that look on his face and I have says "it's the face of someone who is exaggerated to see someone live in a mobile home" and, of course, the next plan, intended to shock us I'm sure, that the bully lives in a caravan rather than in a beautiful house, like his. </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> <p> As many other posters have pointed out, there are SO MUCH better movies with such light and airy scripts about such spoiled families hitting the notes better - "Celebration" is probably the ultimate example that I saw.
