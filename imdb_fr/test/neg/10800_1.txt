This pot of doodoo won a prize? They desperately had to award a prize for something. This film feels like a bopper and it makes me sick. Fortunately, I watched it alongside Mike and the MST3K bots, so it was bearable. Acting horrible, disturbing moment mother / daughter, foolish premise, if you want a bad movie, it's here. Be warned, but watch him with Mike and the robots, otherwise you will suffer. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10. I still can not believe he won an award, and the director defends it * * # $ ^ && piece of ^% ^% $ ^ ^ # # @ @ # # movie!
