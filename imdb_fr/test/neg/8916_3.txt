I like his martial arts style, he's fast, close and oh so fast, but it seems like his movies are getting more and more quality of life based on crime and less sense ... I thought that he was there to convey a deeper message. At least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda that had some good redeeming qualities of the character, but the rest was so far away. I was very disappointed. Martial arts also suffer. I hope to see a more dedicated Segal in his future films. This film also fails to keep the thread of the story, there are too many gaps so the thought is lost. Too many things are cryptic without solution.
