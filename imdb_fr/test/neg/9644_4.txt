... at least during his first half. If it had started with the three navy mates and concentrated on the naval action scenes, the film would have been much better and tighter. The second half of the movie is well worth it, especially for the action sequences and close-ups of ships from the early 20th century, but it's as if a dull toothache was going there. Also, do not watch this movie just because Ginger Rogers is there. She has an important role, but small. <br /> <br /> The film features three friends from New York City working in the tourism industry and showing great competition for the hand of Sally (Ginger Rogers), a candy saleswoman singing along from the avenue. The First World War breaks out, the three friends seem completely indifferent to the fight, but nevertheless join the navy. One of the three with the smallest number of civilian industries (Bill Boyd as Baltimore) gives the commanding officer to the other two (Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets). To make matters worse, Sally fell in love with one of the three, but did not get the chance to tell him before the three went to war. <br /> <br /> The film is a little more interesting. on board the ship, mainly because of the close-ups we have of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry between the three friends is credible. However, James Gleason, at 49, looks a little too long to become a hangman, especially when the sign at the Enrollment Office indicates that you must be between 17 and 35 to be eligible. <br /> <br /> A real obvious flaw in the movie that made me believe that while outside the naval scenes was slapped with minimal care is the design of the costumes, or, should I say, the lack of it. In the scenes that take place in New York just before the First World War, everyone is dressed in the fashion of 1931 and everyone drives the cars of 1931 - no effort was made to bring this film in period . <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you look at the few scenes with Ginger Rogers and the last 45 minutes of the suicide mission with the Navy, you've seen everything here, which is worth seeing. The rest is padded.
