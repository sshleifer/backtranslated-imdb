Isaac Florentine directed some of the best Western martial arts action films ever produced. US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are classics of action. You can see that Isaac is passionate about the genre and that his films are always eventful, creative and intense, with some of the best fight sequences that a fan of action can hope for. He has found a muse with Scott Adkins, as talented actor and actor as you can expect. This is confirmed by Special Forces and Undisputed 2, but unfortunately, The Shepherd is simply not up to its capabilities. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that JCVD ​​looks better here in terms of combat than in previous years. years, especially in the fight he has (for almost no reason) in a prison cell and in the final clash with Scott, but looks into his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There is nothing in his eyes. It's like he does not care about anything during the whole movie. And he is the main man. <br /> <br /> The film has other dubious aspects, both visually and visually, but the main problem is that you absolutely can not understand the film's hero. A real shame, because I know we all wanted this film to be as special as it could have been. There are some good sides, mainly the action scenes themselves. This film had a great director and action choreographer, as well as a great opponent to face by JCVD. This is perhaps what allowed to bring back the old star of the action film to conquer the stakes of the action film. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, that did not happen.
