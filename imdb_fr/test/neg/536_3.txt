This film stinks mainly. The only reason I gave a 3 is because the graphics were lovely. The total contempt for a piece of land and the lack of superficial, even superficial, development of the character gave it the appearance of pretty drawings. This is by far the worst anime out of Japan. I can not believe they put their names on this trash. What a scam to sell this thing for $ 20. If you have not seen this, do not worry. If you have, I pity you.
