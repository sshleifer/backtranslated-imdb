Myself, I was probably farting the brain to praise him. Everyone who buys it will appreciate using it as a coaster. Maybe a frisbee? It's a DVD I found in advance and where kids can go. Since the DVDs do not seem to be able to be placed in this dark room with all the big box VHS tapes, I find it rather annoying that they stick that next to a Disney movie. Yes, going from Dinosaur to Erotic Ghost showed what we all think about Disney, right? I have not lowered this hollow yet. There is no action here. The only interesting thing is the old 1973 trailers of old erotic films which, I am amazed, escape the fact that they are burned. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (if imdb allowed zero, it was 0 / ten)
