Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel, but it has its charms. This film does not do it. He has some of the same character names as the book, but the story is drastically altered, and the kindest man of all Austen's cannon (unless Emma's Knightley takes a place of choice) is portrayed as a devious heartless and mercenary. One or two entirely foreign characters are introduced, and a palpable air of corseted perversion hovers over all this. I was so disappointed when I saw it for the first time when it was released in 1986; still today, it is high on the list of films that dishonor the books on which they rest. Even fans of Robert Hardy should give a large place to it. He has nothing, and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G, to recommend it.
