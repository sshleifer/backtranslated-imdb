The Shanghai Cobra begins as a gangbusters, with a rain-soaked dinner scene straight out of Shack Out on 101 or Gun Crazy (the first). Unfortunately, the film then continues its tired way through a standard formula of Chan that is barely animated by the always wonderful Mantan Moreland. It's as if the director Karlson had wasted half of his budget in the first five minutes, just putting things in the way he wanted. Watch the beginning and think about The Phenix City Story.
