(A possible minor spoiler) The first "Jurassic Park" was an effective but silly movie that did its job well and was actually pretty good. The sequel "The Lost World" had some decent moments, but these were ruined by the lame part of the film that had lost the head at T-Rex in San Diego. Now, in "Jurassic Park III", the little story contained in the first and in the sequel was thrown to the window and replaced by 90 minutes of essentially non-stop action, which would have worked if the movie had not been so badly done. <br /> <br /> Sam Neill is back as Dr. Grant, to whom a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) offers to accompany them to an island to help them find their son, who is lost for more than 2 months. But of course, this island is populated by dinosaurs and, of course, the plane on which they fly collapses, leaving them stuck behind a group of dinos in a row. Strong feelings, no real story, but even at this level, the film does not deliver. Director Joe Johnston ("Jumanji") has managed to exploit the little magic that remained in "Jurassic" films and make the most of his life. <br /> <br /> The dinosaurs look just right and not very scary. What matters is that it is not a very good movie, even with strong feelings. * on 4 stars.
