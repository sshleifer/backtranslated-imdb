The back of my DVD describes the plot of El Chucabra: after his capture in the desert, the legendary bloodthirsty creature Chupacabra escapes into the city, causing chaos and panic. Chasing the mortal animal, the animal control officer and scientist Dr. Starlina Davide realizes that a militant with a shady plan is also seeking the elusive murderer of a mysterious research center led by the evil Dr. Goodspeed. This putrid horror movie is pretty fun if you watch it under the influence of alcohol. The storyline is completely silly, the acting is amazing and the staging is amateurish. Two chupacabra rubber suits are easily the best thing about this movie. 3 out of 10 and this is extremely nice.
