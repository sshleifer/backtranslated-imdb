It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Do not look at it, even if your life depends on it. <br /> <br /> This film by Laurel and Hardy is the one where they inherit an island, shipwreck and are ready to be hung. This is Laurel and Hardy's latest film and what a very low note to end such a superb career. The movies of the 40s were not great, this film was shot in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember them at their peak, the 30s. Talking shorts are better than feature films, my favorite is "Me and My Pal". Another reason why this movie is horrible is its dubbing. The actor opens his mouth and the words come out three days later. Absolutley shit, but let's end on a positive note, Laurel and Hardy have been, in my opinion, the best double act of all time.
