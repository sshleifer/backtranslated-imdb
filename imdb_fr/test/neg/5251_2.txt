What. Uh ... <br /> <br /> This film is so dissociative and so messy that I literally lost some of my sanity once it was finished. I will never be the same person again. I'm trying to put my finger on exactly what's crazy about it ... It's not just the hilarious techno music, or the medieval "out of time" / Blade Runner / Wild West / Highlander, or the the strange CGI "Grendel" monster that looks like a man made of animated sausages, or even the monster "Grendel's mother", who looks like a dancer from the Alabama table who grew up with claws and tentacles when she stayed too long to tan. All of these things are strange, but what's really the weirdest thing about this movie is the acting. I just can not explain. This scenario is obviously stupid, but the actors breathe a deadly serious through all this. Lambert is always strange and generally boring, but for this one, he went to Dolph Lundgrin territory: I can not help but laugh every time he speaks. <br /> <br /> I will give some pictures to this film. credit to be completely crazy and crazy as opposed to conservative and boring. I will always take the weird disaster of a movie on a totally mediocre film. <br /> <br /> Warning: If you intend to watch Christopher Lambert in Beowulf, get ready to spend several hours wandering the streets of some sort of nightmarish, hyperactive-catatonic nightmare. It is true. When I was done with my Beowulf spiritual journey, I woke up in the middle of the Siberian tundra in a pool of blood and milk. A dead wolf was lying next to me and I found out later that I had a handful of human teeth in my shirt pocket. My VHS copy of Beowulf was sitting on a hastily built stone altar nearby, embedded with candles and faded flowers. The band told me to walk. I got up and walked.
