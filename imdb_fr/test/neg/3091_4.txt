Too bad. What a terrible shame. The table was set, the candles were lit, the guests had arrived ... and then ... <br /> <br /> ... well nothing. Just pretentious drivel. It could have been great, OK maybe not great, but it could have been great. All the elements were present but at the end of the day, the bottle was empty: NO LIGHTNING! How it happened is a mystery with everything available to the director ... <br /> <br /> ... The story was rather courageous although it certainly required a lot of work with possibly several rewrites of finishing to correct the story and tighten the links. a lot of characters (the only thing that was constantly and constantly and unnecessarily tight was the cinematography, but I'll come back to it). But the staging was ugly, the acting was just that: _a-CTin-G_ with a heavy side of cheese and a lot of ham, and then the cinematography ... <br /> <br /> .. Well, it was something to see! But only if you're in Cinema Cinema's "Cinematography 101", how can you ever use a professional camera under any circumstances. "Clearly, the student fell asleep during part of the introduction of the lecture and had heard only "... use a professional camera ..." and then back to earth when the sentence ended. <br /> <br /> What can I say; amateur and pretentious until the end! I see only this movie intended to appeal as a Chick Flick because it is supposed to be sad, but then it falls flat and ends up being "sad" (as an excuse for a movie) ... so even those "Chicks" would not be fooled by this schlockenspiel! <br /> <br /> PS I felt bad for Miss Diaz She is much better at her art than this that this film had allowed, even if it was totally TOTALLY underestimated.In fact, I'm sorry for everyone in this movie at the exception of the director and (you guessed it) the director of photography! I tell them '1 against the wall for them when the revolution comes!' Okay, not really, after all "it was just a movie", but maybe a good "tar and feather and get out of town" might be more satisfying or, at the very least, a lot more entertaining !!! <br /> <br /> TTFN :-(
