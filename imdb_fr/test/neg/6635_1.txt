Yes, the votes are there. This film could well be the Plan 9 of the outer space of our generation. But while Ed Wood's film, despite all its faults, still has a certain charm, this film defines the word "without charm" in the nth degree. In fact, I would suggest to the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary to cite this film as a key example of this word in the next dictionary update. <br /> <br /> Carrot Top interprets such an abyssal ability that normally rational people I know once his name has become murderous maniacs are dedicated to killing Mr. Top as soon as possible. Indeed, if you check Amazon.com and check customer reviews for Carrot Top's movie and other performance DVDs, you'll find several that could be interpreted as death threats for Mr. Top. <br /> <br /> Another curious In fact, about this movie, I remember Mike Nelson, the main screenwriter of MST 3000, in his book Mike's Mega Cheese on movies, whether he's good or bad, said to have seen this film and that shortly thereafter he was unable to remember it, including the Title. Obviously, Mike was suffering from a classic reaction to trauma. To see this atrocity was so scary that Mike Nelson had to hide it from him. (It is obvious that in a later chapter of his book, Mike Nelson had found his memory of this film, and according to his criticism, Mike Nelson was absolutely not grateful for the memory he had found.) /> <br /> The only comment I propose on the film, and it's not a spoiler, it's just the honest truth of God, it's not funny. None of that, not even a nanosecond, it's funny.
