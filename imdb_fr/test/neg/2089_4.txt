I chose this DVD for 3.99 at rogers video to get enough points to get a better movie for free. In fact, I never planned to watch this, but it started to pique my curiosity and I finally decided to bring up the DVD player. The effects in this movie are horrible and cheap. Some dialogues in this film seem to have been written by a 12-year-old boy who swears happy. The acting is really lame in some parts, and the "action" scenes are completely laughable. You will laugh in some places, which was good for me, because it distracted me a little. The plot is that a girl carries a spell that causes her to vomit snakes. A shaman must take him to Los Angeles. Two girls are also trying to smuggle drugs and some other unimportant people that there is really no conspiracy. Do not expect anything from this movie and do not listen to the blanket, there are not 100 passengers and 3,000 vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes. <br /> <br /> Regarding the DVD, there is a trailer almost as laughable as the movie, a reel of blooper that consists of a shooting of an actor trying to say train, and the scenes deleted are really useless You can not stay in this movie, they must be really bad. There is also a very poor performance featurette that does not show much at all, except that the people involved in this film were rather silly. I can not recommend it unless I want a very bad movie that we can laugh with friends. I give him 2 cat cats out of 5.
