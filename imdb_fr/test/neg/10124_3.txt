When the naive young Eddie Hatch, a stained glass handler at the Savory department store, falls for a statue of Venus and gives her a chaste kiss, Venus moves away from her pedestal and gives more to Eddie. This shining example of what Hollywood can do for a Broadway musical manages to highlight this foolish story and eliminate most of the top-rated songs. The goal was to make a popular, safe film without much investment, while capitalizing on the upward mobility of Ava Gardner. Robert Walker in the role of Eddie gets lost in a thankless role. Eddie is not only naive, he is also sad and unlucky. Gardner is gorgeous, but the only things that give life to the movie are Olga San Juan as a girlfriend but jealous Eddie's girlfriend, Tom Conway as a savory owner of Savory's and Eve Arden as a crisp secretary of long dated. It's a role Arden could play in her sleep and she's good at it. <br /> <br /> The musical opens on Broadway in 1943 and makes Mary Martin a star. The only purpose of a musical, however, is to have music. As One Touch of Venus was supposed to be a kind of social satire, Kurt Weill, composer, and Ogden Nash, lyrics writers, came up with a series of elegant and witty songs and a masterpiece. Without satire, smart songs or Martin (or equivalent), the film becomes a fantasy of weak comedy where much of the comedy is predictable and where the fantasy is worked to death. <br /> <br /> Not only did the film's producers launch almost all of Weill / Nash's songs, but they also turned to Ann Ronell, the film's musical director, to write new lyrics for one of them. songs that have survived. sharp observation in love romance. Ronell was not a hacker; she wrote Willow Weep For Me. I wonder what she thought as she replaced or modified Ogden Nash's intelligent work. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is this Weill / Nash masterpiece. "Speak Low" is a love song as great as anyone has ever written. Eileen Wilson nicknamed Gardner one of those ultra-professional and lifeless treatments. Dick Haymes contributes to a choir. <br /> <br /> As for Ann Ronell, she was one of the few women in Hollywood to become a major musical director, as well as a composer and lyricist. Yours for a song: The Women of Tin Pan Alley is a fascinating documentary about some of the successful women in business, including Ronell, Kay Swift, Dorothy Fields and Dana Suess. And for those who would like to hear the little Weill / Nash score recorded by the original Broadway cast, you may be able to find the One Touch Of Venus CD (original 1943 distribution) / Lute Song (original 1946 composition). . The music is associated with Lute Song, another Broadway show performed by Martin.
