An ex-informant from East Germany ended up in Mexico as a spy of a group of students in 1971, where she fell in love with one of the activists. This is Mexico's first co-production with Germany, and although it is a good image of the ideals that have marked and continue to mark (at least at the CGH), youth, as many finishes are something of tasteless since to internal dilemmas that he faces dark brown (Noethem) as to the passion of his ideals that Adela feels (Campomanes), as soon as they see, in the case of him, I want to assume, the barrier of language; and in the case of her by her lack of experience. That's why at the end there is no concrete identification with any of them, so what could have been films that even served as a document like Red Dawn, ended up being another film; Although I want to point out that in the room many assistants were enthusiastic in the conversation with the director, which tells me that they are no longer so young or that my ideals have changed.
