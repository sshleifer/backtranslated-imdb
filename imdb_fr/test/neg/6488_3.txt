This film is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest reputation) who are heading for a small fort to take over the property of an uncle who has just left and where they are planning to settle. When they arrive in a nearby town, they realize that no one will go there (even if it is about fifteen kilometers away), so they walk. When they arrive there, they discover that there are no soldiers but many people who have taken over the use of the fort and built a small town nearby. They quickly realize that something is not going well here and that Fort McMillan (Fort Doom, as locals call it) has serious problems. <br /> <br /> Rather than going into the plot, I'll make a few comments on the things I noticed about the movie. First of all, the acting is very flat, only a few people seem to be real enough to believe it. My first job was mediocre, but in the end, I watched some of the tournaments and those same people became alive. So, my only thought is that this is how the director wanted it. In addition to the bad acting of the actors, I have a big problem where people do not react properly to a given set of circumstances. Take, for example, no one would take them to Fort McMillan for any price, even if it's only 15 miles away. However, when we arrive at the Fort, we find that it is well maintained by a decent population, which must all get supplies from someone, not to mention the mail, etc. It's supposed to be in 1867, but we can see railroad cars have electric lights (at least they're not on) and a locomotive engine that's at least 30 years later is not one of the most popular locomotive models at the moment. There are also places where you can see a black paved roof (and maybe a car at some point that did not want to bother looking back) and other anachronistic objects. If they had followed the rules of the "world", they would have created actors and left a home 4 instead of the 2 that I gave him, and they rewrote it about 4 more times.
