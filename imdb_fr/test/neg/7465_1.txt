What can you say about a grainy and poorly filmed 16mm deer film in which the best and most attractive is a German Shepherd? Nothing that would be positive. Avoid this parody at all costs. In any case, it would be difficult to find, as bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the United States. I strongly suggest that IMDb review its weighting formula for rating because a rating of 8.8 for this fecal material is absurd! I'm by no means a prude and I spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70's & 80's; but it is a product of inferior quality, even to the less strict standards of the loop (then illegal) of the deer.
