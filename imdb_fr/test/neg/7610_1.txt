I rarely give one or ten stars to a movie, but it was so horrible that I had to make an exception. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of SciFi and I saw some comic shots on SciFi that I really like. <br /> <br /> I realize that this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student. But even considering this, the sets and the effects are bad. Cinematography is mediocre, but may be the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad. A state of sadness when the female voiceover of the computer is the best actor. The dialogue is bad. The scenario is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> Humor is not only subtle and sublime; it is not found. For example, 20 minutes of the film, or 80 minutes, are devoted to a lame joke with 2 shots with the alien mascot and the elevator. <br /> <br /> It must have been a parody of all bad SciFi from the '50s until 2001. However, we find ourselves with a slightly updated version of an old 1950s SciFi C-movie. these movies were funny because they took themselves seriously.
