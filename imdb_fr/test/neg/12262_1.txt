This movie could have been great, but it was not. Among the group of film buffs without talent and friends of the filmmakers who wanted to help, there are some slight inflections of talent. The main star of the film plays a good role. He is convincing and has those scary Italian eyes. However, he is teaming up with the worst offshoots of actors ever seen. The opening scenes of the film are among the worst and the most embarrassing. It looks like gay porn. Fortunately, nobody has stripped themselves. The rape scene that continues to be mentioned is hogwash. The prison sequence was the best part of the movie - though irrelevant. The soundtrack of the movie (if you can call it that) looks like a teenagers first attempt to use cooledit and sample CDs. It's boring, repetitive and extremely lame. In fact, the whole film is nil. Get out while you can!
