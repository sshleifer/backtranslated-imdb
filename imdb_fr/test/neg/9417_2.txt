Solo is a bad movie - which can not be ignored. Most of the actors are very wooden (the only exception is Adrien Brody's performance as Solo's creator, Bill) and the story is light enough for you to probably forget about it while watching the show. movie. However, these films are more action-oriented than plot / acting and, as such, live or die thanks to the script pieces - which is ultimately the goal of these films - to give the 14 years of what to smile. adults watch movies of real substance. And even on this Solo fails to deliver - the little action that exists is poorly done, dull and uninspired. After seeing the trailer of this movie on TV, I was hoping to have something in the Predator genre with a robot replacing the Predaot. Instead, I had an almost lifeless action movie with a poorly constructed construction attempt transmitting a message that robots may also feel. Watch Terminator II or Predator instead ... the two classics that this film desperately wants to be, except that it lacks inspiration or, to be fair, the budget.
