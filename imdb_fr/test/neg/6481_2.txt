The film is not so bad, until ... <br /> <br /> The main problem is the end, so it's a pretty big spoiler ... <br /> <br /> To the moment is done, it's a beautiful film, and he's really right. <br /> <br /> However ... <br /> <br /> In the book, Sam succeeds and lives his dream, while in the film, he abandons and returns to the city, completely destroying the theme of the book "you can do what you put in your mind". <br /> <br /> This film is a desecration, and instead of redoing the classics that do not need to be redone, the Hollywood guys who do not have better ideas should do it, all of after.
