** Warning, this review may contain revelations ** <br /> <br /> The idea behind Danny's character (Jet Li) is good. A young boy is taken by a thug and raised to behave like a vicious pitbull. He is controlled mainly by the fact that his collar is attached to him or not. <br /> <br /> However, the author did not know how to deliver this idea within the limits of credibility. <br /> <br /> He has Danny meet with a blind pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who must be the most confident fool a man has ever been - as well as his niece, Victoria (Kerry Condon) , babble endless and rather unattractive. By the way, I was stunned when I heard that Victoria was supposed to be 18 - she looked like I was 25 or 30 years old. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there is no friendship between Danny and Victoria. <br /> <br /> When Danny gets hurt again, what does Sam do without driving him home? Danny is away for 2 days, but do these idiots take him to the hospital? Nooooo. I do not know if they even called a doctor. <br /> <br /> Now, Danny is clearly not a mentally stable person, it shows from the start, but Sam takes him home. he and his daughter-in-law could have been seriously injured or killed by this rather strange young man. <br /> <br /> Why did Morgan Freeman take this insipid role in this film asin, which I can not even begin to guess. Mr. Freeman is certainly not desperate by a pay check. <br /> <br /> Next, Bob Hoskins plays Bart, the gangster who "owns" Danny - you are now talking about a son of a hard-to-kill firearm. Bart's car is riddled with bullets that would have rivaled the disappearance of Bonnie and Clyde. We think he's dead, but no. <br /> <br /> Then we have another car accident. Once again, old Bart survives unscathed. <br /> <br /> On top of that, we also have Danny fight half a dozen tough guys at once, plus a scene where Danny decided he did not want to fight anymore. I do not care how much a person does not want to fight, when he's really fighting or dying, I think anyone would fight. <br /> <br /> As I said in the title topic - this film is about 40 miles from the limit of reality as we know it. It's not just a case of belief suspense, it's beyond that. <br /> <br /> In addition, I never understood why Danny's mother, who turns out to be a nice lady, rather than the prostitute that Bart claimed, mingled with Bart and his gang and was shot. Maybe it was my fault, I let myself be distracted by the moment this scene unfolded - but it seemed very unlikely that she and Bart had met. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars - and that's what's generous.
