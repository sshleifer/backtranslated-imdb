The story is disjointed and poorly written. We are given sons and a possible hook in Act 1, only to see it disappear. If the author had bothered to read his work carefully, it would have been obvious that the initial problem of Madsden's character and his encounter with the "bad" girl suggest that there will be a troubled alliance between them when they will try to solve his problem. <br /> The problem is not going anywhere. The relationship is not going anywhere. And there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. Nobody digs anyone and no one appeals. The writing and the realization are laughable. You may feel that someone is struggling with the mess and that the story is focused on trying to extract some excitement. There are not any. The screenwriter / director is simply a beginner whose confused efforts have become a film. Simple mistakes such as "... they took polaroids ..." - in Japan in 2007? to insulting errors such as nudity for eroticism, this film is an insult. You can not make them worse. <br /> <br /> And by placing "Madsden" on the talent list, the producers thought they would be successful. He barely acts. Asia is certainly ... and the result is a chic and heroic panto. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this opportunity.
