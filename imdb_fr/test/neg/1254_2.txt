Having just finished reading the book "One of a Kind" a week ago, I thought, "It would make a good movie, especially now, when people know a little bit about poker and poker players" . I was totally shocked to find it by visiting the video store last night. I did not know that someone turned that into a movie. I grabbed it immediately and looked with a lot of anticipation. What a major disappointment! <br /> <br /> All the fascinating things about Stu Ungar were crushed quickly, and instead I ended up with a biopic that could have affected anyone. Ungar might have been an exhausted idiot, but he was also a brilliant thinker who could read people instinctively. That's what made him so fascinating. Why do not you focus on that? <br /> <br /> And talk about dilution of the truth. This guy was excessive about everything: drugs, women, gambling, starvation, sleep deprivation. He bet on sporting events from dusk to dawn, he disappeared for days while he was hanging out in crack dens, his body was perpetually emaciated and yet, if he needed money, he could always beat almost everyone while playing cards. That's a story! <br /> <br /> Too much time has been spent on his childhood and personal relationships (although his connections with "Vincent" and his daughter have barely been mentioned) and almost nothing about his drug use (which was exorbitant), his crazy game and his incredible card playing abilities. <br /> <br /> Probably too late, but I hope someone will do it again. I had no problem with Imperioli. He is excellent The script does not leave him anything interesting to say.
