If this film had been made by a man, he would have been imprisoned. While Adrian Lyne was chained with a lawyer in the editing room to oversee the recounting of a classic of literature in order to appease censors and to avoid violating the 1996 law on the protection of child pornography. wife drops us off and everyone applauds. Did I miss a meeting? In addition to flagrant pedophilia, this film is utterly absurd. Did this woman ever set foot on an active military base? Has she ever met a soldier? Who is this army? Uniforms must come from Uniforms-R-Us. Just put some patches, who cares? Just make sure everyone has a Big Red One. There is here a slight joke that undoubtedly exceeds the author's head, but which might have been concealed by the one who supplied the military vehicles. Admittedly, there were no military advisers. The US military does not exploit slums. Temporary base camps in war zones in the jungle are cleaner than that. The US military does not require 14-year-old girls to work on military bases or allow them to use firing ranges or training courses. There is a lot of drama to exploit in the sexual appearance of teenage girls. This film has absolutely nothing to do with it.
