In all honesty, I have not seen this film for many years, but the few times I have tended to leave some stuck in my memory, as will all those who saw it. I saw it for the first time at a Halloween party at the YMCA in the early 1960s, and it scared the childhood of us in a fun way. I remember feeling a real anguish at the unknown hidden in the labyrinth. I can not risk giving the ending, except to say that it was surprising, to say the least. I vaguely remember the whole audience of young boys letting out a loud cry of alarm, followed by a laugh when the terrible secret was revealed. The end was seen by most viewers as one of the biggest unintentionally funny climaxes for a film in the film's history, yet strangely moving, in a way. You have to see it for yourself, which is not easy these days. I do not know if it is available on home video or not, but it would still be an excellent feature for Halloween for kids and adults.
