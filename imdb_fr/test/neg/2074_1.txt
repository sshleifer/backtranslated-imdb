As the other guy said that, you can count the words that have been said throughout the movie on one of your hands. Too much nudity, she undressed 7 or 8 times in 1 and a half, far beyond the nudity I'm going to find a porn behind this movie, he fucked her throughout the movie, bad acting , bad story, bad language, Carmen swore all along the film, so you get out of this movie, pornographic scenes and vulgar language, A Lots of gaps in the film, a big silence from time to time The only good thing in this movie , it's the beautiful places where it was shot, otherwise it's an hour and a half of your life that you're going to lose is going to watch this movie good luck really Sux
