This story begins at the end! The opening credits of the film advise us so. Unfortunately, that's not true, since we need about 70 minutes of a typical science-fiction film from the 1950s. The story is sad. the plot is very weak and was clearly filmed on a small budget, as was often the case at that time. <br /> <br /> The story could have covered any situation where people take refuge in an isolated house and are threatened by someone outside. it just turned out to be adapted to fit a sci-fi story. <br /> <br /> The landscape consisted of a few rocks, bushes and smoke. - Oh yes, there was also a pool of water. Someone was wearing a rubber mask with a beak-shaped face and what looked like feathers. <br /> <br /> Written by Lou Rusoff, who wrote several science fiction stories at that time, including The She Creature and The Conquered The World was completed in a few days, leaving the actors no time to develop their characters as well as possible. Low budget constraints also prevented the film from reaching its potential. It could have been a much better movie than it turned out. <br /> <br /> Mike Connors and Richard Denning gave the movie a little life, but even they could not bring it up in the category where we could say - "I enjoyed this movie" Richard Denning's actor began in 1937. He starred alongside Gregory Peck and Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember and later became best known on television in the Hawaii Five-O and The Flying Doctor series. <br /> Directed by Roger Corman who has many films to his credit as a director and producer. He has made good movies and continues to do them. He became well known for his filmmaking from Edgar Allan Poe's stories, often featuring Vincent Price. He has also made other low-budget films. some were good and entertaining for one reason or another, and most were much better than those. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> Darnmay <br /> September 10, 2007
