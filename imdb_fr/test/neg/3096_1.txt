I'm not afraid of bad movies. I like bad movies. I like making fun of them with my friends. In fact, we are all very good. That being said, let me tell you how much I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> For starters, it was incomprehensible. Rob Lowe attacks some people, they capture him but he escapes into this big group. We think this singer is dead, but she did not, unless perhaps many of them act and look alike. Invite Burt Reynolds to interview the singer. It looks like he just got lost in this movie from the band Walker, Texas Ranger and he's confused. Then Rob Lowe dies, but he does not ... And the worst part is that there is not enough dialogue or action that is not about killing people or trying to make fun of this movie !! And do not even throw me on the chihuahua at random. Then there was the fact that it was supposed to concern the fall of the old power structure in Eastern Europe. We did not know where we were, all the accents were apparently "from Eastern Europe" and what did Burt Reynolds and Rob Lowe do in the first place? <br /> <br /> I desperately wanted to tell people what I thought about this movie and my money, but since I had it as a special (only $ 99), I decided not to pay. What I want to know, however, is how the director got the green light to make this damn movie, and what the "stars" thought when they signed ???
