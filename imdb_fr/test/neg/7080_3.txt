The biggest problem with "In Search of Historic Jesus" is that he is very little sought after. Shick-Sunn produced these "documentary" films in the 1970s and into the 1980s. They included interviews with "experts", as well as discussions on "science" and "facts" to defend the title of the film. cash. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "historical Jesus" is really only a third-order dramatization of the life of Christ. Unlike Shick-Sunn, his superior, "In Search of Noah's Ark," spends most of his free time discussing the possibility that the ark will rest on the earth today and in a place where it could be, this film is essentially the story of Jesus without effort made to prove or disprove his existence. The famous Shroud of Turrin is mentioned, but there is hardly any other detective work that lasts much longer on the screen. <br /> <br /> For fans of these quasi-documentary films like "Jupiter Menace" and "In Search of Bigfoot", etc. , this movie does not offer much.
