TWINS EFFECT is a mediocre film in many ways. The only positive thing is that he does not take himself seriously. Apart from that, it's not really a movie, but a merchandising tool for the two movie stars, popular idols of pop in their native Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The film itself is poorly constructed and played. The management offers stupid martial arts, which is strange since the director of the action (and so-called co-director) is Donnie Yen. Like many Hong Kong movies aimed at the teen audience, fans of "actors" like the Twins (the two girls who play this movie) and Ekin Cheng, there is so much bad music that makes the audience believe that some scenes are funny, intelligent, etc. <br /> <br /> The final conclusion: everything is for nothing. Even as a fan of Hong Kong movies, it's a mediocre film. Not funny enough, not serious enough and, as a rule, too much false chewing gum for his own good. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10. <br /> <br /> (See http://www.nixflix.com for a more in-depth review of this film and other foreign films)
