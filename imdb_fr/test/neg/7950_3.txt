I found this movie in a XXX store for $ 1 on VHS. What's interesting is that Camp Video has bought back the rights and that it has a 1986 date in the credits. Anyway, enough strange facts. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely not scary. Even calling this horror or a "thriller" is laughable. There may be only a maximum of 5 minutes of what you call horror in this over 80-minute film, and that was playing, because it was horrible! Aside from the word games, writing this movie was also an absolute mess, just as the special effects and makeup were laughable. No wonder it's such an obscure movie. The director has probably spent the last 35 years searching the country to get all the existing copies and burn it in one pile so that no one else can be subjected to it.
