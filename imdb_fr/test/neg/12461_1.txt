For the first time in reviewing movies, I immediately became indifferent to this story. I do not know if it was the way the movie was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it sounded bland, overused and totally unoriginal. In the first thirty minutes, I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt as if I had already seen this structure, and Tart did not provide anything new to surprise me. After thinking that maybe it was just my mood, I stopped the movie and chose to start it again in the morning, but the same feeling persisted. I did not care. It is not a good sign. The characters were bland. When I say fade, I literally mean that by watching them grow, you will never have any flavor in your palate. The story seemed recycled, almost to the point of plagiarism. Now, I'm not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story, but she did not add anything to the prospect again. The casting was horrible, the underlying symbolism and the themes were so lost that no criticism could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy. You did not know anything about anything or anything, and instead of putting more emphasis on the characters, we ended up with drugs, minor sex, and money laid bare. These are themes that we have seen in every film since the dawn of cinema, but which could not be captured creatively by Wayne. <br /> <br /> What immediately moved me away from this story? It was mainly the characters. I have seen most of Brad Renfro's work and, honestly, he needs to redefine himself. The director Larry Clark has defined it, and curiously, he can not leave this stereotypical character. In the first twenty minutes of Renfro's time, I was bored. I knew exactly what he was trying to describe and why. It was spectacular neither impressive, just repetitive. He needed to bring excitement or suspense to his role, instead of stealthily playing this random social figure. Without a strong character, the final climax of this film is rather disappointing. Renfro did not show the best of his abilities in this film. While I am on the subject ?? no one has shown the best of his abilities. What's going on with Dominique Swain, apart from Lolita, I do not think she really has become an actress, and follow-up with roles like Cat Storm does not help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress I attended who was trying to bring something remarkable to the screen, unfortunately because of the horrible game of all the others, she was lost. Hike here and there, and honestly almost forgotten during the second act. Melanie Griffith was a useless cast and most of the budget for this movie was probably going to her TWO scenes in which she was. Perhaps the rest has been attributed to a random guy from The Kids in the Hall, who desperately needs to get away from any project. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem, apart from acting, was the rhythm of this movie. Nothing, and it's hard for me to say, but nothing gels. There have been so many sub-stories throughout the film that no real substance has been formed. The burglaries, the "anxieties and misfortunes" of the teenagers, the rich socialites learning how horrible real life is, the random guy from Kids in the Hall and even the end seemed just rushed and horribly altered together. With this poor quality craftsmanship, the whole story never really took shape. The family structures have never been defined, no emotion has been emitted for the characters and we have only left pieces of honest remains. Wayne did not complete the task entrusted to him. <br /> <br /> While I do not like to put the whole burden on the director, this film leaves me little choice. With a horrible title that just shouted the opposite of what was being discussed in the film, with amateurish directional skill, the cast was able to give all the emotions of each scene, leaving us with a disgusting game and developments mediocre, and with a vague narration Difficult to place a "good" behind Tart. It was a film I had never heard of, and after watching it, I can see why. All Wayne has done with this movie is to randomly take excerpts from other movies that have better defined all of the above and cut them all together to get the movie Tart. It's hard for me to say that, but Wayne ruined this movie. Although I do not think there was much to be learned from the story, all the remaining excitement was evacuated when Wayne took the helm. Although most of the time, you can credit part of the story, perhaps a powerful acting game, or even music, in Tart you can not credit anything. From the opening sequence to the end, I had the impression of swimming in very lumpy oat flakes. No coherence, no strength. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a waste of time. If you are looking for deep symbolic elements or possibly jokes about our society, you will not find them in this film. Although I know that's what Wayne was trying to show, the final product seems to have been published on an Etch-a-Sketch. It was an embarrassing film to watch and not encourage anyone to take it. Wayne threw all the lessons of his studies to Columbia University and destroyed two hours of my life. To avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Grade: * on *****
