I watched about an hour of this movie (against my will) and I could not finish it. I would say it's a 0. The writing was bad, the plot predictable and the one that was made too many times. The most annoying part of this film was the acting by Melody Thomas Scott. This part did not call anyone who seemed snobbish, but it was successful in all the scenes that I saw to look like a snob (sour) or someone who was about to throw something extremely sarcastic or cruel. <br /> <br /> The two romances that seemed to become serious almost meeting couples were a little too much. <br /> <br /> I should know better than watching movies specially made for television. If there's absolutely nothing on TV and it's the only choice, read a book.
