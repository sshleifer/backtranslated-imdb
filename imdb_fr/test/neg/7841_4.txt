Although predictable and artificial, it's not a bad movie. This amuses all that Van Damme hopes to do. The ubiquitous "twin" device is once again in use (as in many of Van Damme's films), but it is not a problem except for long-time fans. Natasha is beautiful and deserves to be watched. The action is decent, nothing spectacular for Van Damme but exciting. I can recommend to fans of Van Damme and even those who are not, but do not be afraid of an action movie with a beautiful senior couple. The Russian Mob is a cool and topical concept for the day. Obviously, not his best movie but not his worst.
