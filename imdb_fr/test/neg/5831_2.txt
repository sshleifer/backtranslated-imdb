From time to time, 4kids brings new shows to his business. In recent years, they have brought pure gold like Kirby: Back to Ya! or Mew Mew Power. But recently, 4kids has been disabled. CatDog is one of the examples. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to write a negative comment without denigrating the series, but in reality, Weekenders is pure waste. This is a group that has an overactive brain. The trap, however, is that everything he thinks is bad. It may look good on paper, but after looking at it, you'll realize how good this show is. <br /> <br /> The pizza guy is an extremely stupid character. He is very one-dimensional, he really does not have much of it. He is hyper active, end of the story. Although many think that all the characters are a scam of South Park, I think on the contrary. Mechazawa of High School Cromartie is an interesting character and he is able to make me laugh. Tino can not do one or the other. <br /> <br /> The distribution of the series is not better. Like Tino's mother, they lack character. They stick to a characteristic and that's all. The only quality that redeems is the fact that the show can make you smile. Whether it's a really fun scene or a sneaky smile, how stupid it is. <br /> <br /> Thje Weekenders is a very bad Disney / 4kids show. Although he seems to like some fans, it should be left to the children.
