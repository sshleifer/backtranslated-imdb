It is a pale imitation of "officer and gentleman". There is no chemistry between Kutcher and the stranger who plays his love interest. The dialogue is wooden, the situations trivialized. It is too long and the climax is anti-climactic (!). I like the USCG, its men and women are fearless and tough. The action scenes are great, but I'm afraid this movie does not do much for recruiting. The script is formulated, but confusing. Kutcher's character tries to redeem himself for an accident he was not responsible for? Costner is raging against the disappearance of light, but why? His "conflict" with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle. I saw this preview for free and I certainly felt like I was getting my money's worth.
