In the dark days of 1990, Spielberg's heir to the throne (after the failure of Phil Joanou, supposedly awesome), was mistakenly presumed to be the pretentious aspirant David Mickey Evans of Spielberg. Evans managed to steal the studios for over a million dollars, persuading baby boomers to believe in his script - a combination of nostalgic 1960s references and a troubling drama about child abuse - In a way, it was like a good storytelling and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> As Rod Stewart once said, "Look how you can go wrong." <br /> <br /> But the novice's artistic and innovative scenario, "inspired" by "ET", convinced enough people that he was the next elected - the new Spielberg - and so an agreement was reached to not only buying the screenplay for more money than 99% of the world's population will ever see while alive, but also for Evans to make the film - even if he had never directed anything in his life. <br /> <br /> Hey, how hard is it to be another movie genius, after all? <br /> <br /> Two weeks after shooting began, Columbia has discovered. His dailies were labeled "totally unusable" by the studio - or at least those who were weighted enough not to have fallen under the USN. (New clothes of the emperor). All his images were discarded and recycled into guitar images. <br /> <br /> So what can a studio do after paying $ 10 million or $ 20 million for something they thought still represented Steven Spielberg's Resurrection? Engage Spielberg himself to save the day? Columbia probably tried that. <br /> <br /> Enter old pro Richard Donner. Hey, he may not be a movie genius, but he does his job. "Superman" was not bad after all - and the first "Lethal Weapon" was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Then Donner intervenes and takes the reins of management. Fortunately, he managed to convince Columbia that the worst of the film's tasteless films - which would have happened like a swirl of acid at the age of ten - must disappear. Unfortunately, he remains in the Crying Buffalo (ooh, what poetry) and the ridiculous and pseudo-Spielberg spooky ending, with Clueless Mom perfectly satisfied for the rest of his life to get postcards from his missing son while he does around the world red wagon. Yes. <br /> <br /> But Donner managed to get a decent performance from Elijah Wood. And Lorraine Bracco as the silly mother was not bad either. Maybe Donner should be reevaluated. Maybe it's not a Hollywood hack that everyone has always believed. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this over-cooked firewall a score of 2 is that someone was smart enough to throw the big John Heard (but in the wrong part , of course). The kids are fine ... even though Tom Hanks' horrific and overly explanatory narrative destroys almost every scene she intrigues. <br /> <br /> One would think that after the David Mickey Evanses and Phil Joanous and Troy Duffys of the world, the studios could finally be wise. It is to be hoped that these film-driven setbacks will prevent the emperor's new clothes syndrome from ever having an ugly head. <br /> <br /> Doubtful!
