This is arguably the worst of Ava Gardner's greatest movies. Yes, she is beautiful. But this can wear out over time, especially after the end of the cheesy and predictable movie. <br /> <br /> In this turkey, Robert Walker must claim that it is Eddie Bracken (which surely embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays the role of Jane Powell (golly, gee). Dick Haymes plays a kind of weak sidekick (!), And Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a host of other ferocious semi-comic women). Yes, the movie contains a major popular song, "Speak Low". But take a look at the other pieces, quite forgettable Dick Haymes sings very well, of course, and the uncredited singer doubling for Ava. <br /> <br /> The sets are cheap, the screenplay is full of clich√©s and a failed humor, and Tom Conway seems to have done it. been struggling with alcohol (as it was elsewhere). In short, if you want to see Ava at its peak, buy a picture and stay away from this movie.
