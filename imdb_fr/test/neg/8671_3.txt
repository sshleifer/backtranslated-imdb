In the United States, it was broadcast on television. Others commented on the fidelity (or lack of fidelity) to the novel; the 1983 version of the BBC is far superior on this and all others. Given the scope of the novel, it should not have been condensed to 85 minutes. Key sections should be rushed, mentioned or omitted; the time necessary to enter the chronology of events is scarcely sacrificed; the development of character must therefore be sacrificed: we can not really know who the people are, which deprives us of what makes Austen so great. <br /> <br /> One of the main disadvantages for me was the cinematography, which I found just horrible and literally disgusting. The camera is constantly doing ultra-close-ups and going around in circles. Maybe on a small TV channel, everything is fine, but on our 40 "high definition screen, it was so literally dizzying that my wife and I had to look several times off the board (my reserve of Dramamine was exhausted.) This has diverted attention from the rather dull game I play by reading-what's in the script (isolated scenes are well done, but not enough to save things). <br /> < Addition to the score So far, in the JA all round contest: I would say that "Northanger Abbey" is a success, because of superior direction and higher production values ​​(and the story lends itself better to treatment short), "Persuasion" OK (although it is not equal to the other versions (condensation is at fault again), both very much ahead of this attempt, I hope better in the two remaining novels of Jane Austen, the summary of this TV player, I am grateful, as others, to have left P & P alone!
