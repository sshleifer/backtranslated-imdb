I love Arnold and I love the subject, but it was a very disappointing movie. When I saw the glimpses for the first time, they were dark and menacing, and Arnold's name was not even mentioned. But I recognized him, which led me to think that he was making a more serious film. That it was not just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (although I admit it, most of his are pretty good!). So far, he had avoided movies with a real religious theme. And I was excited. I was wrong. This is just another action, explosion, fire movie. And it's a very bad one.
