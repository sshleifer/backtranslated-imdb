It's sad to say that a movie is really awful and we're trying to find a way to say it. However, it's a dreadful movie. Gene Hackman loses time (and a suspect, many dollars) to replay his most famous role and most often reconstituted under the name of "Gene Hackman". Otherwise, television actors have the opportunity to become movie stars and successfully resist temptation. Patrick Swayze has a small part and is moving on to bigger things for which he must be eternally grateful. <br /> <br /> I watched this film as a result of someone else's criticism and I felt that another point of view was: deserved. You may not agree with my comment, but now, at least, you've been warned.
