The original Airport (1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two Series B films (Airport 1975, Airport '77) were at best amusing, at best, fun at the camp; but this grim and inept final entry has no entertainment value and displays shocking contempt for its audience. It's unbearable and not even good for laughs. <br /> <br /> The three suites of "Airport" are theatrical releases made by Universal's television channel, but this one falls short of the modest standards of a televised movie of its time, with a cheap production, grotesque castes and visual ugliness. and "comedy" tasteless and funny. The project was clearly condemned to the "creative" efforts of Universal's executive, Jennings Lang, who himself produced a generic "story". <br /> <br /> Everyone starts somewhere and the author Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) could have provided an element of auto-burlesque, like the previous films (including the famous Airport 1975) , but nothing is worth bluffing in Roth's turbulent and incoherent scenario and even in the Airplane comedy! This crud remained untouchable. <br /> <br /> What makes Le Concorde: Airport '79 particularly shocking is its abusive use of professionals. The worst victim is Cicily Tyson (Miss Jane Pittman's autobiography), a gifted woman, mercilessly reduced to a vomiting secondary intrigue in which she escorts a frozen heart transplant during the unfortunate flight. <br /> <br /> A special kick to the groin is reserved for the magnificent George Kennedy, who is the real main role despite his burial in the list of actors. The official mascot of the series "Airport" and the only actor to appear in the four films, Kennedy had more than deserved the main role and his turn in the captain's seat would have been the only possible reason for this entry, apart from pressing a last dollar. Kennedy provides the only warmth and true humor of this mechanical muckup, briefly setting aside machismo bravura and revealing a truly sweet and tender side, as well as his adorable and heroic character of "Joe Patroni". Unfortunately, we never have the right to forget how big, old and old Kennedy is, and the pretty boy, Alain Delon, constantly calls him "Porky Pig" as part of a boyfriend relationship. falls completely flat. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only human part of this plane wreck, is simply an installation for an odious joke at the expense of Patroni, Kennedy and the viewer.
