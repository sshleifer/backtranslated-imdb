I received this film in a pack called "50 star movies" for $ 18 (45 cents each). Many are good. This one was terrible. It was a retreaded tire made 1000 times before and better every time. A disabled ex-jock dares to train a team of juvenile delinquents. They learn from him that they can do it if they follow the rules. I'm sure children and locals were thrilled to be included in a "real TV movie", but I can not imagine what the people who started and produced this project thought they could bring about this already outdated . I was waiting to see this "new twist" or "new angle" but, honestly, it does not come. Avoid this movie. Forget the 45 cents, I want to find the 96 minutes of my life.
