This movie was a real nuisance from the beginning to the end. Ok, so I congratulate Boorman for raising the global recognition of events in Burma, but that's all he has achieved. About 10 minutes into the movie, I thought, oh no, we're going back, and I could have told you exactly what would happen in the next 80 minutes or so. Patricia Arquette was irrelevant in this role and his acting was wooden and unconvincing. Remember that you are faced with such a terribly conventional script, perhaps boredom, and this has been reflected on the screen. Much of the film was simply laughable. At one point, old Arquette's mate is shot and he is prostrate on the ground. In the next scene, he sprints through the forest, obviously trying to beat the world record of 100 meters! - Or maybe he's just trying to escape Boorman !! If you have trouble sleeping one night, then play Beyond Rangoon on your VCR and snore in no time. I very rarely criticize a film as heavy as this one, but in this case, it is completely justified.
