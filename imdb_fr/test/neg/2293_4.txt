A Swedish splatter movie? Has the world gone mad? <br /> <br /> Probably not, but it's not commonplace these days with Swedish movies, Swedish film activity seems to have problems these days, gone the golden days of " Rymdinvasion i lappland ". And this film seems to have some problems in itself: it is too talkative, it still manages to be quite fun especially for the good special effects, which are excellent for a movie series. The script and most actors are still pretty bad, but it does not really matter, it's supposed to be a bloody movie and nothing more, that's where it turns out a little wrong for a reason any. There is simply not enough blood to fill the void. <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows Gert Fylking will enjoy his role as Sgt. although. I almost laughed my ass. It's so hilarious. <br /> <br /> Besides the good parts I've listed, there's really nothing else to recommend here unless you're hungry for Swedish B movies. <br /> <br /> 4/10
