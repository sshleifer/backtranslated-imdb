Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mr. Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patent curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny. The film itself is brimming with mawkish sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is presented with many indomitable references to religious faith and American patriotism that prove to be too reverential and authentic. Clifton Webb does his best with a mediocre script. Edmund Gwenn still plays another jolly clergyman and has nothing to do. The main role of the child actor is played by a child without talent who displays a flat effect throughout the film. His only claim to fame as an interpreter is obviously a low voice similar to an unusual bullfrog for someone of his age. However, once you have heard it, you have heard it and you do not need to hear it again. Unfortunately, he is in the majority of the scenes of the film. I find this child so irritating that I make a quick lead every time he shows up. Since he has a lot of scenes in this movie, it means that I quickly move a big part of the film. There were and there are so many talented kids. it's a shame that this film contains none. Nevertheless, Clifton Webb in the traditional brimmed hat and shorts is a sight to behold.
