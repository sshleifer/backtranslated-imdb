This film had a very unique effect on me: it blocked my awareness that this film is really bad! It's disguised as a "thinker movie", as in Memento and other jewels like that, but in the end, and even after a few minutes, you realize it's nothing more than a Pretentious pretentious. Probably written by a student in collage with friends too compassionate to tell him that his writing is nil. The whole idea is ?? I do not even know if he's trying to scratch the supernatural, or if they want us to believe that because somebody fills your mind (very weak, by the way) with stupid "riddles", kind of those you will learn during recess of elementary school, you suddenly arrive at the "single truth" about everything, then you must kill someone and confess ??. !!! What? How, what, why, WHY? Is it just like saying that to make a cake, just throw a bunch of ingredients, and add some water? forgot to cook it? I guess these guys forgot not to explain, but to introduce the mechanism of WHY was this happening? You must do this when you present a story in which normal daily acts (rhymes of resolution of lies) begin to have an abnormal effect on people. Playing was horrible, with this girl always trying to look cute in front of the camera, and the Highlanders guy, the show, behaving like a heavy metal record player (yeah, they're all real, though s-o-b's). The "menacing" atmosphere, with the "oh-so-smart" riddles (enter the 60s Batman and Robin series, with The Riddle guest guest) and the crazy ones who claim to have "the knowledge" behind this smirk ?? Simply horrible, HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> In general, I am very biased about low-budget films, and I tend to look for outsiders by giving them more praise than they could deserve, instead of their restrictions you know, but it's an ugly excuse for a movie that will make you want to stay good for an hour and a half, and in the end, you'll just whine.
