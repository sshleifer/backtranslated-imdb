So pathetic that it's not even funny. From the first scene of the movie, I knew I would have a bad time. Thank God, I only saw this movie on TV. The scenario was terrible, not to mention the acting. It was horrible. Very unreal and unusual things happened during this move, such as. The lady whips a whip under the door and whips a little guy who just gave him the keys. I'm like, GET REAL. The creators tried to create a futuristic city and even deepened my disgust for the film. To tell you the truth, the only good thing in this movie was the fights, which in themselves were pretty lame. All I could ask myself watching this movie was "when will it go!"
