I guess I was ready after all the years to hear about it. Siskel and Ebert have heard about it for the first time. When they said Divine was eating faeces, I had to look for him. Then a friend told me about it in 1991. She also said that her parents had seen her right out and that her mother had almost dropped her father! So by the time I caught Pink Flamingos at Sundance today, I was ready. For the majority. <br /> <br /> I still could not help but be surprised by the big anal shots and the blowjob scene. That said, the only characters I sympathized with were Edie and the egg man. His crying scene at the beginning of the film, even if it concerns something frivolous for normal people, makes me really sad. Although she was not pretty, she had a pretty voice. I was happy for her and the egg man, and they really touched me. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the production of this production at the level of poverty was not good. And as for the script, how did John Waters create this stuff? At least it's different.
