This movie is just bad. First of all, the story is just weird and it is not well written. This leaves you with questions when you are done. Sometimes it does not matter, but not in this case. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to play in the theater. Adults do a decent job, but children, considered children, do not do a good job. I thought the lead role, Ian Costello in the role of Mickey, was worse. Well, to be honest, I'm not sure that's the main role. Never quite understood who was speaking this movie. Mickey or Pete. <br /> <br /> There were some shots that stood out, but in the end, there was nothing extraordinary about cinematography. The sound, however, was better. There was a good score. A bit of adventure score, although it does not look like an adventure movie for me. There were some elements of an adventure movie, but it was more of a drama. However, it was hard to tell who this movie was for. Children? Barely. There is too much language and violence for that. Adults? I do not know. It included many elements of a children's movie. It was like an adult movie in a children's movie. <br /> <br /> The story was strange. I do not have much idea of ​​what it really was. You were flushed without knowing anything, but there were all the time references to something you felt you needed to know. The fact that the parents of the children are dead, for example, and that Mickey blamed Pete for that. You expected to know what happened, but you never understood it. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was bad and a waste of time. There was no reader inside. Nothing that can really move the story forward. This is not what you spend on your Saturday night.
