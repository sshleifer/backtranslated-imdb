EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Unorthodox journalist Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) spends his time losing the local gendarmerie and trying to romance a police staff member. But everything changes when the patron of the side pub Thames, he attended, is found murdered and found a transcript of an unpublished novel published by the legendary writer Charles Dickens. As he deepens these two mysteries, he is immersed in the mystery and danger he had foreseen. <br /> <br /> In 1998, former footballer Vinnie Jones shot from nowhere and surprised everyone with his classic gangster cult. Lock, reserve and two smoking barrels. Okay, no one was blown away by his acting abilities, but his presence as a hard man seemed poised for a decent career as a tough guy. But all this turned out to be a marvel, and all he managed to do after that was to support much more acclaimed actors in movies like Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish, before switching to the realm of right DVD, the last being this confusing and laborious thriller, which could have been fine if he had not taken with him other talented stars such as Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith . What made him fall so fast from the dizzying heights of his success (except perhaps being a one-off pony) is a conjecture (a risky personal life being a possible conjecture), but here it is. <br /> <br /> A scenario as far-reaching and incomprehensible as it would have been a task in the hands of anyone, but with a melee head that looks bad in the head, it's even more of a task to understand. The juxtaposed roles of Jacobi as a former fighter and Dickens himself speaking directly to the camera are obviously allusions to constructing something and the scenario is also predictable in other areas. Add to that inexpensive production values ​​and the first director (also screenwriter) Brendan Foley made a bad first impression. <br /> <br /> What was I exactly expecting with something that's free with The Daily Mail? *
