The theatricality and drama included in the film are fantastic, but the facts and research are far from solid. In quoting Dr. Bovon, where the documentary attempts to establish a connection with Mariamene's Mary Magdalene, Dr. Bovon later clarifies that it should be used for literary purposes (ie: fables of this time) and not for a historical figure. In fact, he says he does not believe that Mariamene's ossuary at Talpiot is Mary Magdalene. He then comments in his public letter that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary, but rather for information about Acts of Philip (a literary work in the 4th century). <br /> <br /> We have here a director who made a clip for a 4th century Acts of Philip fantasy and used it specifically to support a 1st century ossuary inscription. Dr. Bovon describes the relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene as "science fiction", which should be qualified as right.
