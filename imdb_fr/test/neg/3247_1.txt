A crazy assault on the senses of viewers. This is a mix of assorted Hindi and English movies - poorly made. The name is similar to that of a 70s multi-star, which also boasts the 2002 version. The story is from the Sunil Dutt / Reena Roy scenario of the 70s - "Nagin" and visual effects taken (an attempt horrible) in The Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible II. <br /> <br /> environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - schoolboys !!! ??? !!), Manisha Koirala is the victim, who commits a fatal aggression against her by two students as part of a collective effort on the part of our heroes. It turns out that Manisha is a Cobra (Nag) serpent who was born again in this life and that his companion of the previous life, now become a super powerful and assuming (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohli, is looking for her in this life. Manisha asks him to avenge his violation and murder. <br /> <br /> This is how the mad murderous madness begins, where the avenging lover begins to select each man in the group, with increasing powers and tricks over the course of the attempts. The effects are extremely cheap, with computer-generated skeletons, bodies in transformation, and motorcycle stunts completing the stuffing. <br /> <br /> Nagin's postponement includes Raj Babbar in a role played by a Catholic priest who offers temporary relief to our boys. "Religion" correct "multi-religion medallion (the original Nagin had only one" Om ") Sunny Deol plays the role of Manisha's love in his present life and his ultimate savior against the all-powerful Munish Kohli. br /> <br /> Music and songs are below average. <br /> <br /> cheap fantasies.
