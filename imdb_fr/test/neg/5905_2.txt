This film begins with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward, in the presence of two caregivers. The unconscious main character is heard in a voice-over, saying that the rapporteurs are homosexuals. The nurses kiss each other. I watched this in a DVD version and I have the suspicion that it's supposed to be funny ?? it said "comedy" on the DVD case after all and it goes on like that. If I had seen that in a movie theater, I would have probably heard some of the audience burst out laughing because it's so funny ?? and because They are supposed to be sitting in a comedy. Although it is fascinating to think of what is funny or not, this film unfortunately offers only arguments on what is not. <br /> <br /> A brilliant brain can DO Something funny, people like Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proven it. But you have to know the "mechanics", I suppose, the director and co-writer, Dani Levy, does not care about these mechanisms, he thinks that some things are just funny, the fact that two caregivers are homosexuals and kiss on a man in a coma, for example, do not get me wrong, some people can DO it funny, Dani Levy can not, not for me anyway. <br /> <br /> The main thing The problem I have with this film is that I do not see any reason behind the way the main characters behave.I did not understand why the two brothers, an orthodox Jew from West Germany, and a copy Fast Eddie Felson's third-class carbon from the former East Germany are so unloved, they are both rather bland characters, their children are boring, apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other. the other (well, we're a lesbian now but she raise the girl she has with her cousin). But even these incestuous relationships ?? if something is embarrassing - just give yourself an excuse because the writers could not find anything better. <br /> <br /> The acting is not bad, Udo Semel really liked me, although he reminded me more of the former Chancellor Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) than of a venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction itself is not really bad either, but maybe Levy should stick to making movies, leaving the script to someone else. Now, I heard that he made a comedy about Hitler. Oi, Vai!
