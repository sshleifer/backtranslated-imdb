It's a piece of Hollywood product that should never have left a movie. Dialogue without plausible thinking, pointless plot, unskillful staging, directionless direction and action without the value of a freshman high school play. The entire cast should have been stopped for his excessive gambling. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, okay!
