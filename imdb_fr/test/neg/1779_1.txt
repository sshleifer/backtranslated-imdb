I'm a fan of low budget B movies and campy horror movies, but it was too much for me. <br /> <br /> If you can go beyond the plot, the tacky effects and the uninspired game, then the horrible writing will kill you, or you want it. The dialogue was most likely written by high school runners, who thought that repeating "Sir, yes sir" on many occasions, gave these guys a more military look. <br /> <br /> The characters were all typical stereotypes of the cardboard: Gung-ho sarge, sorta gung-ho, a guy with a sensitive side, a diabolical scientist with a secret program (bald or of course), a naive brains who would be very hot if she tried too, a stupid sexy chick with essential information, idiot "genius" "nerd, randomly, other military guys who die early enough, and alert character, mad scientist character who was in charge "until something goes wrong" Oh yes, I almost forgot, there is a secret military submarine (sitting?), sitting at the bottom of the ocean, 5 minutes from HQ (at least , it seems), full of radioactive scorpions (ok?) and cadavers.Your mission is vague and ill-defined ..... <br /> <br /> If you look at this, do not say that you have not been warned.
