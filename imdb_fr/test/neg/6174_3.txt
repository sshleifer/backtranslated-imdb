Ugh. Even the very popular Diane Lane could not save this movie, and the most exciting part of the movie was to see if Rourke's face would move. We've heard so much about "gossip" about his failed facelift, etc., so that, as with a roadside accident, we just had to slow down and see the wreckage. The plot was thin. Here, we have a very professional band that focuses on a wild and uncontrollable punk / rogue, and throughout this movie we wonder why this guy stays with this idiot, not to mention meet him in the first place . Then the crime that was not even committed prompts the pro to pursue the witnesses. He would have jumped on the field and there. But then, we would not have had a movie, right? And why did the real estate agent even accept extortion? There were more holes in this film than in my colander. The acting was awful, the whole movie was predictable by the minute, and even the end. And so much could have been done to make a much better movie. But if you have about 90 minutes to kill and you do not have to use brain cells, then this film is exactly what the doctor has prescribed.
