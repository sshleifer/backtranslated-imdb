Herschell Gordon Lewis, a low budget schlockmeister, reaches a new floor (even for him) with "The Gore Gore Girls", a "movie" (snicker) that has all its technical marks: its poorly recorded, poor lighting and OTT gore . It would be tolerable, even a little charming, if the film had at least one interesting plot ("Blood Feast", in all its ridiculous glory, is a good example), but "Girls" is a total sleepiness. Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress), a pompous private investigator in the ass who has nothing like it, is recruited by a journalist to find out who murdered out-of-shape strippers (you will not worry about the culprit long before these two people do not close the case)). As before, the call is not a conspiracy, but the creative methods of bleeding (including the tenderizing of a girl with a wooden mallet) and the occasional bursts of skin then risky ... but this is not enough not the material above boredom.
