An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book. Rude and inappropriate humor, scary passages and a sickening anecdote of the mother's boyfriend who wants to send him to the military school to get him out of the way makes this situation totally inappropriate for the children of the book (3- 8 years. Do not waste your money, time, or good judgment.
