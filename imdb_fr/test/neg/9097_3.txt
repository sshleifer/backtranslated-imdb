This movie contains pretty gorey parts, like an ass that breaks and another big bite. Castle Freak himself is a good monster. I would be very scared if he came after me. However, the film had silly passages. <br /> <br /> A drunk driving husband, kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter. I suppose death is more serious damage than blindness, but you would never know that parents really feel bad about seeing their daughter go blind. All that interests them is that "J.J. is dead!" While their teenage daughter walks around and tells how she can never drive a car. The parents are like - "Honey, stop walking without a guide, you know better than that", then they cry and never stop being depressed because JJ is dead. That seems to me to be favoritism. <br /> <br /> The lines of dialogue are neither very realistic nor well designed. For example, when a giant shock is heard in the castle, everyone rushes into the basement to see what it was. It was a huge mirror that crashed to the floor and broke. The husband rushes over the broken mirror with horror and says clearly, "The mirror broke." I do not know. I would say a little more than that if a giant mirror crumbled mysteriously in my castle. <br /> <br /> The husband and wife have big relationship problems and it's funny to see how dumb they are with each other. Nobody ever believes the blind girl. Tip: If a blind girl says she hears things, believe her and do not tell her to shut up. I think that's the moral of the story. Listen to people when they tell you things, otherwise you risk killing yourself to prove your point of view. <br /> <br /> Finally, I thought the best character was the main policeman. He was the best actor and character. Everyone (except Castle Freak) was pretty commonplace. 3/10
