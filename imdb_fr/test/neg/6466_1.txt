Ladies and gentlemen, may we present the worst of all Disney remakes. Although the name of this movie is "That Darn Cat", it should have been "That Darn Teen" or "FBI Agent". The cat did not have very good scenes, the character of Ricci was more annoying than funny, Doug E. Doug did not have good replicas, even the role of Dean Jones could not save this movie! The only good characters were the only two mechanics in the city, but their scenes were only brief. All in all, I would say that if you're thinking of watching this movie, try something smarter, like a Barney video.
