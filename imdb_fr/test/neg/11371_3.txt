Although not as bad as some movies (like the horrific "Atomic Twister"), "Meltdown" still relies on common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear energy sector to advance its plot. I am currently studying nuclear engineering as part of a master's degree, and it was easy to point out the flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved in the industry. <br /> <br /> Overcoming the false fear of a collapse of the Chernobyl style could occur in an American factory, the film claims that any merger (even partial, according to one of the film's guest commentators) would mean a disaster for the region. In fact, a partial meltdown in an American plant, while destroying the core, would pose no risk to the surrounding area. Three Mile Island was partially melted and no radioactive material was released to the environment due to the natural fuel stability and basic design used in this country, coupled with substantial containment. <br /> <br /> The security measures presented in the film were perhaps the part of the film furthest from the truth. Regardless of the strategic location, whether it's a power plant, a chemical plant, a military base or anything else, you'll never see staff respond to an alarm by discussing it was an unexpected exercise. This is especially true in a nuclear power plant where, at the onset of the alarm, the reactors would be immediately destroyed, which would stop them. SCRAMing can be done by pressing a button in the control room (it is not necessary to put the kernel in "stop mode" as described in the movie), and the nuclear fission chemistry prevents a nucleus from coming back turned on approximately 9 hours after a SCRAM. So, if this scenario unfolded in real life, the attackers could not cause a major crisis. In theory, they could still create a partial one because of the residual heat if they immediately expose the heart, but it would be almost impossible given the many backup systems present in a plant - they are much more numerous than the only pumps relief they talk about. in the movie. <br /> <br /> For spent fuel pools, it may be possible to turn pools into dirty bombs by blowing them up, but this is much more difficult than parking a truck full of explosives near the pools. The fuel is under (about) 18 feet of highly purified water. Water can not become radioactive (no radioactive vapor as discussed in the film). Particles dissolved in water can, but not the water itself; this is the reason for a very thorough purification. So the only way to turn a fuel pool into a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water. This is not an easy task as the water is very heavy and the pools are underground with very thick concrete walls. Explosives should be in the pool below the fuel (which is securely attached). And it would take a lot of explosives because the water is very difficult to move in an explosion. Even if this were to happen, the spent fuel is not extremely radioactive and the explosion would not result in a death toll as high as that mentioned in the film, especially given the small amount of radioactive material to be propagated. . <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the base film, I'm a little tired of the style used. The trend of constant weakening of entrances and exits, the use of grainy black and white, as well as the speed of tracking and panning seemed very friendly. The characters were one-dimensional, especially those of the US government. I have some problems with the twist thrown in the movie, but I will not talk about it because it would be a major spoiler. <br /> <br /> Overall, 3/10
