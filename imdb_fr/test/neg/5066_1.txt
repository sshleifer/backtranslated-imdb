I admire the efforts made to try to reach the rest of the world with this tragic story. However, the film is so bad that most people I know could not let it go. The film was relevant to me since I lived in Estonia when these events took place, but it is written horribly and does not catch the attention of someone who knows nothing about it. The musical choices are not going well in the film, it seems that someone has just lit a CD player in the background to put the actors "in the mood". The acting game The only actors are Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland, although Prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role. As for the evolution of relations between Erik Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuter (Greta Scacchi), it's like watching a train wreck. There is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to attend their "sincere moments". It's not a good movie. There is a difference between trying to get a message across (it could have been a documentary!) And trying to make a good movie. It is a failure and all those who say otherwise make me wonder if they are trying to promote it. In fact, as a native of Estonia, I am shocked by this miserable effort. This tragedy deserves more than just a movie excuse to chase low-budget ghosts. It could have been a lot more!
