I do not really consider myself a conservative, so this film did not personally offend me, but it was clear that the plot and characterization in this film were secondary to the message. And the message is that all conservatives are mean or stupid (or both). The characters are one-dimensional - either good freedom-loving Americans or brave, greedy and evil-minded conservatives. There is nothing intelligent or creative, just anti-conservative. Political bias does not really bother me, but that should not be the only purpose of the film. And it's clear. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the cast is wonderful and Chris Cooper's opinion on W is funny the first two or three times, but after that, it's the same old joke <br /> <br /> So, if you really hate the conservatives, you'll probably enjoy this movie, but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a less black and white story, then you'd better look something else.
