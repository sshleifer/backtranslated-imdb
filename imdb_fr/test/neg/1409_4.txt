I was aware of the man-of-the-year critical pans and his insignificant brute, but I was willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt because I know that good images can fall under the radar during the Exit calendar cluttered with autumn months. <br /> <br /> What I discovered is that the film is surprisingly uninspired. Surprising is a euphemism considering Barry Levinson's gift for political satire (demonstrated in Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog) and obvious Robin Williams cartoon gifts. Robin Williams, in fact, is mysteriously underutilized. On the "Making Of" featurette that accompanies the DVD, Barry Levinson explained how he sometimes let Robin Williams improvise from the screenplay, as if it were a nasty secret. Uh, are you really so stupid, Barry Levinson? Whenever you have Robin Williams in your movie and want to use it for his comic abilities (basically, any movies in which he has played other than Insomnia or One Hour Photo), do not have him shut up in a scenario . Let him edit anything he wants, because it's funnier than anything anyone can write for him and his content-free comic can instantly raise the bar for any mediocre film like RV or Patch Adams. What I found even more disconcerting in his inability to use Robin Williams is that in 1987, Levinson used that exact formula to perfection in Good Morning Vietnam, injecting Robin Williams' comic zanyes into a painting. of war to create a resounding political event. piece. <br /> <br /> The film is not as festive as it could be and feels clumsily lost in its tone. If the film had the potential to work, it could have made one of these mid-90s thrillers in the manner of The Pelican Brief, The Fugitive or one of those Jack Ryan movies. His plot is about an employee of a Silicon Valley company who discovers a problem in a system that reveals that the country has elected the wrong president and that the CEOs are trying to eliminate it before secrecy be revealed. If you replace Robin Williams with a certain Harrison The Ford-type actor, or maybe even Harrison Ford himself, added some extra explosions, and maybe that's where the movie was trying to go. I'll never really know it and it's not worth trying to find out.
