I only rented this stinker because of its relatively high rating. It's totally nil! I can not imagine how you would think it's a good movie - even a movie OK. None of the characters had ANY redeeming quality. To varying degrees, they were each selfish and petty - or abused and damaged personalities who had no idea of ​​the Christmas spirit (when that happens!). I know Canadians and I like them - but I can not think that thinks it's a good movie. I would rather have a punch in the eye than watch this offensive movie again. A waste of time and money colossal. Do not believe the person who wrote the opinion that it was "worth watching". This person would probably also like to have a dentist drill their teeth without anesthesia. Do not want to be mean, but for my life, I can not imagine what this person was thinking. Unless they had ulterior motives. Maybe he was the director or the producer. If so, I would like to ask them to give me back my money. If your money is important to you - keep it instead of renting it - or rent something (anything!) Otherwise. I lack good reasons not to rent this movie. If I were Canadian, I would be convinced that it is a favorite Canadian film. If that is the case, I would say that those who think it certainly need large amounts of powerful drugs. Yeck!
