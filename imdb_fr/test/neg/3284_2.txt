I screamed when I heard the first piece of canned laughter in the first few seconds of the show, but I gave it a chance. You KNOW that when someone offers a rather amusing line and you hear a piece of dummy laughter explode in laughter, it is a show intended for morons who need to be told "yes, 's funny, go ahead and laugh ". /> <br /> Ugh. I could not stand this show as it turned out. I can not speak for everyone - after all, some people really like this IDIOTIC show "Stacked" (which makes me want to throw up). I can imagine that those who like "Stacked" could actually love this drivel too. Some people still have a kick from the old gag "pull my finger". For me, this show is as spiritual as it is original. <br /> <br /> The themes were old and tired. The jokes were lame and messy. The characters are the ones we've seen everywhere before - and the worst you can imagine. <br /> <br /> So ... if you like things like scorching words and neighbors saying "pull my finger" ... you could really like this show. Otherwise ... pass the par. It's stupid - and not in an intelligent or original way. This one is about as old and tired as any show has ever been at its premiere.
