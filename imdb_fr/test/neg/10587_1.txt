I was expecting this movie to be absolutely horrible. Like for example "What Dreams May Come" or "The Truman Show". Well, they were selling it Â£ 3.99 to my local HMV and there was Giovanni Ribisi on the cover, you know you can not help but love it, so my friends challenged me to 'buy. and I was sure it was going to be rubbish. Maybe that's the only reason I could get through this movie because my standards were never that high.
