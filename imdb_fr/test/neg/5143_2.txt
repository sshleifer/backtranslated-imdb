The film seems to have been built from a disjointed dream. There is not enough realism to retain the interest of the viewer. The scene of the Vermont Farm was a missed opportunity to show how the farms were set up and the farm families alive, which would have been interesting and entertaining. There was little or no research on the illicit trade in whiskey at the time. The costumes of the Canadians looked like something from the French Revolution, totally unbelievable. The violin was playing well at the time, but Chris's movements were supposed to be incredible. The appearance of the owl was a mystery never explained and the train disappearing in the air, it was too much. I did not understand how a live trout had been frozen in the ice and why two men without food, in the wild, released trout, a good source of food.
