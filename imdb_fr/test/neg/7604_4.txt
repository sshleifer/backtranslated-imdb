It was a real disappointment for me. The original white-haired bride is a fantastic kung-fu movie, but this one was rather weak. I did not care at all about the new characters who unfortunately dominated the time on the screen and the story was not well developed. While the first film was tragic and that it was tedious (I just counted the time elapsed until the unhappy lovers meet). The action was poor in this one too. The fights were not very well choreographed and there was really not a lot of kung fu. Just a few weak sword fights between the very unpleasant Him and one of Lin's flax women. Lin herself mainly uses a kind of telekinesis to throw people between the walls and sometimes the hair, far from the impressive representation with the whip and kung-fu she showed in the previous movie. I still gave a 4 to this film because at least the pace was fast and I wanted to see what would happen in the end, even if I predicted (like almost everyone who watched the first movie) and after seeing it, I found it anti-culminating and would have liked them to do a proper sequel or leave history alone. I really recommend the first, but as for the rest, only fans of the genre and those who really want to see Lin as the bride once again must apply.
