I went in this movie determined to love it. I usually enjoy drama series like Wall Street, Glen Glen Glen Glen, Boiler Room, etc ... I went into this movie thinking that I would be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I'm a big fan of Pacino. <br /> <br /> What a trash. Probably the worst film I've seen in five years. That makes Pacino's debacle good in Any Given Sunday. First, half of the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. OK, we get it. You're fit, Matt. We do not need to see all the scenes with you pumping iron without a shirt. <br /> <br /> Second, how many holes are there in this movie? Why present the long-lost Brandon father's phone call and stop responding? What was the purpose of his mother who was hanging on to him - why did he even call her to tell him he was sending her too much money - what was the point? The Puerto Rican guy who lost 30 million? In addition, since sports betting is illegal in New York and is illegal, how can they guarantee everyone's bet at the end? <br /> <br /> It was simply a very poorly written script. He had potential, but he was devoid of consistent plot. I thought Pacino had learned his lesson on the selection of the script after Any Given Sunday, but apparently not. My God, it's the same actor who played in the godfather! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money.
