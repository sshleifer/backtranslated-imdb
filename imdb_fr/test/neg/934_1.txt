I do not know what some of these filmmakers think, by doing the same kind of cliche film again and again, where the bad guys (the bad girls in this case) win. Low game and very predictable. Nothing original about it. This same movie was shot over and over again - no different from GOODBYE LOVER (1989), SLOW BURN (2005), or at least ten other movies with exactly the same storyline and the same ending. There are also a lot of holes in the film. It's like they're running out of money and just stopped filming. Or maybe they ran out of ideas. But do not waste your time with this one. It will not leave you upset to have lost your time watching it.
