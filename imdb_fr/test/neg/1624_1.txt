I just read a very long review on the front page of this movie on this site and explained in detail that this movie is only worth watching on the TV show "Mystery Science Theater 3000 !!!!! " And yes, I find this advice really useful! I mean, a movie that tries to be as good and exciting is really not what this movie wants to be !!!!! So yes, watch this movie as seen in this show and instead of giving it one star out of ten, you can give it ten stars out of ten! Until then, my star review is for the real, pure, untouched version of this movie only !!!!!! Do you have that now?
