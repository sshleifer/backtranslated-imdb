I liked Takashi Miike's films that I had seen so far, but I found that rather disappointing. I bought it, but I will not keep it. <br /> <br /> I saw it on the DVD Adness, which only contains two episodes. In the first, a killer removes women, cuts their skull to expose the brain, plants them in the ground up to their chin and plants a flower in the brain. You can tell from the DVD box. In the film, the top of the head is numerically dimmed by the parasites of the television. If you had not seen the DVD box, the viewer would not know what people were watching before a young policeman produced a small model of the body. Curiously, there is also a flash frame later on the woman's head and it is not censored. Apart from that, I'm not really sure what was going on. Some women receive phone calls, and an unclear animated character gets carried away when it happens. An animated character sometimes appears on TV screens. We do not know if anyone sees it. <br /> <br /> In the second episode, pregnant women are found cut open and their babies are missing. Once again, a cop creates a model of what corpses look like, which is useful because the body itself is censored. There is also a natural birth in the film, but curiously, even the baby and the umbilical cord are censored! According to the DVD box, the uncensored versions were not kept during the initial production. Maybe even if they did, if they knew they were going to be censored, maybe they did not even bother to show anything ...? Not sure. <br /> <br /> If I hear that later episodes are better, I'll look for them. As it stands, I will not worry.
