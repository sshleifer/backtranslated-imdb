As a former film buff, I have often heard about the controversial film CALIGULA, ambiguously considered one of the most realistic epics by some and one of the most disgusting pornographic films by others. I decided to see it in the full version in order to evaluate it myself in the hope of finding something positive that would do justice to the many accusations made against the film. I sat in my chair one autumn evening and started to look. The starting quote from the New Testament shocked me a little and raised the first controversy in me ... why involve a phrase from Mark's gospel in the film about pagan Rome? But the pastoral scene prelude with a young half-naked couple (Caligula and Drusilla) running desperately through the meadows seemed rather sentimental. The music that sounded memorable while the credits also provoked me in the positive sense. Yet the negative feelings aroused in me quite quickly, especially at the death of Tiberius. The cruelty seemed very intense and the sexuality exaggerated. However, it was not so bad in the middle. During the second half of the film, I had the impression of not looking at any historical epic, but an extremely disgusting porn. Finally, I said to myself, "This is one of the movies you can really hate" ... I'm aware that a movie can be controversial, but I never imagined that CALIGULA would go that far in removing all the limits of taste. . I hate this movie for many reasons, but especially one. <br /> <br /> CALIGULA does not serve the purpose of an ancient epic (which he claims to be), but Bob Guccione, the director and founder of Penthouse pornographic magazine, aims to combine cinematic art with porn. This is, I think, the most serious issue to which the film can be accused. The film is an art that has to be governed by taste, by the message, by a feeling of epic grandeur while this film kills all the limits of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most beastly of human beings in the most nasty and decadent way. Some scenes are so disgusting that I do not think there are people whose psyche will not be affected. Some say that Rome during Caligula's reign was so brutal. Yes, it's true. Corruption flourished at that time, various sexual deviancies were preferable to Roman citizens. However, I do not think it is fair to focus on these deviations so strictly and to make an emphasis on an old epic. I think this proves rather the weird spirit of the producers and their strange tendencies ... <br /> <br /> HUGE HISTORICAL ERRORS: The scenario of Gore Vidal is known for its inaccuracies. This is noted, for example, with the figure of Proculus (Donato Placido), a historic senator from the Roman era. Yet the film shows him as a simple soldier to whom Caligula imposes his most decadent methods of torture and rape. Moreover, Livia was not Proculus' wife who was raped by Caesar at the time of her marriage. What is behind the transformation of stories of historical characters into stories filled with incredible vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical parody is the figure of Caesonia described by Helen Mirren. She is introduced as Caligula's wife with Drusilla, her sister. In fact, Caligula married Caesonia long after the death of her sister. The sexual assault on his new wife at the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical foundation. I also hated the moment with the killing machine - a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL ASPECT AND CASTING: From the technical point of view, the film is nothing special. Cinematography can not boast of being exceptionally good and the sets and costumes are also nothing exceptional. However, the only highlights of the film are the performances, especially that of Malcolm McDowall in Caligula. He does a perfect job in the leading role describing the madness and cruelty of the emperor. McDowall increases the value of the film. If everything bothers you in CALIGULA, you can at least admire his performance. I also loved Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (the film is based on Suetonius' gossip that Caligula made love to her sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole as old Tiberius are also memorable. O'Toole plays his best actor in the sequence of Capri's cave, illustrating the decadence and escape of the old emperor. Yes, I recognize that the only thing I like in CALIGULA is the performance. Therefore, I do not score the movie at 1/10. <br /> <br /> CONTINUITY OF THE BLADES: The historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with a poor continuity. Let us analyze just the beginning: Caligula comes to Capri Grotto where he sees the terrible pleasures of old Tiberius. After about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome where a black bird near Drusilla and Caligula's bed is a bad omen. And immediately the characters are again in Capri where Nerva (John Gielgud) is dying ...? <br /> <br /> Overall, I do not recommend seeing CALIGULA to anyone. If you want to know the story, read the magnificent novel by Robert Graves I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD or watch Herbert Wise's mini-series with the magnificent performance of Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick movie whose most serious crime is the destruction of art. It is, for the most part, a porn movie that should never be called an epic. <br /> <br /> Some movies are really artistic and accentuate people's taste for beauty, <br /> <br /> are movies that are average entertainment; yet they have something to offer, <br /> <br /> some movies show extreme violence; However, they still have a certain morality. <br /> <br /> There are, however, movies that show illness and decadence for themselves and, therefore, harm the minds of people, <br /> <br /> CALIGULA belongs unfortunately to the last group
