First of all, I am a horror fan. But this production of "Tobe Hooper" (go ahead, the man of the original Texas Chainsaw and Poltergeist !!) was below the standards, even for a fan. The acting was not bad at all, some characters were incredible, but the leading women were OK. We have already seen the story a hundred times, without any surprises. Never exciting or intense, and do not rely on special effects other than blood splatter. The scary zombie kids are pale faces with dark eyes and that's it. It could have worked in the early 70s, but not now. Director J.S. Cardone has not managed to keep the suspense, halfway you might fall asleep. My vote is based mainly on the acting of the main actors, but it could easily have been called Children Of The Corn 8: From cornfields to mines ... Enough said ..
