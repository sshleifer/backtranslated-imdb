The recent release of "Mad Dog Morgan" on Troma DVD is disappointing. It seems to be a censored copy intended for television. Some of the most violent scenes have been mounted and parts of the colorful language have been removed. Anyone who has watched the uncut movie will be crazy as hell from this toxic DVD version. "Mad Dog Morgan" deserves to be published on DVD in the original theatrical editing. However, even after its release on DVD, the film remains one of the best representations of bushranger life in Australia in the nineteenth century. After visiting the Old Melbourne Gaol, with the death masks of the condemned exposed, it is "Mad Dog Morgan" that comes to mind.
