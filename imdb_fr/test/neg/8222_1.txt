Wave after wave of nausea without direction - this film wants and promises to be original and weird at first, but it is actually obvious, solipsistic and entangled in a dialogue based on clich√©s that leads to a terrible crecendo and cheese to the end. Throughout the film, we meet supposedly offbeat characters, who are actually very sad and who do not work very well and who fit into the horrible scenario like men in armor, driving jeeps through mansions and pushing preppy existential evidences accompanied by the groans of Coldplay. The film sometimes has fun episodes, often no more fun than a dog playing with his genitals, which happened twice (a hint of deceit, the rudimentary humor of the film in general), but to the end, the film falls into an "infinite abyss". complete detritus and egocentric ramblings of the director that made me want to dig my eyes. Watch this movie at your own risk.
