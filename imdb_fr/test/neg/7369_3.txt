Despite decades of tax incentives, the Canadian film industry is still lagging behind most Central African states and Islamic states (surprisingly, few Canadian films leave their country of origin) , and New France, nicknamed Battle of the Brave. Why. More than any other country, Canadian commercial cinema seems unable to forge its own identity and remains frozen in the pale imitation of the failures of other countries. On paper, this historical drama may seem vaguely promising. There certainly exists in Canada a rich line of untapped materials where French and English fought to buy and sell the colony, but none of that makes the difference here unless you count the strange blink of the eye. characters saying "Wolfe is dead" or "New France is no more" before returning to the TV series. But if it is not a lesson in history, it's not a drama or an epic adventure that the new title promises: there is no battle in the film if you do not count 10 seconds of bombing by half a dozen reenactors and a collapsed hangar. The place of the city that represents everything we see from Quebec City is a fairly bright studio interior, giving many scenes a televised mini-series aspect, just like the reluctance of director Jean Beaudin to offer many long shots, even outside. What you get for your money is a simple but endless harlequin novel about doomed lovers, constantly separated by events beyond their control, where the biggest surprise is that Fabio does not show up in the cast. This is the kind of movie where every time two characters prepare to do the beast for two, the camera goes to a fireplace or waterfall raging. <br /> <br /> An Anglo-Canadian-French co-production that does' So unite the once warring nations that throw a country with a decent tax break in the stew, this box office disaster was clearly destined to be the Titanic of Canada - although someone neglected to tell producers that they wanted to say the film, not the ship - but proves more like a cheap revolution without battle scenes, crowds or the few moments that threaten to work briefly against irresistible obstacles. The Montreal Mirror described it as "so bad that you can not even find the strength to make fun of it." It is rather unfair because, while the film is essentially like a 1980s miniseries, the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny, with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps, despicable husbands declarant see your beautiful lover, honor cuckold! You'll pay for it both! "and our heroine accused of murder and - panting! - witchcraft in a pretty funny trial for being in the demi Moore version of The Scarlet Letter. At the end of the evening, the British governors, pious slaves and cantors sing and you have something that sometimes looks like the kind of movie that Timbo Hines aspired (and still managed to miss a lot) with his legendary inept version of War of the Worlds, albeit without the stupendous technical incompetence. <br /> < br /> The versatility of lead actor David The Hague seems to be limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the film: he starts out looking like Andy Garcia, briefly adopts the Al Pacino Revolution look, flirts with the Shaky Karyo's shaved style before becoming a young Ted Danson as his character gets older.While his opening scene where he reacts to the announcement of his father's death with an expres The film, which seems to be waiting for the director to tell him that he can go home, now promises a feast of bad acting. He is actually giving the impression of mediocre support. actor who had the chance to play a leading role at the last minute, when the first actor finally read the script and got a bond. He is willing and tempted, but the grace and charisma that the room needs are simply not there. The grand dame of Billie Piper, the mistress of No√©mie Godin-Vigneau, does not really light up the screen although it occupies the front of the scene as a peasant who is the prey of the Intendant Le Bigot corrupt and perverse Vincent Perez (this is the name of the character), Sebastien Huberdeau, the drunk lackey with beard, and the saddest of all, the old revolutionary bedridden priest of Gerard Depardieu, wearing a gray-haired manky wig. It's a really pitiful sight to see a once-awesome actor at the bottom of his game as he struggles to pretend, he seems not to lose the will to act, but the will to live with . It was clear that he could not be bothered to stay in dubbing sessions in English (or even some long shots where he was visibly doubling). It's no wonder he talked about retiring at the time of the film's brief release. <br /> <br /> Jason Isaacs, in his default patriotic mode, offers a brief comedic relief that overlooks Quebec's Wolfe, much like an asthmatic Alf Garnett / Archie The bunker was played by Timothy Dalton at speed, while Tim Roth's William Pitt stays on the sidelines with the sometimes amused smile of one who is staying in a rather pleasant hotel with excellent room service and many days off, although like Benjamin Franklin of Colm Meaney, they are 'Re both in the movie for less than three minutes. (Voltaire and Mrs. Pompadour spend their heads a few minutes at a time but do not make any impression, comic or otherwise.) Supporting actresses are generally better: Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais as true and adopted girls of the heroine and Irene Jacob, surprisingly beautiful, in search of the whole world, like the young Fanny Ardant, is refreshing and deserves a lot better.
