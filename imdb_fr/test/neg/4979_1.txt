Only three words are really needed for this exam: Piece of shit. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed watching the cartoon while you were a child, you will find that this movie is a waste of time and money. The best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet stuck to the floor. <br /> <br /> Yes, they use all the names and expressions. The very name of the dog "Shoeshine" (referring to the dog being "Shoeshine Boy" in the cartoon). They name Polly, but she is not Miss Sweet Polly. <br /> <br /> My wife and my son are drugging me to visit me. They should have drugged me to see him. <br /> <br /> The original Underdog was voiced by Wally Cox, the ultimate nerd. This is expressed by someone who has an attitude of "intelligent teenager, who knows more than all adults". <br /> <br /> As an independent film, it is awful. In tribute to Underdog, it's even worse. It's not a tribute. This is not a story of the story. This is not an update of the story. It is simply an attempt to acquire a known title and to create a merchandising. The next time I go to the store, I'm afraid to see Underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothes, etc. McDonalds and Burger King have probably quarreled over the child's rights to meals. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie, however, is the soundtrack. THEY DO THE SONG OF THE SUB-DOG THEME AT RAP (read this with a silent "C" at the beginning)! Well, now that we are going to destroy something, let's go all the way. <br /> <br /> I knew it would probably be serious before I left. My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my local local, where I discovered that they had opened it on the first day and that they had been presented for the first time in their smallest auditorium (and one only four without stadium seats). Even theater people knew it was going to be rubbish! Save money on tickets and invest the best by buying the original series on DVD. It will be more entertaining and will have better production values.
