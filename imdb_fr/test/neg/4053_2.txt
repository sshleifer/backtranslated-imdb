In the only common sense they have ever had, NSW's television and television bureau has refused to fund this film. The producers had a big stink and their production was brought to Victoria. In addition to the lost work for technicians, NSW was fortunate not to have been involved ... <br /> <br /> The film fails at almost all levels. Postmodernism has failed, the casting has failed (what does the character of Rose Byrne refer to?) What is the size of the harness that Hugo Weaving channels? What the devil does the character of Pia Miranda? And the story is a mess of contradictions . In fact, the story unfolds as a trailed prelude rather than a complete plot. <br /> <br /> He might have had a chance if the "pop culture meets depression" style was better thought out and executed. If the cast was stranger, if the style was less serious ... if pretty much everything was different. <br /> <br /> Aside from the usual excellence in costumes, design and cinematography (like most Australian films), the film is just a misunderstanding. <br /> <br /> With an announced budget of more than $ 7 million, "The Tender Hook" is a symptom of the unease in the Australian film industry: bad people and bad projects are funded. Compare this mess with "Noise" (under $ 2 million) or "Cedar Boys" (under $ 1 million) and you get the idea. Difficult and interesting films struggle for funding, and fuzzy and overflowing projects with name distribution earn money. <br /> <br /> The funding organizations that have invested in this project deserve to follow the same path as the character of Hugo Weaving at the end of the film.
