Usually, when a biopic is broadcast on a celebrity, it's at least campy (Cybill Shepherd in the role of Martha Stewart, Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke), it's the most horrible TV movie, good market and BORING never realized. If VH-1 is about to make a TV movie, they have to GOT spend a little more money for them. Flex Alexander - although gifted with Michael's voice - is not a great dancer, does not look like Michael at all and does not even have his manners. VH-1 would have done better to hire an imitator himself. So, when he sees Michael getting surgery on plastic surgery, he will not come out exactly the same way. Why should we be surprised by the shrinkage of Michael's nose when his size is identical to that of the beginning of the film? The woman playing Elizabeth Taylor can not play and does not look like her, and does not even throw me on the woman like Janet Jackson. A horrendous scenario and a serious case of malfeasance should prevent VH-1 from producing more films. Flex Alexander would have done a much better JERMAINE JACKSON than Michael. Suits? Trashy ripoffs. Imaginary country? Assembled images of news docs. Do not bother with this one ... it's not worth it. The only good casting piece - the actor portraying Joseph Jackson and perhaps the actress as Lisa Marie Presley, though she should have been more tomboy than girl.
