Hello, I normally like movies. I'm 19, I've seen a lot and I do not like one or two. This one however, the second finished, I had to pull my sister by the arm and I burst into tears of laughter as soon as I left because it was a film so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Why it was awful: - all the cows had a udder, especially the boring MALE - none of the characters were unique or endearing, except maybe the main Coyote Dag - The idea of ​​keeping cows Watching against coyotes is simply ridiculous - the "funny" moments are repetitive and simply become a sequence to surpass the last - the themes of the collaboration, which should have been present at the end, were nonexistent. People have the impression: well, I'm going to fend for myself and in this case I was lucky that my friends decided to support me without my knowledge - every moment of the lion king (as mentioned here). below) were beyond the cornea, even for a children's movie <br /> <br /> and ... the worst of all ... PARALLEL THE LION THE KING IN ANY WAY UNIQUE Father figure responsible killed by Coyotes (the Coyotes are essentially hyenas, with Dag, the coyote in the lead, the equivalent of Scar) The farm falls into chaos, Odis (the cow, though basically Simba) wants to play, and is shocked that his father is dead, thinks it's his fault (although in this movie it was his fault), confronts the Coyotes and gets an asshole, after which Dag tells him to leave, and about to leave , Odis decides to leave to save some chickens and his friends. (Surprisingly, of course, he leaves without knowing that they will come to help him). <br /> <br /> Other elements borrowed from the Lion King: stars moving in signs, father figures referring to stars / signs in a mystical and amorous way, the obvious roundness of the way the father Ben found Odis and took care of him, and how, in the end, Odis' love gives birth to a similar experience. Birth in the end? GOOD GOD, but damn ... and even music of a similar type, which seems completely stuck in the end because it is completely different from all previous music. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is the first movie I've ever seen where I was really looking for the bad guys - I never understood what others were saying so far. <br /> <br /> LOWER SUMMARY: Do not waste your time going to see that. Convince the children not to see him and see the Lion King again. Either that, or take them to see the Bully Ant, creative and artistic.
