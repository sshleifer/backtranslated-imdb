I just wanted to leave a short comment because I do not listen to it here, but I just saw this movie. The version I just rented was released in 2005 as far as I know and it's actually called "Do not go to the attic" I only realized it was the same movie as Devils Harvest looking for actors who seemed familiar in the movie. Anyway, I'm in Ireland, so maybe it's just been published here and in the UK, but that's what it's called here ....... ... not really as if it were important because I would not recommend this movie. The only words that come to my mind when looking at it are Cheese Cheese Cheese !! My only rating out of ten is purely for the only little nerve thing: o)
