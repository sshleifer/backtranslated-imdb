Antonio Margheriti, director of Cannibal Apocalypse, the cult horror of cheese, directs this giallo to the gothic flavor featuring Jane Birkin, icon of the 70s with teeth apart, and his French lover of the day, Serge Gainsbourg. <br /> <Unfortunately, despite the inclusion of such pleasures as a bisexual French teacher and a terribly unrealistic killer orangutan, Seven dead in the cat's eye end up becoming a terrifying disaster that's hard to do last. <br /> <br /> Pretty schoolgirl Corringa (Birkin) returns to the Scottish estate of her family after many years, only to discover that a maniac kills her parents one by one. Using all the tricks of the "old phantasmagorical house" (hidden doors, dark corridors, scary cemeteries, rooms covered with a candlelit-lit spider web), Margheriti puts together a puzzling narrative that sometimes promises supernatural adventures. but ends in a lame cop. A termination without imagination to the extreme. <br /> <br /> "And where does the cat fit into exactly that?", I hear you ask. A rather chubby moggy attends every murder, which justifies the rather cool title of Margheriti. <br /> <br /> "Gory, fun fun" says the DVD cover; "Heap of boring dung," says I.
