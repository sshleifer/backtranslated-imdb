After which, the vaunted update goes and gets shot through the head. Rather fit, given the deplorable state of this film, a sequel to a film that clearly did not need. <br /> <br /> What really irritates Robocop 2 is that the editors obviously do not understand why the original was so good in the first place. Robocop (7) was a spiritual and vibrant satire of bad action movies. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie. <br /> <br /> Thin dialogue, especially with regard to the tedious end of the shooting, it arouses little interest and has neither the energy nor the spirit of the original. Misleading ads, now a little tasteless ("Warning: continued use may cause skin cancer") no longer appear as an afterthought. And calling a brand new drug "Nuke" is not as subtle or as funny as the original family board game, "Nuke ?? em!" <br /> <br /> Stop-motion animation ?? the weakest element of the original ?? is used more intensively, while this humorous sequel fails to include a sequence of credits, which makes it even more economical and in a hurry. Oh, without humor? You could say. But what about the funny mayor or the way Robo is reprogrammed to bring out platitudes? Yes, these are light relief attempts, just as Robo is tightening himself with a screwdriver ("we are only human") for the line of the film, but none will make you laugh. Like the rest of the film, these are wild and stupid attempts at entertainment. <br /> <br /> The third and final film in the series (titled with fantasy Robocop 3; 5) saw Peter Weller leave, to be replaced by Robert John Burke, who is doing well in an undemanding role. With soft language and violence, it was a clear advocacy for the kids market, a very cluttered Robo action figure. With his overestimated social conscience, Robocop's arm attachments and jetpack found too stupid, the final film was never intended to be a masterpiece. Yet, Fred Dekker's flowing direction and flowing look make viewing pleasantly disposable. <br /> <br /> Robocop is the film itself. Robocop 3 is the sequel that you can watch if there is nothing better. Which leaves the second film hanging in the middle, an unbeatable image. A franchise vehicle that has nothing to say, apart from the pound signs that have rung. Irvin Kershner is not Paul Verhoven, just as comic artist Frank Miller and his partner Walon Green are not the writers that Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner were. A tragic waste of a good concept, even if it is limited. 4/10.
