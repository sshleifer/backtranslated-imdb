Oh my God, I was expecting so much more fun when I downloaded this movie, because 1903 was one of my favorite years for movies, but it was bad! The "plot", although I hesitate to call it that, is about a stupid elephant. He slowly makes his way onto a platform and is electrocuted to death. Lame. Even for a short film, the plot was too thin to hold my attention. Edison is like the worst director of all time. In addition, the elephant has no presence on the screen. And the end? Wow, it was not predictable at all. * sarcasm * <br /> <br /> The quality of the image is horrible too. You can hardly tell what's going on most of the time. The only positive thing about this movie is that, unlike most other scary horror movies, it does not generate eleven sequels. Other than that, it's a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life you will never receive.
