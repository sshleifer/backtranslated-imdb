One of the movies I just did not want to see. I had it in preview, but damn, the acting was very bad! At the end of the movie (I'm always surprised to watch the entire movie ..), I wondered why I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> Here also in the Netherlands, the author of this film (filmed from a book by Giphart) thought it was very bad and was disappointed that his film was released like that . Next time, he would like to play a role in choosing people for casting.
