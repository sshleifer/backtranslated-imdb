Is it just me or are all the "horror" movies just boobs, slapstick and a villain that can not be killed? this film had no interest. no matter what happened on days when a person could escape the killer as at the inn. and at least make the killer a little more realistic. Victor Crowley was the worst killer I have ever seen. he reminded me of a demon apparition between quasimodo and leatherface. it was exaggerated that while victor was lying on the fire, no one thought to finish the job. and the end was the biggest disappointment of all recalling the soprano finale. I had to agree with the guy behind me when he let go ... WHAT THE F ***! if I could give the film a negative score, I would have taken care of it.
