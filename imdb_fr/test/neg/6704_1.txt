I am primarily a homosexual man, even though I do not live in the so-called "community", and it is because of such films that homosexual films are not my favorite genre because 90% of them are shit. Like this one. If I could give a zero, I would do it. (I do not understand all the positive comments, unless they were all formulated by people who made this film). I actually stopped him in the 24th minute when the so-called "Anthony" kissed Adam outside the restaurant for no reason. And how does the son fly to the restaurant if he does not even live in the city? Bank transfer? The acting game was horrible! Sound editing? (Listen to "Anthony" and Adam when they are sitting on the fence having lunch.) Every time the camera switches between the two so-called actors, the sound changes, as if there were no filter on the microphone) Seriously, do not rent, or God forbid, buy this movie.Horrible Horrible Horrible act and just a stupid scenario.
