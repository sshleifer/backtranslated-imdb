Class C actors and scenes with a mediocre transition, complemented by a dreadful acting game, also led me to believe that it would make a good TV outing, such as the FX presentation of a smallpox outbreak. However, at my local blockbuster, about 9 copies are kept on the shelves, none of them were checked when the title was rented (I wonder why.) Anyway, this title was almost ridiculous in the director's "fear factor" was going for. The "number of dead" at the bottom of the screen completely contradicts the plot, for example when the helicopter flew over Angola and the record was fast, from 23 million to 24 people. However, at the end of the film, (possibly several hours or even a day after the arrival of the helicopter), the counter of the number of deaths is reset when the helicopter approached the area. . The movies end up leaving a huge set in the entire plot, and god knows no one is waiting for more. Anyway, do not rent this, I only advise you to watch this if you got the title without any monetary loss, and you're in the mood for a nerdy thriller.
