It looks like one of those Australian films made by "talented" and government-funded students. It is packed with intelligent colors and forms and verbal excursions in Freudian psychology for art students and professors to appreciate, but in general, it is perceived as a stupid derision of the good cinema, the good narration and good taste in general. I guess that's what happens when art students become so lenient. "Pink Flamingoes" is miles away from the same topics. Some 70s porn movies are much more watchable and inspiring. The book of Revelation is not entirely devoid of merit, but as a global experience, it is well below average.
