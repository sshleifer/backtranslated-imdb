This film is horrible. The game is nerdy and laughable. If you know anything about rugby, the game is boring. In fact, every episode of Power Rangers contains more realism than this movie. The "action" consists of a single pass and a shot of the guy who lands on the test line or is tackled without the ball and the thrusts of the one who knows what. It's impossible to say. There is nothing of the excitement, skill and construction of scoring that the real Rugby contains. As far as the haka is concerned, this is a group of detractors who are trying to imitate a tradition they know nothing about, much like the white Rasta character who should have been left out of the movie. The next time a film about rugby is shot, we can only hope that connoisseurs know it.
