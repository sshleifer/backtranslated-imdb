It was only the second version of Charles Dickens' classic story that I had seen and unfortunately it is one of the worst. The film begins with a short action scene where Simon Callow begins Charles Dickens and tells the story of A Christmas Carol. You probably already know, Ebenezer Scrooge is this cranky cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage) who warns him of the visits of the three other ghosts of Christmas Past (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the silent Future / Yet To Come. After all this, he obviously realizes the true magic of Christmas and promises to be more pleasant in the future. The only changes I've noticed in the story are Scrooge having mice as friends (a stupid idea), Scrooge's ex-girlfriend, Belle (Kate Winslet) needing to see him to help him out. Orphanage, the present Christmas Ghost showing the two children, "wanting" and "ignorant", Scrooge is still haunted after being made kind, and he fears he will not be able to keep his promise to stay kind. With Rhys Ifans in the role of Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit, Iain Jones in Scrooge's nephew, Fred, and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig. The animation is not of high quality, the actors wereted their voices for a trash worthless. The only good thing that comes out of this film is the good voice of Kate Winslet, who sings the closing song "What If", as for the rest, it is terribly awful. Very poor!
