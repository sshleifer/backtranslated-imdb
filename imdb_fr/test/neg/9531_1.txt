I am one of those people who respect all filmmakers and realize them. Every film I watch is generally respectful (although I admit that I select carefully) and jealous of what it is. Not anymore. This is really one of the worst scenarios I've seen producing as a movie ... so much that I felt compelled to warn others. The dialogue was really incredible, the protagonist was talking about the last person I would like to know more about. A scene where an old school friend "tells me like that" made me laugh only because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of an already concluded plot. Management is at best simple and the worst filmer. To compare this film to the atmospheric majesty of a film like Five Easy Pieces is a travesty.
