Frankly, I'm surprised to see that this film receives relatively good reviews. I will be quite honest and I will say that the only reason I managed to understand it is because of Ryan Phillippe, and not for reasons particularly related to his abilities as an actor, although I think that in recent years he has proven to be a better actor than his leading roles in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> As for action / suspense movies, this film fails almost all respects. I think the acting is OK, but the scenario is absolutely horrible and makes little sense, a fact that filmmakers are trying to conceal by adding absurd references to Chaos theory, as if that would convince anyone that the movie is actually "smart". '- but again, judging by other critics, some were. Do not be fooled: the script is a boring derivative mess and no other element of the film makes up for it. Wesley Snipes probably never had a less interesting role in a movie and Statham is a completely boring actor. <br /> <br /> This is not recommended.
