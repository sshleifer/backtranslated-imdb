Talk about marketing. The "New Twenty" poster / video cover is showing a half-naked man in a "Wolfe video". For those who know gay-themed movies ?? this diffuses a "must-see". (I loved reading a review (from another site) that he was "cheated" to see a movie "sodomite." Are you serious? The slogan itself is the word "gay." Lord gives you eyes, but you can not see. ??) That being said, despite the number of gay characters, stereotyped, nothing less (see: the lonely gay, the gay victim of AIDS and gay locked up), it is more of a long-term friendship and separating characters. In fact, if there is any, there is more (there is one that Christians can complain about): heterosexual couples having sex outside, breathless !, Marriage. Not to mention the beatings in the back, the excessive consumption of alcohol and drugs. I see it more as a movie made for TV-Logo or Showtime than for a big-screen effort. Of course, I loved the cinematography, some actors could play and I still like to see a big group of friends who behave as if they knew each other for a million years. But we have seen all this before. Nothing really "new" here. Hardly an original idea ?? That's why, for a good part of the movie, our friend has a serious drug problem, but do not worry about it until it's almost too late. It is therefore "Queer as Folk" and "Broken Hearts Club" (USA) respectfully. The film deals with a group of college buddies, now grown up (in size, not minds), who must eventually grow up and each trying his best by failing. Strangely, as in most of these independent films, the most interesting, for me at least, was the heaviest, Ben. He stole every scene, but again, there was not much to take.
