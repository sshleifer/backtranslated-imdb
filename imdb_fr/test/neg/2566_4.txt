I discovered "The Patriot" in a DVD store and thought it might be a real action thriller. No, it's more of a low budget movie with a ridiculous story. It's probably a movie on cable and not a movie. Fortunately, after 90 minutes, the film stops, otherwise the public should have taken an anti-virus against sleep. One thing has come: it is the beautiful country where the film was shot. You can really feel the American air, but that's it. I hope that Steven Seagal will finally succeed in a great success. This is not a must because my wife and I voted on average 4/10.
