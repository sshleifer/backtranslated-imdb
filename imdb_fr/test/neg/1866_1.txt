The only good thing about this movie is that they managed to tie it with the first part! But other than that, it was one of the worst movies of all time! The only time you see the Ghoulies is in a flashback (and the flashback is just clips of the first part)! Do not see! On a one to ten, "Ghoulies 4" gets one!
