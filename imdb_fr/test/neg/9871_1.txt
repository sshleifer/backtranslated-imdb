If this adaptation of the Marvel comic was made or not ?? and sidelined ?? so that its production company can retain the copyright of the characters, it does not change the fact that it is waste. The costumes of Dr. Doom and (especially) Thing are surprisingly good, but everything else suffers from a deficit of money or talent. Director Oley Sassone can not even point a camera at scenes without including howls like a blind woman's point of view, the dialogue is absolutely sinister, the team's costumes do not fit properly and the The effects are appalling: the human torch seems to be fired on the film with felts, while Mr. Fantastic's powers come to life with a curved blue staff with a glove on the end. Joseph Culp compensates for having to wear a mask while wildly waving his arms. Jay Underwood is incredibly boring, the rest of the cast reaches terrible levels and it's hard not to feel sorry for anyone who thought this movie getting a release, it's just as hard to imagine that one of they think it's really good.
