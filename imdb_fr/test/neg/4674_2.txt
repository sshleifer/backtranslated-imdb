I saw this movie last night. <br /> <br /> And I'm worried about becoming one of those left-wing liberals they just make fun of in South Park. Because I found it extremely offensive. Am I ridiculously sensitive? First, there is the old staple, that America is the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Second, and frighteningly, there is the first meteor strike that hits some (unnamed?). why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in "my god, imagine the tragedy that could" happen. "Because, you know, it happened to Asians, it could happen to white Americans, and that would be tragic. <br /> <br /> > Then, later, a bigger meteor hits Paris, our actors on the ground are irritated, because it could mean that our boys have less time than they thought ... Not angry in America No mention that many people are dead. <br /> <br /> Then there is Michael Clarke Duncan, a wonderful, lost actor, never a black man has been so symbolic.In a team of hardcore drillers, his work seems to consist to stand in the back, sometimes saying, "Hey, you da guy." Really, why did he even bring him in? It's not like he was a kid - he made the shuttle bustier for nothing! once, it does not lift a tool, steers a spaceship or even helps repair anything that explodes. <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor lost in a useless role), who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with keys rather than repair them because "that's how 'We make drawings in Russia', it's pretty horrible. <br /> <br /> All cemented of course by the site of blonde, blue-eyed American children are all rejoicing in the cornfields to be saved and all is well. Because all death and destruction of the rest of the world is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> You expect the wrong scenario, the suspicious acting, the implausible plot (fat mature men trained in 12 days to become astronauts "Including the one who seems to be delayed") . But I could not believe the racism and xenophobia involved in the film, and total disregard for the lives of all Americans who did not feed on corn. <br /> <br /> It is a paralyzing accusation against the attitude of a part of the West. Society in the world. <br /> <br /> And it's a shitty movie too.
