Edge of Madness is a story about a nineteenth-century woman who is hand-picked by a dirty Scotsman who can not keep his penis in his pants. It turns out that his younger brother is against rape and kills him, but he keeps saying that it was an accident. This makes his wife crazy, she becomes delirious and she falls because she loves George too much. <br /> <br /> As I said, this kind of thing has already been done. It's simply more "artistic" because it's Canadian and it's an independent, low-budget production with barely known actors (except for a Lassie kid, yes, he's involved). I did not know if it was worth for Oscar, but it sure was boring. And this is based on a 40-page news. Half of this short story is incorporated into this film, and I'm delighted. Otherwise, I would be bored to death. Unfortunately, I had to watch it in my Media Fundamentals class and I had a job to do. Read the news and compare the film with the opinion. BORING. <br /> <br /> You know, it's harder to answer the film's questions when you do not like the movie. Oh, I hope it's the last type of work my class and I get. For what it's worth, Annie Herron was totally hot, she had a nice sweet ass and I liked the naked parts of her in the movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for boring, Oscar bait performance and graphic sexuality ..more nudity.
