For some of us, director Ernst Lubitsch, loved for his underlying daring and ironic comic touches, was rather wet when it came to picking up material. It's not that Lubitsch is overrated - on the contrary, he was probably ahead of his time in terms of visual storytelling - and yet the projects he's focused on (or assigned to) are not everything. indeed the landmarks of comedy. fans like to tag them. With "Heaven Can Wait", an on-screen adaptation of Lazlo Bus-Fekete's "Birthday", Lubitsch is attacked by Don Ameche asleep in the lead - and the combination of an anemic plot, a colorless star, and of a moldy flashback - stymies frame the director. A nasty man at the turn of the century "falls asleep without realizing it" and presents the facts of his life before the entrance to Hell. Ameche ... mean? It was the number one problem. The promising opening sequence (located in the hall of Hades) quickly gives way to a sinister fantasy, and the secondary distribution does not help much. * 1/2 of ****
