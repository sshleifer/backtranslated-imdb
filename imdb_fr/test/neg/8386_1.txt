I watched this movie last night, I was thinking of renting a horror / scary movie of blockbusters and I pulled it out. The opening scenes were so long, the conversations between the characters seemed to lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> The story seemed so poor, she gave him HIV then she met another person but she is killed by the man she infected (I think she does it perhaps for a long time time to different people) Then, when he threw the body, it was precisely the man she was going to meet, he was in the forest and saw him empty the body. Then he chased them (did he ever finish burying the body ??) and they got into a car and he found them one way or another in a different direction from where they came and killed the guy. <br /> <br /> I think that the cut head was the only good thing in the movie because it was quite realistic. and then when the woman ran, she fell in front of him so he could stab her with a shovel !! AND THEN HE FINISHED !! <br /> <br /> What a relief it was the most useless movie I've ever watched ... avoid it, it's so mediocre, I only counted 5 different people, and The scene where he kills her is so unrealistic and they swear in and that's it! Thats it from me ... <br /> <br /> STEER WELL CLEAR !!
