It's a puzzle for me to see how this film has always been distributed. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's horror and there is a lot of nudity, but my god, the value of the production is the lowest I've ever seen, the material used is worse than the standard home hardware, everything is superimposed, giving a whole amateur look, bringing your thinking to the worst home videos of the United States or any other title called show .. <br /> <br /> Please people, is It's too much to ask that you make an effort when you expect to lose 90 minutes of people's lives watching this? You really should have done short projects first because it is obvious that you are a group of amateurs! 1/10
