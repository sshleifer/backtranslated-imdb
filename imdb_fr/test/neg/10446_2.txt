Hey what a good idea to open a movie - show someone's movie at home. Theater schools must be full of idiots! , they are taking acting classes in hopes of becoming the next big adventure in Hollywood, while all you have to do is send a movie to the house in a studio. Hey, I think I'll send the video of my wedding and call it THE GREATEST ROMANCE NEVER SEEN or send a cassette of my honeymoon and call it THE GREATEST SEX ever seen. Oh wait, I'm not married and I've never been on my honeymoon! Do not worry i will send a video of someone else's wedding / honeymoon <br /> <br /> !!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> You think that with an opening like this, SHARK HUNTER could only improve, is not it? As shocking as it may sound, the movie at home is the best-directed, best-written and best-interpreted part of the film. Alas, everything is downhill while the family goes to sea (In fact, a swimming pool covered with fog) yacht on foot where mom and dad are eaten by a CGI fin and where their son Spencer swears to avenge the fin. Today, the French use an underwater research base for oil exploration. The only thing is - And it's so obvious that you can not fail to realize - it's not filmed under water !!! , the director did not even try to use the unconvincing technique of filming the scene through an aquarium. The shark (maybe he's hired by Greenpeace?) Has he blown up the underwater research base and Spencer is now an adult man hired to hunt down the shark that killed his parents and a group of French . What else is going on? No idea because I decided to look something else <br /> <br /> No resentment if none of the actors and the team read it and I hope that Matt Codd will become a big fish in Hollywood. Do you think you know Matt sharks? You have not seen anything yet
