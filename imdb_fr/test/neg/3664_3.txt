I must start by saying that the actresses and the actor did a good job for what they worked with. The problem in Dark Reality is that you have a poor director who has tried so much to be innovative and evocative that he ended up distorting the film. From beginning to end, you may find that the quality of the film reel is low in itself, but the wrong, shimmering light camera only hurts it further by obscuring what is happening. The sound is muffled and often incomprehensible. I'm sure Huston (the director) would argue that it caused panic among the public, but he had more equipment to do it. The fact of having to turn to the camera and light up as it did was a sign of a syndrome above the head. The story is good. A sadistic story of a basic female kidnapper who avoids clich√©s by leaving the girl in a state of despair all the time for a good reason. Billy Bob of Silence of the Lambs treated his victims better than Netwon. The biggest problem in this story is that the dead people constantly harass the main character in his mind and, the second time, they came forward, I moved forward quickly, because it was to try to destroy the only decent part of the story. movie. <br /> <In the end, the way the director put the film together by showing random and fuzzy things and incomprehensible scenes (not because of the horror, because of the light, the angles and the camera) finally destroyed this movie. Huston was obviously trying too hard and looked like a bad film school project. If you want to see a decent story, everything is fine, but be aware that the quality of the movie is enough for most people to disable it.
