This film begins with a man who seems to be a kind of sport driver. He meets a gang that includes an arrogant leader, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never talks and a woman who turns between them three. The group, called Satan's Angels, wants Rod, the pilot, to be their personal pilot. He says no but says yes after the authorities made him a spy to check. They steal a weapons store in a ridiculously absent scene. The scene features the woman entering the store, her long hair in her bun and the large circular glasses. She says she wants protection and wants the trader to load the gun to show her how to do it. She then takes it to the shopkeeper and shoots it. The other three gang members (excluding Rod) go to the store. They remove everything from the walls and then play with them as children receiving their toys on Christmas day. <br /> <br /> This film certainly does not waste precious time on the screen with a plot.
