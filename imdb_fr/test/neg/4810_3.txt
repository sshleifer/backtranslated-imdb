I can not believe I bought this movie! That sucks! ... Where I live Mexican movies Mexican movies are never advertised or even available ... You can not find them in classic rental locations ... so I had to buy it ... J love Mexican movies! They bring me closer to my roots and my people, and they are very different from what you used to live ... but this one was so predictable !!! You can guess what was going to happen ... This is not a horrible movie! It was not worth what I paid! jaja ... but if you have the time and you are really bored, then you should watch it .. but if you like Mexican movies and you like the theater, do not look at it, it will be painful! lol
