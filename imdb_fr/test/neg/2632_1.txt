This film was really bad, I could not even look at the end. Milo's voice was too low and I did not understand what he said and some of Kendra's replies. Plus, where did he get all those wedding dresses? it was very inconvenient. The film failed to explain Milo's drowning and how she ridiculed Dr. Jeter and his practice. Overall, I was disappointed that I could not give this film a score of zero because, classifying it as such, I had the impression of praising it deservedly.
