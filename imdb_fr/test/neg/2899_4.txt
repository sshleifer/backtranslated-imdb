Wow, this movie is bad. Think "Flashdance" with ninjas. The worst is when a sword is supposed to float in the air, but you can see the strings. Or maybe the worst is the gigantic eye patch (which looks like a coaster) that the good ninja wears. In fact, there are so many bad things that I can not decide, which is the worst. I can not believe anyone really put money into making this thing. The only value that redeems is that it is good to laugh.
