The plot has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worth it. Jolie's acting is rather flat and poor, that of Washington is fine, the rest of the actors are cardboard. In a way, almost everything in this film oozes from mediocrity. The plot is lame. The only thing that I liked more or less in this film, it is the rather original methods used by the author to put an end to his victims. The technical details are worse than the most advanced knowledge and gizmos of CSI and halfway through the film, one wonders if the director even cared about the credibility of the details. (Some spoilers here!) I mean, an ECG machine with a pure sinus wave reflecting the heartbeat of a man, a quadriplegic with complete muscle spasms and a working index, of course. A killer eviscerates a man's intestines while keeping him alive to allow rats to feast on him followed by a rat aimed at the guy's FACE! What is this stupidity? Then there are a lot of continuity gaffes, but you can find them elsewhere here on IMDb. Honestly, I found this a little insulting even for my limited intelligence. <br /> <br /> Loss of time. Another 4 out of 10 to prevent my girlfriend from kicking me.
