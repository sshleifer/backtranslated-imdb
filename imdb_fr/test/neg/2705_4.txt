I like Errol Flynn; I like biographies and action movies. That included these three ... but I did not like this movie. It just lasted too long, although the last 20 minutes were excellent, especially for photography with excellent low angle shots. However, it seemed to me that it took six hours to get to that point, and I really can not say why I feel that way. <br /> <br /> The action is interesting, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are doing well. In fact, it was refreshing to see de Havilland actually support Flynn instead of playing his usual antagonist role. However, something is missing in this film. <br /> <br /> The film has been criticized for its historical inaccuracy, but I do not hear the same criticisms as many other films that have done the same. In fact, it's RARE when a movie is historically accurate. For some reason, this revisionist story offended most critics. If the film had made General Custer much worse than he really was, they probably would have liked it. Well, it's a shame. In a twisted way, critics prefer villains to heroes. <br /> <br /> I really wish I could have enjoyed more, but I'm going to experience many other Flynn adventures.
