Bare Wench is another softcore parody of the Blair Witch project (I think there are about two dozen of these things out there). He has 5 very attractive women (which includes Nikki Fritz, Julie Smith and Julie Strain), and a boy whose sole purpose is to provide comic relief. <br /> <br /> All right, so I think "Cool beautiful women who have very softcore lesbian sex very good, about 10 minutes.This should be really good." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the producers ruined everything. There is nothing in this video that can be described as a sex scene. There are some false starts, but the majority of the action consists only of women posing for the camera. I suppose that once the producers had spent their money on the women and spent more money getting them to take off their clothes, they had no money left to get them to do anything. And I suppose they also used the nudity time too early, because towards the end of the video there is a huge amount of useless dialogues that are obviously only used to increase the execution time. "You're a liar, no, you are, you're going to the cave, no, you're going, I think we should go home, well, I'm not doing it!" It continues over and over and over again. <br /> <br /> There are better things than that.
