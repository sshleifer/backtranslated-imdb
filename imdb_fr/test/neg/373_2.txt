I just watched Dog Watch. I thought some parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few improbabilities. The acting was not too bad and the plot is not bad. BUT, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details. <br /> <br /> Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) It has been shown that the bleeding of Charlie Falon's bandage (Sam Elliott) comes from the back of the hand while it is his fingers who were bleeding. <br /> <br /> 2) Does the inspector dispose of the victim of his murder in a very bright area? It seemed very ridiculous to me. <br /> <br /> I'm not particularly difficult about a movie, but, in my humble opinion, it's certainly not recommended by me.
