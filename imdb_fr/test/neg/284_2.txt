SPOILER!! Terrible camera work, horrible writing, non-existent plot and many plot add-ons. Wonderful game! Except Julia Roberts. Who plays badly who pretends to be Julia Roberts, badly. Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this movie. <br /> <br /> During the film, we regularly zoom in on each of the twelve (!) Characters. Twelve is too much, even for a classic like 12 Angry Men. And the problem is that we zoom in fastidiously on the characters, when they are all in the same room and do the same thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, Clooney is eating. Yes, Pitt is eating. Yes, the "Jew" eats. Yes, the geek is eating. Yes, the bodybuilder is eating. Yes, Mr. Sensitive is eating. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes Yes. Yes. Phew! This happens at least three more times in the movie. Yes, they are all sitting in cars, bored. Yes, they are all arrested, frightened. Yes, they are all driven out of prison, depressed. <br /> <br /> But it's only since I came home that I realized how much they had "had" me for this business. This is a heist movie, right? That's what I went to see, right? But when I entered and put my car keys in the coin, it was only then that I realized: NOTHING WAS REALLY STOLEN IN THIS FILM! It is true. It's a hold-up movie, where nothing is stolen. Oh, they try. They will try to steal a boring document or something like that from a guy (whatever), and it turns out he's been stolen. 20 minutes of my life, wasted. Then they try to steal an egg in a museum (YAWN!), They screw it up and get arrested. <br /> <br /> Then, we see how a French guy stole the egg before even, and we get all the joy of "Hinder", except that this time, the person inside the tight catsuit dancing around fake lasers is ... a skinny French guy. Um. <br /> <br /> But it turns out he did not steal the egg either. In fact, our heroes stole the egg, long ago, in another film, which would have been a BIG film to watch, if they had shot it. <br /> <br /> Instead, we see a 30-second clip in black-and-white on how they stole his backpack from a student. You heard me ... the clever breakage, the ultimate robbery - the accumulation of those two and a half hours of utterly boring shit - do they steal a backpack from a student, throwing themselves out of creative way in a fight against baseball teams and distract him, and replace his backpack with an identical backpack? What?? <br /> <br /> Ugh. I tell you, it was so bad, I did not even realize how terrible it was - how stolen I was - until I got home.
