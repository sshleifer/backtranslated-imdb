Eh. This is a popcorn movie, nothing more. I watched this with a group of friends (and although this is NOT the best way to watch a horror movie ...) and most dialogues and actions were laughable. <br /> <br /> That let me aspire to a real movie. :) <br /> <br /> The main problem is the lack of tension in the film. It keeps blinking in the background "explanation" scenes, which dispels any noticeable tension. <br /> <br /> And the character relationship "twists"? Yes, they fear. I will not say what they are, but they add nothing to the film / script. <br /> <br /> (By relationship, I mean the two main characters.) <br /> <br /> Eek. My recommendation is this: watch this film if you can not think of anything better. At best mediocre ... maybe not even.
