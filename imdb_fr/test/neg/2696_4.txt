It's one of those wonderful martial arts movies that start with two hard-core gangs in a park; and when things go wrong and the battle begins, it turns out they all know karate and kung fu! Cynthia Rothrock, still in wood, plays (as usual) a cynical, impassive, good cop, this time in Los Angeles. She and her law enforcement partners are trying to dismantle a network of counterfeits, and when this plot is exhausted, the story gets out of the way and Cynthia becomes the bodyguard of a wealthy tycoon. In the obviously low budget of the film, there is a helicopter action, a speedboat, car chases, a fight where Cynthia beats everyone in a Western country bar, pool scenes with bimbos in thong, and A suprise. good horse hunting. A dozen and a half policemen are shot dead. Many twists occur that make no sense. do not worry about them. (And counterfeiting money is a federal crime, so where the heck is the FBI? I guess they were too busy.) The combat choreography was performed by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent co-starring Richard Taylor, whose Elegant and spiritual presence in front of the camera would have made this movie a better movie. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together and, frankly, she could use it. she seems tired and bored, and does her best to play in GUARDIAN ANGEL when she plays a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter and drunken monologues. The dog almost surpasses it! She also wears some of the most horrible clothes that all major women have ever worn in a film: loose, loose jeans with acid wash areas over each buttock were the most shocking. The other actors are everywhere on the map. You can imagine that many minor characters are expressed in this way: "Hey, me and other guys I know, we're going to be in a movie, you want to be there too, no, man, I'm serious!" Then there are the professionals of slumming: the most fun is Lydie Denier, the superb French model and veteran of "Red Shoe Diaries", "Baywatch", "Melrose Place" and many other variants of the French sexy bomb; Here she plays a psycho killer, as if she were in FUCK ME or an episode "Alias" and not as a direct junk like this. There is also the tall, dark and handsome Daniel McVicar, who is now a regular at "The Bold and the Beautiful," John O'Leary, who has played a decent old man in dozens of movie and sitcom episodes and do it again here, and Aharon Ipale, the famous Arab character actor, is perhaps best known as THE MUMMY's "Pharaoh Seti" and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL must be the most laughable entry on their resume. I gave this film a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters, who are enthusiastic students in martial arts, like to see a woman kick ass and have big action scenes to change. They are still a little too young to worry about the poor quality of the situation. They simply liked to encourage Cynthia to play stick fighting and the pivoting leg. If you like this kind of movie, you could probably enjoy it at this level.
