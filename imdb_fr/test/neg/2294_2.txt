From time to time, I like a good horror movie, so I thought it would be a splash and a gore movie. but it was a boring and boring film, maybe because I saw a cut version, because there were only two things: a small splash, a time when some cut an arm and some shot an arm, but where the only things. Wismaster, for instance, had more senegals than diabolics, his more annoying than diabolical. and some actors where ugly to.o
