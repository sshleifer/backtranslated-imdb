First of all, even IMDb is released with this movie, because the list of actors is VERY "gappy". Even the main characters are absent, like Buddy for example. <br /> <br /> Now, let's go back to the movie. I love watching movies, but this one tortured me all through the 82 or minutes. It was horror. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And the reason it bothers me so much is because I was so excited to see him before. <br /> <br /> The line of the plot itself is good. It could have been a good movie if it had been done correctly and with a neat cast. Golden Brooks was a huge disappointment. I see now that the only role she can play is the sexy, energetic, playful and playful girl she plays in Girlfriends. The melodramatic roles are not at all for her. She basically killed her character, Rachel. <br /> <br /> I love some actors, such as Deborah Cox, Mel Jackson and Darrin Dewitt Henson, but even they could not save this catastrophic movie. Of course, my personal opinion is that I can not stand Hill Harper as a man, and he did not help me appreciate it more here either. <br /> <br /> The voice of Golden Brooks bothered me so much that I had to force myself to finish watching the movie. It looked like she was whispering all over the joint. The director, I'm not even going to lose any space on the board, he's done such a bad job. The editing, photography / focus of the camera and pretty much everything about this movie was SAD. Not to mention the dialogues! Absolutely unreal and many times hilarious (when he was supposed to make you cry and search deep inside of you). <br /> <br /> As I said, it could have been a very good movie, but it was seriously damaged. I would not recommend it to anyone unless they are major in cinematography and want to see an example of "what not to do" for their future work. <br /> <br /> Have a good day, everyone !!!
