I loved Heavenly Creatures and I make a point of catching it at all times. <br /> <br /> Imagine my pleasure when I discovered Love & Suicide when I surfed NetFlix. Echoing Heavenly Creatures, an easy choice, he went to the end of my line. <br /> <br /> I looked at it last, I made myself comfortable and I waited. What I thought was a disgusting sneak preview of a high school student's joking movie project (I laughed once or twice thinking that "it lowered the bar of the video right") turned out to be the movie. Horror game, amateur leadership, weak dialogue. I usually like low budget movies, there is something concrete and concrete because they can not afford the superficial stuff that distracts the attention from "meat" - the acting, the staging , the plot, the story. I would say that it looks like a student who has not studied for an exam and who knows he will fail. He puts his head on the desk and sleeps. <br /> <br /> In the hands of someone else, the plot would have serious potential. <br /> <br /> Do not expect magic or even cult classics like, for example, Divine's Polyester, or Showgirls, at least here you'll learn to expect bad deeds. <br /> <br /> Love & Suicide went from the worst to the worst movie I have ever seen.
