Why does C Thomas Howell make these films? Cruise (formerly Howell's co-star) is making a huge success of WOTW and Howell is following along with this lame effort. <br /> <br /> Where do I start here? Production Values ​​- I will start with the right things. To be honest, the appearance of some scenes from this movie is not so bad. The settings are correct in the spots and the direction not too bad. <br /> <br /> Script - Terrible. A series of clumsy scenes that could have been placed in the order you prefer throughout the film. The number of times the scene went black and resurfaced a second later in the same room was uncountable. A very mediocre scenario (but the WOTW Cruise was too), but a terrible scenario kills him. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - Okay, I do not want to be too harsh here because I imagine the budget. was smaller than the Cruise lunch bill - but in the general context of the film, the effects are poorly made. Some plans are pretty impressive - mainly from far-flung plans to destroy bridges, Washington, steamers. But on the whole, machines and "extraterrestrial" tentacles are formidable. In addition, the quality of the camera is blurred on some shots and cuts entirely on others. <br /> <br /> Acting - I'm a fan of Howell, but as he's reduced to playing these low-budget movies - he succumbed to the "over-acting" bug a long time ago. Watch his performance in The Hitcher and compare it to this film. There is no comparison. He exaggerates his facial expressions, his arms and legs (where did he get this style of running ???) and for one last stroke of fat, look at the scene where he loses the picture of his family. Hysterical. But having said all that, he's still the best actor presented here. Busey is embarrassing to watch and Peter Green (Zed is really dead now baby) mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene. Honestly, I did not understand a single word he had said - I even went so far as to try to activate the subtitles of that scene - but the DVD did not have any subtitles. This seems like a real family maintenance affair as well, since Howell's son, the director's wife and the executive producer are all part of the film. None of them are good. <br /> <br /> Direction - not bad but not good either. <br /> <br /> Score - Dismal. <br /> <br /> Overall, a lame duck will do nothing for Howell in his attempt to come back into the open. He should take a look at Rourke and try to figure out how he managed to get back to list A, but if he continues to do that kind of thing, he will not have a career soon enough. <br /> <br /> 3 / ten.
