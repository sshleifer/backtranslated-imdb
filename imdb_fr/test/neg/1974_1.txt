This comfy middle-class sitcom sparked a lot of hatred among the new generation of talented comedians of the 1980s, such as Ben Elton. Did he deserve such mischief? Well, Terry and June have never been smart, it's never a well-written tale with different threads that cross at the conclusion. It was the show that your mother and father and probably your grandparents watched. They laughed rather than laughed, but they never risked being offended by the show. The fact that he never challenged them does not really matter to being just another Terry and June. <br /> <br /> A few days after Terry Scott's death, an episode was broadcast on terrestrial television, and this was his last outing. There have been few rebroadcasts of the show on a television channel. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the television comedy has progressed since Terry and June. It's hard to find nice words for that - Terry Scott made the most of the weak scripts.
