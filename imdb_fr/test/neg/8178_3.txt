What you need In the run-up to "What you need", every episode since "The Lonely" had been a winner to a certain extent. This episode is the first major failure since "Escape Clause". The Serling script is again based on someone else's material, a Lewis Padgett short story. As for "And when the sky opened", Serling changed the content significantly, removing a scientist and his machine and inserting an elderly peddler. <br /> <br /> "What you need" gives the best results when it is attractive. The opening half, in which the hawker provides bar patrons with the items they will need in the near future, bears a charming charm that may have worn out throughout an entire episode, but works well within the time limit. Unfortunately, the main plot she sets up is full of gaping holes. The minute Steve Cochran's performance as a thug becomes the main focus of the episode. Cochran's piece is a subscribed stereotype and its flat performance highlights this flaw. His exploitation of the old peddler is boring and predictable and the revelation that he will assassinate the old man is totally unconvincing, which gives the scene of slippery shoes a completely false appearance. Ernest Truex is good as a peddler, bringing a magical, mysterious but warm character to the character, but he's not good enough to help the script crumble. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the weak script is also full of inconsistencies. For example, we learn that the hawker's power to provide people with what they need comes from their ability to look to the future. So how exactly does it allow him to produce a pen that will magically select winning horses? It seems like it should be a little outside of his areas of power. Also, for a man who sees the future, the hawker has certainly tried to find the thug who was waiting in his apartment. There are many more holes that can be picked in "What You Need", but it's really not worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see it anyway.
