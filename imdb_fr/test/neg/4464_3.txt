In this desperate and utterly stupid attempt to maintain Hammer Dracula's franchise, even though she has already lost most of her power, our legendary vampire is resurrected in the London swing of 1972. Exactly one hundred years after her destruction by her nemesis Helsing, an occult disciple named Johnny Alucard (get it? Get it?) Gathers his flamboyant friends in an abandoned church, including Van Helsing's granddaughter, Jessica, and practices a satanic ritual that revives Dracula in a cloud of smoke. Dracula's only mission is to wreak havoc on Van Helsing's lineage, and the fragile Jessica is the perfect victim to succeed. It's probably the only movie of the 70's that goes way beyond trying to look like a 70's movie! Considering that Dracula's six previous films were all shot in the Victorian era, director Alan Gibson really wants to emphasize the fact that we are in the twentieth century and so he stuffs his film with unbearable hippie characters, ugly trends in 70s fashion and 70s terrible music. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing seem hopelessly lost in this setting and their performances sadly show it. The opening sequence (a flashback) and the climax of the slaughter are pretty nice, but everything in between is painfully boring and the opposite of the scary. The greatest elements of this film series have always been Dracula's dark castles and exhilarating coaching races and, of course, this episode lacks all of this. Fortunately for fans, Hammer's contemporary studios have released other movies about much better vampires ("The Vampire Lovers", "The Twins of Evil", "The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires"?). Not recommended.
