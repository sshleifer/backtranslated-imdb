After watching the movie, I must say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It takes my worst film out of Komodo, which is not easy. It's not a porn film or a legitimate film and it gives them a bad name. The acting, the work of the camera, the plot, the story and the sound are all awful. My favorite part of the movie is the duck that asks the bartender if he has any grapes. Why was such a joke inserted in the movie? Did the director think? "I need a humorous scene to balance the big acting, so I'm going to use a disgusting ass joke that I read on a Laffy Taffy movie." Another delayed element is when Norman spills the invisibility potion on himself as he tries to prevent it from overturning. Why did they even bother to give the film an NC-17 rating, did they hope to have the widest possible audience? At least, if it were rated X, it would be more sexual and would therefore divert the attention of viewers from the overall poor quality. I pray for someone who worked on this panties wasted a movie to answer.
