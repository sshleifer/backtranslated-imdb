I paid $ 2.00 for that piece of shit, I want to get my money back. it is a horror movie of high quality that is not so groovy <br /> <br /> There are many floors in this movie, including the acting, the lack of real horror, the lack of nudity (which aside from the starting nurse (a porn outfit) and the flash of naked corpse still breathing, there is none. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack may be be the best thing because it has some kind of upbeat guitar riffs / tracks. <br /> <br /> There are your usual characters, the jock, the jocks woman, the nerdy guy (who looks more like a jock) ), the rookie cop / ranger (who has the biggest hole in his teeth, I wanted to slip some dollar coins in. away .. or aim a goal on the field) the mysterious guy and the Pure girl. /> <br /> The makeup was pitiful with side views of the dr chopper showing a clear line of makeup and natural skin tones, the DVD sleeve is clearly photoshop / improved to make the cover more appealing, because Dr. chopper looks like an old "plopper" The scruffy women who hang around Dr chopper are not explained and ook convincing like the rest of this movie. <br /> <br /> The turn of the plot was VERY predictable and the abundance of bad FAKE members was laughable, what do they think about it .... um throw some members around and some fake blood and you have a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Doctor Chopper himself is the most stupid character I've ever seen, though original, I think the creator of this movie was short of ideas and maybe tried to use the rhyme doctor and the helicopter (bike) and I thought "bingo" was a shit movie about it. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse before ..... but it's just bad. everything is bad ... the lack of suspense ... the lack of real horror or development of the character ... the lack of a decent scenario ... the only good thing about this movie was its end. This film is not part of the category "so bad, it's good" for me either.
