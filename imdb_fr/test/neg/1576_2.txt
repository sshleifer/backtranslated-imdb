I saw this movie while surfing on 80s nightly infomercials and sitcoms on TV one night at 2 am. I must say that I did not expect much and that I did not have many. Although Rose McGowan is exciting, her performance and that of the rest of the cast did not deserve the Oscars, to say the least. This film has its ups and downs, and has some nice touches in the end, but in all honesty, it was awful. Not even a typical slasher movie. No gore, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. Just bad actor. I would give it a 3 out of 10.
