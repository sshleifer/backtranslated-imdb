Of all the films I could have chosen, it had to be that. During my last visit to New York, I went to a Times Square store. Among the hundreds of DVDs they received, I chose Joel M. Reeds Bloodsucking Freaks (1976), and this on a double DVD that also included Seeds of Sin (1968). ), do I regret it? Keep reading to find out. The film begins on an island (near the Staten Island home in Milligan), where two lovers walk with a huge paper umbrella. At one point, he offers him the top of a weed as a gift. From nowhere, Colin (Hal Borske) a late hunchback appears and kills them both for no reason. After the opening credits that mix some of the worst headaches I've ever heard about music, at least I'm used to it because it is used consistently throughout the film, we have met three couples. The wives are all sisters, Vicky (Ann Linden) and Ricard (Fib LaBlaque), Veronica (Eileen Hayes) and Bill (Don Williams) plus Elizabeth (Carol Vogel) and Donald (Richard Ramos). They each receive a letter from a lawyer, H. Dobbs (Neil Flanagan), who asks for a meeting so he can read the will of their late father. Dobbs informs them that they must spend three days in the house of their childhood, "Crenshaw House", and fill it with "a sexual harmony and a conjugal love" that he had never known because of the tense relationship between their father and mother. He informs the couple that the will is very irregular but legal. After three days, the inheritance will be settled. Couples are also informed about the servants, Martha (Veronica Radburn), Hattie (Maggie Rodgers) and the late Colin, who greets them by killing and biting pieces of a rabbit in front of them. Later in the night, the remains of the dead rabbit are found in one of the couples' beds with a note saying "Happy the sweet ones, because they will inherit". It begins a series of events that end in horrific murder and reveal dark family secrets. <br /> <br /> Co-written, photographed and directed by the talented Andy Milligan. It's an absolutely horrible film in every possible way. Let's review some of his flaws. The music is awful and inducing headaches. The sound, you hardly hear what the characters say and some scenes do not have sound effect, and at times you can hear Milligan shouting orders to his actors, oh, and there is a constant hissing on the soundtrack. The acting game, probably among the worst I've ever seen. The very special effects, Colin puts the first sequence in value, it's the size of a tennis ball, the part where someone is attached and who has his stomach opened with a saw is really awful, as well as the different hands and legs cut. In photography, Milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene. He regularly cuts the top, bottom or sides of people's heads and faces the screen. There is also at least one scene so badly thought and filmed that a member of the team is seen. The movie is often so dark that you can not see what's going on too. In editing, again among the worst I've ever met, he seems to cut the scenes before the end, cutting the characters in the middle of a sentence. The scenario, if there was one, credited to both Milligan and Hal Sherwood (It took two people to write that !?) is everywhere and is incredibly stupid. There is an incredibly bad sequence in which the killer follows a victim in the basement, the killer walks right behind him, at some point the potential victim turns around. What does the killer do to not be seen? They are hiding behind him, the killers being close enough to give him oral sex, but he does not notice them, just in front of him. You must see this sequence to believe it, I still can not believe what I saw. Weird subplots occur and then disappear completely. Check the scene when Richard has to borrow money from his brother Walter (producer and co-author Hal Sherwood), who turns out to be a homosexual priest who has had an incestuous relationship with his brother. brother before he was married! A strange scene that exists without any reason. Martha, the housekeeper, reacts to the first murder, she is more embarrassed by the fact that her dinner schedule is canceled! Patty and Martha discuss Colin, but if they are fulfilled, Martha responds: "If only I did not beat him so hard," Martha responds sympathetically that "you must Patty, you must!" And do not start saying how ugly the wallpaper is all over the house! The only good thing I can think of is that the costumes seem reasonable, for the period that it is supposed to be installed. I could probably continue all day to say how amateurish it is, but I think you have the idea. One to avoid unless you are a serious masochist! I did not regret having bought it or watched for a second!
