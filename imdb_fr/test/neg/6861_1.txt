Had the misfortune to see this on a bus trip across Africa. It was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Deserves to be the worst No. 1 of all time ;-) No role, no conspiracy, very little talking. Many monkey-like grunts in this desperately improbable movie. An involuntary self-satire - you'll laugh or cry.
