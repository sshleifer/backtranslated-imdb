OK, a film about a film that hits the mark in a video film could be entertaining. Could be, should be, funny, pissed off, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet ... This movie is the negative bizzaro version of that. Hamlin was entertaining as a movie producer "B". Shatner played a crazy but friendly role and had all the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. The value of the production was nil. In fact, you will see the boom disappear in a scene. The sound was awful in some scenes. Hey, I'm a big fan of Shatner and Hamlin now, but their talents are wasted here. At least the story ended with a clich√©.
