Well, I agree with the critics on this one, who all said "leave him alone". Why did they have to do this overhaul of the "Psycho" of 1960, I do not know. I imagine they wanted to reach a new audience and thought that color and modern actors were the solution, since these were the main changes. The dialogue was the same and the story was the same. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I applaud them for not treating it with much blasphemy and nudity and making it a shady movie. Still, if they wanted everything to stay the same, why not worry about Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh and the original cast? Did they honestly think that Vince Vaughn was going to be as good or better than Perkins? Are you kidding? Ann Heche, with her short haircut, will be better than Leigh? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> Yes, the colors were pretty here, but black and white photography helped make the 1960 version so scary at first. It's perfect for the story, not a bunch of greens and roses! Again, I guess filmmakers were betting on an audience that had never seen the original. <br /> <br /> It was just a stupid project that should never have happened.
