The film is visually stunning: from the dusty interior of the church with its lit stove, through the foggy street and dilapidated garage, to the fire that is the highlight of the film. It also has a wonderful sense of time, both in the 1950s (opening of the film) and in the 1960s. All performances are top notch, especially Mathew MacFadyen as a psychotic preacher and Gerard McSorley as father who finds his own intolerance magnificently magnified by his son. What a pity, then, that the story is so ridiculous. For starters, focusing on the relationship between Gabriel (McFadyen) and his family, it does not at all show how he managed to have so much influence on the community. In the church, we see five or six of the main characters in the front and two or three others in the back, but the rest of the congregation could just as well be models: they show no sign of listening , listening or dissent. from him; in cockfighting, no one says yes or no when it disturbs the procedure, but no one applauds or condemns him when Caroline throws him a pint. a situation that results in a stone thrown through the window of the pub is mysteriously solved by the onset of birth pains. Second, Middletown (which is not really a city, but a tiny village) seems to lack some essential services, such as police and firefighters: the murder can only be handled by a family member with a crowbar; the inhabitants watch a hell that threatens to engulf the whole city as if they were in the cinema. Moreover, everyday things like phones and newspapers are remarkably absent, the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or wheat fields, and the most disturbing of all for a "typical" setting from the north of Ireland, there is only one Christian community. Not even a couple of Anglicans to season the mix. Even if you are ready to suspend disbelief, the story itself is well discarded, a pale imitation of A.J. Melodrame Cronin. And the music? Well, it's beautiful for the first two minutes, but when the same four chords are repeated continuously for 90 minutes, it becomes more than a little irritating. My advice: look at this without the sound.
