This DVD misses its appeal as a roller coaster Heineken .... This is a great example of why no one should ever go see a sequel with a director / screenwriter different than the original one. Two hours of this turkey let me beg for 2 reruns of Exorcist. <br /> <br /> NO legitimate laughter. Not a decent fear. The scenario was just a mess and I felt bad for the actors who had to play it (they had to have sick parents at home or habits of Coca Cola or whatever). <br /> <br /> The original was a benchmark of makeup effects. So naturally, the producers of the sequel thought it would be a good idea to remove FX makeup and make CG werewolves instead. These CG werewolves made me laugh a lot louder than any "comedy". It was just a total lack. If you want a night of entertainment, go rent the original again. Or go take a movie class and make your own horror movie. You will do better than these fools.
