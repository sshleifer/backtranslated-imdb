Yes, it's true. If I asked my friends this question, "What is the worst film you've ever seen?" They could answer something like "Armageddon" (can you drill the hole?!?), "Shriek", "Plan nine from Outer Space", "The Medallion", "Scooby Doo" etc. Offended by this thinking that you have seen something that could be in the same human fertilizer department naturally produces this one. If the worst movie you can think of is, let's say it's so bad that it really pisses you off; then you know nothing, my friend. <br /> <br /> Crazy Six ... I remember the day that one of my friends and I went to the local video store to rent a movie. We had both seen most of the movies there, and on the "new movies" shelf, we see him watching us. "Wow, there are good actors here guy, say something about the mafia, let's get him and get out of here." It was without a doubt the worst movie error of my love life. It was also the worst mistake for everyone: movie lover or not. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as much fun as watching a glass of iced water (or iced tea ...) until it reaches room temperature. Watching this movie will make you dream of an eternal dream of death, if death is just a blackout light and nothing, and you realize then that you are just watching your TV monitor. Do not watch. In fact, you pay as much attention as possible. This is not a joke. <br /> <br /> This film is perfection to make a bad movie. This is not the kind of bad movie you can watch, point and laugh, it's the kind of movie so bad that you have no chance of escaping from memory. Unless you may be using electric shock therapy to clean the brain. .... ... (Hey, that might look like what I remember about myself and my boyfriend after watching her ....) <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Albert Pyun. <br /> <br /> -Joergen
