Overflowing through an unbelievable hinterland, this extraordinary adventure enchants with its frankness. Comedy of the confrontational confrontation of cultural assumptions - like Drama from Crisis. Maybe a little too Queenie for some - I would love to watch a movie audience in the outback. Amazingly good
