The worst movie I have ever seen, and I saw a lot. Playing is horrible, the plot is awful, the idea is terrible, and no research has been done, anyway! Ok, I admit, "Air Bud" was a very good movie, but not "Soccer Dog". This "dog" is smaller than my cat! How can he play football? Even for 10-year-olds, it will not be difficult to hit the ball hard enough to stop the stupid dog in two! It's horrible, do not watch this movie.
