For some reason, I did not like her at all and I felt embarrassed at how bad it was since I bought it and watched with my family. We all hated it with passion. It's a pretty cool movie for kids, maybe the year he came out. However, think about it: an old-fashioned children's movie? What's the point? Children generally do not like watching such old movies anyway, and I do not see at all what adults are supposed to get out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some children's movies (like Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz) can be enjoyed even now, but Time Bandits is totally obsolete. For your reference, and I think applicable in this case, I did not like Dr. Strangelove or Spinal Tap at all. So, if you disagree with me about such obsolete movies, you might like Time Bandits. <br /> <br /> There is also a horrible case of overactivity, as I remember the "bad guys". Think of the two stupid "bad pirates" in Pirates of the C movies, except that in Time Bandits, they are not even very entertaining. <br /> <br /> In any case, I warned you, that's all I can do. People who value this film must have loved it for years. If you have not seen it before, then do not worry about watching it now.
