Genre: Cartoon short film without dialogue, African girl and lion. <br /> <br /> Main characters: Inki, the lion and the bird minah. <br /> <br /> What's going on? A lion wants to eat an African girl called Inki. There is also a rather confusing Minah bird. Is it on the side of Inki or the lion ..? <br /> <br /> Message: Uh ?? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I agree with Lee Eisenberg, it's pretty mean to poor Africans !! :-( I like the way in which the main character, Inki (who is an African girl) is a very pretty main character, but they always describe her harshly and make a younger audience do not like her a lot because she HUNT !! GRRR CHARLES M JONES !! I do not like the lion very much and I think the bird minah is perfect (I guess) Personally, I prefer the cartoons Looney Tunes by Charles M. Jones in the future. <br /> <br /> If anyway, I recommend the YouTube website, just type "Inki" on the main page and you're there. <br /> <br /> > I would like Charles M. Jones to be nicer to Inki in this short film. <br /> <br /> Recommended to: People interested in old caricatures and / or others who are having fun on You Tube .
