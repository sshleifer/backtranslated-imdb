I just watched National DVDoon's Christmas DVD 2 on DVD, hoping to see at least something close to the original and fun holiday comedy, "Christmas Vacation". I did not see anything like it. You can tell from the beginning that this movie just would not be up to it. Too bad he has a title that binds him to the original Christmas holidays. It's really a little sad. The film can not defend itself. I think too many people will see this movie because of the strength of the title and it is not close to this level of comedy. Apart from the title, there are very few links between the film and the original "Christmas holidays" and even fewer links with Christmas. The comedy is very simplistic and the plot is poor. Children may find some humor, but most adults will only laugh here and there. This film is a flop. Do not waste your time with that.
