Corny and horrible, I was not surprised that this short show did not survive. I remember very well when Tales From the Crypt tried to reuse those silly episodes as if they were really scary. Coupled with a bad acting and lousy music, I was surprised to find that this shabby showed was never designed. This has never happened again and we can only be grateful for this circumstance.
