Presented by the following: <br /> <br /> 1- Yigal Carmon (Hebrew יגאל כרמון) is the President and Founder of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) <br /> <br /> > Yigal's Career: <br /> <br /> Colonel, Israeli Army Intelligence Services from 1968 to 1988 Acting Chief and Counselor for Arab Affairs, Civil Administration in Judea and Samaria, 1977-1982 <br /> <br /> 2- Raphael Shore is a full-time Israeli-Canadian writer, producer and producer of film by Aish HaTorah. He is the founder of The Clarion Fund, a nonprofit organization that seeks to promote the idea that the United States is threatened by radical Islam. Shore is also a regular critic of media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a cover he says is regularly anti-Israeli. (LMAO) <br /> <br /> 3- Anti-Defamation League (ADL) It's funny how ADL supports this hate propaganda. You can never find out by reading the title of the name "Anti-Defamation". <br /> <br /> Use your mind and see how objective these people are. They have their own agenda! <br /> <br /> I think, so I am.
