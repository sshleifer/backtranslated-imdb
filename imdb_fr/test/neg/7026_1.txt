The version of "Mame" Lucille Ball is in my opinion one of the worst performances ever recorded on film. After seeing Lucy in her various sitcoms more than an astronomical number of times, I can tell you that I really love Lucy, however, this movie is an incredibly bad casting, music and dance fiasco. Robert Preston is the only saving grace with a tiny part to miss if you blink. I do not know what she was thinking about, and I can not imagine how the studio or the director advised her to do it, but I collapsed watching this embarrassing performance. I could be really cruel and suggest looking at it for laughs, but it's too pitiful even to qualify for that. Do not waste your money or time.
