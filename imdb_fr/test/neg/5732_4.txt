Sometimes intentionally camper, sometimes involuntarily silly (as in the opening scene, where a woman is "informed" that she was raped and her family was slaughtered, just for exhibition reasons), this film does not is ultimately neither funny enough nor competent enough (like a simple adventure story) to be really nice. I let you decide what may be the best moment, but the weak point is probably the fight against a metallic dragon idiot. Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for Sonja, with her cool face and firm, slightly muscular body (and I think her dark red hair fits her perfectly), but Schwarzenegger gives one of her colorless performances as a Calidor.
