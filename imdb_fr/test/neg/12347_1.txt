A friend and I went to see this movie. We have opposite opinions on Fujimori, but after watching this film, we agree on the following: the easiest way to have an inaccurate documentary is to do it on a foreign country in which you were not. not present when events happened, no matter the talent or quality. you invest a lot in the film. If you really want to know the story of another country, look at something that was made by natives of this country, otherwise you will not be able to leave your bubble. And those who try to force their views and opinions on something they do not belong to really abuse their power. To make matters worse, the director chose not to talk about the embarrassing involvement of the CIA with the Fujimori regime. She decides not to address the only subject for which her country has a lot to explain to the Peruvians. But this is not surprising, as the director and the CIA violate Peru's sovereignty by trying, of course, to change the democratic process to very different levels. <br /> <br /> If the director was really interested in helping In Peru, she would have financed a native to make the documentary. In any case, there are many documentaries, films and Peruvian books on the subject. These include "Ojos Que No Ven", "Dias de Santiago", "Montesinos-Fujimori: The Carmelites of the Misma Moneda", "Montesinos: Poderoso Caballero", etc. The director of "The Fall of Fujimori" should spend time analyzing the many problems of his country or at least the involvement of his country in the affairs of other nations.
