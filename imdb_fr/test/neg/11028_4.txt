When I bought 4 DVDs for Â£ 5,000 at a local store, he should have been warned enough that this movie did not live up to the usual David Selznick Productions standard. With a cast containing names like James Stewart and Carole Lombard, I was expecting a real treat. As many commentators have said, this is a strange mix of intrigue and scenes that does not really convince. However, I am so happy to have seen this movie because I now have the memorable saying "Never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon." live by. This should sum up everyone's life. Choose these seeds or spit them out or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.
