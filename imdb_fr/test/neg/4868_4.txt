My Take: Routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists. <br /> <br /> A rarely seen political thriller, which caused a very bad box office response, I managed to capture THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY on television just now, while being happy to be able to satisfy my curiosity to see this rare thing. movie, I did not really think this movie was special. Given the box office response, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not as bad as the critics and the audience has reacted to it, but still is not very good at first and everything from scenario to direction is quite predictable. Charlie Sheen plays the presidential aide who finds himself trapped in assassins and goes after (many of them) when he discovers a deadly plot hiding among the White House staff. After the assassination of a teacher, Sheen helps former journalist Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton) discover the traitor and reveal the conspiracy of the title. <br /> <br /> But this script, written by Adi Hasak and Ric Gibbs, is pedestrian, but does not differ much from other thrillers of the White House plot, like ABSOLUTE POWER and MURDER AT 1600. Some considerable talents ( Donald Sutherland, Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang) do their best with a script routine, but rarely avoid the predictability of the script. Not to mention a ridiculous scene featuring a toy helicopter that seems far too stupid and misplaced in this "serious" political thriller. I'm sure THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY has its highlights, some of which are well underestimated (director George Pan Cosmatos recounts some worthy pursuit scenes), but none throws up this routine thriller whose fallout and surprises are thin. <br /> <br /> Note: ** out of 5.
