I guess I can understand why critics ascribe two stars out of five to this film, it's not fantastic, but I think it's worth a look, from director Shawn Levy (Cheaper, Night at the Museum) . Jason Shepherd, age 14 (Frankie Muniz of Malcolm in the Middle) often lies to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he does not do his creative writing, he will fail his whole semester and will have to repeat the note in summer. So he finishes his work, but taking a lift from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who hit him on the way to school, he manages to leave his diary with the story "Big Fat Liar" in the car. He discovers in a trailer that Marty stole his paper and made it a major movie. Her best friend, Kaylee (Amanda Bynes, from She's the Man), has a mission to prove that Jason is telling the truth for once. Of course, Marty is too mean and sufficient to call Jason's father, Harry (Michael Bryan French), and he even burns the Big Fat Liar newspaper. So now, Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as infernal as possible, until he agrees to call Jason's father. They put blue dye in his pool, orange hair dye in his shampoo and far more nasty pranks creating chaos for Marty's career. There is an obvious point when Jason seems to want to give up, but do not worry, all the characters who despise Marty lend a hand in the last operation. When Jason's parents arrive, he will want to prove his veracity and the boy will do it. he delivers, great style. In addition, Amanda Detmer (Monty Kirkham), Lee Majors (Vince), Donald Adeosun Faison (Frank Jackson), Sandra Oh (Ms. Phyllis Caldwell, Russell Hornsby (Marcus Duncan), Christine Tucci (Carol Shepherd) and American Pie (John Cho - Dustin "Dusty" Wong, Muniz is nice, Byrnes is incredibly supportive, and even if he loses some of his time and talent, Giamatti is good at being mean. for kids, so if it sounds corny, corny or predictable, keep that in mind and try to enjoy the performance and the awesome movie.
