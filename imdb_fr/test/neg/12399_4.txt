It's strange what fate does to some people. While shopping in the discount cart at a DVD retailer, I came across a copy of Deadly Instincts. As a collector of all sci-fi, horror and alien monster movies, I decided to buy it (not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars - a bargain, believe me). After viewing it, I came to the opinion that it was nothing special. But after researching the Internet, I discovered that the film was actually called Breeders and was a remake of the horror film Tim Kincaid that threatened video libraries in the mid-1980s. What I've already seen . My appreciation of "Deadly Instincts" has increased as a result of this discovery. <br /> <br /> A meteorite crashes on the lawn next to a private girls' college. The only teacher, Ashley (played by Todd Jensen - that's right, the guy who is turned into a cyborg in the cult movie CYBORG COP four years ago), notices that some students start to disappear, when they meet a black . woman with healed hair and wearing a kinky leather outfit. His investigation reveals that an alien creature clung to the meteorite and came to Earth to breed with local women. Beside a local detective who believes him responsible for the disappearances, Ashley tries to stop the monster. <br /> <br /> The original BREEDERS, directed by Tim Kincaid (who would leave the genre to make gay porn), was a sci-fi / horror movie that was actually a slightly veiled soft-core porn movie, designed to bring skin movies to genre fans. This is, in my opinion, one of the worst films made in the 1980s. Why anyone would like to redo it is a mystery. <br /> <br /> This remake is actually a better effort than its low-budget source. The film, which takes up the basic concept of an alien monster trying to mix with women, eliminates any pornographic element. In fact, the film is very tame. There are no sex scenes, no nudity (even during the shower), swearing and violence are kept to a minimum and there is no gore (which can deceive the gorehounds). This makes the remake a safe movie for the whole family, that is if the kids are not scared by alien monsters (which brings me to the M 15+ rating of the movie, which seems like a little loud). <br /> <br /> Tameness of the material aside, the film has some flaws. The script, although having good characterizations, has a number of holes so big that you can plant a meteor. <br /> <br /> What? Are you mad at me for that? Come on, this review needed a bad word game, so it will remain interesting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the frame of the movie is a problem that the script has not solved ?? the movie is in Boston but the buildings do not look like those in Boston. Something about architecture is not right. Another thing is the college itself, with a fairly large building housing about twenty students (all of course female) and having only one class ?? art. The only teacher there has a relationship with a student (and the janitor too!), Which escapes the director's attention anyway. Not to mention the cops, who are so one-dimensional (and stupid) that the real Boston DP would have a good chance if he decided to sue. Oh, and the meteor ?? Well, the probability that a meteor sent from Saturn (check the opening credits) reaches the Earth without onboard propulsion is astronomical. This does not include the chances that the meteor's passengers will survive the landing. <br /> <br /> As for acting, Todd Jensen gives a reliable performance as a heroic instructor, while the late Kadamba Simmons murdered by his boyfriend shortly before the release of the film) makes a remarkable entry into this leather garment and proves that she knows how to play. The visual effects are mundane, and the filmmakers thank us for bringing us a cool monster.
