I just watched this "movie" and it really made me want to write my first comment on IMDb.com, even if I have been a user for more than 9 years. The reason I watched this was because I like splashed movies and sometimes I like to test my limits and see what still shocks me. First of all, the gore in this movie did not shock me, not even the idea that someone invented that and made a movie of it - which really shocked me. seems to be a market for this kind of shit. . Do not get me wrong, I'm totally against censorship, but this film seems to me to have been made for some kind of fetishist crowd that seems to be attacking this type of sh * t. It did not give you the same type. of disgust and guilt that one has felt after watching movies like "August Underground". this movie is terrible to watch, but at least you feel like the filmmakers want to show you how disgusting the violence is. in the case of "niku daruma", it seems that this was done strictly to awaken people. I prefer shocking movies because they are well made and thought out, like those of Gaspar Noe, Takashi Miike, Funny Games or Man Bites Dog. These movies will stay for a while. this film that I will have forgotten by tomorrow, and the only thing that keeps me in mind is that somewhere, there are people who are excited watching this movie. If you are reading this, please go to the next hospital or shoot yourself. This obviously does not apply to gore hounds, who love splashing. You are cool! peace
