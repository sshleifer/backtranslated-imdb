Oh, Mr. Carell! How far you have fallen! After a brilliant moment in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Steve Carell's film selection begins to contrast with what has happened since. Although THE 40 YEARS VIRGIN was entertaining, her character "Sunshine" prevailed. Hoping to find something that would make me spit popcorn from my nose, I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and see what gaffaws could be waiting for me here. Not much ... <br /> <br /> Given the banal scenario and cliché, the entire film felt forced and without emotion. Playing a little fun while highlighting family values ​​and the current US administration's position on the environment, Evan Almighty also tries to put a deep biblical moment in humorous terms, but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone on Earth knows the story of Noah and the Ark. God's wrath was sent with 30 days and nights of rain flooding the entire planet while Noah, his family and two of each of his creatures on Earth hunted moisture in relative comfort via the gopher. arch of wood. It was a great moment in the history of man (if you believe the Bible text). <br /> <br /> Then why would God come to one man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry a few animals of the world's animals? minutes after a break? The simple answer is that he would never do it. Too much emphasis has been placed on US government policy and not enough on world events, which has made Evan Almighty a terribly short-sighted, American film. Although conceived as a comedy, he never reaches the belly laughs. Maybe some grunts and a smile, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> John Goodman (CARS) records a new forced performance as the despicable congressman Chuck Long, whose sole purpose is to create development opportunities on protected lands. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 ITEMS OF LESS) as God can not help but mop this wet disaster of the film. <br /> <br /> The only fun moments are between Carell and the animals, especially when Evan discovers what animal magnetism really looks like. The birds literally flock to him. Flock of sheep around him. Lions are proud to be near him (please forgive the puns). <br /> <br /> The special effects were nice to watch, but brief (for no reason). The "flood" was interesting in that the Ark was visibly guided by his hand and pushed in the right direction. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, you are no more than an insult to good sense and intellect.
