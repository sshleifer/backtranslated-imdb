The reports on the brilliance of this film seem to have been greatly exaggerated and, unless the other critics watch a different film, I do not see how anyone can find in this film anything other than dull, indifferent, unpretentious, too long and sometimes extremely irritating. I am not a fanatic of horrors. I love American and European horrors every day, but I feel the need to warn all potential viewers of this film before they invest two hours of their lives. <br /> <br /> That could have been the case. been so awesome. A journalist investigates a series of dead and strange events, which seem seemingly unrelated, but a series of annoying tropes seem to connect them - dead pigeons, deaf sounds, presence of knots strangely tied ... Our journalist goes from a nobody to another. by interviewing them, filming them and then transmitting them. Three important characters are part of this entanglement of people: a shy psychic girl, a psychic man extremely irritating and crazy, and a crazy old woman and her boy whose importance is revealed only later. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the film is not even interesting, which makes its two hours of reading unforgivable. It's not even scary or scary at a distance. Supposely scary scenes, like gruesome face shots, are incredibly badly filmed, shown twice, or worse, we are told when they are about to happen. Other techniques, like telling us that a family we just interviewed "died five days later" just do not pay attention to me, let alone slightly frightened. <br /> <br /> The film takes a little bit towards the end, while our journalist, cameraman, psychic woman and cursed goes to a village to "suppress" the spell that binds all these dead. However, at that time, I was in a state of catatonic boredom and I did not care at all, so all the camera work was pretty scary and the shocks were lost to me. The "last cassette" is pretty good, but again, I stopped getting interested and I just wanted this movie to end. <br /> <br /> boring and dull, not scary and not scary, I would advise you to keep away from Noroi. There are promising moments, but it's a film that has been badly done and is not worth your time.
