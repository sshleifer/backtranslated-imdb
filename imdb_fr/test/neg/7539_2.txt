Unlike most of the comments in this section, I must say that this movie barely escapes the definition of "garbage!". The only readers who seem to be aware of what a clich√© catalog is are those who, like me, live in the north-east and know what the area looks like. I'm fed up with movies that are supposed to be "realistic," but describing the working class (from anywhere) as stupid criminal fools, but then excusing them because of their social background. And funny? I smiled briefly twice and I laughed once, but it was because of the incongruity of two Sunderland-themed boy actors who claimed to be trying to hide their Newcastle accents from Sunderland football fans! There was only one sympathetic character in the whole film, it was the senile grandfather, played discreetly but with great skill by Roy Hudd - the only non-Geordie of the cast. <br /> <br /> As for the writing - Well, I'm just wondering what department of academic sociology the author has studied. He certainly had no ear for the local accent. And I, too, have never heard the phrase "Purely Belter" - and not only am I an aboriginal, I am a linguist who has written articles on the local dialect. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and the sight on this trash. It's not funny, it's not realistic, it's not entertaining and it's basically dishonest.
