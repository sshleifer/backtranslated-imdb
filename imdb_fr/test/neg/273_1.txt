I saw "professional" critics claiming that Julia Roberts playing herself was "smart and very fun". I do not think so. An actress plays herself? And do it with the same usual vertigo whenever she tries comedy? Talk about hollyweird narcissism to its fullest. Why does not she stay there and go, "Me, me, me, look at me!" The director and the writer should be shot for not having thought of anything better than this one in what could have been a charming sequel. And by the way, Steven, when the audience starts paying more attention to strange camera angles than to the story you have a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, all used creative cameras, but they were talented enough not to lose the audience in them or simply show up with the camera. You seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule of making a film in the name of "style". The chemistry of Pitt and Zeta Jones, however, is pretty good. Maybe if the film had been better focused on them and dispensed with narcissism, it might have worked. Once again, Zeta Jones shows how she has more talent and beauty than Roberts could dream of. Unfortunately, this film wastes talent and fails in many ways. I want my money back.
