I have no idea who these other people are, but this movie is downright awful. They must support Joe Pesci when he is a minor character. Bait and change movies as the studios did with Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey, etc. The DVD I watched says "this mysterious jewel is about the character of JOE Pesci's MOB who is a burnt-out who starts a war" and so on. etc. Joe plays Joe, he does not even carry a gun, plays a delusional character and gets SPOILER - (slain). So much for the film around Pesci. The only memorable mid-point scene was a bad comedy attempt when they were passing gasoline waiting for a score. If you watch this movie after reading this, I warned you. Stop and do not lose 87 minutes of your life.
