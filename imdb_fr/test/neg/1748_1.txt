I was so annoyed by this film that I had to write something about it. So, have fun please. <br /> <br /> His only virtue that redeems, apart from a good acting, c minutes. Even this duration is too long of about 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Comparisons have been made here with the very dark "The Grifters", but I do not see it. These are two different movies. The film "The Swingled" closest to an existing film is "The Sting", made in 1973. It borrows (sorry, STEALS) to this wonderful "entertainment" George Roy Hill, which is exactly what it was . I enjoyed it, because it does not pretend to be anything else. <br /> <br /> There are so many red herrings in 'Scammed' that I thought I was in an aquarium. It's very confusing, but it's just one of his many problems. The main thing is this: if you make a movie where everyone is lying to everyone, where everyone knows, we do not have anchors to anchor us. The inevitable result is a mishmash of seconds very neglected compared to other caper movies. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this movie is complicit and shocking. A basic course on Film 101 would surely tell us that the public must care about someone. We can not care about anyone here: they are ALL pigs. It may have worked like a crazy comedy, but it's all right from start to finish. <br /> <br /> IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS FILM, DO NOT READ MORE. GREAT 'SPOILER' TO COME. SORRY, BUT I MUST DO IT. <br /> <br /> There is so much fake blood and so many false murders that it does not put the credulity to the test - it destroys it. The end is absolutely ridiculous - a "murder" in a crowded airport that is not really a "murder"? And the "murdered" type, soaked in blood, simply stands up, disengages himself, and goes away, the fake blood dripping with booty? While the police and hordes of people are watching and no one interferes? The director must have a lot of cojones if he thinks we are supposed to accept him. The Noirish B films of the 1940s had better results. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of European films, but that confirms that schlock does not always come from Hollywood. Regarding "Swindled", my judgment is based on a famous phrase of the producer often poorly expressed, Samuel Goldwyn, who knew Schlock perfectly: "Include me out".
