It hardly compares to the spatial adventures of his time. Those who are Star Wars and Star Trek. And although I'm not a fan of Star Trek, I recognize that this film is derisory compared to the Trekkies series. In fact, I would put Back to the future in a better light in terms of space and movement. <br /> <br /> The story is that of a boy captured by pirates. In a obviously false and uninviting battle, the captured boy befriends and even helps the pirates. And slowly, one by one, these looters die. In the end, the boy returns home and the last pirates who escape escape seriously injured. <br /> <br /> The staging was not great. But what is really obvious is the total lack of dialogue, effects and interesting scenarios. It happens to me even beyond 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want to try it because it involves space, go for it. But be warned. "RE"
