Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella: it's a cast of stars, but "The Box" proves once again that this is not a guarantee for a solid film. The premise seems promising: a couple is visited by a mysterious person who offers them a million dollars. The disadvantage is that someone will die, a person she probably will not know. So what are you doing? This gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes. After that, the story completely derails. Wave an uninspired plot about an extraterrestrial conspiracy involving NASA, nothing is really explained here. <br /> <br /> "The Box" is a disappointment, it could have been so much better. But since it is based on a very short story, it explains the errors of continuity.
