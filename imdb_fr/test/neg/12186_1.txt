I watched this movie last night, I'm a big fan of the book and I was pretty happy with the version in which Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon played. But this one is just awful. Oh my God, I do not understand how they dared to tear up this classic story and make the characters totally different, starting with Beth being the younger sister and Amy the third. And Jo's interpretation, terrible, Jo was a smart young woman, a little angry and the actress who portrays Jo in this film behaves like a stupid little girl and very annoying. And what makes Laurie go to war? I agree with the fact that when a book is turned into a film, changes must be made, but without rewriting the whole story. very badly done.
