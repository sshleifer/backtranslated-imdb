I really enjoyed "Candid camera" with Dom DeLuise and was surprised to see that after years, Suzanne Somers became the co-star of the show. But it was the only positive side of the show - the whole studio, the intro, the animators - all that gives a new meaning to the word "pompous". <br /> <br /> Well, it would be OK if the materials were not so cruel - I mean, come on, the best you can do is show some men who have trouble getting them out the ketchup of the bottle, Suzanne Somers walking with a basket for Halloween in July, a place where ice cream only sells vanilla ...? I saw few episodes and each time it was horrible. They posed as if it was the most beautiful series of all time and then filled the time with scenes so boring that I felt really embarrassed to watch. Even the people in them looked bored and that can not be good.
