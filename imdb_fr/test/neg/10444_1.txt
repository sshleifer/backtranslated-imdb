It's one of the worst movies of all time. There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and literally walk on dry land and they have added bubbles! The shark is boring and is just that big computer-generated slow stupidity. Antonio Sabato is horrible, I mean even worse than normal. How does this guy work? The staging is the worst and nothing is refundable in all the films. I love shark movies and this one disappoints. I've seen movies like that in studios and all they do is stars doing bad work. I would rather see an unknown actor who cares to make a good story.
