As for the Asian horror, I saw my share of disappointments with some of the scariest sh * t imaginable ... "Acacia" does not really qualify for any of these categories. There were a few moments of tension and it was interesting to watch, but I could not help thinking that there should have been a little more in this story. The film is about a childless couple who decides to adopt a child who seems fascinated by trees. He develops a link with the acacias in their yard and seems to communicate with him. Then, during a fight with his mother involving their new child, he rises after threatening to find his dead mother who is now a tree. When he does not return, the parents send a report and wait, while the girl from the neighborhood believes that he lives in one way or another in the acacia. The pace is rather slow and the end becomes a little weird, but I have to recommend it as a nice effort, although the story seems a little flat. Damn, I can not really decide ...
