Despite all its many shortcomings, I am inclined to be charitable towards "Thing". Here lies the nugget of an interesting, scary and claustrophobic Hitchcock-style story. Put this in the hands of a writer like Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer from the British point of view) Robert Bloch, or the guy who wrote "Day Of The Triffids", and you may have had a story of small unpleasant spooky that was the best thing in an anthology of horror and suspense books. <br /> <br /> However, someone chose to tell this story as a feature film. . A story like this really needs a voice like Sturgeon's to bring out the interesting quirks of character. His classic story "The -widget-, the -wadget-, and Boff" is an example of how he can bring together an isolated group of "ordinary" characters and, in 40 pages, can make it the most fun, the most most friendly of the most friendly. and fascinating people you have already met. A good writer can, with a few chosen words, make sure that the reader "sees" some of the most memorable and memorable events that have ever frightened his emotions. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a movie where the never-created irritating and unparalleled characters are grouped and unconvincingly intertwined. "Where did it come from?" moments that are right there. (That is, the blonde psychic girl declaiming, "You are all perverse and I hope you are destroyed!"). We have lead rhythms, slowdowns, matt decors and stiff actors. I blame the director for the "steep and shallow" part. They are all 3rd level actors who have never done the main work, but they are also "real" actors, and a good director could have obtained better performances. We do not receive lesbian appearances that make the viewer feel uncomfortable and exploited without making a profit. (If I have to exploit my lower instincts and feel guilty, I want to do it with things better staged than that). And we get over an hour of frightening buildup broadcast in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climax I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Good things about "Thing"? Uh, well ... some of the close-ups of the warlock's head silently voicing his instructions were quite effective. The miserly and cranky widow sounded faithful (though I wanted to put a sock in her mouth). The first scene where the big, "simple" ranch hand turns silently on the fat cowboy and kills it has a bit of shocking value, because the plot had bothered to establish the big guy as a character rather friendly. And, as I said earlier, the idea of ​​a past insidious force between members of an isolated community is a good idea and can maintain a much greater interest than the actual merit of 'poor performance. <br /> <br /> That's right. <br /> <br /> But, as I said, I tend to be charitable, because the director was probably working with minimal budget, time-consuming constraints and the best actors he could have found for money. God knows how future generations will judge easy shits like "The Cave", "Wrong Turn" or the remake of "House of Wax" in 40 years. I hope they are charitable towards our own tastes by supporting the waste of film stock of our generations.
