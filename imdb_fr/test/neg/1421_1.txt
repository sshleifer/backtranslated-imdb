It's one of the most pathetic, predictable and misunderstood films I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood has never been so bad, I have never seen anyone less convincing on the screen. I made fun of him all the way. Then there is this love story between him and the superb Rene Russo, who was even more pathetic than that between Mr.Connery and Ms.Zeta-Jones in Trapement. <br /> <br /> An IMDb user asked the question: What does not like this movie? I ask: what to love? And the answer is: John Malkovich. He's an absolute genius and probably the best villain of all time (he even saved Con Air, you know). But that's all. <br /> <br /> This film is called In the line of fire, but "Bodyguard 2: the scam" seems to be a more appropriate title. Only watch if you are an unconditional fan of John Malkovich. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. * 1/2 (out of five)
