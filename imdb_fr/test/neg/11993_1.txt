I had been "chosen" to see this film in preview. <br /> <br /> First, know that this movie is based on the video game "Far Cry", a very good game (2004)). Second, you should know that the director of this movie is the awesome Uwe Boll. it is a man who takes video games (headquarters, dungeon, bloodrayne, postal, etc.) and makes movies (very horrible ...). <br /> <br /> I still remember what I saw. boll's "swords of the king: a siege tail in a dungeon". there were so horrible mistakes in this film (like 3 scenes playing at the same time, 2 during the day and somehow at night .....) <br /> <br /> ". expect a cool action, forget about it .. really cheap stuff and a plastic helicopter are far from the real action.If you expect a cool story, forget it .. steered by history not too bad of the game, what Movie is a laugh The acting game makes the movie funny in many moments, but in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see this movie for free so do not do it mistake and pay for this trash.it is one of my favorite movies for the last 100. !!!!
