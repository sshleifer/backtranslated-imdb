I love basketball and it seemed like an intriguing movie. However, in the first ten minutes of the movie, I knew it was going to be ugly. It was badly played and much too slow. On top of that, he was very, very racist, sexist, anti-Semitic and homophobic. Sometimes racial, ethnic and other insults make sense, illustrating the sectarianism that exists. In this film, the horrible fanaticism made no sense and no one learned from what was being said. Part of the problem is that it was an adaptation of a play and a remake of a 1982 film that dealt with a 1950s basketball team. early would have made a little more sense. It did not translate well in modern times and the writing was horrible. I do not know how the play was originally written, but I can not believe that a movie as bad and as obnoxious as this one was shown on TV and in the 1999 video. disgusting. Do not waste your precious time on this one.
