At best, I found super-soldiers rather amusing (it seemed like a glorious scam for the Police Academy), and I rented this movie in the hope that it would be better. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely horrible and the rhythm of this film is even worse. There does not seem to be much going on in this film, nor does it really give us a reason to make fun of any character. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Felix is ​​totally devoid of inspiration, although perhaps partly because of the dialogue with which he had to work. In short, this film has gone bad in many places. <br /> <br /> I have the impression that since films like Clerks, independent filmmakers seem to think that they can make such films with long disjointed dialogue scenes. where the characters are trying to be funny. But, where the dialogue in Clerks advances the story, in this film, it adds to hope. Films are supposed to have a good balance between action and dialogue, and as tempting as it is for filmmakers to try to have tons of quick and fun dialogues, it simply does not work. Especially if they are not very good at writing a dialogue. I hate to say it, but even "Extreme Heist" was more interesting than this movie - and this movie was so small that it was shot in video.
