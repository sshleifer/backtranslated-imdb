I could fuck a better movie. It is a waste of time and money. it makes me sick that films like these are really made and that those who make them really think they are good. I like comedies for teenagers, when they are well done. This movie, however, takes this genre to a new low. With movies like this, people think it's okay to create this mess and ask unsuspecting people to pay money to get through it. It's sadism.
