This movie probably seemed like a great idea in pre-production. "Let's make a film about one of the greatest and most controversial sports coaches of the modern era, and let's put Brian Dennehey in the role of coach Bobby Knight!" This is where the film went terribly wrong. Why choose an actor who does not look like the man he represents? And then, why let this actor turn his character into a Coach Knight, but rather Brian Dennehey in a red sweater? As I watched this movie on ESPN, I did not realize that this man was actually Coach Knight. He did not look like him, did not speak like him, did not do the same, or did not walk like him. I could not go beyond that, so I could not enjoy the movie. When Paul Newman and Robert Redford were selected as outlaws Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, we did not care whether they were accurate historical models of their real characters, because most of them we had never even heard of these men before seeing the movie. But with someone as visible in today's media as Coach Knight, you have to do better. When Anthony Hopkins was chosen for Nixon, it was the same situation. But Anthony Hopkins made us believe it was Nixon. Dennehey did not even try. What could have been a good movie was upset by this. In addition to the fact that this film tried to do for the four-letter word what "Save Private Ryan" did for dismemberment, he was able to stink. Too little real Coach Knight and too much blasphemy to make the shock fun have made this film a "season to be cut halfway to broadcast". The only good thing about it is that it was a TV movie. I did not have to waste my hard-earned money on this trash.
