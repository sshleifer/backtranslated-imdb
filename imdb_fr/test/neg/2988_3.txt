Silly and violent thriller that is a scam of 'Deliverance' but without charm or intelligence. The plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and anxious to be free of this odious entrance. This film is a good example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea. It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James making their living in such a mess.
