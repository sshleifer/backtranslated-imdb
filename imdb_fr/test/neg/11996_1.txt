When a group of idiotic children (including an inappreciable racist bitch) stays in an old house, it wakes up four murderous Toltec spirits. Can Lash Street save the day? Will you be able to watch until the end because of the awful comedy on display. <br /> <br /> "The Dark Power" is the kind of very bad comedy horror / comedy hybrid that Troma broadcast regularly. The thing is, they do not have. free this. That does not excuse the whole thing, because it has a terrible synthesizer score (including bad attempts at Native American music and even worse "comedy"), bad make-up (mostly Halloween masks) and an atrocious game ( Ok, the big guy was fine, even though everyone is terrible, and The Street, a veteran of Western cinema, seems embarrassed to be there, not that I really blame him.) <br /> <br /> The worst thing is comedy aspects. Of course, stupid teenagers are one thing, but when the film talks about Toltec spirits as if they were the ultimate evil, only to turn out to be horribly annoying fools, all hope is wiped out. Combining horror and comedy requires at least some skills. There is no skill to display here because it's just stupid, and it's not "so stupid that it's fun". I mean "smoking pot and listening to bad Punk Rock are not idiots" idiots. <br /> <br /> Even a decent face torn off and a girlfriend in little clothes can not save this disaster. Terrible movie, and not worth a rental.
