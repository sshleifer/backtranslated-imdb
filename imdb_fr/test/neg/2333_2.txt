ok we have a movie that some describe as one of the best movies of all time..but i'm sitting here thinking about hell f!, stories sux {which there is no history], the diolouge is quite simple, artistically, nothing extraordinary! , and the acting game is not very real, so if you want to pretend to be arty, do you say that you like it, but if you have a real view, say you do not like it or if you explained why!
