This film was awful, clear and simple. It will probably be revered by those who see only "movies" and not "movies" and will regret not having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but I'm pretty sure of my intellect for to say that this boring, self-growing and painfully stretched film was a waste of two hours and nine dollars. <br /> <br /> I let myself be carried away by the good inexplicable criticisms that he had received and that came out of the theater thought that these criticisms had to have been written by excited students of cinema and by the aforementioned group people who were fleeing normal movies, perhaps for fear of enjoying it one day. <br /> <br /> a promising man: a man is imprisoned for 15 years without ever knowing his kidnapper or his crime. He is then released suddenly and has only five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. However, the big concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke as Oah Dae-Su beats people to try to make love to a girl who tries to use the toilet and eats a squid that is alive (without doubt for a dramatic effect, as there is absolutely no other reason for this). While he was trying to understand this horrible thing he had done to earn fifteen years in prison, he discovered that it was both ridiculous and disappointing. His sworn enemy, a man who would have been at school with him when he was young, looks like a model of Banana Republic, twenty years younger than him. Hey, I know that the prison was tough for Oh Dae-Su, but is it too much to ask to find an actor who looks a little more like his age? Of all that is wrong in this film, this one seems to be the easiest to repair. <br /> <br /> And the big secret - the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes while I could have done it. something productive - is a joke of a plot involving incest and a rumor started in high school. Come on! Throw a bone here - was it really the best they could do? I sat in a stupid dialogue, over-acting scenes, dark scenery and gratuitous violence for that? (By the way - I'm not at all against the violence in a movie if it seems like the story, but in this case, it seems like I had to watch our hero smash a person's face and cut his tongue with a pair of scissors to distract me from understanding that I lost my afternoon watching a pretentious waste). <br /> <br /> Take my advice - do something else with your time and money. Or take your nine dollars and go see a humble "film" - a movie you might like.
