I think I'd rather have my batteries cut with a pair of rusty clippers instead of supporting another 5 minutes of this movie. In fact, I can not even be bothered to go into details! I do not know how they managed to introduce the needles into wooden actors to heal! It would be better for everyone to hit the island after learning about the virus because it would have lasted as long as the commercial break and we could have continued our life. Moreover, were these garbage ordered by the chain of the gods? All they seemed to do was congratulate the bleeding lord most of the time. Avoid like the plague! In fact, I would prefer that!
