For years, I hesitated to watch this movie. Now, I know why. Not only is it a comedy that does not even succeed in being funny, but there is also nothing to laugh about the movie. It was even worse than I expected. I rented this miller and I felt more deceived than money. I have never seen a film that bored me so much. It's a movie about stupid people doing stupid and terrible things. I do not know how a man of common sense could play in this kind of film. I used IMDb for a while, but I felt compelled to sign up just to help prevent the unsuspecting poor people from renting or, worse, buying that stinky !! Really a waste of time and money. I must say that the plot is terrible.
