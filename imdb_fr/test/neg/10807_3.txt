Now I watched this movie when it was released for the first time on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a great movie, but again we were teenagers. But honestly, it's not good of a movie in hindsight. A kind of metal in hair, Dokken version of Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie does not mean it's impossible to watch. however, this one seems to lack the charm usually found in the usual Mst3k feed. But if it was on the cable, if I was bored and drinking beer, of course, I would watch it again. But again, I've been watching Howling VII about five times now, so maybe you should not really listen to me. movie? And why did he feel the need to use so many capital letters?
