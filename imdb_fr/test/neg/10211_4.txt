In 1989, the struggle in New Zealand was a mega-hype. The orange goblin himself, HULK HOGAN (one of my superheroes at the time), was directing the ship to the top of the pyramid. why I loved this movie in 1989-90 when it came out here. HULK HOGAN A.K.A Terry Bollea is a terribly bad actor and Zeus A.K.A small list is worse !!! The scenario follows a standard scenario of the WWE (then the WWF) of about 88-91, resulting in the hype of the standard guy, the hulk and then the defeat again, just to follow the fact that the good makes use of any his inner strength gained by eating vitamins, saying prayers etc etc) to ride the epic come back ..... Nice standard formula here. It is worth watching if only to remember your youth !!!!
