This is the kind of movie I wonder why anyone would have thought of doing it from the beginning. This is the kind of movie I do not understand how people put money in, how the rental store can put the DVD on its shelves. This is the kind of movie that I blame for having rented it. <br /> <br /> There are good class B movies and I do not reject the genre. When they are good, they attract the interest of the action, they have characters well written and have played well enough so that you can worry about it. The effects of some of these films support the film in many cases, and you might like them for their originality. Almost nothing is true in 'Coronado'. The subject and scenario are at the level of cheap comics - just a clich√©. The effects are cheap - and no matter how small the budget is - you can do a lot with a small budget, but you need talent. There are so many continuity problems and other staging mistakes in ten other films. You do not care about characters, you do not laugh, and at the end of the movie, you wonder if the parody was intentional or not. The only quality I could find is the scenery, there are some good places, which are better than a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 on my personal scale. The worst film of the year so far.
