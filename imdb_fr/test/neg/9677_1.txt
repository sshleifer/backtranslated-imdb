How this film could be classified as drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I would try to erase it from my resume. It was historically as accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses melted into Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew, Lot, arrives thousands of years before his birth. The Canaanites wandered on the earth ... really? What did the writers think? Was it just ignorance ("I remember something about Noah and the animals, Lot and Canaanites, and all those Sunday school things") or did they try to offend the greatest possible number of people on the planet - among Christians, Jews and Muslims, historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ... have not we been offended? Whoever would even have a minimum of taste would have grinned at this one!
