Scott's 80s icon collection can not save this teenage disaster. But then, I guess that's why it was only a TV movie and not an important movie. William A. Schwartz (screenwriter) offers something closer to "Stewardess School", except that this movie is more boring. This film is not really stupid, but boring and completely without intrigue. The only reason to see this could be to see Tina Yothers in a real role after the family ties. After this film and "Class Cruise" just as stupid, I guess Mr. Scott woke up and returned to the sit-com direction, which was his best action to date. 4 out of 10
