When I heard that Disney had the rights to "Underdog", at least I thought it would be a Pixar partnership affair, and we would have a great movie for adults and children like "The Incredibles". Alas ... I forgot how Disney should imitate classic material for today's stubborn youth. What were they thinking? "Underdog" was a product of the 60's, your Prime Fanbase is in your forties and fifties, why would you refocus it at the age of 5? It should have been done "Roger Rabbit", half animated, half real. Instead, we have characters like Riff Raff (a WOLF !!) foolish against another dog. "Underdog" can not have an "energy pill" because we are now "enlightened", it would obviously be a reference to a steroid or a drug. The only good cast was Patrick Warburton as "Cad" because it actually looks like the cartoon version. Otherwise, fans of the old school "Underdog" should avoid this as the plague. And then? A live version of "The Go-Go Gophers" disguised as a revisionist history lesson? (My excuses advanced if Disney jumps on it!)
