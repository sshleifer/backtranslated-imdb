A friend invited me to see this in the theaters. <br /> <br /> After half an hour, we went out and entered the next multiplex (yes, we broke the rules) in time to catch the start of Against All Odds. <br /> <br /> I remember too many monkeys dancing around them saying, "Oog, Oog". Very little about the characters or the introduction of the story captured one of us or were memorable. This just dragged on to the point of being terribly boring (and believe me, any excuse was enough to spend time with that friend). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​were excellent, good photographs and good lighting, was a major studio release, and we came to see a movie, not an art gallery. It seemed that Ralph Richardson and Andie McDowell were going to be wasted in such a badly written film. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you arrive in the second hour, there is something interesting to see. I do not have much patience with my time. 4 out of 10
