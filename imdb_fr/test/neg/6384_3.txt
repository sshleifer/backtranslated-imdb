I saw this film and, in all honesty, I was quite disappointed. And in my opinion, this film lacks heart. Frankly, I did not care what happens to the characters at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> They could have done so much with the movie that they did not do it because they were so impressed by trying to be obscure and make deep comments about life , or trying so hard not to, that the characters and story were completely lost in all of this. I saw another picture of this director and I enjoyed it. But I felt that this film lacked fantasy and other heart and I wondered what was the purpose of the operation or if the purpose of this film was that there was no interest. Honestly, while I did not want to tear my hair during the film, I remembered the time lost on this sad little film. <br /> <br /> I do not doubt that some people will love this movie, but frankly I do not have.
