Jon Stewart (aka John Liebowitz) constantly tears up conservatism and all that is Republican. This liberal comic is everything but he puts his "humor" sharp in the throats of young impressionable. I watched the show while I was stuck in a waiting room while my car was being repaired and this guy was cheating on treason. He will take Al Queda's side of Bush every day. He is shameless and everything he says is punctuated by a deceptive laugh. I remember four years ago, he had "interviewed" John Kerry. The two faces face each other, which seems to prevent a preparatory session. It was like, "Take a room, guys." I do not like the malicious little traitors who peddle their propaganda. Call me shallow. The Daily Show has been around for a long time and many like-minded Liberals have a fierce hatred for Republicans and conservatism. I'm not surprised about its success, but do many people actually watch Comedy Central? This guy from Mancia pisses me off.
