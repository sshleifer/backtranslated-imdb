It is reassuring to see that other critics of IMDb have had the good sense to pan through this disappointing film, at the risk of blaspheming against the great Vadim, Malle and Fellini. These directors can be talented and artistic in their own right; however, in trying to put this legacy of eroticism and 60's chicness as "in no way" in relation to Edgar Allen Poe's stories, they turned out to be scammers. Either (A) they did not bother to read Poe's stories, either (B) they read them, but they were so captivated by their own selfish agenda that they did not care to think about Poe . <br /> <br /> Imagine Si Metallica has plugged their guitars, mounts up to 11 amps and passes three chords claiming it is Beethoven's 9th symphony. This is the feeling you will get after going through this movie. If you are a fan of Vadim / Malle / Fellini (Metallica), you will have dug it. If you are a fan of Beethoven (Poe), you will vomit. <br /> <br /> METZERGENSTEIN ... <br /> <br /> Here we start with a weird porn version of Poe. OK, "porn" is maybe a little extreme haha, but you should at least call it a Barbarella version (including, I do not doubt, some of Jane's outfits coming directly from the scifi sci-fi decor). Vadim falls into old clich√©s: the girl lying on a bed enjoying herself by a man while the camera with the pillow shows the apathy in his eyes; the general lassitude and boredom of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism. Cute stuff, but "Metzergenstein" is not the place for that. And besides Barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes, the impressive American accent and Jane Fonda's unconvincing performance as European Countess have made it the worst cast since Julia Roberts in this ugly version of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. <br /> WILLIAM Wilson ... <br /> <br /> Here is a beautiful story about Poe about the craziness that demands a man when he realizes he is no longer unique in the world . If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, watch episode 27 of Star Trek's "The Alternative Factor". But here, Malle emerges on this central theme and focuses instead on ... assumptions ...? Yeah, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. Ho hum. Brigitte Bardot's role is a complete fabrication to achieve this goal, and once again the director distorts a classic Poe story into a masturbatory catharsis of her own unshared sex issues. Do it at your own pace, Malle. I thought we were here at Poe's fortune. <br /> <br /> TOBY DAMMIT .... <br /> <br /> The worst of the three and probably the worst movie I've seen since Staying Alive. At least Fellini has been tactful in changing titles, but his departure from the plot, theme and humor of the story is so vast that I wonder if he just released this reel from his collection Private movie at home, stamped "Edgar Allen Poe Story" on it and submitted it to this collection. I worked very hard to find a thread of familiarity with Poe's works, but there was absolutely none. <br /> <br /> Poe's original story ("Never bet the devil on your head") is a dark, short and hilarious tale about a man who constantly exclaims "I bet the devil head ... "On a hazy morning, the devil offers him his offer. The result is the sickest and silliest thing you have ever read. It was the comedian Poe, at his best (yes, Poe has written many comedies, see also "A Predicament" and "The devil in the belfry" if you want to get a glimpse of his spiritual and satirical works). <br /> This version of Fellini? It's bland, soulless and not funny at all (unless you find it funny to see a drunkard stumble over himself for 45 minutes). Here, Fellini's selfish discourse speaks of an artist struggling with the hypocrisy, pretense and mediocrity of the cinema. Most of these events take place during a prize-giving ceremony during which Fellini beckons us with sarcasm, cynicism and the classic attitude of "sour grapes" found in all Fellini films dealing with the cinema. Note the sarcastic critiques of "criticism", a recurring theme in Fellini's films. For someone who considered himself above criticism, Fellini certainly spent a lot of time talking about it. Anyway, I get the impression that Fellini just took 8 1/2 sets, put them together and sold them as a Poe story. The worst "adaptation" of all time. <br /> <br /> I think I put more effort into typing this criticism than the three directors to make a movie Poe.
