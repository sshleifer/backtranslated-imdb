Not to be confused with George Zucco's 1943 film "The Mad Ghoul", "The Mad Monster" is a film that Zucco appeared the year before. In this rather nuanced case of numbers, Zucco is developing a way to turn his unsuspecting handyman, Petro, into a wolf / man hybrid through wolf blood injections, and then wasted little time sending the transformed doofus transform former colleagues who had made fun of his experiences. In reality, it is a very simple scenario and a very small budget production. Glenn Strange, who plays the character of the wolf here, will soon become more famous by playing the monster Franky in such films as "House of Frankenstein" (1944) and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948). The makeup work he does here is rather lame and only manages to make him look like a hippie with depressed teeth (like the one of "Teenage Monster" of 1957). In addition, the sets of this film are almost non-existent and the outcome is brutal and unconvincing. I gave the film 4 stars very generous, partly because I have a constant love for horror movies of the 1940s, but, to tell the truth, most objective viewers would probably think that like shit, and I guess that's the case. It's certainly not a well-designed Universal case or a Val Lewton masterpiece, that's for sure! Despite everything, Zucco is still fun to watch, even in the less demanding piffles like this one. If you can spare 72 minutes of your life, I guess you could do worse than "The Mad Monster" (not too much, of course!). Oh ... another thing. This DVD comes from Alpha Video, and you know what it means: blurry images, mediocre sound (actually, the worst sound of all the Alpha video DVDs I've encountered so far) and no extras. You have been warned!
