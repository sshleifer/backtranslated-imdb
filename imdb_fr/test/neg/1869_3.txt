Busty beauty Stacie Randall plays in PVC clothing, Alexandra, the faithful sidekick of Faust, an evil entity trapped in hell. Determined to free her master, the malicious minx enters a warehouse to steal a magical jewel, essential to its success. but while performing a satanic ritual to call Faust, the stupid mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has traced on the ground, resulting in the loss of the gem and the release of two small creatures resembling trolls, lite and Dark. <br /> <br /> Now, Alexandra must find a replacement jewel, which is not going to be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex-lover, detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis)), who investigates theft in a warehouse and who knows only too well what harm Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, the legendary Lite and Dark inter-dimensional half-pints face all kinds of crazy problems trying to find a way to get home. <br /> <br /> In the film world of Jim Wynorski, all women are busty babies with the fashion sense of a cheap prostitute. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this film, whether she's a police captain, antiques curator or mentally ill in an asylum, is hot, hot, hot and does not wear much, and that's what's Pass this makes this piece of shit STV totally unassailable, it is almost bearable. <br /> <br /> But know that although the presence of half-naked and quality crumpet slightly facilitates the work, there is still much to say about this film to justify its labeling as a test: the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful; Black humor (as described in the text on DVD) is about as funny as a knee to the stunner, the comic joke of Lite and Dark being particularly worthy of squeaks; and the special effects are good basements made of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have dated back ten years ago. <br /> <br /> 3/10 only for the high bimbo quotient.
