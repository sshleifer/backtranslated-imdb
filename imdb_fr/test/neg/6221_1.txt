I love musicals, from the merry Oklahoma to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to the romantic "Damn Yankees". And I know most songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone. <br /> <br /> In a "real" musical, unlike this vaudeville show, each song is carefully crafted to match the exact moment. It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation - a natural extension where mere words are missing. Thus, in Guys and Dolls, "My Time of Day" describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson as she is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. Each song of this brilliant example of the genre creates an atmosphere or develops a character, creating a phantasmagoria of places, made absolutely credible by the evocations of songs revealed by oneself. <br /> <br /> For this Broadway Musical lover and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the twentieth century, Mama Mia is between satire and a cruel distortion of the genre. There, the songs of these musicals have advanced intrigues often elaborate and often delicious. While here, the songs, simply chosen from a collection, only interfered with the shaky premise of the film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of those who make this film a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century musicals. They have no idea of ​​the magic of the writer and lyricist who can turn a dance floor into a person we know and love, as was done in "Sweet Charity". <br /> <br /> Allow me to apologize for the arrogance of this criticism. Perhaps, another day, another mood, I could have started, and not to have been so critical in this review. <br /> <br /> But I can not help but imagine what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and so many others could have managed even with this ridiculous premise. I think about it, while the memories of seeing this movie are fresh, and I can not help but cry the big loss.
