Ok, you hippies, you're probably wondering what I have against an "educational" and "informative" show like "Barney"? Well, I have a lot of hate against her for these reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. He teaches that having a personality and individualism is immoral. No one in the series has personality. Everyone dresses the same, speaks the same, acts the same and dances alike. Even in the episode titled "Being an Individual," kids are trying to tell Barney what they like and EVERYONE on the planet should do what I love. Do you want to teach your child that being an individual is a mistake? <br /> <br /> 2. "A stranger is a friend, you have not met him" Episode. Although seemingly harmless, the producers of the series soon realized that it could also be extremely dangerous for young children. In fact, many young Barney fans from the United States were victims of pedophiles, who used the series' friendly message to lure children away from their parents. The episode has since been shot, but the damage was done. The so-called "innocent" mistakes in programming, such as this one, clearly show why parents have to watch TV WITH their children. <br /> <br /> 3. If you are not happy all the time, you are a bad person. No one seems to show any emotion other than happiness, whatever the situation they are in. If the child's parents go crazy or sad for whatever reason, the child may think of mom or dad differently. Not a good message at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Magic solves everything! It seems like every problem is solved by magic. At least in shows like "Fraggle Rock", this teaches us that magic can have the opposite effect, it is better to solve the problems by oneself. Does Barney teach this? No of course not. There must be magic in there. And the problem is that many two-year-olds can not distinguish fantasies from reality and may think that their parents, siblings can use magic to solve everything, but become confused when they CAN NOT use the magic and think they are weird. Another boner shot again. <br /> <br /> Barney makes no distinction between flying and sharing. He even specifically stated that "flying is good if the person you fly does not mind". Children can learn that if you really want something, stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it. This is not something for which preschoolers need authority figures to tell them. <br /> <br /> 6. "If I just have what it takes, I can solve all my problems." Whenever children have a problem, Barney gives them everything they need to solve it. The message sent here is "Do not try to think about solving this! It's too much work and the solution probably would not work anyway. Just use this." As a result, children could stop thinking through things (Barney said it was too much work) and become dependent on the right object. (Good shoes, good food, the right computer, the right weight machine ...) This is obviously a good message for Barney marketers, but it's not good for preschoolers . <br /> <br /> 7. The message that cheat is good. In another episode, the children participate in a contest to carry a peanut with a spoon without dropping it. A child puts peanut butter on his spoon and wins easily. The child is rewarded for his creative thinking, as he breaks the rules and changes the game to win. It teaches that cheating is good, we win and people think that we are creative, whereas in real life we ​​are often disqualified or worse, and other opponents who respect the rules do not feel not embarrassed. <br /> <br /> 8 Do the kids on this show eat anything other than cakes, cookies and sweets? This teaches that it is normal to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy foods, despite Barney's song "Healthy Food". Other than that, EVERYONE in the show eats junk food. No wonder there are so many obese children in America and Europe. <br /> <br /> And finally ... <br /> <br /> Most children's TV shows teach creative problem solving without having to resort to "magic". Barney could also have done it, but instead decided to use the method that was A) best for marketers and B) who took the least time and money for scripts. It's a blatant break that shows how little the Lyon group cares about children. <br /> <br /> It's my mouth-stroke for you all.
