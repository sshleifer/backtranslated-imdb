When I saw on the voting board that some people had given this film a score of 10, I assumed they did not know that the score was not 100. It's a disaster movie in the real sense of the term. Wrongly written and weakly directed with so-called actors unable to act, but able to grimace on order. For the first 60 minutes, the story seems to go in one direction, then it changes course and mingles with a power struggle, with extremely poor special effects. Unable to find a clever way for the hero with limited powers to defeat the evil with super powers, the "editor" cheats. It is obvious that the father was added to the so-called story because it was easier than developing an acceptable outcome. Not that writing even knows the word "denouement". Some movies go directly to DVDs. He should have gone straight to the trash.
