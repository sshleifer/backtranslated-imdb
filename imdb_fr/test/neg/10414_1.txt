This film attracted me by its offbeat story, discreet and realistic. That is to say that a guy in his twenties is driving in the Big Apple and returns home to live with his parents and his brother even more fragile. It may have worked, but there is a problem. And the name of this problem is Casey Affleck. <br /> <br /> Casey Affleck is almost catatonic in this movie. His actor's mantra must be "to make the least effort possible at all times". Or "why talk when you can whisper?" Or maybe "get into a coma as soon as the camera rolls". The lips move when we talk? Barely. Facial expressions? No. Muscles in the face? Atrophy. Something? Nothing. Whatever? Zip *: French.
