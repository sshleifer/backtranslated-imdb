It's probably the least involved film I've ever seen. I watched it because I have a thing for Leon (everything else Besson did was horrible, in my opinion, with the exception of Wasabi's screenplay) and Jean Reno. This proves how terrible this film is: Reno, one of the most charismatic and affably energetic actors (it's true that he's just starting here) can not do this movie, nor moments when he's on the screen, observable. <Everything is very filmic: black and white, no dialogue, people who do things for no apparent reason, who chase each other while being chased in turn by a shaky camera. And, predictably, none of this is entertaining. <br /> <br /> This is not a "French Mad Max" as some have claimed (actually, I think they mean "Mad Max 2") - it's a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting, and is just the kind of comment you expect from someone who does not know what they're talking about. Mad Max 2 was thrilling, Mad Max 2 was exciting, Mad Max 2 was worth your time - The Last Fight is not one of them. <br /> <br /> I know it's supposed to be cool to love Arty in black and white French movies and just as cool to say that you've seen in them something that other people do not have read (or that you have managed to sit without drowsiness), that's why I would not trust those who claim to love The Last Combat, because I do not see anything worth it; he asks so much and does not do anything. I found myself drifting after about five minutes and he never did anything to regain my full attention. Anyone who can sit there without being distracted is not human, or at most is psychotic. (In fact, they are probably just trying to look "cool").
