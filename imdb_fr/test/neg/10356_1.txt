I am a fan of this generally excellent though sometimes rather boring show but Season 3 has taken some terrible plot directions. The HERO episode is an example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> The story, over time, is that the Cylons deliberately allow Bulldog - a pilot captured several years earlier during a Black Ops mission - to escape, steal Cylon Ship and back to Galactica. The plan is that when Bulldog returns, he'll know that Adam let him do it and be so angry that he's going to kill Adama, which he's almost doing. <br /> <br /> Now the problem is this: the Cylons arranged for Bulldog to think he escaped alone. This means that Bulldog leaves the Cylon ship without assistance. So he kills a Cylon and gets out of his detention cell - that's what we see. Then we must assume that he is heading to the aircraft hangar, manages to embark on a Cylon combat ship and learns to maneuver, take off and return to Galactica. Just like that. <br /> <br /> Now, Starbuck was able to get one of them working in season 1, which was hardly believable in itself, but it was enough for him to fly over it before making contact with Galactica. Bulldog must program his ship to make several jumps in hyperspace and catch Galactica somewhere thousands of light-years away, in an unknown direction. How does he manage to program a ship that contains a totally foreign technology? The cylinders connect to their computers to the touch, there is no visual console or keyboard. And having achieved this miraculous feat, how does he know where Galactica is, knowing that Galactica took off 3 years ago and has been trying to escape the Cylons since then - he does not leave any beacons? Even taking into account the suspension of disbelief that must apply to any science-fiction show, this episode has absolutely no meaning.
