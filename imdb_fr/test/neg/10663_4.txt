Here is an interesting anecdote about one of the comments above: In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie. I was approached - in white - to double some of the lines of this film in a recording studio. <br /> <br /> Although I speak German too, I was asked to do all dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience ... So, all the Germans of this film speak english! funny enough, I made several characters, so if you really want to lose some time watching the movie again, listen well; <br /> <br /> All non-Indian characters are only created by 4 voices! . . . .
