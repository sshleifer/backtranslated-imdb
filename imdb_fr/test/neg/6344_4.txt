Gene Hackman is a former Marine Corps colonel who is asking a handful of Vietnamese private veterinarians to return to Laos to save some Americans who have been reported missing in action. Hackman suspects that in reality, half a dozen MIA are secretly detained in a remote camp by Laotians for torment and provide more forced labor. Hackman is paid by the wealthy Robert Stack, whose son, like Hackman's son, would be among the MIAs. But the circumstances are such that Hackman can buy only old and obsolete weapons, even if he manages to get the help of a fierce anti-communist Loatian and his two daughters on the way. <br /> <br /> I do not think the film was deliberately concocted to endorse the myth of Vietnames still holding our MIA for propaganda purposes. The myth was very real. If anyone remembers, there were a lot of bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983, Report the MIA. I think rather that the film was made in part to take advantage of the myth. It was absurd at first sight. Why would our former enemy refuse to return the MIA? Propaganda? Where is the value of propaganda in something that is kept secret? To add the job offer? They need a hundred more workers in Vietnam and Laos? The motivations behind this film - with its triumphal music and its large number of corpses - were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But what about the film itself? Ridding himself of his theme of rescuing mythically abused MIAs, he is a routine paramilitary activist, neither better nor worse than dozens of others who appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one to succeed. keep your head out of the water. He is almost always reliable. <br /> <br /> Among the others, this is a stereotypical plot, from "The Dirty Dozen", among others, I was trying to guess which gang would sacrifice for the mission. Among the three anti-communist Asians, I thought that one or more of them was dead meat. That's why Asian assistants appear in movies like this one. (I was right two out of three times.) I also thought Patrick Swayzie was the former junior officer, the youngest in the group, who had never "earned the respect" of others because he had never seen fighting must also go into a heroic mode. False. He becomes a hero, certainly, but remains intact. I thought there was a chance in fifty that Hackman would have to leave too, but he's doing well. The formula does not look for originality either. Charles Bronson's Claustrophobic Prisoner of War, from "The Great Escape", is here in Fred Ward's ex-tunnel tunnel, a claustrophobe who is forced to crawl through a drain pipe with a snake. inside to be able to reconnoitre the Laotian POW camp. <br /> <br /> The title "Uncommon Valor" comes from a tribute Admiral Nimitz gave to Iwo Jima's men - "Uncommon courage was commonplace that day". Nimitz was certainly right about it. That the men who fought in Vietnam are all equally brave is far from the subject. Everyone who witnessed or approached the battle, putting their lives at risk for the guys next to them, was pretty heroic. This film, and the way it exploits our bitterness in the face of the Vietnam War, does not really do them justice.
