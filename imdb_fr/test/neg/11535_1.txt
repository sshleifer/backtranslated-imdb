I absolutely hated this movie. Even though the film wanted to convey a kind of social message, it was done as clich√©d and melodramatic as a Mexican soap opera. <br /> <br /> The action was also terrible, especially Charityn and his son. This is one of the problems of Dominican films, they use celebrities who can not even act solely to attract the masses. <br /> <br /> I am even more ashamed of the positive reviews here, which unfortunately means that Dominicans are simply condescending to what is happening here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry to base on quality.
