As cute and adorable as it is, the story of three sung chipmunks just does not seem to have enough meat to bear for an hour and a half. I thought the first half hour of this movie was really worth watching. It was fun, there was some laughter, it was full of energy. Then he just lost that. I would not even say that it faded, because it seemed to me rather abrupt. The pleasure was gone; the laughter has disappeared. My daughter also noticed it. She is 4 years old - she burst out laughing several times in this first part of the film, then her laugh stopped. Maybe it was too serious a tone: the devilish film producer working dead the chipmunks. Anyway, something happened and it was not for the best. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film tries to tell how the chipmunks (Alvin, Simon and Theodore) started. Everyone knows the Christmas song. We discover here how they met Dave and started. The film is currently up-to-date, although their actual origin is mentioned in Dave's street address in 1958, the year of the creation of animated song rodents. Jason Lee did a very good job because Dave and the chipmunk voices were also very good. David Cross as the evil Ian irritated me to be frank, and I could not understand the purpose of Claire's character, played by Cameron Richardson. She added little to the movie. It's a movie you can watch with kids - it's probably a movie you would only want to watch with kids, actually. He gets a 4/10 from me.
