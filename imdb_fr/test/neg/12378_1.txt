It's a horrible movie !! Some people told me that it was not so bad in reality but I certainly do not agree! The monster is incredibly cheap (and funny) but it's something we all knew, I guess. On top of that, the dialogues are awful and the writing is just terrible. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, this film has the quality of being entertaining. Not always for the right reasons but it's a good movie "so bad it's fun". <br /> <br /> By the way, "La Castagne" does not exist. According to a secondary character in the movie named Pierre (described in the film as a French Canadian), there is a legend among French Canadians about a giant bird called "La Castagne". As a French Canadian, I can assure you that I have never heard of such a legend. It made me laugh anyway ... :))
