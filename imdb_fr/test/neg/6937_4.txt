In a way, I rather liked this film because of its positive atmosphere "without spirit". I had a problem with one aspect of the plot, but more about it later. First, the characters were a bit clumsy and one-dimensional. "Good people" had similar physical features and character traits, and "bad people" had similar character traits and traits. The basic scenario was OK (quite simple and standard) - nothing exciting or objective. The main attraction was, of course, miniature dinosaurs - a kind of fun element to enjoy. However, their presence in the movie was minimal. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film kept a steady pace and did not get bogged down in one place. I liked the movie. <br /> <br /> The problem I had with the plot was related to the idea of ​​"stealing". I think this movie may not have been thought out enough - there is something wrong, especially if it's a children's movie. I will keep the summary of the following sentence for not being a spoiler (avoid it if you are worried). The 'good guys' are flying and they do not have the same information as the public - so it's flying and it's a bit of a bad thing for a kid movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you have kids, because of one aspect of the dubious plot, I would consider passing. However, all this film is quite discreet anyway, so it does not matter. Pass this one if you have other interesting choices.
