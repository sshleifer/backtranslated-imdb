When "Deranged" was created, the filmmakers saw fit to turn Ed Gein into Ezra Cobb, even though the resulting film was actually quite close to the facts of the famous case. I guess enough fiction has been imagined that they think they should change their names, etc. <br /> <br /> "Ed Gein - The Plainfield butcher" masquerading as a true story about the Gein affair, but actually shows very little resemblance. to history. As a biopic film, it's a travesty. If ever a film needs to change its name, it is this one, much more than "Deranged". It's as close to the real crime story as "Dirty Harry" was the true story of the Zodiac murders. <br /> <br /> OK, so, aside from this annoyance, how is this a horror movie? Well, as a horror movie, as a film in general, it's terrible. One of the worst movies I've seen in months. The problems are as follows: 1) Kane Hodder is surprisingly misinterpreted as Ed Gein. Quite inappropriate in the room, Hodder is content to look threateningly. Very bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Kane Hodder is the best actor of the movie! The rest of the cast is more of an "amateur dramaturgy" and completely without commitment. It is painful to attend the presentation of some sequences. <br /> <br /> 3) The occasional efforts to make stylish films seem to come from the "Big Book of Moody's Film Clich√©". You have seen everything before, better executed. Apart from the efforts of style, the rest of the realization is largely inept: the cameras are shaking, the framing is bad, there are very long unnecessary shots that slow down the pace ... which leads me to .. . <br /> <br /> 4) It seems to last forever. It lasts less than 90 minutes, but getting through is a test. You swear it lasted two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> 5) Ed Gein seems almost secondary. The film mainly deals with the family affairs of a newly promoted deputy sheriff. This MP is portrayed by an abominable actor on whose shoulders no film should rest. <br /> <br /> Something good about this? Well, the FX gore is very good. Some convincing wounds are exposed and the makeup is usually excellent. None of this, however, offsets the huge flaws of the film. <br /> <br /> It does not even have any kitsch value, it's just bad; not pleasantly bad, not "so bad that it's good", just really bad. A film to avoid and despise.
