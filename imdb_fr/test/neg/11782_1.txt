My website (www.theflickguy.org) lists this choice as the worst movie of all time. Here is an excerpt: <br /> <br /> "If I were tied to a chair and forced to watch this movie again and again, I could not imagine that hell was worse." Jim Varney plays A crazy man trying to destroy the world (apparently starting with the movies) Now, let's face it, nobody expects much from a Varney film, but this agony has made me dry mouth for 92 minutes, not a laugh, not a laugh, it's neither kamp nor nerdy, it's not stupid, it's an evil, do not rent it, it could destroy your DVD player. 'do not even buy the VHS in a 29-cent customs clearance bin to use as a blank tape ... is the worst movie of all time. "I really mean it."
