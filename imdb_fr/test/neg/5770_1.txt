And believe me, it's a remarkable achievement. Take "Jolly Roger: Massacre at Cutter's Cove," turn the pirate killer into a prospector, turn his obsession into treasure buried in old gold and changing from dark green to dark blue. You now have "Miners Massacre". The problem is that at least "Jolly Roger" was quite fun - although it's so bad - it's a good way - to keep you watching it for two hours. There is no murder scene committed by a gang or weird killings. I can not tell you how many times I lost interest in the "Miner's Massacre" and started doing the dishes or cleaning around the apartment. And the end is absolutely stupid. The 49-year-old has just reappeared at random to kill the local sheriff, while the lead actor and actress are sitting in the cruising boat screaming. A really horrible movie.
