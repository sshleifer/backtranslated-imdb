All those interested in PC culture are shocked by the dogmatic Christian view of this film, claiming it contains racist ideologies and / or religious intolerance. <br /> <br /> Those who do not care, but are oriented here, values ​​and competent actors are dismayed. <br /> <br /> Those who denigrate them are sorry to say that this production has been delivered to the general public, as evidenced by the comments below. <What is interesting, which is not original, it is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND, is treated rather immature in this film, but realized with brio. What the team and actors lacked in sensitivity, professional skills and technical expertise is somewhat outweighed by the intensity they display. <br /> <br /> This is not as serious as many think here, and it would have been in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense, and it is enough below mediocrity to provoke laughs and moans. However, it deploys with enough intensity to keep the interest, and gets closer to the input produced by Corman from his very first period of work, or Arkoff's or Sam Katzman's material. If you get it for $ 2 (or less) as I did, you will not be disappointed, but would like to have your say on how the product was made.
