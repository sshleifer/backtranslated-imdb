In 1970, feminists invaded the "Miss World" beauty pageant in London and ended the occasion by throwing flour and eggs onto the stage. Why? Because, rightly or wrongly, they felt the event was humiliating and degrading for women. I offer no criticism of their actions. It is a free world in which we live. What I want to know is: why would not their modern equivalents take over studios where such shows are made and do the same? <br /> <br /> "Sex & The City" is made up of four egocentric New York women: Carrie is a fashion slave who turns into a pussy when a man throws her as long as her eyes, Charlotte longs to find the perfect man (they do not exist, love) so that she can use sex to trap the poor devil, the lawyer Miranda scares men by telling them nonsense as "out of touch with my emotions" living incarnation of the old Martini ad "anytime, anywhere, anywhere". Feminists view these characters - especially Samantha - as a shining example of modern femininity. Well, if progress shouts in busy restaurants is progress, I think feminists should look at each other for a long time and what they are supposed to represent. <br /> <br /> If Sex & The City had been the creation of a man, he would have been fired for being sexist. Instead, like "Charlie's Angels" before him, he persuaded so-called intelligent women to think that he had acted as a positive force for good. There is something very clinical and cool in the series. "The Benny Hill Show" was also sexist, but at least it was funny.
