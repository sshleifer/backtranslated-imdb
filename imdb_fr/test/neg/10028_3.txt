Insane hikers will camp in the mountains of Utah before falling on a murderous and disfigured gypsy. <br /> <br /> The Prey is a nice series of slasher films, which is mostly lacking in imagination. The characters of the victim are all too familiar idiots, which means that we are not really interested in them, we wonder when they will die! Not to mention the fact that there are too many tasting moments and that it is filled with useless and endless sequences of nature. However, he has some moments of interest for slasher fans, an occasional touch of phantasmagoric atmosphere and a decent musical score of Don Peake. That said, things are going well for the movies of dead campers. <br /> <br /> There are much better films in this direction, but overall, The Prey may be quite watchable for hardcore slasher fans. Although one could be more rewarded for watching Just Before Dawn (1981), Wrong Turn (2003), or even The Final Terror (1983). <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on ****
