I am very disappointed. First of all, the German synchronization is bad. Maybe in the original version (with subtitles), it would have been better, but the whole movie looks if the director saw Luna Papa and Black Cat White Cat and was trying to produce something in that style too. But failed in all aspects. It's an incongruous mix of a strange, incredible story and very childish gags. No atmosphere, no life. Extremely primitive sexual humor. I voted 2, because 1 is the worst, and the other point for 'Sybilla', she is really cute. Sorry, I like "oriental" movies, but this one is really superfluous.
