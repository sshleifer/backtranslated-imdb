Jesus Franco has a lot of success in his films and I would say it was a mistake, unless you like nothing. I will say that the man has the eye for a good shot, even if it is women with bare breasts with machine guns silhouetted on the ocean. This is pretty ridiculous overall and the acting is horrible, but it's the least we can say. And what is it? Well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism, women picking and shoveling in the sun for no apparent reason, and about as sordid as possible and maybe even a few. The most notable (?) Is a scene featuring a young woman tied to a chair and a German shepherd apparently in love, and although what happens is only implied (hopefully), it's probably a scenario which I could have done without. I would say that Tender Fles is part of Francoist films that I would prefer not to have in my collection, even if the music is jazzy and fun. 4 out of 10, yecch.
