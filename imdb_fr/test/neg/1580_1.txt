Some time ago, I watched this movie and the only thing I can remember is how absolutely horrible it was incredibly bad: it was definitely in my top 5 worst movies ever And to think that I had to convince my friends to get this movie at the video store, my reputation was undermined because of this movie, my friends will they trust me again? I doubt it, they always say not to judge things by the cover, they were right when I saw the cover skins / gang boys, I thought wow, it looks great, because there was full of skin skin on the front cover that was raging with metal bars. Do not watch this movie. I can not think of anything else to say that the game is bad the story is bad, it's just bad.
