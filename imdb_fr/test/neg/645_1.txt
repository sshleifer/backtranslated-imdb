The first thing that struck me in this film was the terrible actor role. All the actors were so uniformly unable to deliver their lines that I laughed at the awful dialogue in the middle of the film. An even bigger problem with this film is that at no time do we discover what motivates the actions of each character. The innovative visual effects of Halfdan Hussey are a somewhat redemptive aspect of the film. However, as attractive as they are, they do not make up for the gaping gaps mentioned above. A dreadful scenario mixed with acting at the community theater level does not allow for enjoyable viewing. Honestly, I was shocked to see how bad this movie was.
