*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> I saw this movie last night during a screening. I have already started to like Tim Robbins and love science fiction. The first third of the movie was very cool. The score was good, the cinematography was interesting, the vision of the director of the future was realistic but nevertheless quite interesting. I remember thinking, "It's the most cleverly-made sci-fi film of my life." Then they just could not stay together. <br /> <br /> Even if, initially, this film presented a number of problems more "difficult" (including editing, and later part of the writing). / parcel development), these questions were forgivable. They became unforgivable once the film lost momentum halfway, and then the movie became boring when you realized it was not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Robbins could not give life to his character, but did his best. Her female counterpart (her name escapes me now) played her part well. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the film's meanders seemed to be that filmmakers could not decide to make a sci. -film or a futuristic love story. They ended up with neither one nor the other. <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> Part of the cinematography: granular, it's like sometimes "21 days later". <br /> <br /> Very suitable for a futuristic film like this one. <br /> <br /> I dug some of the filming. <br /> <br /> The music was cool. <br /> <br /> The vision of the filmmakers of the future was realistic but always cool and interesting. <br /> <br /> I liked the interactions with the other minor characters of the film. <br /> <br /> Part of the writing was interesting (at first). <br /> <br /> The girl who played Maria Gonzales (her name does not remember), she was good. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS BELOW *** <br /> <br /> Some questions / comments: <br /> <br /> I thought that many futuristic things in this movie were convenient for repair a tiled story. To know VIRUS. Obviously, the virus that they transmitted to her at the end of the film and that made her physically "frightened" was right there, so that they could stay in another sex scene and she could then report it uncontrollable way to code 46. They took it away then clears his memory and the film ends. The classic dream sequence ends if you ask me. perfectly fits all the details, if you just make it a dream? <br /> <br /> Was Robbin's character naturally good as an intuition or was it the virus? <br /> <br /> Why did not they explore the myriad of issues surrounding the girl being a clone of her mother? It could have made an interesting story. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, I like the greetings of the whole world in the speech of each one. But this became intrusive especially since their accents were not convincing. I understand, the future will undoubtedly be more androgynous racially and culturally, but it began to look like an AT & T Global Networking advertisement in the end. <br /> <br /> If they were "outside", how could they have been broken for code 46? <br /> <br /> The "cover" has never been well defined. Sometimes it seemed as trivial as a visa, and sometimes it was as vital as life or death. Once again, fuzzy definitions allow them to use it to glue together disparate parts of the plot. <br /> <br /> OK, I'm starting to be negative, so I'm going to stop. There were nice scenes and interesting things about this movie, but it only gives him a 4/10
