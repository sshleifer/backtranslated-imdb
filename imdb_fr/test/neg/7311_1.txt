This movie was bad. I think Elton (or is it Mike) Wong played in this movie. Be that as it may, it was the Wong who did not have that awkward smile and who seemed more naughty. He plays a man who is hit on the head and suffers brain damage. He recovers and takes revenge. Gordon Liu is the only one who deserves to be seen in this movie, but he does not do much. But the little he does seems to make others pale in comparison. In addition, the film has a cheese rubber falcon that the Wong type controls. This film is not worth renting or buying.
