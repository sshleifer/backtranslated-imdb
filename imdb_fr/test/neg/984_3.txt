I still think it would be nice if you could somehow get a sneak preview of some of the old movies that are re-released on DVD, before you buy them. In this way, you could save time, money and some degree of aggro when you feel totally depressed. <br /> <br /> "The Buddy Holly Story" is a movie of this type. <br /> <br /> I do not want to enter the characterizations, or the holes of the plot, nor in the confusion with the historical facts that this film includes, because I had already dealt with them there at twenty, when I started to watch him. <br /> <br /> I recorded it on the old beta machine (monaural) in the early 80s and loved it so much that it became a favorite. The best part, in my opinion, was Gary Busey's performance as a young friend, and his almost perfect singing and guitar playing. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to the day when I could have it ... STEREO ... and that's where disappointment comes in. <br /> <br /> This version DVD is (supposedly) remodeled in both audio and video, according to the shell information, but I'm afraid it left me sadly disappointed by glancing at my watch, wishing that she is finishing. <br /> <br /> The sound is murky, close to the unintelligible, and so meticulously mixed that it made me aspire to the crystalline clarity of the voice of my old Beta cassette! <br /> <br /> Despite what you think of images, plot or characters, the real card to play here is MUSIC ...... and if you can not hear the main song because they are drowned by cymbals, or accompanying harmonies, or other ambients, so there is not much left, right? <br /> <br /> I will convert my old beta to DVD (Mono) for the following views, and place it in its original location, with garbage! <br /> <br /> "Extinction is the rule, survival is the exception ..."
