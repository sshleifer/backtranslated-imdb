After the book, I became very sad watching the movie. I agree that sometimes a film must be different from the original novel but in this case it was more than acceptable. Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) why the ranks are different (for example, Lieutenant Diestl instead of sergeant, etc.) <br /> <br /> 2) the last screen is very poor and makes Diestl a soldier who prepares and wants to die. But that's not 100% true. Just read the book. He was also a bull in the last seconds. He did not want to die by destroying his weapon and simply heading to Michael & Noah. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of happy ending that is not suitable for this film at all.
