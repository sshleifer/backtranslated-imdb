"The Yoke's on Me" is arguably the most controversial film of 23 years of Stooges short films. The reason is understandable. compared to current standards, this film can be considered racist. For this reason, it is rarely, if ever, shown on television. <br /> <br /> Let me say that, for information, the Japanese seen in the film are not soldiers; They were Japanese-Americans sent to a resettlement center during the Second World War. They have been treated and presented as the evil enemy in this film. By all accounts - including the US government, which apologized and made reparations in the 1980s - Japanese Americans during the Second World War were as loyal and hardworking as any American. Their imprisonment at that time is a dark spot in American history. <br /> <br /> There are some Stooge laughs in this movie, but the memories of how Japanese Americans were treated at that time carry the value of entertainment. Let's not confuse loyal Japanese Americans with their portrayal in this movie as villains. Loyal Japanese Americans and the devilish empire of Japan from the Second World War are not synonymous. 2 out of 10
