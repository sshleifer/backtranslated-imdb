The director does not know what to do with a camera ... too many options and she always always chooses the wrong choice ... she lets travolta take charge ... and he controls the film from beginning to end .. the characters are not developed ... maybe because we need to watch them sing ... no rhythm at all, sometimes too fast sometimes too slowly ... composition error: travolta ok ... johansson, she's too tall to be an 18 ... even though she's really 20 ... <br /> <br /> happy ending? Well, it looks like there must be one, so the story is sad but not too sad ... Travolta does not know how to play the guitar, but the director does not seem very worried that it's totally out of sync ... <br /> <br /> The idea is the only thing that's great ... but how did it develop? Well, it's just full of stereotypes and lines heard too many times ... <br /> <br /> Too bad, another missed opportunity ...
