This looks like a zoology textbook, since its description of the animals is so precise. However, here are some details that seem to have been slightly changed during the transition to the film: <br /> <br /> - Handgun bullets have never reached the giant Komodo dragons. No matter how many times you shoot the Komodo, bullets do not approach it. <br /> <br /> - The best way to avoid being eaten by a giant cobra or a giant Komodo dragon, is just to stay there. The exception to this rule is if you are told to stay still, in which case you should run away until the Komodo is right next to you, and you should stand there waiting for defeat. <br /> <br /> - Minutes of slow motion sequences behind the credits allow you to watch with pleasure. <br /> <br /> - $ 5,000 is a memory enhancement tool and an excellent substitute for losing your driver's license / arrest. <Br /> <br /> - Members of the elite army units do not see the giant Komodo dragons arrive until they are one meter away from oversized beings. Maybe the computer-generated nature of these dragons is for something. <br /> <br /> - When you are filming a story to reveal illicit animal testing, a journalist and a cameraman with a single camera are all the equipment you need; Audio equipment, a second camera, microphones, etc. are all superfluous. <br /> <br /> - When you hear a loud animal scream and a person has a gun, he must take it out and direct it to the nearest person. <br /> <br /> - When you take out a firearm, the sound of the security removed sounds, even if your finger is far from safe <br /> <br /> - Journalists agree to leave for the first time other end of the world to expose something - without having any idea what they are exposing. Background research and vague knowledge are outdated in modern journalism. <br /> <br /> - Handguns contain at least 52 bullets in a clip, and more than in the next clip. Despite this, those with guns say they will need more ammunition. <br /> <br /> - The expensive cameras (remember that the reporter has only one camera) are regularly left behind without even a moment of hesitation or regret. These cameras are surprisingly good to visit the journalist. <br /> <br /> - The blonde girl is really stupid. <br /> <br /> - The same girl who says do not do it Go to a house, because a Komodo dragon can easily cross it, which makes it dangerous, takes a team to a building made in the same material to protect it - and nobody says anything about it. <br /> <br /> - High tech facilities look like simple desks equipped with high school chemistry kits. <br /> <br /> - Genetically modified serpents grow from a normal size to 100 feet in one day, but do not grow at all in the weeks on either side. <br /> <br /> - The army regularly destroys whole islands when the inhabitants do not respect the contact deadlines. <br /> <br /> - Men armed with firearms do not necessarily change the direction in which they are. shoot when their target is no longer right in front of them. Instead, they continue to shoot in the air. <br /> <br /> - The more beautiful you look, the more likely you are to survive giant creatures. <br /> <br /> - Women's intuition is reliable enough to change Even the most stubborn of minds. <br /> <br /> - Whenever you are hunted by giant creatures, this is the perfect time to hit girls of half your age. <br /> <br /> - Animal noises are an appropriate masking noise to "swear" at the same volume. <br /> <br /> - Old Israeli and Russian planes are regularly used by the US military.
