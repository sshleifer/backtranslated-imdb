I had the dubious opportunity to see this film on television. This is the perfect example to turn a screenplay into one of the worst movies ever made. Not only the acting is terrible and the effects are terrible, but the film has more logical holes than 10 pounds of imported Swiss cheese. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this film as an example of how it is forbidden to make a film and which director not to use in one of yours. <br /> <br /> I turned off the television during the last ugly minutes of the series. To call it "pathetic" is a euphemism.
