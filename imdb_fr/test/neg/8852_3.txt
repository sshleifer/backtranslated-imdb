I was so excited to finally see "Pulse" after receiving it from Amazon, and I must say that I was totally disappointed. I think maybe I was too excited. I had expectations set by his fans that just could not be satisfied. After enjoying other Asian horrors, I thought I knew it would find a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The story was slow, painfully. I am a diverse horror fan. I love the brutal and bloody madness of "The Devil's Rejects" and I also like the constant and growing macabre of "A Tale of Two Sisters". "Pulse" unfortunately did not offer much on both sides. <br /> <br /> Parallel to the slow conspiracy, he was also very confused. I did not know why the characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem. It seemed that the director had cast the plot in a sentence or two and that the rest was unproductive of our actors. Unlike "A Tale of Two Sisters," which also has a pretty difficult plot to follow, "Pulse" clears up very little in the end and left me feeling frustrated, confused, and indifferent to the characters' efforts. My final statement about the plot was its inconsistency. At first, it seemed that the story concerned the overflowing ghost world and that their way to escape was the Internet. It's a damn original idea. I like this. But as the plot continues, as holes in the plot and unexplained events come up, it seems the director has turned to an apocalyptic narrative (as evidenced by the end) that has not been clear enough to to be executed. <br /> <br /> I realize the sadness of the shots and the setting chosen for the viewer to feel lugubrious and isolated, but the gloom of the film was only intensified by the grainy frame and shady. I'll admit that the film was surreal, but my attention may have been lost. <br /> <br /> The actions of some characters are a little ridiculous too, and maybe if the story interested me more, I could have suspended even more incredulity, but also myself, being as unmotivated as some of the characters. As I mentioned before, the logic behind some characters was absent and contributed to the inconsistency of the plot. Perhaps it was due to the incoherence of the plot that the characters make questionable things. To be honest, I do not really care. <br /> <br /> The acting game was correct. Certainly nothing exceptional but nothing horrible either. No exception to mention on either side of brilliant or simply awful. <br /> <br /> Now, I'll stop ringing so sour and mention that there have been a handful of scary moments. One towards the end especially if there were more, I would have appreciated this film (almost) completely. I thought that every time the website was posted, it was quite disturbing, as well as some of the ghostly encounters that our two main characters face. The things going on between these horrible clashes were too dull, disconcerting and "WTF" for me to really appreciate them. <br /> <br /> Now, let's move on to something about the DVD itself ... The Magnolia "Pulse" comes with subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are off. They are not told at the right moment of the character's speech. It may seem annoying, but it bothers me a bit and can bother others. I think this is the only North American version of the film, so you have to either process or watch dubbing (NEVER WATCH DUBBING !!!). I tried to like the movie, that's right. I wanted this film to respect the hype ... but unfortunately, it fell flat for me. If you are looking for other scary Asian movies, I can recommend "Audition", "Shutter", "A Tale of Two Sisters", "Strange Circus" and "Marebito", all of which are more my palette.
