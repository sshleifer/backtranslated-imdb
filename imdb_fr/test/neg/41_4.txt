The film begins with a cult leader trying to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting his rebirth as the sun hits them in the desert. Reanhauer (Bill Roy) believes wholeheartedly in his power and is so upset that he collapses in front of what appeared to be a heart attack. Unable to keep him alive, all the doctors, nurses and nurses involved in this case are sentenced for attack by Reanhauer's demonic spirit invading Sherri's (Nurse's) curvaceous body (Jill Jacobson, big breast), targeting her. on each of them, thus avenging her. Forced against his will, not remembering inflicting such harm, Sherri's body, the host's body, kills selected victims. Luckily, Sherri's colleague Tara (Marilyn Joi) started a blissful relationship with a blind patient, Marcus Washington (Prentiss Molden), a former American football player whose mother was a voodoo practitioner. Thanks to the knowledge of Marcus, transmitted by her mother, Tara discovers the possession and the possibility of saving Sherri before murdering everyone without her knowledge. Meanwhile, Dr. Peter Desmond (Geoffrey Land), Sherri's lover, worries about his current state and well-being. <br /> <br /> Well, it was my first film about Al Adamson and I have to agree with his detractors. film alone, he seems to hold them together with paperclips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see the mind take control of Sherri is beyond horrible and rather laughable. A bit of soft silly stuffing, a demonic possession (Sherri actually talks about another voice when she's possessed), with naughty nurse behavior (the three movie-centered nurses are all very sexually active) and free -spirited) and a little violence / gore. The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with bland dialogues of a rather banal cast. The sexual situations are not so difficult and Al often shoots them without revealing anything. The film looks embarrassing, cheap and there are no chills, although the glossy score (which looks like something from Dark Shadows) helps a bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass (... as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac, even if she will even fuck a crazy patient, always complaining of diseases he does not really have, with enough hair on chest to declare it Neanderthal) Adamson's film, though fragile, is quite coherent (it seems that he seldom directs films that are). Overall, the film seems to cost $ 5 and Adamson simply can not overcome budget restrictions (or, in my opinion, create a rather unpleasant atmosphere because of a sometimes painstaking story and tedious scenes that do little for history). John F. Goff is the psychiatrist of the hospital who wants to engage Sherri, not believing in the idea that she is possessed, he quarrels constantly with Peter. I looked at the unrated "lost" version which, I guess, is the true version to look at of Nurse Sherri.
