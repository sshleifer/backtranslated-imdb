Altioklar: Master of Thieves. <br /> <br /> Watch a movie, steal some pieces, write a script ... It must be very easy to be a director in Turkey. I think Altioklar watched "Identity (2003)", "Saw (2004)", some series about crime, murder, etc. of the film. <br /> <br /> You can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie. It only took 10 minutes for me. He shouted "I am the murderer, I am the murderer". There is no mystery. <br /> <br /> Tamer Karadagli is the same (sux). Exaggerated imitators, a funny macho man. <br /> <br /> There is only one good thing in the film. The performances of Demet Evgar are very good. You can see the movie just for that.
