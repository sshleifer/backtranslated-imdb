To sum up, my group of friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorite blunders, conspiracy inconsistencies, weaknesses and other ridiculous aspects of this film. I found the story quite commonplace and the intrigues as underdeveloped as the embryos of dino still locked in the jar of shaving cream of Jurassic Park 1. The editing was mediocre and none of the characters aroused any sympathy or feeling . In short, this film lacked the suspense and thrill that the first film offered from the point of view of history. Even the new dinosaurs were rare (although I really liked the pterodactyls.) We received several brief snapshots of the new species and only 2 actually involved in the action. <br /> <br /> As a scientist and former childhood paleontologist, the lack of real scientific content (not that it must be realistic, but logically formed, that is, how they built the dinos in # 1 and the chaotic discussions of malcom) was also disappointing. <br /> <br /> In short, the film seemed to be an excuse to convince the dinos to return money. I hope that moviegoers will not fall back into this trap (although I apparently have it)
