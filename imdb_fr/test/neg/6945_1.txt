It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. They said it was the man's response to Waiting to Exphale ... All I'm going to say is that we really did not respond at all. I could not believe it was done. The director should choose another profession because he can not make a film. The script was not good. It made no sense and was very messy. The betting movies are way better than it was, and I was terribly disappointed to see the talented actor Terrence in this bad excuse for a movie. If I could go back in time, I would not go back to Media Play to never buy the movie, I would just keep it wrapped on a shelf, instead of wasting my time looking at it.
