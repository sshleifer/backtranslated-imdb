Rudolph Mat√©'s 1950 film gets a makeover for the '80s. Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid) is a college lecturer who has had a successful writing career but has now lost his life with his marriage. The initial exhibition embodies in the viewer's mind that everyone has something against him. Thus, when we learn that he has been poisoned, we are not surprised unless you know the original well. Dexter, after learning that he has less than 48 hours to live, decides to retrace his steps with the help of one of his students, Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan), but they discover that they meet many obstacles. <br /> <br /> The film starts promising in black and white, while Dexter stumbles in the rain towards the local police station where he wants to report a murder ... his, but the huey style beat lewis The 80s that accompanies this scene serves only to remove any feeling of tension and tells the viewer that it will be bad enough, it's only a question of how serious? Of course, we soon use the old medium flashback, but the film now uses full Technicolor. There are some short homages to Black, while the embracing couple stands in front of a Venetian blind, but there is really nothing here to recommend, the depictions are awful, Ryan doing in particular his usual dizzying blonde with a smiling routine . The film is a lazy attempt to put some useless work into a well-finished movie theater, obviously trying to cash in on a Body Heat audience, the apparent results are definitely intended for an adolescent audience and of course, they're welcome. 4/10
