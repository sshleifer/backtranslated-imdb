It's been over 30 years now, but I still remember this movie was the worst I've ever seen. I would have thought that during this period, something worse would have been filmed, but I was wrong. I just finished watching "STARSHIP TROOPERS" and the film became very close, but it was even more entertaining than "POOR COW".
