Someone said that WEBS looked a lot like an episode of SLIDERS, and I agree. Spoilers: I never liked Sliders' actors and I rarely saw them except when nothing was better. WEBS is the kind of movie to see if you have no other choice. Read a book. WEBS has these kinds of TV actors who seem to be present as part of their PROBATION or Work Release program. Some low-budget television movies have at least enthusiastic actors. WEBS actors feel they are getting the minimum wage and working on a clock. They have this desperate look, "The-Paycheck-Better-Not-Bounce". The queen spider looks great, except that it is rarely seen and there are no other spiders (and no webs). The Spider Queen bites people and they become zombies of spiders, which means they try to keep their eyes wide open when they attack humans. Humans argue with each other for a variety of reasons and are not friendly. After meeting all the "humans", I would have recommended a school of charm for the characters. All WEBS made me feel was APATHY. I was numb by the characters and hoped for interesting gore and special effects. The gore was minimal and the special effects were reserved for the ugly queen of spiders, which looked great. If WEBS had a group of spider creatures eating humans, it would have been more entertaining. Apparently, they could only plan "spider zombies". WEBS is a sad entry into the field of SPIDER oriented films. This could be considered the worst movie of Spider, because Eight Legged Freaks had excellent special effects.
