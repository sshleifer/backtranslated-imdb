I saw a good excerpt from this film, which I'll talk about later, then the list of actors, and I thought I might as well try. Roughly, an unlucky bartender, Randy (Matt Dillon), his arrogant cousin, Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and detective Dehling (John Goodman) all have something in common, they've seen the girl of their dreams. (whether married or not), and they would do anything to please him and be with her, even to die. All three met her / seen "one night at McCool's," the bar Randy worked in, they do not know each other, but they can not help but think about Fetal Woman Jewel Valentine (Liv Tyler from Lord of the Rings ). All three tell their stories to someone who, he hopes, will listen to their stories, which are quite intense and revealing. Randy speaks to Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas, co-producer of the film), then to Psychologist / Psychiatrist Dr. Green (Reba McEntire) and Dehling to Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins). They confess all the details of what they wanted to do, their sexual contact with her, and end up being all together in the same place, all resolved to be with her and all involved in the final shootout that leaves a dead, a s 'running away (and ending up dying) and a stunned, and the unexpected guy she chose (but at the same time obvious, because it's Douglas obsessed with sex). Also starring Andrew Dice Clay in Utah / Elmo and Sandy Martin in Bingo Woman. If I had to pick a favorite moment, that would certainly be what was mentioned in number 11 with Cool Hand Luke in The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, where Tyler copies the woman who washes the car with foam on herself, and in front of Goodman very sexy! Apart from that, not the most memorable movie. Okay!
