** SPOILERS ** The title of the movie having the name of the killer fish twice, we do not expect to see it in action attack, tear and devour almost everyone in the cast of characters. Instead, you have to wait until the film is almost finished for you to preview the Piranahs. Even then, all you see is the water boiling and stirring as a poor individual disappears assuming he is devoured, whole and alive, by the fish. <br /> <br /> The movie "Piranha Piranha" starts with this scary Piranha on the screen while the credits begin to drop, but **** SPOILER ****, it's the only time in the movie you never have the opportunity to see the killer fish or fish that you never have the chance to see a Piranha, this is the movie again. What you see is a travelogue of Venezuela and its inhabitants and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon basin. With many beautiful and breathtaking pictures of landscapes, people and wildlife, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of story that has to do with this great white hunter Caribe, William Smith, which ironically means Piranha in his mother tongue, is this the title of the movie "Piranha Piranha "really meant? "Caribe Caribe"! Caribe is played by legendary Hollywood biker Hell's Angles and tough guy William Smith. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, this trio of American tourists Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry, Peter Bown and Ahna Capri and their American guide Art Green, Tom Simcox, go to the Venezuelan jungle for a tourist visit . Terry takes pictures and sends them home. Terry is terrified by the weapons as we learn that a girl saw her father cut off with a firearm. Even when Art saves her life by using a bullet when she is attacked by a diamond rattlesnake, Terry almost gives her the belt to get a gun; that he had promised not to take with him during the trip. <br /> <br /> At a halt or bar in the jungle, the three people clash with Caribe as we first saw a monkey in the jungle at the beginning of the movie. Caribe is more than enjoying the three with her knowledge of the jungle and her half-cooked philosophy of life and death, as well as her ability to get them where they are heading to the local diamond mines located at bottom of the Amazon basin. <BR /> <br /> Even though it's a bit strange at first, the guy is so prisoner of himself that he does not seem to notice that there are people around him, Caribe proves to be an adorable and friendly guy indulging in a long and friendly motorcycle race through the swamps and jungle with Art. Caribe even shows Terry, who at one point in the movie nearly broke his head, the good sides of hunting and game hunting that he says do not really die, but are now part of him after have killed! A little crazy, but we must admit that this guy has imagination. <br /> <br /> It's much later in the film that, for some strange reason, it may be the cheap drink he drank, Caribe suddenly goes crazy and becomes homicide by attacking and raping Terry and then murdering his enraged brother and feeding him to the deadly Piranha. Trying to flee the madman, then forced to fight with him, Art is brutally beaten by Caribe, who struggles wildly, leaving him almost unconscious. Just when Caribe is about to finally kill Art, he is shot by Terry who, after knowing what this crazy job was, finally decided that guns were really essential and had to be used to kill at very rare but life-saving opportunities. <br /> It's worth watching, if it's worth watching, only for the scenery and nothing else. It's just a shame that the movie has to advertise like a deadly fish, or Piranha, a horror movie where, if it were honest to itself, it could have been a jungle adventure movie. more or less average with Smith, he really builds it, playing Tarzan Venezuelan, not African, Jungle
