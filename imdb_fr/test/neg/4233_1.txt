I saw this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival and I would not recommend it. It lasts two and a half hours during which not much happens at a frantic pace. <br /> <br /> The main characters lack charisma and personality. Nobody smiles at all during the movie (I would not do it either if I had their life) and although Domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite, she does not seem to enjoy sex at all. <br /> <br /> The whole experience is depressing and cumbersome, the director lingering on each scene in such a way as to drive me crazy rather than strike me with the beauty of his technique. <br /> <br /> Too many questions remained in my mind: why does he sniff the head of the Algerian man? Why is he levitating? What is he looking over the parcel fence? Why does he kiss Joseph? Why did we go to see this waste instead of ordering another bottle of wine at Bouzy Rouge?
