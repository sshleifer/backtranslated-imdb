Rented (free rent, thank God), this film would have been filmed in my hometown .... could have been filmed in a tunnel, whatever! Dark ninety percent of the time, and just a terrible attempt at a low-budget movie, which can be good if done right. In a word about a group of young adults witnessing the fall of a meteor, then the prey of aliens on a lighthouse island, assisted by the guardian and his wife. Analysis: <br /> <br /> - acting = dreadful <br /> <br /> - writing = uninspired <br /> <br /> - history = made a million times before with different settings <br /> > Production values ​​= agreement (lighting) for the budget <br /> <br /> - effects (creature, digital, other) HORRIBLE, VERY GOOD SOOTHING LOOK <br /> <br /> You get thus the essence of it. To add insult to injury, the end credits have some shooting blunders - really now ...... who cares! Distributed by a shocked Universal company, he would do it even after seeing it. <br /> <br /> Finally, try "CREEP". Small budget, but well written, well played and rather, well, terrifying!
