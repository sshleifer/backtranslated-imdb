The basic premise of this film is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay, except this person. And that a man who likes the tunes of show, who tastes good and has a neat appearance MUST be a homosexual. Yes, the film is funny in places, but the basic principle is that it is homophobic and insulting that the whole film collapses into something that is painful enough to endure. The performances, especially Joan Cusak and Kevin Kline, are very good.
