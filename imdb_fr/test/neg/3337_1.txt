The film contains a very short scene of Deneuve in a bathtub. She looks absolutely gorgeous for a 56-year-old lady, but it's the only saving grace of the movie. Otherwise, the script is devoid of meaning and without motivation, and the main actress has no appeal to Deneuve. The director has obviously seen too many movies by Peter Greenaway and Pola X appears as an imitation of the Greenaway style by a student, without any of his inspiration.
