I went with friends and one of my friends, mom, thinking it would be a good way to start the spring break, but the movie was horrible. We all agree that it should not have been PG-13. More like a R material. Lots of sex dialogues, expletives and references to boy and girl parts (under the waist). Not worth the time or the money. Urge you not to go or rent it at the exit. If you end up going there, do not take smaller children. Not the kind of movie to see in family!

Especially when they make fun of Steven Hawking.
