Parcel synopsis: Los Angeles in the future. The crime is kept under control by Core Trackers, Android killers sent by the US computerized justice system to execute the guilty. The secret service agent, Eric Phillips, prevents the aggression of his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the founder of the USCJS), by the Union for Human Rights, a group of anti-machine activists . Dilly tries to introduce Phillips into his private circle but the SS officer leaves after seeing Dilly cold-blooded a UHR officer. Dilly sends Core Trackers after him. Phillips joins the UHR group and helps them discover a plot involving Dilly. <br /> <br /> "Cyber ​​Tracker" is the first of a number of science fiction / action hybrids directed by Richard Pepin, co-founder of PM Entertainment, a central action film in 1990s. Pepin's other films include "Hologram Man", "T-Force", "The Silencers" and "Dark Breed". Pepin's films usually begin with a major action sequence that lasts about 10 minutes before allowing the plot to be played. The scenario of this film has some holes in the plot? the conspiracy that heroes attempt to put an end to reality is never clear. As far as acting is concerned, Don "The Dragon" Wilson can be difficult but can not act for beans, with little charisma. His co-stars are much better. Action scenes are the best choice of the movie. They give rise to impressive artillery fire, a large number of dead and not to one, but at three times during which a vehicle flies in the air, rocks and hits the ground, exploding. Visual effects line the cheap side and the score is unobtrusive and shrill.
