What shit this movie is. The script is simply non-existent. The film sometimes looks like a music video. But it can not even be so since the soundtrack does not really match. Pathetic way to combine action and rap. You might think it's a recipe for a successful movie ... here it fails miserably. The dialogues in this movie just kill me. The scene where Harlan is interrogated by a policeman is simply pitiful. In general, recent Seagals films are hard to see. What happened to the guy? I know he's old, but can not he convince "Hollywood" to leave him a decent script or something? Is there a lack of dough for his escapades in India that he takes all that they serve him?
