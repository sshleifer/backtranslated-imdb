Gordon Scott with his well-coiffed hair, his hourglass and his strange English pidgin must be the worst of all Tarzans. As for the other actors of this disorder, they are at the same level as any grade 4 drama class at the elementary level. I've seen used car dealers in TV ads that can do a better job. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (the dull Eve Brent) find her lip pencil and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I realize that these were made for kids but wow! The plot seemed ok, but the director should have asked more of his actors. I realize that even Weissmuller's films have some flaws, but this one seemed so "low budget".
