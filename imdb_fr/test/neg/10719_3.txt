This film is perhaps one of the least original and funniest films I've seen in a long time. To be fair, I did not expect a revolutionary comic formula, but I expected at least to be entertained. With such expectations, how could I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, maybe my favorite actor (not sarcasm), just stomped the water in this film. He seems to be temporarily back to his funny roots and to create a character identical to that of Fletcher Reede of Liar Liar. This new character, Dick Harper (aka Fletcher 2.0), is a poorly rendered puppy and poorly written. If you find yourself smiling looking at this pitiful and essentially boring character, it's probably because Carrey is trying to bring him a third dimension. Carrey's weird pose becomes humorous clumsy - and finally sad. <br /> <br /> Tea Leoni as Jane does little more than provide the Abbott at Carrey Costello. I usually find Tea Leoni refreshing and underused, but not in this case. Jane Harper could have played easily between all actresses from thirty to forty-five, and it is in this non-specificity that the character of Jane becomes uninteresting to watch. It simply does not have any distinguishing features except that it follows the general theme of the film, which seems to be the case ... Wait, no, this movie has no theme. Unless you count "Big Business Is Evil" as the theme. I thought it was more obvious. <br /> <br /> Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin offer credible performances (although tired), but neither of them seems to be really invested in the role he plays. It is very clear that Alec Baldwin was working so hard to play his role as the sinister C.E.O. as he starts to eat a sandwich (which he seems to be doing a lot lately). <br /> <br /> Slight tangent, but has Alec Baldwin played in roles that have not forced him in recent years to be a powerful fool in a costume? <br /> <br /> Anyway, take my advice if you have not yet witnessed the horror: save your money. This is the one who catches HBO in a few months. Dick and Jane are present, but there is no fun to have.
