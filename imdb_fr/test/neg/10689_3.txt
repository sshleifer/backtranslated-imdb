Given everyone's budget and inexperience, life could have been worse. Jamal wants to be Chris Tucker (which I've always found very annoying), as noted by a previous commentator, but Peanut (Edward D. Smith), while some of his (on) reactions go way too long (problem of a director), has relatively subtle and amusing moments, as when he tries to explain to Jamal the good way to smoke a joint with a friend. Throughout his career, he is generally more relaxed and optimistic than Jamal, which could have been the seed of a beautiful exploration of contrasts in the relationship, but did not develop very far. <br /> <br /> But the inexperience of the writer / director / director photo / etc. is not an excuse for his inattention. Has he ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Has he ever heard of a close up? Even Ed Wood could do a close up. I do not think it's really a budget issue. I could only give a general description of what one of the actors looks like, not just because of the lack of close-ups, but the lighting ...! Lights for outdoor shots can be too expensive, but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper! To do this, it would have been necessary to bring the camera closer to keep the reflector away from the shot, while helping to solve the problem of close-up. If it's too technical, you can return the actors so that they are not in the shade, or you can expose for the shadows, and if it had not been shot in LA I would say to enjoy the cloudy days . It goes without saying that the movies that this one steals are all, with the possible exception of Weekend with Bernie, better than this one, but Livin 'tha Life would have left a much better impression if the spectator had not not all seen. the right way to get a glimpse of what the human element could have been. <br /> <br /> PS The scene in the barbershop is just stupid.
