!!! Spoiler alert !!! <br /> <br /> The fact is, I did not think this movie had an end to spoil ... I only started to look at it in the middle after Matt got into Sarah's body but then I became fascinated by the quirk of the plot, even for a Channel 5 movie ... and I really could not see how Matt was going to end up happy. And his fiancee? At one point, he seemed to want to go with his best friend, surely disgusting and false ... and then the whole thing 'oggi oggi oggi' does not work like a captivating slogan, it's ridiculous ... go 'surely he can not just come back to life? and yet how can he live as a woman? and then the film has just overcome that by ending without explaining anything at all !!!!! What are you talking about ??? I was so angry, lost an entire hour of my life for no reason !!! :) but was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, so, swings and roundabouts
