This film is really bad. <br /> <br /> Try to stay awake for 5 minutes while observing this fool on a nice girl (Joan Woodbury) who gets into hell because she needs money (and because she lazy to take a job from friends after offering it). Alan Ladd was supposed to be the star of this film, but he was not found during the first half hour and when he shows up, he stands like a constipated mannequin. A real failure with enough chatty scenes and unlikely characters (as stupid) to make you wish someone shot someone, like very fast. <br /> <br /> Bring a pillow.
