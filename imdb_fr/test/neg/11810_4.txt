Ken Burns' "Baseball" is a decent documentary ... it clearly shows the origin of the game, an excellent representation of the beginnings and heroes of baseball. This film has a lot to offer to all baseball fans ... That said, the film has several flagrant flaws. <br /> <br /> 18 hours, it's just too long to attract the attention of the man. It is clear that Burns has extended his film to the "nine-sleeve" concept. It's not even 18 o'clock close ... the rhythm of each segment is slow, almost morose ... music always nostalgic and nostalgic. Is baseball never exciting and fun? Why are each player and his or her achievements presented in the form of a tragedy? Speaking from head to foot, every turn turns into emotional sorrow, yakking on baseball as a metaphor, baseball in America, psychology and baseball theology ... enough! This is syrupy, mawkish dreck. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee hokum he has already sold us. Ken Burns uses the national anthem as the theme of the series and manages to play "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" so many times that you risk throwing up. We understand, man. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Burns is a fake neo-Hollywood liberal. So he probably spends a third of the film in the black leagues ... these segments are dedicated to chastising the whites of yesterday for not being as open-minded as Kenny is today. For shame! He chides baseball for being separated in the thirties and forties, but does not realize that America was isolated at that time! Burns falls madly in love with Buck O'Neil, a former black league player, and drools over every sequence in which old O'Neil poetically tells his days at the game. Nonsense ... <br /> <br /> He would have been better to burn with an adult to help change his creation. "Baseball" is a human rights propaganda disguised as American. It is clear that Burns is not a baseball fan ... otherwise, he would know that we watch games laugh and applaud, without crying or reciting monologues ... do you listen, Mr. Burns? There is no crying in baseball.
