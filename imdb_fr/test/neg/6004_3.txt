A scam with bare face of Se7en that is not suitable for cleaning his shoes. The word "predictable" must have been coined for such an occasion. Lambert is in wood, as always (his moments of emotion are laughable, just like his accent). The "climax" is not at all what we got, because we had so many signals and, in the end, we are simply immune to flesh, rotting and others. In short, a real mess.
