Shirley Temple's films for Twentieth Century Fox are not insignificant because they are of poor quality (Darryl F. Zanuck has supervised most of them, after all); they do not retain a "classic" stature among moviegoers, mainly because they are weighed down by the syrupy optimism of Hollywood at the time of the Depression. The audience of the 1930s was appeased by the pleasure of seeing a girl of the weak, often orphaned sun, which made the adults look silly by comparison (they became angry and wringing their hands while she danced away from her problems). Seeing this many years later, Temple's vehicles are barely coping with history (always helped by musical sequences to reinforce the content), and its timing (always too perfect) and its exaggerated reactions could leave most Modern spectators turn their eyes. No one could be blamed for his exasperation at Temple's performance here (lines screaming above his lungs) or the perversity of his dance steps, sashaying with a crowd of sailors for "At Codfish Ball". Still, the phantasmal aspect of this particular story, filmed in 1924 from the book of Laura E. Richard, is enough to captivate those who are immersed in the appropriate saccharinous spirit. It seems that Shirl was removed from a shipwreck by a government-appointed lightkeeper, but when a Public Affairs Council watchdog finds out that the tyke is not at school, she threatens to remove the child. It does not matter if the prune-faced officer has any idea that Temple is not raised correctly (the woman is almost immediately turned into a nasty villain); it can be seen immediately that Temple can fend for herself, taking care of herself and her elderly guardian (as well as the local widow who holds the Captain in her place). Temple is not the only one to repeat too much; The month of January of Guy Kibbee arouses strong reactions and one wonders often if he did not film them all in one day. The dialogue is imbued with metaphors of the waterfront ("You can not rush a trout!" ... "Well, do not give up the ship!), And something about the company seems strangely pixelated. * from *** *
