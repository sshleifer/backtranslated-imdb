It's really just terrible. Quaid is more active than Shatner. The part where Elvis comes in and says "You can have it all" kills everything that could have been good in this film which is bad enough already. The drug was completely covered in snow, the only thing that had a connection with his life was the marriage between his cousin and his cousin. Quaid does not look like Lewis either and has dark roots and eyebrows. I wish it could be redone in the future with someone who is not looking so hard. A bigger budget would not hurt and maybe more about real life. I was very very disappointed with Quaid. Do not watch this movie or you will be too.
