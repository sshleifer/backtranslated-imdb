I enjoyed the caricatures of Mr. Magoo I saw while growing up. And I appreciate the comic skills of Leslie Nielson. So, I thought that this wedding had to produce a funny child. <br /> <br /> I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible. I do not remember a single funny moment. It's one of two or three times (in hundreds of movies over the years) that I wanted to get my money back. You will leave this film discouraged because you will never have the time to use it better. In a comedy, the plot must attract the viewer and serve as a frame for gags. This plot does not do either. It's just a little there, panting like a stranded fish.
