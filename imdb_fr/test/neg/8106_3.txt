The mishmash of Jimmy Durante organizing a big party for everyone in Hollywood. No major star appears - we have the Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I did not recognize anyone else - they were probably unknown (for good reason). The film contains boring jokes and really awful songs and choreographies. The only things that prevent this from being a total disaster are the "battle" of Laurel & Hardy with Lupe Velez and a beautiful Disney color cartoon called "The hot chocolate soldier". It is a beautiful colorful cartoon that gives a boost to the film. Otherwise, the film is a huge problem. There is no credited director - what does that tell you?
