After taking advantage of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi, I was looking forward to seeing this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and seeing what direction it had taken. Rarely has a film failed so spectacularly failed at the height of its predecessors and gone astray? Although it attempts to represent the "civilized war" in the form of sport, science, commerce and other forms of competition, it lacks global reach and even themes developed consistently by its predecessors. War is chaos, but even wars have a purpose in mind and this film had a loose structure and unclear goals. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi presents a flaw because it is a chaotic mix of images that does not really develop its theme. On the positive side, he judiciously avoided using some of the emblematic images of the wars of the last century. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is also so insular that many times I remembered that I was not watching an advertisement promoting the American way of life. Perhaps this insularity reflects the ongoing "war on terror". When representing "sport as a war", the logos of the leading teams ensured that the United States was described as the winner. As a result, he missed the opportunity to describe some of the many sports in the world and to show that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilized warfare. <br /> <br /> Apart from the news film, the images seemed to have been shot on a New York budget and there was little recognition of "life at war" in the rest of the world . The gallery of faces (waxworks) evokes only the existence of important characters outside the United States. The authors understood that globalization did not mean Americanization. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass's soundtrack was very similar to all the other Philip Glass scores I've heard (with the possible exception of Koyaanisqatsi) and can, at best, be described. as "harmless" do not add, nor diminish, the chaotic image.
