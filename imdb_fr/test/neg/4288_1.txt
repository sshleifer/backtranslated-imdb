A frightening and almost painful psychological thriller, every aspect being appalling. <br /> <br /> The combined talents of the best actors Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman are totally futile, and if they give good performances, one wonders why bothered. Mark Kasdan's scenario is a complete disaster, and Martin Campbell has the story popping up everywhere, but if you can not follow him, take it as a blessing. There are far too many unnecessary and crazy scenes that simply do not make sense. Jerry Goldsmith's music is not a big help either. <br /> <br /> Even if there was potential in the plot, the approach of the director Campbell completely ruined it. To avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Monday, February 26, 1996 - Video
