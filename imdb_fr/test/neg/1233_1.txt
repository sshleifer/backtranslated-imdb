I just watched Lonesome Dove, Return To Lonesome Dove, Streets Of Laredo and Dead Man's Walk. Everything is excellent. This sad piece of bric-a-brac is cheap and misunderstood. <br /> <br /> In the previous series, Captain Call and Gus McCrae present themselves as respectable cowboys. Despite the fact that Caption Call is played by a different actor each time, he quickly convinced me. In Dead Man's Walk, boys are credible as the youngest versions of Texas experienced rangers. In Comanche Moon, they are only two or three chubby rednecks. I had to stop watching. <br /> <br /> I guess many of the rave reviews of this show were written by the people who created this stinky pile. It's a sorry ending for an excellent franchise.
