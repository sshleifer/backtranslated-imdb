First, I have not seen "Silence of the Lambs" yet ... but, I think I would have fallen ill if I had seen it before that song. Not the macabre violence, but the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was very good like Hannibal and I really thought he was as psychotic as he was playing but, according to the reaction of the audience around me, the movie was filled with shots of "Silence" that left me lost to some points. where others laughed at what was on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now, I heard that the film would be very horrible and that the director wanted to make reproaches ... he did it ... but, only in 2 sequences? I mean, if you want it to be horrible and so horrible that you're going to play the movie from that ... you need more than 2 sequences ... I always see it as a movie must become either this jewel film that will ultimately take you to another place and time, or go beyond it (which is usually done in bad taste). But, this film left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep sometimes. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are the stars of the movie, right? Well, with the exception of Hopkins, I did not feel like that. Who cared about the stupid Italian police officer? I certainly do not have. So, really, the movie has a big hole that talks about a guy who dies anyway. I mean, go .. who cares? <br /> <br /> In summary, the film is good if you want to see Lector and Starling again, but if you want a good thriller .. You will jump once and you may be disgusted twice. It depends on your level. <br /> <br /> If we think of the money that this film will bring back, there will probably be another "Hannibal" and this film will probably not be on video until the autumn. If you have to see it, wait, save $ 3.50 - $ 4.00 and get it on video. Do not spend a lot of money on this movie.
