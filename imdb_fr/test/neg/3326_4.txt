I thought this movie was too absurd for me to finish watching it. The premise was too stupid and predictable. I did not go far in the film. <br /> <br /> Let me see. She is obviously older than the taxi driver (unless she is much younger than she is). He is black and she is white. She earns more money than he (he is only a taxi driver). It is one of the 3 most statistically bankrupt unions in society and we are supposed to claim a chance in hell. She'd better marry the guy she does not like. <br /> <br /> I only watched it partially because I like MJW as an actor. His game was superb. Hers, meh! It was ok but the premise is too silly. I did not see the end. I could not go, so I do not know if it ended differently from what I had predicted. I can not imagine a black woman loving this movie. There is something sickening about watching a black man look after a white woman like that. And an old man to that. PLEASE! Not in the real world!
