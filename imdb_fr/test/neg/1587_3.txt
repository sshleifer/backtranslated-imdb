(Spoilers) "Cash Crop" goes a bit like this. The lucky farmers grow the pot to make ends meet. A DEA officer blows downtown. Farmers hide the pot. A DEA officer leaves the city. End of the story. <br /> <br /> This film offers strong performances from second level actors, a poor direction and a fairly average scenario ... but it has no history. And since history is the foundation of every drama, "Cash Crop" is a total failure. Too boring to recommend.
