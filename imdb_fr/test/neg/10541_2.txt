Yes, long ago, it became a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Type of. Well, it looks more like an airport mixed with a college, but there are a lot of guys wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess that way, it's like a jail. Not really anyway. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is admitted to prison, he queues and goes to a different line to talk to his friend, as if he was waiting for security check at the airport. Then, too quickly, he and his friend punch and slam around two security guards. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. You assault a correctional officer in a federal prison, they will shoot you. Ja Rule would have been hit about 30 times before throwing his second punch. Oh, and there are guys wearing hats and bandanas, etc. In prison. Federal prison. <br /> <br /> You can not dress like this in most American high schools. <br /> <br /> About Ja Rule, I must say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone on earth, including Ja Rule himself, must have been 50 Cent. Just before watching this movie, I saw one of these TV shows about the biggest celebrity feuds of all time. Number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 Cent, who had lived the life of a thug for real, and Ja Rule. Who did not have. Every time I saw Ja Rule on the screen, the only thing I could imagine was 50 cents laughing. Ja Rule looks like a 9 year old kid every time it appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's go back to the plot. It's funny. Sasha is an FBI agent who works under cover and agrees to be sentenced to prison in order to support the criminal organization. He is sentenced to five years and this old line between determination and stupidity disappears instantly. After that, nothing matters in the film, it becomes a series of meaningless action sequences, most of which are not even well choreographed. <br /> <br /> Oh, why not, a helicopter crashes on the roof of "New Alcatraz" at one point, accidentally releasing all the detainees. And what are they doing? They all came out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without even a basket. They had a bullet, but it does not matter. The scene is so stupid that they could just as easily have played hopscotch. <br /> <br /> A guy is sentenced to be the first person to be executed in Alcatraz's ultramodern execution room, obviously not for stealing $ 200 million in gold, but for failing to report where he was hidden once he was caught. <br /> <br /> Here, think, my friends. If you can not get information from someone, kill him. It's a great way to learn the truth! Some gangs enter the prison planning to stop the execution and locate the $ 200 million themselves. <br /> <br /> Oh, the $ 200 million is in gold brick. I doubt they imagined how difficult it would be to turn that into an exchangeable currency. <br /> <br /> There is also the issue of the prison guard. It's a hard vato that thinks he's a hardcore chollo in the neighborhood, which reminds me of a joke. I've already seen this comedian talk about people in California who went out of their way to talk to each other, to stay, to live at home and to do all kinds of nonsense. The actor says that these people go to Mexico and say to themselves, "Oh my god, people live there, it's like a total hut!" <br /> <br /> The best is when the US Supreme Court justice arrives and this guy tells him that his men can not carry their weapons in his prison. "I do not care if she's a US Supreme Court judge!" <br /> <br /> This woman could crush him like a grape and he thinks he is in charge. Ha. <br /> <br /> And besides, the judge of the Supreme Court who is taken hostage in the film tells the woman that she is 53 years old. It's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> The only good scene of the film is that of the prison where Ja Rule is slapped like a cotton bag by a little Asian woman. It's the funniest thing I've seen in a movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> You know, I work for the company that produced this movie (why I watched the movie), and I still have nothing positive to say about it, at the exception of course the scene where Ja Rule is spanked by this Asian woman. <br /> <br /> Then read my account of Malena and you will understand. See how I sometimes disagree with professional film critics such as Roger Ebert, but in his review of this film, Ebert wrote something that I totally agree with: "I imagine the ruffles of inertia. " to the MPAA welcoming their good day's work by assigning the title "Half Past Dead" to PG-13 after giving the anti-arms film "Bowling for Columbine" to R. "<br /> <br /> , guys.
