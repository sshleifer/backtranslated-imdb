Since my first VHS recorder, it is customary to bring together many of the incarnations of Charles Dickens' old chestnut. This year, I recorded this one as well as "Karroll's Christmas". Fortunately, when it was broadcast on the Hallmark Channel at the unpleasant time of 3 am, I avoided having to publish advertisements. It was, however, it is only saving grace. <br /> <br /> The writing was terribly boring and there was almost no intelligent scene to prevent it from being anything more than a tiny sooper like Beverly Hills 90210. In this one, a good man who has been put aside for his celebrity seems to be the only logical explanation of his transformation into a hostess of the Scrooge-like TV show. That ruined Dinah Manoff who just plays the goddess of the bitch to the other goddess of the bitch Tori Spelling (who, by the way, had more layers of paint on her face than some colonial homes) and Bill Shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this other dreary adaptation. <br /> <br /> Some of the best opportunities are spoiled, as are the ghost entries. Aunt Marla's entrance could have been spectacularly funny in the hands of an honest writer, but this Christmas turkey did not have one, of course. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling may be an adorable person, but she has all the acting skills of a model, and that makes a bad show all by herself. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was good to see Gary Coleman working again, but the script gives him absolutely nothing to do except roll his eyes and start a really lame dialogue. <br /> <br /> the most annoying was that Scroogedom's transformation into Tori "soft and light" is as convincing as a passionate curator. Now, if anyone wants to write the ultimate story of George Bush and Karl Rove in Scrooge, we may have a refreshing change from the usual Christmas Carol bad clones. <br /> <br /> I guess if you're a fan of Mrs. Spelling and / or 90210, this could be your cup of Christmas joy. I would prefer a good scotch and a cold beer to wash it myself. This one, I'll throw it maybe before he's been with me here for a very long time. <br /> <br /> God saves us all!
