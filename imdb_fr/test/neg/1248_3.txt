20 people ranked this! This urn was better filled than a Christmas turkey! Speaking of turkey, here is a traditional story that hopes to take advantage of the current craze for poker - without success. Entirely told in linear flashback, and when I say "said", I speak of TALKED TO DECESH, this film never leaves a sufficient image if the words can be used to expose. <br /> <br /> Stu Unger's fascination with children and the cards The associations with thugs may seem like interesting films, but the director manages to lick their lives. At no time did I feel any sympathy for Unger, a card genius who threw everything into other forms of play where he was not as competent. Of course, this leads, as we go through THREE musical montages, to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs, the loss of family and finally its redemption (in a way). Big yawn!
