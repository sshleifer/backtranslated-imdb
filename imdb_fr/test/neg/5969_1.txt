I think the film was a side, I recently saw it and I find the typical documentary of Western filmmakers, which was biased and without substance. The fact is that prostitution exists all over the world, not only in Tanzania and not because of this fish trade, but that prostitutes were present well before the arrival of Russian businessmen and other businessmen to Mwanza. Poverty is indeed endemic in Africa, not to mention Tanzania, and it is not because of the fish fillet trade. In fact, the fish industry has helped millions of people help their families in their daily lives. This film only tarnishes the image of this peace-loving country. Regarding the arms trade, the film could not confirm if there was any truth in the fact that if we look critically at the films, we doubt the authenticity of the filmmaker, it seems they are trying to prove their point of view by using a few characters made for anything really. Yes, Tanzania is a poor country. Yes, there are prostitutes and street children, but they are not the product of this activity. This is a common scenario in most poor countries of the world, even in the western world ... What a garbage load. <br /> <br /> The pilot himself talks about sending weapons to Angola, more than 2,000 km to the south of Tanzania. The war was going on in the DRC and miles away from Mwanza. The director could not provide proof of the origin of these weapons. From Mwanza to the DRC! <br /> <br /> In short, the films lack focus and respectability, it is quite easy to find the character anywhere in Africa and has nothing to do with the nightmare or the fish fillet of Darwin ... What a pile of garbage! <br /> <br /> The truth is that the Nile perch did not decimate all the other species in the lake contrary to what the film describes, and less than 25% of all the catches on Lake Victoria are exported, the rest is consumed locally. allows to obtain this right.
