A boring film about a wretched loser ... it's in short Factotum. Matt Dillon plays Henry Chinaski, alter ego of the author Charles Bukowski, on the novel from which the film is based. When we meet Chinaski, he may be a writer, but it is certainly not a success. He floats in life, getting fired on the job, without worrying a bit. The fact that he is still drunk may have something to do with his indifference. He meets a woman, Jan, played by Lili Taylor and a relationship ensues. Chinaski settles in Jan's apartment and instead of getting drunk alone, he can get drunk with someone else. Good time. Finally, he is tired of this relationship and Chinaski is doing his own thing. Unfortunately, he still can not keep a job so soon that he has gone bankrupt. At this point, Marisa Tomei arrives and for some reason, her character, Laura, decides to save this miserable drunken loser she does not even know. We soon meet Laura's acquaintances and the film goes into a kind of bizarre world with this rather eclectic band. Soon, Tomei and his friends are no longer in the picture and we find Chinaski, who drinks and his miserable life. There is still time with Jan, but mostly time wasted being a drunken loser and unemployed. And then the movie is over and not a moment too soon. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it seems infinitely longer as the film drags on. Nothing is happening. Nothing ever happens. If you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching a drink at Matt Dillon, this movie is for you. If you're looking for a captivating story, well-developed characters or whatever entertainment value, then you're in the wrong place. Dillon's performance is actually not bad. Too bad the movie around him is actually pretty bad.
