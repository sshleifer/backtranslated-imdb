I hated. I hate the pretentious, self-conscious inanity that pretends to be art. This movie is either stupidly stupid or incredibly stupid. After the first half hour, I quickly flipped through the DVD version and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over again. I became angry for spending hard-earned money on the sophomoric Clap-Trap. The tincture of sepia or blue dye does not make something a movie, let alone art.
