Also called BURNING MAN and FLASH FIRE for its various releases, this Australian production film shot in New South Wales has been a problem for its producers since the beginning because of several personality conflicts and the long filming time that uses its budget prematurely. allocated. The plot is sometimes well detailed, below the standard post-production finishes and excessive cuts that will put the case. Tom Skerritt plays Howard Anderson, an American "building enthusiast" who is building a tourist resort in the Blue Mountains region, while ignoring that his partner, Julian Fane (Guy Doleman) structure incomplete for ten million dollars , much more than its current value, and plans its destruction as a corollary to normal summer bush fires in order to collect a large sum by fraud. In accordance with this illicit ploy, Fane asks an arsonist to perform the incendiary act, a young man who happens to be also the boyfriend of Anderson's daughter, and because of the fact that the future resort is at heart of a critical area of ​​fire risk (a Julian hopes that his ignoble conception will be achieved without serious interference.) As the local insurance company victim of the crime belongs mainly to Fane, subscribers naturally skeptical of the police, Lloyd's of London, have deployed lead investigator George Engels (James Mason) to investigate the nature of the crime, made even more sinister by the death, possibly a homicide, of an insurance investigator (Wendy Hughes) who, at As a result of clues, the cause of the arson seems to be approaching, the film's setting is the week before Christmas, the cornerstone of the antipodes summer, a dramatic context, but the links within the story are not perfectly harmonized, resulting in the presentation of events difficult to follow for a viewer. problem aggravated by irregular editing, the heavy cut mentioned and poor sound quality and image. Skerritt's semi-comatose style and drone is fatally invalidated by this very low sound processing, but Mason is still as effective and enjoys the best dialogue with Hughes, as impressive as the investigator writes too early. Doleman wins laurels with his interpretation of the evil Julian Fane.
