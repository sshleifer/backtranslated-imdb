I had some expectations of this movie because 1. It was a production of Yash Raj. 2. When the songs first aired on television, they seemed catchy. 3. The distribution of stars (??!) Was new. Well, I have to tell you that I just could not get through this movie. Uday (with his red lips - what the make-up artists thought, ???!) Strives to look cool but fails miserably. I will not even start playing his role (if you can call him that). 'Queen of the cleavage' Tanisha with all her screams and delusions only makes you want to tear your hair out of frustration. I think Uday was slightly more tolerable than her! She badly needs to take acting lessons from her sister. The story is pathetic ... the same old, proven formula. Absolutely no originality. There is nothing to watch in this movie. I wonder why it was made in the first place!
