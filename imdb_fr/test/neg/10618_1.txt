I chose this film because it sounded like a pretty decent film, and I've always been a fan of foreign films. However, for someone who loves movies, I was surprised at how much I hate, hate, DESIRE this movie. <br /> <br /> Even if it aims to expose the lives of young men of the lower class in Lima and to the extent possible, the characters are desperately superficial and the public has absolutely no feeling towards them. <br /> <br /> Although the story revolves around M, he rarely speaks, and his dialect is, at best, incredibly dry and dull. <br /> <br /> *** Warning: some little spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Basically, the story revolves around a young man named M who was looking for jobs, but without success (He gets a job twice, but quits because he is "not for him", when you are poor, the last option you have is to be difficult). We spend a little time with his friends, who have the idea of ​​"having fun", raping a 14-year-old boy, stealing tires on a piece of car for a sack of cannabis, and many more slightly delayed activities. <Br /> <br /> M's friend announces a plan to earn $ 25,000 per room and settles in the US by sending Cocaine to Miami. When the drug lord gives them a job, we witness an extremely lame scene of three friends buying clothes at the mall with music in the background. We see them trying different clothes like little girls at $ 200 to shop, getting their hair cut, then strutting to look like gangsters (a character, Carlos, will ALWAYS wear sunglasses ... even the night). On the eve of their departure, the leader of the group leaves to speak to the lord of drugs, leaving M and his friend stupid. They party, take several samples of the drugs they are supposed to use and enter their old school, acting like animals and destroying everything on the horizon. <br /> <br /> The film ends when M tries to call his girlfriend. , who hangs up on him. The friends then proceed to the firing of the public telephone, which makes appear a group of children and an old armed man. The friend of M and Carlos, who is in charge of drugs, arrives on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him now. Then he goes off alone and gets shot by this old man. The police arrive and arrest M and his friends (but not the man who shot the man) and covers their deceased friend of newspapers while the music plays and the credits fade. <br /> <br /> **** End Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> I even watched this movie a second time, hoping to see a subtle compensation factor, but I did not do it. A total loss of 102 minutes. Although I must attribute to it the merit of being simple and not afraid of the annoying elements, the distribution, the acting and the general direction leave much, much, much to be desired. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion interested by a film that explores the problems that it was supposed, go rather praise the City of God (Cidade de Deus). Avoid this basket at all costs! You were warned !!
