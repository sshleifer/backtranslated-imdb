hair, the film based on the success of broadway, fails to achieve recoverable cinematographic qualities. you can not really take the coin and make it a movie. Whether rock music tries to see this film, it hurts the quality of a broadway show. worse than seeing sitcom reruns. musical fiasco, and I can not believe that others have judged it so high.
