This is a perfect example of the horror shit of the '90s. Nothing is scary here and the film is almost bloodless. Yes, there is violence, but everything is politically correct, as in a This is not safe I can say that I found it quite nice.However, the lack of originality really hurts "Voodoo". All in all, if you are part of the general public and that pseudo-horror movies like "Scream" are your favorite. like "Voodoo", but if you want something very macabre, avoid this movie.
