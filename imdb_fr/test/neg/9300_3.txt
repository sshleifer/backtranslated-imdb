Frank Falenczyk: It's not that I'm sorry for killing them; I'm sorry I killed them. <br /> <br /> Wow! You talk about a swing and a miss. You have an excellent cast and a beautiful plot with endless possibilities ... how are you doing ?! Well, apparently, John Dahl has found a way. With an atrocious scenario containing jokes as funny as an epidemic of malaria and a dialogue so painfully sterile that it does not make any of the characters friendly, "You Kill Me" could be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007. On a note positive, Ben Kinglsey provides another great performance as a Polish alcoholic batter trying to clean himself, but the material with which he has to work is shit. Tea Leoni is good as well as Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philip Baker Hall and the rest of the cast. I guess the best way to describe "You Kill Me" is a terrible movie with good performances. Grade: D +
