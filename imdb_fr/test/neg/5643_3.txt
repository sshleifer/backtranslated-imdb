I could not believe the original note I found when I watched this movie, 9.5? Unfortunately, it seems that I am not alone. <br /> <br /> The film is slow and boring. One of the sad aspects is that if the film had got a realistic score of about 5 or 6, the expectations would not have been that high. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not the case. So when I watch the film, see the poor story and play a role, I'm left with a score of 3/10. /> <br /> Vinnie Jones is superb in Lock's stock, but also in Snatch, and he's playing a big hard, but he should stick to that role. It's a bit like when Stallone and Schwarzenegger made comic movies, they just do not work. <br /> <br /> He can not play the main role either, he plays better as a supporter or otherwise. When he plays the lead role, his acting skills are too "in sight" and are not really good. Mean Machine is another good example.
