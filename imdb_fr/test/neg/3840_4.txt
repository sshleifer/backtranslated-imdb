Like most people watching this movie, I did it for stars Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper. Both are extremely underrated and, unfortunately, because of that, they have to make headlines. In this film, Hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a master singer and is offered the help of the mysterious Madsen. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually not as bad as it could have been. I saw both things much worse, both independently and working together (LAPD, horrible movie). The management was pretty bad and the script needed some re-writing, but both give the best performance possible with the proposed material. In addition, the end is strong enough, so you can say that the story had potential. But when a critical review of a movie is "it could have been much worse", it does not say much for the film itself. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a film that can be easily ignored if none of these actors attracts you. But if you're a fan of one or the other, give it a watch. Both give strong performances that surpass the obvious defects of the film. Believe me, the options are much worse.
