Well, the first thing I saw after watching the DVD box was "Best Screenplay" and thought it would be a good rental. WOW, I was wrong! I'm sure at one point there was a good film here, but after the incredibly mediocre values ​​of the video game and the actors, it ends up looking like a delayed half-brother to Tron. The first scene defines the general atmosphere of the whole movie. After five minutes, you'll wonder, "What's the hell I'm watching?", And it'll snowball from there. A horrible soundtrack that makes every song sound like Rob Zombie's "Dragula" completes that wretched piece of shit into a ridiculously bad movie. On a side note, # 3 most romantic quote in a movie - "I think you're the final destination."
