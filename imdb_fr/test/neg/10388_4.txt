I agree with the previous comment. Although Kristin Erikson played the possessed girl very well, I really do not think her character, Isabelle, was possessed. I have seen people taking psychotic breaks because of sexual abuse, and they never said whether the father actually abused her or not. I also had to revisit parts of the room to clarify the contents of the letter, the names of the characters, and I still do not understand what happened, whether it's real or not. . I try to find the "original" story she was based on, compare facts, but I can not find anything online. <br /> <br /> It was not a bad movie, but some of the dialogues were incredibly tacky. As for the special effects, the film was not bad for a Grade B, and these scenes of possession were worth it ... that is to say if you have nothing better to do. LOL
