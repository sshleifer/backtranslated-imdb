It's a really odious sight. This is actually an example of the decline in television since the "reality" has become a reality. Tanya is pretty but she is also extremely rough and has a terrible taste. Does a house show the place for sex appeal? Apparently, some men like the show because they find Tanya attractive. The other leader is not handsome, but he is also impolite and has an awful taste. It is unfortunate that so many houses have to be built while someone lives there. Most people who have visited these homes before changes are made should move into new or completely empty homes to avoid insulting anyone. Most of them, like the crew, have to learn good manners. I can imagine how appalling the British show is, as British reality shows tend to be even worse in terms of tastes and ways. <br /> <br /> What has become of Arts and Entertainment? When that started (and for a few years after), it was filled with treats. Now it's a big garbage machine.
