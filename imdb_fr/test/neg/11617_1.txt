Wow! I really regret looking at this picture ... Funny, I agreed to see it just for my wife, who endured the torture of seeing her about half an hour before I pulled out, while I was standing in front of the television, but only to feed the masochist in me and me because I wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were redeemable aspects that could lessen the feeling that I had to be a fool for watching this movie called Two Girls and a guy ... <br /> <br /> Everything in this picture is wrong, totally wrong ... since the first, absurd, premise of two women stupid enough to stay with their common boyfriend to the terrible, but merciful, End, not to mention the horrible game of the three actors ... Do not believe the rumors, the game of the drug addict is bad and I do not see how Graham has made a name in the film industry ... <br /> <br /> I wonder why, after having saved a few dollars with only three actors and one location, they did not hire anyone to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with his *** ... <br /> < At least, I felt a little good when I destroyed the DVD and threw it in the trash ... Anyway, I liked (and just a little) l brunette actress, Natasha something, but that was not enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy principle of Face-off, so Two girls and one guy go to the bottom ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this ****!
