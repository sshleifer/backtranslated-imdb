First of all, I must point out that the role played by Wendell Corey has been exceptional. Usually, Corey has been relegated to the background, but it is he who helps to wear this very soft film. Without him and the character he played, the film would have been much worse - barely worth a 2 or a 3. <br /> <br /> So why did I hate the rest of the movie so much? Well, one of my problems is that the characters are acting "too stupid to live". You can not base your major arguments on the assumption that your main characters are completely stupid (unless a brain injury is part of the plot, of course). But that's exactly what happens in this movie. Wendell Corey is a crazy man who murdered three innocent people and they know that his next target is Joseph Cotten's wife. So what are they doing? Yes, they offer really inadequate police protection and a meaningless plan (no sniper or guy with shotguns that are so far away that they will probably not stop this madman). And if that was not enough, the marked woman would flee inexplicably from her hiding place and head straight for the worst possible place she could be! Is someone so stupid?!?! Arrrggghhhh --- I hate when movies have such stupid characters. In fact, I found myself rooted for Corey since I felt that idiots deserved to die for their behavior! In addition to these cliché characters, there was also a player who fainted. Of course, seeing your husband being shot can cause someone to faint, but in reality it is a rare event; people rarely faint unless for a medical reason. So, combining this with the character problems above is a nightmare for people in search of realism - what Black Film movies should have. <br /> <br /> All these serious problems are even more infuriating as the character of Wendell Corey is incredibly well written and designed. It was his chance to shine as an actor - too bad that the rest of the film was so lame that Corey and the basic idea of ​​the plot were cast. It's a movie that could really use a remake - but this time without characters without brains.
