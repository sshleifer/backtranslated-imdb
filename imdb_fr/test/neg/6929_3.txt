I loved the book "A Little Princess" for most of my life and I was very happy there was a movie. But I was appalled by this adaptation. Not only are the acting and the plot a complicated hodgepodge of various incidents in the book, but the theme is all wrong. The true theme of the story should be that a girl can only be a princess if she behaves this way, as Sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 rolls to a beggar child, even though she herself very hungry. The theme of the film seems to be that all the girls are princesses, which depreciates considerably the action of Sara and seems rather to have to be written on a Poin√ßon card rather than applied to this story. <br /> <br /> There are many others. what's wrong with this film - it's too much to list, but here are some of the bigger ones: this story should be set in Britain in the mid-1800s, not in the United States during the First World War . From the beginning, Miss Minchen is harsh on Sara, which makes her less oppressive than if she was sweet as a syrup at first, as she is supposed to be. Nowhere is it mentioned that Becky is black. Sara's father does not come back, he's dead. It is his closest friend and collaborator in the diamond mines who finds Sara and restores her in her place. In fact, diamond mines are not even mentioned at all, although they are the source of Sara's wealth. <br /> <br /> Throughout her journey, Sara always acts like a princess, giving what she can, and forgiving those who have hurt her. She would never have called Lavinia a "two-faced tyrant". Such a thing is completely devoid of character for her and compromises the whole philosophy that she must behave, no matter the case. <br /> <br /> This is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen I've ever seen (with the notable exception of "Ella Enchanted" and "Anne of Green Gables," The story of the book is wonderful and his writing is clever. I do not understand why the director felt it needed to be changed to make it interesting. I would suggest that anyone wishing to know this story should look at the 1987 version, which is far superior. Or better yet, read the book. It will be more worth wasting your time than the hour and a half lost for this version of the film.
