This film was different from most 1930s Jimmy Cangey movies in that it was NOT shot by Warner Brothers / First National, but was loaned to a smaller studio. Since this was a "poverty level" studio, production values ​​are lower than what you are used to seeing with Cagney's films. Plus, the plot is certainly one of the strangest I've ever seen. Instead of being a gangster, he was a good guy in this one - fighting for the law. This is not unusual, as Cagney frequently played with lawyers - such as a chief of the OSS (ancestor of the CIA) of the FBI agent. BUT, making him an investigator for the Bureau of Weights and Measures was indeed strange - especially since he sometimes acted the same way as in the movie G-MEN! <br /> <br /> All in all, a time saver and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the videotape of Memory Lane Video that I saw appearing was perhaps one of the poorest I've ever met. The sound was awful and rough and the print was very white and had a lot of torn dandruff and holes.
