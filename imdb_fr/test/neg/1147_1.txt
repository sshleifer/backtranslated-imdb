Why oh why did they have to try to make a sequel to one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time. The film is a train wreck on all levels and should never have been done. The portrait of cousin Eddie by Randy Quaid is a remarkable caricature of his previous adventures as a cousin Eddie. Plus, Eddie's character is not interesting enough to make an entire movie. Even "sweet in the eye" Sung Hi Lee could not buy that piece of holiday shit. Please do not waste your time on this move, just look at the original again.
