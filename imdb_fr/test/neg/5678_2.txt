I was a big fan of "SNL" at the time of Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Gilda Radner and many other memorable stars. But every time I tried to watch it in the last ten years, I was very disappointed and sometimes even disgusted. Ten years ago, I thought the show could not survive because it had become so devoid of the kind of humor that I could understand, and yet it kept spinning, which I have always found dismayed, wondering how could possibly find his humor lame at all funny. In the last ten years, I have never been happy to have listened to him. Indeed, I have always been bored to stay awake and waste my time. For me, the lowest point was reached several years ago when a popular host I loved was the guest host. At one point that night, he played a big star, maybe himself, and in the skit, the character "Mongo", I think, played by Chris Kattan, again, found himself in the back of a car with him. What followed then was that Mongo was forced up and down on the actor's knees, hysterically screaming at him while he was probably sodomized. The audience laughed at me and I shake their heads, surprised that they could find that as funny as possible, surprised that NBC could even broadcast such a thing. In the years that followed, I tried several times to approach the show with an open mind, hoping to find the sly sense of humor that I had loved for so many years. But until a week ago, for me, it was not the case. Not even close. An exception: during the 2008 presidential campaign, I thought Tina Fey was fantastic and she was the interpreter who kept me listening. But Sarah Palin's sketches, though hysterical, were still not enough to save the rest of the 90 minutes, and I'd always regret not turning it off as soon as I heard the famous "It's Saturday night. !!! "
