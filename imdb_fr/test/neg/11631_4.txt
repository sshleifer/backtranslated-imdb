OH MY GOD! After such a promising start, Critters 2 reiterated the karmic rule of what is happening. Clearly, very little has been thought about when making this film, and what if Scott Grimes wore an ear! It should have been the last expedition in the Critters saga, but other wastes were on the way. That's the main reason why I did not watch Critters 3 and why should each series of bad movies have an episode in space? (Creatures, Friday the 13th, Space Goblin, Hellraiser, etc.)
