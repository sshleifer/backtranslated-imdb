Barney and his friends ... the Dora the Explorer of the 90s. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'll admit it. when I was a child, barney was my ultimate hero. I had my plush Barney toy and I watched the same episodes of Barney again and again on a videotape. maybe because it was so sweet and numb. <br /> <br /> However, by the time I turned 7, I started to hate Barney. Everyone at school would be Dis Barney, and I went (mostly because it was funny) and that's what little boys do. but a few years later, I discovered something else about barney that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> a known person on the IMDb like Angel_meiru did a try for the school, explaining the dangers of barney watching, and he or she posted it in the bulletin boards. many of these dangers made sense. <br /> <br /> Barney is a dinosaur that can magically come alive for a day at school. it's supposed to be educational, says Sheryl Leach (Barney's creator), but all I can remember is that magic taught me that magic can solve anything, which is not true <br /> <br /> End this story comment, I would like to tell you a little story. Once upon a time there was a young boy who watched a particular episode of Barney. One day he was alone when a stranger pulled him into his car and left with him. I do not know the outcome (but presumably the child is dead), but why was it removed? because he watched the episode Barney and his friends titled "A stranger is a friend you have not met yet." <br /> <br /> 0/10
