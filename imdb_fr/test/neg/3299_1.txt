I watched the first episode of "The War at Home" because I thought it was worth replacing "Arrested Development," my boy, if I was disappointed. It should be clear to everyone that this show has been outright stolen from "Grounded for Life", "Titus" and "Married ... with Children" because they are all similar in plot and general mood. The so-called "typing lines" are all repetitive and based on formulas, even more so, these "typing lines" are not even funny at all, for me they are rather in the lines as being coarse and coarse . The main character Dave Gold acts like a white thug who thinks he's funny and cool, which he is not. (Even Hillary (Dave's daughter) said it in the episode "Gaza Strip"). <br /> <br /> In the episode "Dream Crusher", Hillary wanted to be a singer {but was actually pretty mean}, and Dave and Vicky then willingly decided to crush his dreams by saying that it was zero . After that, she later wanted to become a child psychologist and planned to go to Harvard. After telling Dave and Vicky, she left the room and the two made fun of her. Also, in the first episode, Dave said about Hillary's boyfriend ("black") "Does she really think we're going to let her out with that guy? I'd rather drink my own urine," that line has the most stupid line in the history of television. And Dave constantly makes fun of Larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and geeky. Also, let's not forget that he also laughed at Larry's girlfriend. Dave is the father he is supposed to defend for his son, whatever happens. "The War at Home" is without a doubt the worst television show for the family. This clearly explains why the series should be canceled because it spreads a racist and homophobic agenda. It's as if the show wanted to be funny, because it always put that silly laugh every time someone said something, but the aftershocks are a bit forced, silly and pathetically juvenile. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the series is horrible is Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are terrible actors. Rappaport must always move his hands when he is in front of the camera. Not only does he do it for this show, but he did it while he was with "Boston Public". Sullivan speaks and acts like a robot every time he acts (he also did it in "Malcolm in the Middle")}. <br /> <br /> So, to put an end to all this, you have all understood why wrong with this show 1.It is not original 2.The actor's game is zero 3.This is not even not funny 4.All the jokes are the same 5.With a lousy scenario 6.The characters are pitiful and inimitable 7.The father is a scam of Archie Bunker <br /> <br /> FOX has to eliminate this waste from the air, because everything is better than that.
