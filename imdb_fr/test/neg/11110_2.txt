Excerpt from GUIDE TV: <br /> <br /> This week on THE LOVE BOAT, Captain Stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist gets on board with an unexpected cargo! Join the captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun Halloween special. A guest with a guy in a very bad lizard suit, such as Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> This is a typical and lame scale of the Sci-Fi channel. The captain of a cruise ship, played by the very respectable John Rhys-Davies, is responsible for a carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. Her daughter is with her for the ride and she earns her gift by being the ship's kickboxing instructor. Be careful, everyone, this kickboxing will be useful later! It should be noted that the captain's daughter is poorly coordinated and difficult to watch. It would have been nice if she had taken some kickboxing lessons before trying to play an instructor in a movie. Captain Stupid and his daughter join Mrs. Thurston Howell of Gilligan's Island, a timid cryptozoologist and a dark and mysterious stranger on this 90-minute boredom trip. <br /> <br /> That's right, I said cryptozoologist. He keeps mentioning that he has brought on board a precious cargo that he has to check. Needless to say, the box contains a chupacabra that someone decides to let out. From that moment, a man wearing the Chupacabra rubber suit runs around the ship and kills people. Captain Stupid is powerless to stop him. He decides to call the Marines but tells them there is a group of terrorists on his ship. <br /> <br /> The Marines answer. They say everything about the Navy like "Hooya" and "Get Some". But these stupid Marines can not compete with a Chupacabra. They also do not really tell anyone where they are going, so there is no help in sight. I guess no one will really miss a lame battalion of lost Marines. But do not forget ... Captain Stupid's daughter is, thankfully, a kickboxing instructor. Yay for Little Stupid! She arrives just in time, she beats the bloodthirsty goat sucker and saves the day. Chupacabra means honeysuckle. Therefore, Chupacabras are void. But there is no way that Chupacabras sucks as far as this movie.
