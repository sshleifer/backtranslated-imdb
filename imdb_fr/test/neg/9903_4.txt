I think "Category 6: Day of Destruction" was very unrealistic. The digital effects looked like a children's cartoon. <br /> <br /> The actors did not act realistically. For example, when the girl was touched, she acted as if she had had a tomato sauce on her head. <br /> <br /> The movie was boring but I watched it because it was on. <br /> <br /> The only interesting character was Tornado Torny, he was funny! <br /> <br /> Please keep the real special effects. <br /> <br /> I liked the comment: Did we piss Mother Nature? "<br /> <br /> I do not know what to write to fill the 10 lines.What else can I say the movie is so boring, I think my comment will be just as boring.
