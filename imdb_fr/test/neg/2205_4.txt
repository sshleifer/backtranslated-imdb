I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, so I was surprised and disappointed that he was barely in this movie! The film really belongs to Robert Ryan, who is the hero of the jam and who is involved in the love triangle. Good luck, Gabby Hayes wins more time on screen than Mr. Scott in this movie !! For a lot of viewers, that's not a problem, but I'm part of Walter Brennan's school of acolytes, not Gabby Hayes ... although I would say that his lines were a little more humorous than boring in this film only in many of his films with Randolph Scott and John Wayne. <br /> <br /> Personally, I found the movie very slow, with a complicated plot that was even more confusing because of the useless super-intrigue of romance. By stills, I do not mean impossible to understand or understand, I mean too messy for his own good. <br /> <br /> Management is not inspired, and the two main villains have the most unsatisfactory come-up at the end. The whole film seems wrong, unrealistic and badly filmed. <br /> <br /> Just so you do not think I can not find anything good here ... <br /> <br /> In addition, Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her too short parts of this movie . I do not know if she's really singing, or anyone else, but whoever has a very nice voice. Ms. Jeffreys also had some good times to play. The scenario required much more of her, or the removal of her character. As it was, his few good moments were not enough to help the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Mr. Scott. He looks fantastic in this film and he is the ideal lawyer to sort things out. Some people complain that his characters before 1950 were too perfect, but that never bothered me. I would take it well before the 1950s, or brutal and violent after the 1950s. Anyway, Randolph Scott was a true Western hero. <br /> <br /> It saddens me to have to say it, but I would recommend you to skip this movie, unless you're an unconditional fan ... there are so many better Scott movies than this one This will not be missed.
