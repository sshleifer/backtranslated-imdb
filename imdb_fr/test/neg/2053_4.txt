Quite simply, I just watched this movie just because of Sarah and I also give these 4 stars just because of her, on the other side. This movie was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The game was horrible. The script was not inspired. It was a film that kept contradicting itself. The film was sloppy and without originality. it's not like I'm waiting for a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. It did not even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is, the more I think about the plot as a whole, the less sense it makes and the more holes we find. It's really a shame, because I'm pretty sure there was a good idea hiding somewhere ... <br /> <br /> I'm maybe a little bit hard giving the film a 4 / 10, but saw the actors involved and still SARA obvious writing talent, this movie really should have delivered a lot more.
