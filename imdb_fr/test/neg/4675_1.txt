As a Scot, I find the idea of ​​"Macbeth" completely shifted in America from time and space. I'm sure this does not apply to broad-spectrum IMDb users, but why are so many Americans unable to understand any film concept that is not set in their country? This attitude does no favor to Americans in the Big World. <br /> <br /> It was bad enough that "The Wicker Man" was redone and staged in the United States, totally devoid of its cultural context and Politicaly Correct the sex change for a main character. <br /> <br /> One wonders what will be next, Robert The Bruce as a police officer in New York ?, Mary Queen of Scots as a "football mom" juggling with children, a career and relationships ? <br /> <br /> Go Hollywood, open to all the other cultures of the planet!
