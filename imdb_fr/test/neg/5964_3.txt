According to this masterpiece of the film's (pun intended) scenario, Charles Darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his theory of evolution, since he made absolutely no mention of any foreign intervention. For you, the extraterrestrials have sent Chupacabras to earth and they are the missing link in the theory of evolution. However, the rest of the movie seems to clearly point out that Chupacabras are a typical Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I do not really know where this fits. Do they say that all Puerto Ricans are extraterrestrials? It does not matter, anyway, it's irrelevant. The only thing you need to memorize is that "El Chupacabre" is a totally cheap and foolish amateur B movie, lacking in tension, character development and any form of style. Several duos of people pursue this monster eating goats (which looks like the midget version of the Pumpkinhead demon) in the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. We have a dogcatcher without talent and a stubborn novelist, a pair of odious cops and the supposedly evil scientist with his dark-minded accomplice. Since they are all extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can carelessly continue to devour all Latino immigrants in the neighborhood. The monster itself seems to be going well and the makeup effects on the remains of its victims are grossly and bloody. The performances are irremediably terrible and cause headaches. In particular, Eric Alegria is pitiful in his first and only role as an overly ambitious Animal Control employee. Yes, it's an incredibly stupid movie, but you've probably struggled with more modest and less amusing rubbish.
