I drop this vehicle from Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy, and Murphy in particular the first time, but after reviewing it recently, I see that it has very fun elements. <br /> <br /> This is by no means saying that it's the greatest boyfriend comedy of all time, but what can you really do to the already exhausted subgenre? What director Tom Dey has tried to do is make this movie a satire of clichés comedy boyfriend and media. At the beginning of the film, the executive of a cable network asks: "How does this differ from Cops?", When Chase Renzi proposes the idea of ​​a reality show starring the character of De Niro , Mitch Preston (a name so boring). It was then that I saw things in a new light that I had never noticed before. <br /> <br /> The idea is to show all the elements of comedy buddy and put them in a different light. De Niro's reluctance to play in the series and to associate with Murphy is directly related to every crime movie you can think of. You can say that De Niro plays himself by asking, "Why would I do another movie by playing a cop?" Chase Renzi is portrayed as a Hollywood can, but if you look at her opening scene again, she's just doing it to save her job. She sees in some way the ridiculousness of what she does but she wants to succeed anyway. A line says it all: "Who does not want to be on TV?" It may be too much reading in what is essentially a light film, intended to entertain, but it gives a little effect that I had not noticed before. <br /> <br /> As for Murphy. You must congratulate him for looking so ridiculous. Trey wants to be such a bad star that he is ready to sell anything he comes into contact with. Murphy was a big star and that may have made it clear how fleeting it is. <br /> <br /> The plot with the rifle is of course quite boring. The action sequences are nothing special, except the end that required a lot of effort on the part of the actors and the team. One thing I noticed about the bad guy is that he's dressed like an 80s pop star. George Michael comes to mind and that adds even more to the media. <br /> <br /> That's why I ruined everything. The first time is good. If you want to do that, why not emphasize how ridiculous it is, and De Niro and Murphy took a great chance to do it.
