Dreamland started moderately interesting but never went anywhere other than Tedium City. A case of low rents without named actors and laughable effects, discouraged for any reason whatsoever. The best thing to say is that they really seem to have filmed it in the Nevada desert. That's it, I can not think of a good thing in addition to that of this whore. The finale is supposed to be a kind of revelation but falls flat like the rest. Oh, I thought of another good thing about this cheese: it is timed in a little over an hour although it has lost its welcome well before. When the girl begins to walk in the desert at night, it seems to last forever and only gets worse. Horror attempts are not at all effective. The story is an attempt to feel like a twilight zone, but it fails badly. Discover "Retroactive" for a good sci-fi movie.
