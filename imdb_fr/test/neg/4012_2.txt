Altman is very proud of the fact that in his films people talk to each other because, he says, people do it in life. Well, people cough, rotate, go on the tangent, and so on. The fact is that just because people do something does not mean that cinema is convincing. It is a problem. <br /> <br /> The most important problem is that it's not a very skilful satire, direct or striking, nor relevant, neither in 1988 nor in 2004. Garry Trudeau still lives in the 1960s and thinks that everyone except a small core of Republican elected is a 1960s style hippie liberal. I mean the guy always meets Zonker in his band - a character who is a complete anachronism, yet Trudeau still uses it as his he was the representative of a large band of American youth. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I'm a Conservative, but I'm not saying it's bad because it's a Liberal trend. It might take a liberal approach and be funny and relevant, but it is not. It's mostly a piece of vanity with a group of prominent celebrity liberals (including the loathsome and loathsome Ron Reagan, Jr.). Sometimes he feels impromptu, and the rest of the time he looks sarcastically of personal importance and "are not we so smart?" - ness. <br /> <br /> Someone said that this show insists that he has a cult after. I think his cult status is more desired than real. I'm sure there are two or three people who have recorded all the original episodes in 1988 and keep them, but if that's the norm, every show broadcast to date is a cult classic to some degree. If Tanner did not have the names Altman and Trudeau, it would be another forgotten HBO production of the 1980s. Instead, it is presented as a hard-hitting and incisive political commentary by guys who are at the top of their game. form. However, the reality is as far away as possible from that. Pat Paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than ever to Tanner's, and he's been dead for a decade.
