The Man (Gaston Modot) and the Young Girl (Lya Lys) pass through the film, consumed by passion for each other. They aspire to be together but their moments together are constantly interrupted. The film is littered with images and stops after an hour ......... do lovers find happiness ...? .. <br /> <br /> The film begins interestingly with images of scorpions, but you quickly realize that it is a pretentious nonsense. It's a silent movie with occasional dialogues and a non-stop soundtrack that's so annoying that you turn down the sound and you want to watch it as a silent movie. Continuous battery bearings had to make moviegoers crazy. There are really fun times, for example, when a man hits a dog and when he turns a blind man over. Unfortunately, this humor is done in the name of art, so it's a pseudo nonsense. The film is shit.
