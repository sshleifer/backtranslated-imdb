A ruthless assassin was hired to eliminate a person at the top of the US government. By constantly changing his identity and place, he is known only as Jackal. Everything about this killer is a secret. Aware of Jackal's presence but unsure of his goal, the FBI's deputy director faces the biggest challenge of his career. In order to find this murderer in cold blood, he and an officer of the Russian intelligence services set themselves the task of appealing to an imprisoned Irish terrorist. These unlikely allies enter a global race against the clock to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can complete his work. If you're looking for a non-stop action movie like Die Hard, The Jackal is not your movie. It's a slow spy thriller with many gadgets and weapons. Richard Gere does a good job playing the role of a passionate terrorist who helps the FBI for a cause deeper than mere freedom. And Willis makes a good effort as a jackal. OK the movie but nothing more.
