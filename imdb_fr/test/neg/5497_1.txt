Such a stupid movie should never see the light of day. The acting is nothing, violence is omnipresent, the stealthy end is just stupid. <br /> <br /> This is a lawyer who witnessed a murder committed by the R.I.C.C.O. team. Nobody has ever seen it, not even the killers. So, he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the leader of this R.I.C.C.C.O. the team, before they find them. <br /> <br /> Then the film goes on to a love story, a shotgun and a voodoo. Now, how the hell did voodoo get into this case? Never see this movie if your life depends on it. Believe me!!!!!!!!
