This film is an obvious scam of Underworld USA with Cliff Robertson. You must invest a few hours and look at the original. I found this one disjointed and hard to follow, with many scenes that did not make much sense. I'm not opposed to violence in movies, but all that seemed to be an excuse to destroy one person after another, many of whom had only a marginal connection to the script. With everyone being killed, throughout the movie, I wondered why Frank had not just exploded Johnny's brain. He certainly could and Johnny was sure he did not act like a trusted person. Another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes; why do these people have sex with their clothes? Is it supposed to excite us? They probably did not think they had a chance to get a PG rating. Nothing in this film seemed to play naturally. as if we were looking at people in real life, it was rather heavy and superficial.
