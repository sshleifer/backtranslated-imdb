It's a beautiful concept, and Brando's acting game is a great job. Dean Martin is not bad and Montgomery Clift is also very good. Unfortunately, it is a very rambling and very long piece that should have been modified to be closer to 2 hours (it's almost 3 hours). <br /> <br /> We follow the lives of 3 men from 1938 to the end of the Second World War and we see them discover who they are and what they could become as they discover the world that they are. about what they are made of. For some, it is the women in their lives who allow this awareness, for others, it is the broader general circumstances. Too often, however, I found myself wondering what had happened or how important a given scene was.
