I started looking at it because I thought it was a really crappy porn. As I continued to watch, the only thrill of this film was how it was called so I could search for it and tear it apart. I just finished it and I considered putting an end to my life knowing that someone actually made this movie. <br /> <br /> For people who have commented on this film as having a good screenplay and outstanding acting, my words are of wisdom to you. that you probably do not have friends because you were in the movie. You probably want you to have lost all that time of your life doing this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no way that it's a serious movie. There was an old man who was stabbed and it did not hurt him at all. And when everyone is stabbed, they fall dead. <br /> <br /> It was probably important that these people kill and eat people at random and hang out with an 80 year old man who wanted to put the coins in his body. . <br /> <br /> What I preferred was when the old man found the "hemoglobene" or how you spell it, because it gave the film a very intellectual aspect and probably allowed to touch the older crowd. <br /> <br /> What really shocked me was that they decided to stage this random scene about girls going to college looking for fake skulls. <br /> <br /> If you are trying to see this movie, you should probably fill up your bathtub and put your hair dryer in and get ready to jump in. <br /> <br /> THIS IS A GOOD SEE !!! .... for all those who think that life could not be worse help you realize that there are people (the directors of this movie) who are even more pathetic and who are not going anywhere in life.
