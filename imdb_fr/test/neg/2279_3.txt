Director / screenwriter Allan Burns seems to have associated two different scripts before proposing this minor release: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage. The result is a grumpy film. Christine Lahti plays the role of a grimy and cynical television journalist who befriends aerobics teacher Mary Tyler Moore and soon dines with Moore and her family - to discover that Mary's husband (Ted Danson) is the secret affair of Lahti! Burns has a strange and rhythmic rhythm in his dialogue, which is neither realistic nor effective (just more and more annoying, because nothing important ever seems to be said). Moore, slim as a rail, looks radiant in her leotard, she has a radiant smile but does not convince like Danson's wife, and Danson gets stuck with a derisory and ungrateful role (he's just here to be a boy). The film tries to cover all the bases in a classic case of excessive attack (the role of the woman in the workplace, the television news, the deceitful family man, the working woman and the mother who wants it) more, a woman's need for female friendships, etc.), but nothing essential comes out of these ideas since Burns only looks shyly at the problems. As a writer, he is surprisingly free of lines of force, but he is also devoid of purpose, and the complicated plot is completely dirty. * 1/2 of ****
