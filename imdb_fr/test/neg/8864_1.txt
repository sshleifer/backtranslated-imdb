This is a spin-off of Pulp Fiction. I thought it would be good for some decent laughs. Well, it turns out that this movie was really terrible. The entire plot does not follow on the plot Pulp Fiction. He turns to another film like Forrest Gump and more. A few bursts of laughter came out of this movie, but it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me. If you plan to rent this movie, avoid losing 90 minutes of your life. Come back to this question and continue to find a film that makes sense. Please, if there is a Plump Fiction 2, I will definitely not continue to rent the suite. Just to give a head to those there.
