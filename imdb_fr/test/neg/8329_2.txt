You would think that a film about incestuous sisters who would finally murder their employer could not help but be staggering, but then you would be wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy. There is no character development. There is no redemptive visual beauty. <br /> <br /> This film is a waste of time. The exploration of the evolution of the relations between the sisters is null, their sexuality is never anything but a grotesque one, the relations of class are passed over in silence and the employer is a ridiculous sagacity. <br /> <br /> not the same depth of meaning.
