Tycoon will never be named as one of John Wayne's best films after Stagecoach. It is good in places, there are beautiful sequences of action in the cave and also in the flood at the highest point. But the plot leaves something to be desired. <br /> <br /> What we have at Tycoon is two men who hate each other completely and who prevent them from working as a team. Multi-millionaire Cedric Hardwicke hired John Wayne and James Gleason to build a railroad. But then he refuses to give them the money to do the job well. <br /> <br /> Things get really complicated when Wayne falls in love with Hardwicke's daughter, Laraine Day. After a night where they have to spend time alone in an Inca ruin, by convention in South America, Wayne and Day are planning a wedding, although nothing has happened. <br /> <br /> What should have happened is that these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to settle their differences in one way or another. Their accursed annoyances make victims among the members of Wayne's crew. <br /> <br /> But what makes the reputation of Tycoon is another part of thinness. Laraine Day was married to Leo Durocher, the manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, at the time of filming. He was a constant presence on the set, incredibly jealous of John Wayne who, according to him, might have an affair with his wife. Nothing to do, but he made the life of his wife miserable. <br /> <br /> Not one of the duke's best efforts.
