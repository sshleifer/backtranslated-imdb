Let's describe Larry as an interviewer: a complete suckhole, in every way possible. He laughs at all the jokes of his guests, he asks the most boring questions and he would never dare to contradict them. He strikes me as the type of person who wants to be loved by ... everyone. Harry friendly, boring, unpredictable. He probably owes his success to being a dream interviewer for celebrities because they are not bombarded by what we, the people, want to know and have the right to know. Let's put it this way: he interviews as if he were in a red country. 02/10, 2 for guests coming on the show, but everything seems pointless when Larry starts asking scary questions, such as "What does it mean to be a mother?" followed by the usual response of the type "Being a mother is the greatest thing that has happened to me: it is wonderful, but tiring".
