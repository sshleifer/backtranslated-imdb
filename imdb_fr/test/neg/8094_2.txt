What can you say about a movie whose funny episode sees a fat man fighting a garden hose? The acting, especially that of Jerry O'Connel, is embarrassing. The dialogue is so artificial and insane that it makes you cringe. The main idea is actually not a bad idea for this genre (infant comedy for teenagers), but the director manages to derive the least benefit. I notice a 2 out of 10.
