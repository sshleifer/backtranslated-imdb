I remembered that horrible movie I bought at the Camelot Music Store in the summer of 1989 while visiting my grandparents. It was a time when I had just discovered films like Re-Animator, From Beyond, The Return of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. I was ready for any kind of horror / gore had to offer ... or so I thought! I was only 12 at the time and I really do not remember it very well. I remember a psychopath running with a corkscrew who was killing people, and two cops (I think) who were riding in a car that did not really move, but who were swaying on one side to the other. other to give the impression that it was ... a real cinemagic. I also remember that it was the worst movie I have ever seen so far and that I quickly threw it in the trash. <br /> <br /> Something makes me think of this movie tonight (I can not believe I remember the name), so I jumped on imdb to see if it was listed . To my surprise ... IT WAS! And 5 other people have already seen this ... Amazing. Although I remember hating the movie at the time, I would have liked to keep it hidden somewhere because I'd like to check it again for a laugh (it would probably make a good movie to drink). Anyway, I'm happy to be part of the elite who saw this little "treasure". I would like to pick it up somewhere for a few dollars ... but beware, it's not a recommendation ... it's horrible ... it's just for nostalgia.
