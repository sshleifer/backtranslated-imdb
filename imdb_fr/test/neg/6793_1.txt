This show is the worst show of all time! Norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, etc. The only reason I saw this is that my clumsy wife loves it. How many times can Norris fly through the air to kick a badly blind villain? No trees, no construction, just whoosh ..... look thin. It ALWAYS solves the case or is the best regardless of its skill. No co-star ever wins glory. That's all Norris. It's really obvious that Norris is terribly stuck to himself and will not allow anyone to join him in all scenes, whatever the content. Terrible game, terrible scenario, dreadful series.
