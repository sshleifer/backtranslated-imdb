This cheap, garbage-free movie is about a NASA test rocket that is sent into space with a cargo of animals. It disappears for a moment then comes back unexpectedly, crashing into a forest, releasing a vicious mutant creature. <br /> <br /> Like many films of this type, Night Fright features stupid teenagers diving into 60s surf music before being killed. However, none of the murders are memorable because we really do not see anything. One thing we see though is that one of the teenagers seems to be around 40 years old and sports a pretty stupid haircut. <br /> <br /> For a creature function to work, it must present a monster to the viewer properly. In this film, however, we only have the shortest glimpses of the monster. It seems to somehow resemble the alien of Robot Monster. But I'm not sure; As the photography was so dark, I simply could not understand what was happening very often. Although my feeling was that I probably did not miss a lot.
