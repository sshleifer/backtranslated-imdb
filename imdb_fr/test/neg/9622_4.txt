I'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask. I am a passionate spectator and an amateur filmmaker. As I said to my friends at lunchtime, MirrorMask could be my biggest disappointment of the year. Like the short film Moongirl, the film has missed its mark. Several times during the film, he tried humor. It prepares you for laughter. Instead of making you laugh, you feel empty. The jokes recalled one of the recent Star Wars movies. They were not funny unless you were five years old. And the acting game felt equally terrible. I saw actors playing in front of a blue screen. And I believed him. But not in this movie. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> This film takes a formula and tries to apply it with pretty illustrations ?? And although the script is fully exploitable and the special effects pretty good, he has no heart and fails miserably. I left the film shaking my head and I considered leaving the theater. I felt myself holy and miserable, and I still had not removed the sour taste of my mouth. I love the independent film. I encourage people to watch independent films to support them. But not this movie. This film should not have been done. At least, not like that. Why did the director miss the notes so clearly? They were clearly settled ?? Not just humor. But the emotions. The drama. Even the lines were poorly synchronized and poorly delivered. It was as if the film was walking on three legs instead of four. His steps are clumsy and miss timed. And he could fall with the slightest push ?? Do not see this movie. I do not care who you are. It's not worth your time.
