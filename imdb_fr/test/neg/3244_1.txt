I am ashamed to admit in public that I even made the cover of this movie once! This is an absolute reason why you have to research the film before you see it! The "makers" of this film have treated us gullible losers and losers by leaving them too much time. <br /> <br /> Inspired by the mythical Indian cobras and the rebirth, the story transports us around the world. painful turn. More than 40 actors (now really?) From the university are the target of their former friend Manisha Koirala (who was in his old life a cobra, but who is now a ghost!) And his pathetic boyfriend, eternal and powerful, Munish Kohli (who, fortunately, has not been seen since). Now, do you need to know more? <br /> <br /> I vote in favor of studying for the next test at school rather than for this film! Give him a pass if you are sane. If it is not ... then you will probably enjoy it.
