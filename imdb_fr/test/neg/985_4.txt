The most generic surface biography you can hope for. The personification of Holly by Busey is accurate - but who wants to hear Gary Busey sing "Maybe Baby"? As a general rule, Hollies members are used for comedic relief and melodrama (Smith and Stroud, respectively) instead of being characters or even characters. When Holly uses a string section, the old Jewish-looking guys tell him that he uses the same techniques as Mozart. It is precisely this kind of shameless statement that makes movie biographies like this (and "Amadeus", about the aforementioned Mozart) worthless. Some entertainment may be derived from Holly's excellent styles and songs performed in a B variation.
