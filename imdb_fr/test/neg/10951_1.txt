First of all, I'm a big fan of crappy movies. Note B is always good for laughs. Unfortunately, this movie is just bad. I disguised as a Zombie for a party and my makeup was more beautiful than this one. Especially the big guy from the beginning, it looked like a kid had drawn his face with colored pencils. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that I do not have to say why. The effects are also extremely amateurish, with obvious blood tubes shooting a blood stream right on the backs of zombie heads when they are shot. <br /> <br /> It also seems that many people commenting on this film are trying to increase their rankings. Nobody without his finger in the cake would give this movie a score higher than 5/10. Frankly, it is shameful that the people who worked on this film improve their own rankings. <br /> <br /> I suggest everyone avoid this movie, it's not worth losing the 90 minutes of your life. <br /> <Absolutely horrible.
