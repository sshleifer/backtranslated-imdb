This is one of those religious horror films that never explain why the forces of "evil" are 10,000 times more powerful than those of "good". Here we have a satanic cult that can: 1) "sweep" people (as in "Star Trek"), 2) kill through dolls of little children, 3) transfer a soul from one body to another, 4 ) hypnotize telepathically from a greater distance, and 5) cause drastic car accidents in which some people turn into spaghetti while others (children, in this case) survive unscathed. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the forces of the "good" can: 1) sit helpless, 2) remain helpless, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) waste time by not doing nothing, 6) read cartoons while people are being slaughtered by dozens, and 7) arrive too late at satanic rituals. <br /> <br /> In every religious horror movie, I have to assume that the world of this movie is inhabited by God and Satan. I must also assume that Satan can not be 1,000,000 times more powerful, unless the film has a world order like hell. In other words, where were the priests in this movie who knew something? The best that the priest of this film can do is guess that there are witches - nothing else - to read all those books from his office. At the first sight of violence, this priest becomes catatonic, then laughs hysterically, ending with a major panic attack. So, this is supposed to be God's contribution to the fight against Satan? Ridiculous. Every good movie of religious horror has the power of the "good" with some kind of (more or less) supernatural power, or at least its concrete knowledge of how to fight "evil." In this sense, this movie is pretty silly. Like the casting of the drone Martin to play the high priest (!) Of worship. There is very little threat or fear to watch this weird Martin directing a satanic ritual. I mean, it did not have to be Christopher Lee or Langhella, but could not they have found someone less funny? Also, why does the couple return to town after his car is out of the race? After their "friendly" meeting with the inhabitants of the city, no sensible person would have returned; they should have just walked. The explanation of the man to his girlfriend (and to the viewer) is: "who knows what is going in this direction".
