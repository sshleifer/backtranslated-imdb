You would have more enthusiasm to cut your testicles than to watch this, which is clearly something to allow you to rent "Descent" instead of "The Descent", which is a much better movie. <br /> <br /> This is a total rip off of "The Core" and a lot worse when it comes to special effects, I could do better with a box of corn flakes and a roll of aluminum foil, I to say, go! ... this thing "Mole", bore more resemblance to a vibrating dildo compared to a buried vehicle. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it - you will find that the room in which you feel has a funny smell for days and that you will have that throbbing sensation in the back of your head that you should go to kill you or something.
