Yes, in this film, you are treated with several small snowmen attacking in a seemingly very hot climate, so this movie should absolutely not be taken seriously. It is actually a much worse movie than the original because at least with this one all the production seemed to cost more than a few dollars and a video camera to make. There are fun times, but playing while playing on the low cost of your movie and doing what you want to laugh is a kind of low film making if you ask me. You can not invent a good story, your effects are going to be really bad, hey, let us give the movie an appearance as bad as possible with horrible liners and we have our movie. The first had at least one credible enough story as a snowman in that one attacked in the winter and not what amounts to a recourse. This has also had better effects too, this one is just a step forward on "Hobgoblins" when it comes to monsters and you really want to be more than a step-two above a hand puppet group . Yet, he compensates for all this with a great end that depicts a large ship being washed away by the frost. In fact, I'm kidding, but it was really the funniest part of the movie.
