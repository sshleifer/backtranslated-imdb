Conrad Radzoff (Ferdy Mayne), icon of the martyr cult cult, dies of a heart condition (not until he had a thankless assistant and a TV commercial director, who had disrespected him with a rain of insults). Some film students remove his body from his mausoleum (they want to "invite him to dinner" ... they are big fans). What these children (and especially the young Jeffrey Combs) do not expect is that Radzoff is resurrected by a way to wreak havoc on those who chased him out of his resting place. <br /> <br /> List of Violent acts, Radzoff shoots a guy's tongue, fires a woman, raises a coffin that crushes a woman's face, decapitates another and cremates a woman another man living in a coffin. A really strange soundtrack and a pesky fog envelop Radzoff's macabre activities. <br /> <br /> The silly hokum of Troma is limited by a very low budget and a slow pace. The film looks much longer than it is. The film is not really gore and we hardly see much violence because the film is often too dark. At times, Radzoff is a disturbing presence, but at other times, he just looks really stupid.
