Legendary turkey Cameron Mitchell on an actor / makeup artist who is burned by the head of a studio when a drink is thrown in his face while he lights a cigarette. Reduced to a scar disorder and wearing an eye patch, Mitchell works at the Movieland Wax Museum. He also kidnaps and kills people with a solution that paralyzes them so they can be turned into displays. A real really weird movie that defies description. Watch the different wax figures try not to move, watch the total consumption of tobacco for several southern states - watch as things get more and more weird. It's a horrible train wreck of a movie and you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. A bad classic film that will amaze you even if it leaves permanent scars on your psyche.
