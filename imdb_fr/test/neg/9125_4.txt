Like many suites, this one simply does not have the quality or the impact of the original. The first belongs up there with the rest of the big ones. It just does not cut. The first movie had a magical "good time" feeling that is totally missing from this movie. We fell in love with all these characters (minus Richard Dreyfuss) in an era of innocence. A few years later, they have changed so much that they are largely different. Even though this is what happens in real life, we do not think it will happen to our favorite movie characters! The movie does not have the humor that the original had, and we expected to laugh. What a little humor there is black. The first film also presented what is probably the most beautiful soundtrack of all time, while it is good but not very close to the original. This film is so different from the original that it's not even a sequel. I gave him a 4.
