Well, Killshot is not that great, but it's getting close to it. The production values ​​are correct and the main actors do a very good job (with the exception of Rosario Dawson in a lost role), but the story is just pathetic. I do not know if Elmore Leonard's book had such stupid characters, since I did not read it, but I guess it was supposed to be at least slightly humorous. The film has no detectable humor. After the first twenty minutes, you will scream on the screen: "Oh, come on, no one is so stupid !!" In a word, and without any spoilers, everyone acts in a convenient way to the plot, which makes no sense anyway. A very frustrating and unrealistic film, which may explain why he stays on the set for so long.
