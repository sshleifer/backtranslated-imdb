(Spoilers) Pretty horribly, I actually saw the movie that this horrible movie was a sequel. It was called Ator the Fighting Eagle, and I saw it when I was just 8 years old. It impressed me so much that I never forgot it. I've been a fan of MST3K for a long time, so when Cavedwellers came out on cassette, I bought it. I was horrified to realize that it was a sequel to Ator's miserable movie I had seen so long ago! Ator's costume has, in one way or another, become thinner than the last time I saw it. How can he wear this little bikini? Does not it bother him that it shows the fact that he does not have ... uh ... package? And poor Thong ... he does not get any lines and no girl, and must follow that girly frizzy Ator frizzy all the time. Has anyone noticed Miles O'Keefe walking like a woman? No wonder he is not interested in the pretty but a little dull Meela. The mean but nasty Zor is more to his taste, I'm sure. I liked Zor's cardboard bomb painted swan helmet and the way he spent all his time trying to touch a part of Ator. The fight scenes are so badly choreographed that it is a wonder that the swords manage to connect. The dull old man spends his whole time standing up, looking depressed. Ator drinks from a cup given by a guy who hates him, then looks surprised to have drugged him. He must be smart enough, he invented a hang glider in the space of five minutes, then plunged it into a break in the space / time continuum, so he briefly traveled to Bulgaria in the seventeenth century. It was after he stabbed the giant snake puppet, of course, and rescued Meela after coitus while sitting there doing nothing. The real hero of the movie was Thong, who saved Ator many times from his stupid stupidity, and who killed the evil Zor. Congratulations to Thong, the only competent person in the entire movie.
