Okay, I'm sorry for the actors and the team of this review, but this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen ... First, the acting has gone well. It could have been better (especially in some parts), but it was "ok". Then there was the cheapest video camera (they used). The violence was pretty good. If the pace was accelerated, it would be great, but they did not (* sigh *) ... Frightened. The fears were well written (in the script), but not well done. For example ... (SPOILER HERE!) In the attic, one girl is halfway and the other half is in the dark part of the barn house, then she understands. The monster pulls it down and you hear guts get ripped off. The fears could have been better if the music had not been extracted from a CD of cheap horror sounds. The effects of the blood were pretty good, but the blood was like that of "Kill Bill". K.B. successful, because it must have looked like old kung-fu movies, but when the team can not tell the difference between red and pink ... it's sad. The torn corpses in the movie were good, but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for $ 25 at a Halloween store. Do not let the cover fool you, the costumes are void! My overall rating is 3/10. If you are interested in independent films, if you are satisfied or if you just have 3 dollars burning a hole in your pocket, go to Blockbuster and see the horror of failure.
