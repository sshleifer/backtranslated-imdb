My wife received tickets for our family to attend the premiere of this film from her employer for free. I only regret the price of popcorn and the two hours of my life lost in this waste film. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD of the original mask and enjoyed it a lot. I was expecting a remake that was far from the original in terms of production or writing ... but I was not prepared for this pile of rubbish. A mediocre action, a mediocre plot, a bad baby who passes gas and urine in hyper "mask" .. a woman became a giant nose, vomiting mucus .. Amusing huh? My eight year old son loves movies like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars. After that, I asked him what he thought. His exact words; "I hated it, it's like Scooby Doo's movie, they take something good and have to put all these rude things in it." My daughter and my wife of twelve also hated him. My wife later told me that my son had asked her twice if we could leave. He never did that before. I'm proud of him. Lest you think I'm a Puritan, because of the groans and lack of laughter I've heard at the theater, I think most of the clients agree with me. today, and any positive reviews MUST come from people with a financial connection to the film.
