What one can expect from a comedy produced by Adam Sandler, Grandma's Boy is predictable and so stupid that it's disgusting. Allen Covert plays Alex in the movie, a 35-year-old woman who works as a video game tester and had to move with her grandmother and two roommates after losing her apartment. The usual intrigues occur: he struggles to adapt to his new life situation, which also puts him in difficulty at work, which is particularly serious because he tries to attack one of the new consultants from the office. Throw a strange boss, a star of the almost alien society, a really nerdy best friend, a few scenes at the burn pot seller, a very big party scene and an original video game that Alex is trying to finish by himself. even in the mix you have with Grandma's Boy in its entirety. Allen Covert is a good advance, Linda Cardellini is pretty cute for her role as Samantha, office automation consultant, and some scenes manage to make a laugh or two laugh, but none of this does not do The grandmother's boy is worth a lot time. Most supposed "jokes" or "gags" are just "humor" that would embarrass the entire National Lampoons team. Joel Moore is incredibly funny in his role as JP video game leader, and the whole film manages to be boring, not funny or substantial. At least, Grandma's Boy did something for someone: Adam Sandler was able to touch a few paycheques to his unemployed friends, David Spade, Kevin Nealon and Rob Schneider.
