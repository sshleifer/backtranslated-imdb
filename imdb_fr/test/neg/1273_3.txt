Yes, I had the misfortune to watch this movie when I was younger at a friend's house because her mother was a teacher and she wanted to see the film and see if there were inappropriate scenes that a parent might object to . Well, besides the insignificant jokes, I think it was clear, as well as the insignificant jokes and the strange scene where the look looks like Ernest's hitting a girl. So yes, Ernest is thrown into jail through a glance and proceeds to try to escape and he has other things like becoming magnetized at some point, drawing electricity, and in a very painful to watch the final flight. There are some jokes, but nothing else to mention except the soap gun ... I think this is the only scene where my friend's mother or I laughed loudly. This and the camp are Ernest's only two movies I've ever seen and from what I've seen in it, I'm not going to hunt down other movies. Ernest was good at small doses, but a movie is too much, even if it's as short as this one. I think the movies have brought in money, mainly because all you need is Varney, a place, a theme and you have your movie.
