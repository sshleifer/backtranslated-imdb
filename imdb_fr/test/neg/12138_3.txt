UP IN THE VILLA (2000) ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> WARNING: YOU CAN FIND SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It's hard to know what's the point. a beautiful but shallow period piece, one of those made for the sole purpose of winning Oscar nominations for the best costume design and artistic direction (one for cinematography and another for the score are also the welcome). It has the same basic idea of ​​thousands of vintage pieces produced each year: a beautiful, intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place for her. She has a lot of difficulties but finally finds her happiness in the arms of a man who is not the one with whom she has succeeded. In this case, our lady is in Florence, some time before the second world war. She is an English widow betrothed to a rich but elderly man (whom she obviously does not like). One day, she meets another man, who does not have a good reputation but for whom she falls in love. Of course, there is her friend who will help her for better or for worse and a third man, who commits suicide here, in the woman's room, sets up a risky situation for her. Guess how the story ends ...? <br /> <br /> UP IN THE VILLA is not a bad movie. I have always been very interested in history, but I have never been enthusiastic. The problem is not the slow pace, but the scenario. Adapted from a novel, he needs something more spicy, exciting, twists and suspense. Whenever you think the story will warm up, it will get cooler again. If you think there is a plot involving the average police chief in Florence, well, there is one, but that hardly changes anything in the story. This only continues, until the foreseeable end. <br /> <br /> As I said, UP AT THE VILLA is not bad. If it's a little bland, it never becomes sappy and too sentimental. The acting is half and half, but certainly convincing. Kristin Scott Thomas made some very bad choices after THE ENGLISH PATIENT (the romantic drama saaaaaaappy THE HORSE WHISPERER and the RANDOM HEARTS dull / irritating). UP AT THE VILLA is definitely better than these pieces and Kristin is also better, but she can do more than that. Sean Penn is good as always, even if his character is a great guy. Anne Bancroft is a wonderful actress (THE GRADUATE, my God!), And she does not let her character become ridiculous here. Now the support actors are pretty bad (Jeremy Davies is so irritating!). <br /> <br /> The staging is good, but not daring. It was interesting to know that the director is identical to ANGELS AND INSECTS (with also Kristin Scott Thomas), another rather average drama, but more daring than this one. What matters here are the visual elements. Florence is beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the scenery, the music ... <br /> <br /> In the end, UP AT THE VILLA is an average romantic drama, but of course it could have been much better. It's interesting and interesting, but do not expect a suspense movie, that's not the case! This film somehow fails because it wants to have a mystery, something to see ... However, there is not much to say mainly because of the shallow scenario. Now, about Oscar nominations, do not worry, he'll probably get them.
