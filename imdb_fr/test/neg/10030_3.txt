The prey has an interesting story. Unless you remember her ads in the June 1984 newspapers, you might have seen her on Movie Channel in the summer of '85, but nothing else is remembered. The plot is your basic killer again in the woods. But ironically, it was filmed before Friday 13. The prey was actually shot at some point in 1978, according to one of the actors in an interview a few years later. But released for about a week at some drive-in, (yes Jim, the namans lead in showed this in June of 84). But it has a dated appearance. Perhaps they had published it so late to take advantage of all the other terrorist films whose market had been flooded in 1984. Now, there is some kind of history, a forest fire in the 1940s has left a lot of gypsies burned. to death. But one of their children has survived (our monster), so move on nowadays (that would be in 1978). We have a couple of older seniors who camp to be sent by the monster. The slogan of this photo claims not to be human, nor to have an axis, but an axis was only used during these first two murders. We now have a group of teenagers who seem to be in the middle age camp. We all know that they are the prey, and the monster knocks them one by one. For a film of 80 minutes, it seems longer. We also have a lot of pictures of wildlife to fill for 80 minutes. Overall, the horror film of the 80s seems to be over 70 years old than ever before. Hey the Prey had the potential to be a good horror killer in the Woods movie, but he falls a little short. It does, however, have a rather scary monster at the end, and we have to wait the last 2 minutes to see it. Side note, the monster continued to play in the movies of the Addams family in the 1990s.
