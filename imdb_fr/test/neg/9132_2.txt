I was very disappointed with this movie. The director showed talent in his other projects, but it just seemed to be fulfilling. There may have been a deep sense behind that, but it does not seem to me to be a director who has access to toys. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend his other works to people, but certainly not that one. As I watched it, I thought it would resume after a slow initial period, but it never happened. At the end of the film, I was neither entertained nor moved, nor thought in any other way. I could only say to myself, "What was it?" <br /> <br /> There were some really striking parts of the movie, but not enough to warrant a second reading.
