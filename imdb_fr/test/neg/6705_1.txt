Even if "The Adam House" is supposed to be a traditional gay movie; that Anthony (John Shaw), who is a curious gay and a major cutie guy and Adam (Jared Cadwell) who is openly gay, and a close second in appearance; 41 minutes of film beginning in the film (that may not be enough for many of us) - despite all this (to which "The House of Adam" is a horrible film by most filming standards. boost. <br /> <br /> The acting abilities of Shaw and Cadwell are either sophomoric, or they really suffer from the wrong script, the wrong direction and the wrong editing, or rather their absence. love scene is nonetheless compelling and perhaps more so because they are really one in the other, given the rest of their storyline and their acting. <br /> <br /> L author-director Jorge Amer (Bonus Feature) welcomes himself as to his filmmaking skills is out of the wall. <br /> <br /> So, the script and its absence is a thumbs down On the whole, the acting is disappointing, with the slightest exception for Shaw and Cadwell Alexis Karriker as that Nina could have been the best except the limitations expressed above. Thomas Michael Kappier plays Albert Ross, Anthony's father, who does not even have the quality of a primary school comedian. It really represents a colossal casting failure. <br /> <br /> Actors who play the new owner of the cabin also deserve really bad appointments. <br /> <br /> Except that the production, editing and post-production were as good as the trailer, this film would have been something else. The trailer features well-edited excerpts of scenes that led me to rent the movie. That, and the hope that this gay-themed film, would have been played and touted very prominently in gay film festivals. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is disappointing. <br /> <br /> worth buying / renting and watching? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the scene of the making of naked love, and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you just like watching bad movies.
