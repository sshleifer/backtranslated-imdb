It's a poor movie. How not to make a feature film category? The story, the direction, the acting and the style are all flat like pancakes. The story consists of five ?? yes five ?? the football games are spread over the duration of the film, each shot in a more boring way than the previous one, while a dysfunctional amateur football team gets stronger. That's it, it's the plot. It's hard to know who this movie is for. It's too commonplace for football fans and there is nothing for teenagers or adults. There is nothing for women either, there is not even a single female character. His gloom runs out as the team plays part after game, part after game. The story as it is, the dialogue and the manners seem to come out of past Ireland, with all the actors springing from theatrical accents of Dublin. You must not see it to believe it. Avoid at all costs. Can someone give me back my 90 minutes? Strong point credits in the end, low point too numerous to mention. Brendan Gleeson is in this movie.
