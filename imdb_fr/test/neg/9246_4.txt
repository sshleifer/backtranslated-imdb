Too fractured to be pleasant, too vague to be interesting and too awkwardly photographed to be bearable M. LONELY is an interesting idea ruined by a very bad cinematic realization. Like a film by Ken Russell at its worst, or DAY OF THE LOCUST done by amateurs, Mr. LONELY might have seemed like a good idea on some pieces of paper (no script, you see) and a free vacation somewhere, But finally, we have a big screen movie that seems to have been made by film students whose parents told them that EVERYTHING they had done was a brilliant creation. Or did I understand the filmmaker? Mr. LONELY is a waste of resources, trying to be (gawd!) Offset and deliberately off the mark. It ends up being boring and indulgent .. and useless. What is the point of going to a municipality in Scotland? What a stupid idea in this film of Hollywood madness. Maybe Korine wanted to redo GODSPELL ... well, the result is GODSPELL. Oh, and there are subplots such as the remains of FITZCARRALDO, including Werner Herzog, nuns and a plane. Add slow, melancholic music drifting and fiddling, add James Fox who seems to be hoping to be perceived as daring (as in PERFORMANCE). The result is a fantastic alphabet soup made from amphetamine. It may have been fun to film, but the result on the screen is a disaster. Imagine American PIE BAND CAMP with food poisoning.
