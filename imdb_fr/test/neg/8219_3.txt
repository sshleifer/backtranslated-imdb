Of all the directors ever sitting behind a camera, Wellman could break your heart faster than anyone. Even Ford. But it's one of his worst. Even he seemed to know, probably because of his juvenile treatment, not much above a Bonanza or a large valley. <br /> <br /> Yet, there's a typical Wellman moment that comes from nowhere to break you down, the death of Gable's Indian woman. She went to give water to her baby and WHAM is killed instantly by an arrow. No warning. Nada. <br /> <br /> One of the most shocking, unprepared for death in all cinemas. Especially after investing an hour of love for this lady in what appeared to be a cursed western. Of course, the treatment that is reserved thereafter is charged, it seems, the total indifference of Wellman with regard to the film. Even so, he recalls the power he always had the best.
