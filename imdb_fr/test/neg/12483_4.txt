Born in 1988, Touch Of Death is probably the most frustrating film I've ever seen in Fulci, which made me join the chorus of horror fans who tend to think his films are getting worse. as his career progresses. In view of the synopsis of the plot, I expected a cursed pleasure with it, but despite its strange frills, it is tedious, even after an autonomy of only 80 minutes, and suffers from nauseating production values ​​and the art of making cinema (or its absence). <br /> <br /> El Story: A wine addicted to wine, widowed and rich dinners (and strange) that he discovers through solitary columns of hearts, before offering them in a macabre way - eating or sometimes feeding them animals - and steal their money to keep his debtors at bay. Of course, it is unlikely that a single man is the host of such a pathology at the same time (drug addict, psychopath / sociopath, cannibal), but it is Fulci! <br /> <br /> Touch is actually the cheapest and the most scattered Fulci movie I've seen. There is hardly anyone in there, even in the background of shots on the street, for example. A newsreader that continues to appear on the TVs of the film to warn the non-existent casting of the latest acts of the maniac operates from the most pathetic television studio on the planet. He can never even look at the camera because he has to read all the titles on misaligned sheets of paper. <br /> <br /> Some scenes unfold constantly, the protagonist mumbling alone about what he did or what he is about to do, but the acting is far from to be good enough to support this kind of thing, so the main result is the boredom of the viewer. The film also has a bland and ugly appearance in general. I read that it was an Italian TV movie (has it already been screened in this room? Given the magnitude of the gore, it seems unlikely), and it stinks the old values ​​of the telemovie production. <br /> <It's also Fulci's first foray into black humor, but he's just too much a director to make it work. Sometimes, remarkably cheerful or "crazy" music is used to play against a macabre scene, for example when the hero / villain is carving a corpse in his basement. The effect is not really terrifying, neither funny nor ironic, but what you would like it to be is mostly simply hideous and fearful. <br /> <br /> There are of course redeeming redemption moments (waiting for you while trying to stay awake), including the baking (!) of a woman who just does not want to leave the house. life, even after his face has been totally demolished with an awesome club and a homeless man who gets a car running on him about five times. Touch's most outrageous element, however, is all the physical deformity on widows courted by the madman. Beards, hairy moles, messy hips - it's not like he's looking for women with these characteristics, it's just the way all widows with solitary hearts are, apparently. There are lots of shots of Mr. Crazy grimacing in secret as he pampers these women. The dark humor of this shrieking misogyny might have some power or resonance if the movie was not so badly executed in general. In the end, Touch Of Death appears as a really lazy and inarticulate mess.
