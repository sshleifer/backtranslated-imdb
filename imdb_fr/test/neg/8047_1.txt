... a film arrives that manages to be absolutely terrible, from the opening title to the logo of the studio marked at the end of the closing credits. It was such a movie - the very type that you can not stop watching for fear of missing a moment of its always decreasing quality. <br /> <br /> Forget the small budget indicated by a slow and monotonous opening sequence that shows agents of the secret services who rub shoulders with a presidential procession without crowds, traffic or place discernible. Forget the tangled logic needed to make even the plot plausible. Forget the fact that Roy Scheider delivers some of the most fascinating dialogues while not completely concealing his shame. <br /> <br /> This clunker is terribly rhythmic, bombarded by a simply laughable score and seems published by a third student. While trying to hide the most difficult scenario to film a presidential plot at a discount: to make it pass for presidential. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I fell asleep briefly in the last roll, and when I woke up, I ran back to not miss a single unbearable frame. Try this drinking game: take a picture every time you see it blatantly ring for another, much better movie. You will doze too. <br /> <br /> It's not since "The Man" with Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy that I've seen a project so deliciously irretrievable. I can distribute copies as Christmas presents. Zero stars. A thousand bursts of laughter.
