Among the many awards presented here for this production, there was an individual whose comments asked if he was the only one (who was not so enthralled by this), that is to say, he assigns 3 stars to this film. However, the commentary continued to indicate a general taste of the story and another production of it. Well, this person is not the "only", who did not like this production (with me!), But I even separate with it. If you put a weapon in my head and asked me to choose between shooting me or watching this movie again, I would certainly watch it - but I would probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. I would much rather be locked in an isolation cell or have to watch the paint dry on a wall, though. Moreover, I would not want to see this story again, anytime, anywhere or in any alternative presentation. Sometimes it feels like the comedian George Gobel's pair of brown shoes, while the rest of the world is a tuxedo, and that's one of them for me. I loved Angela Lansbury in one of my favorite movies, "Long Hot Summer" and, although I'm not a big fan of the show, I enjoyed "Murder, She Wrote". But HERE - Not only did I not like the story or other aspects, but I found Angela's screams, moans, songs, and everything about her exaggerated performance, maybe the presence of her. more distressing in a movie (or presentation in any other media) that I have ever experienced. It looked like an endless continuation of Audrey Hepburn's equally "exaggerated" chuckling Cockney at Rex Harrison - in the opening parts of "My Fair Lady". But it was an incident related to the plot, presented for a light, a comic effect and (fortunately) short. Without mercy, it was far from brief and I had the impression that it had lasted for about 10 hours (the explanation of "relativity" given by a profane Einstein.) If I had not been with friends, with the need to stay, MY viewing would have been brief. However, I laugh at the episode "Seinfeld" where Elaine pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she did not like "The English Patient". My friends looked at me a little in the same way when I interrupted them with ecstasy in front of this film. Give me at any time a few slippery fingers on a blackboard.
