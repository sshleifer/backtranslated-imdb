This short film by Harold Lloyd was not much; not one of his funniest efforts. Of course, I never see stupid kids as hilarious kids. This is the essence of this story: Harold and his wife, Mildred Davis, keep two beautiful children from his in-laws. One is a baby who cries constantly and the other is a four-year-old terrorist who does everything except undo the house. Letting the kid wreak havoc over and over again did not make me laugh. <br /> <br /> The best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thought this big fool (Noah Young) was burglarizing their house. Half the time, it's the cat that scares the couple, but overall, this segment is fun, with good gags of sight, reminding me of another Lloyd's short film, "Haunted Spooks". <br /> <br /> However, the good end does not save the entire image, which I would probably not look at anymore. Lloyd did too many other good things to make him lose another 25 minutes. It's just not so funny.
