Welcome to Plan 9 of the outer space of Star Trek movies. Come on, trekkers, admit it. This film is so bad, so inept in every department, that it has become a classic. <br /> <br /> The Shat offers the worst performance ever of celluloid. "BOONES! Hi, Bones" Brilliant! It's not fair Ham - these are several large hog farms in Kentucky! <br /> <br /> The "special" effects. Should be done under the law on commercial descriptions to use such a term. The Enterprise is a moving cardboard in this movie. Really! Even the TV series Star Trek had better. <br /> <br /> Bones, Spock and The Shat sing! Yeah, Spock sings Row Row Row Your Boat. After struggling on the meaning of words !!!! "Life is not a dream." Poor Leonard Nimoy, he really needs to strangle Shatner for that. Could not the Shat have given us his interpretation of Mr. Tambourine Man or his harmonization with Nimoy on Ballad of Bilbo Baggins? Seriously disappointed. <br /> <br /> A lookalike Sean Connery plays Spock's half-brother. Only because they could not have Sean Connery! Uhura is a fan dance! That would have been sexy in 1966. In 1989, it's like watching your drunken grandmother embarrass herself at a Christmas party. <br /> <br /> A cat woman jumps on Shatner's back! Shat twirls her a few times as a WWF wrestler and rejects her. Yayy the Shat! Apparently, Connery 2.0 was a bit of a Vulcan rebel. Which is why Spock has not mentioned it yet in 79 TV episodes and 4 movies. McCoy apparently killed his father out of pity, BUT AFTER BEFORE, HE FOUND A CURE. Tell me it's not hysterically funny. <br /> <br /> Enterprise at 11 Bridges suddenly needs 400 more bridges for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft. Spock's antigrav boots provide amazing support for Bones and The Shat. Should have also used them on humpback whales in Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or what claims to be God, but I guess it's really a kind of extraterrestrial being. God looks a little like Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments. Sean Connery the 2nd calls God to share his pain and dies quickly. Or something. God punishes the Shat for questioning his identity. Spock kills God with a photon torpedo. I would really like to know what Jehovah's Witnesses did with this scene. <br /> <br /> The Shat, having killed God, quickly returns to his song with Spock and Bones. In total now, Row Row Row Your Boat .....
