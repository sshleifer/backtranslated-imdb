I wrote spoiler alert, but there is not much to spoil. It's like spoiling spoiled meat. This movie is probably the worst I have ever seen. Not because of actors or special effects, but because of the number of errors, both factual and physical. First, MIGs are not MIGs at all. They are mirages and they are French. And how on earth can Doug's father stand up to his son's maneuvers to fight the "MIG" without a suit? And why would Chappy try to get on his plane without a suit? And how was Doug able to defeat the ace pilot with such ease? In any case, I did not like this film. And the worst part is that it has 3 suites, the last one in 1995. It's scary.
