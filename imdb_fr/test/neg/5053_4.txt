I did it about mid-way through this movie, and at that point I realized that I did not really care about the end of the movie. It's basically a sweet teen comedy I watched because I like Helen Mirren, who is actually very good as an incredibly cruel teacher. <br /> <br /> The basic idea of ​​the film (or the first half, for example) of the film, since I do not know - or do not care - how the second half goes) has already been done , especially from 9 to 5, and a comparison between the two shows how completely wrong Tingle is. You must have the feeling that things are getting out of control in a way that makes you feel that events are inevitable and that you need interesting, well-defined characters that are important to you and you do not have that. It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it never caught me for a second.
