Planet Earth has suffered a terrible environmental disaster. Humanity has thus survived the clandestinity divided into different religious cults. What caused the disaster? I have no idea ? why is humanity divided into different ecclesiastical factions? I have no idea . Since the surface of the Earth can no longer support human life, how are humans able to grow crops to feed the population? I have no idea . What kind of producer thought this scenario deserved funding? I do not know at all. <br /> <br /> SHEPHERD is one of those movies that comes late into the night on cable channels. The kind of movie where you check out the IMBb to see if it has any merits. The number of people who have commented SHEPHERD on this page has not yet reached double digits and this is a film released nine years ago. Maybe those who have never seen it are the lucky ones? <br /> <br /> For the rest of the plot, it's a routine. Boris Dakota, a former grumpy cop, whose wife and child died several years ago, met a woman and her child. It's up to him to save their lives, almost like a futuristic western. Add to that a former wrestler who now runs the God channel, a fascist type of Christian who is trying to smother Boris, a ventriloquist, a little T & A for the sake of it and you have a messy movie. After seeing Neil Marshall's DOOMSDAY, I guess it may be a cinematic masterpiece in comparison
