The unthinkable happened. After witnessing it a few years ago, I had a film that was my horror reference and was called "McCinsey Island". A family adventure film with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I do not invent it), it plunges into new depths and is still the only film I've seen that makes me wonder what the movie budget could have represented. passed on. Like new schools or drugs to treat cancer. However, for pure and unmixed levels of shit, any movie will have to lower its standards even lower if it wants to make "Guest House Paradiso" the distinction of being one of the worst films I've ever had. to watch. <br /> <br /> Founded vaguely around the childish but amusing television series "Bottom", this film presents two of the biggest losers imaginable. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel manager, as unpleasant as anyone can imagine and so relocating that it almost overflows with mud. His buddy Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is an alcoholic mess of human life and together they are trying to run the worst hotel in Britain located atop a cliff near a nuclear power plant. Between them, they engage at regular intervals to violence of cartoonism (with sound effects), stealing anything that is valuable or interesting to the fools who stay there and nostalgically fix any woman. The plot, as it stands, involves the arrival of the goddess of the legendary Italian screen Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel) who flees her marriage and tries to fall asleep at Guest House Paradiso, to the astonishment of Richie and Eddie. And that's all. <br /> <br /> I used to think that Carry On movies represented everything that hurt the British film industry and God knows we spent a lot of time and money trying to escape this terrible god inheritance. We had movies like "Trainspotting", "28 Days Later", "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and the brilliant "Shaun Of The Dead" (also starring Simon Pegg), but that ... it drags these screaming movies let's go back to the days when Sid James and Barbara Windsor flew away with a bicycle whistle. "Guest House Paradiso" has so little ambition that it insults you the very minute you look at it. I kept looking, eagerly awaiting the start of jokes, but they never came. Just an endless stream of booby pimples, unimaginative scenarios that defy explanations, a slightly amusing violence with frying pans and refrigerator doors, and almost nothing that stirs a sly smile. Come on the first commercial break (it was on TV, you see) and I was ready to turn off but my faithful duties towards you, my readers, allowed me to continue. "I'm looking at it so they do not have to do it" became my mantra for you to remember how much you owe it to me because it was about as much fun as having sand in the eyes and feed me forcibly. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I loved the TV show "Bottom". The suitably dirty combination of Mayall and Edmondson's roles with OTT's juvenile humor worked ... for half an hour each week. Certainly not before half-past one, as Edmondson and Mayall indulge in their private joke and bore and depress the rest of the public. Honestly, it gives Mayall's "Drop Dead Fred" to "The Godfather" and if you meet one of those two people (who are pretty much responsible for the chaos on screen that pretends to be a movie), do not hesitate to have him quickly deliver a boot to their testicular area. They would probably appreciate it. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both guests at the hotel) are trained with this sinking ship but at least they have survived. Mayall and Edmondson should not be so lucky. The film equivalent of Chernobyl and should be avoided as such.
