I can accept the fact that it was the child of NEXT karate so that Ralph Macchio could withdraw from the series and that although Hillary Swank is great for the role .... the plot of the film is horrible. <br /> <br /> Mr. Miyagi's old friend of the Second World War dies, leaving his widow to take care of his rebellious granddaughter when his parents die in an accident. The girl has no discipline yet, it's the hero because the local ROTC ... that I'll explain in a minute, has the will to look for it. You know the exercise ... Miyagi takes her under her wing and at the end, they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happy forever. <br /> <br /> His hokey, it's nerdy, it's the 90s .... but it's not even long and short of it. My first case of "huh?" Why is there a "military division" in high school? I thought that sort of thing was out in the 1960s, especially in a public school. As much as Michael Ironside plays loot in his role as main stub, since when are the military involved in a high school? My next complaint is that during the end-of-the-year ball scene, activists jump in bungees to scare people ... why? What I noticed throughout the 4 films is that the stubs suddenly turned against all the nonsense they had committed to the main character (Billy in Part 1, Sato in Part 2, Kreese in part 3). This film is no different. After Ned and his buddies sabotage the prom, Eric's car explodes and threatens Hillary Swank with the whole movie ..... Ironside tells them to beat her up and they're like "uh ... no" Make pathetic faces, at least make sure the characters have not done anything too much, like blowing up a hot rod. <br /> <br /> Regarding the rest of the love affair between Eric and Hillary Swank. ... corny but nothing melodramatic, which is a breath of fresh air from the trash Ralph Macchio shot in the first 3 movies. <br /> <br /> I'll say for his own movie, after watching the first 3 movies I can accept that it's more or less a spin-off ... but I can not accept the whole system military, far too rare for him to be taken seriously. Now, if Ironside and his team were a wrestling / football team and coached, CELA would have been more credible. <br /> <br /> Ironside and Morita deliver the goods, Swank goes well ... the others are the same as anything, the highlight is when they blow up the hot rod, which was cool 4 out of 10
