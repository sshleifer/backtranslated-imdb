This is said to be the first Polish western and is written and directed by Piotr Uklanski. Known in the US as DEAD MAN'S BOUNTY, this film uses strange visuals to tell a story without dialogue. Val Kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes. Some uncomfortable visual situations are actually comical and unhealthy. My favorite is a young man who builds a gallows cuts his finger and clings to test the strength of the rope. A cowboy known only as "the stranger" (Karel Roden) finds a dead man (Kilmer) he thinks is a wanted man. He takes her to the nearest city to collect the bonus. He ends up losing the corpse and the potential bonus in a game of chance with the city's drunk sheriff (Boguslaw Linda) and makes sure that the few townspeople turn against him when he has a penchant for the waitress (Katarzyna Figura ). He manages to escape certain death and leads the small group into a dangerous "wild goose hunt". In one of the scenes, the stranger tends to injure the scalp by cauterizing with gunpowder and a match. The corpse rots chained to a hitch while the sheriff discovers there is no bonus to be earned. This film, also known as SUMMER LOVE, contains a haunted theme song performed by John Davidson. Nevertheless, this western looks like watching a train wreck. There is just something that tells you not to look ... but you do.
