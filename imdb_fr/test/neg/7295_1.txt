If you saw Atlantis 1, then you would know that what makes this movie really great is a brilliant animation and a good storyline. This film was so badly drawn and animated. The story is also doped. I was so disappointed with this half-cooked cooked that I could not get past the first hour and MAN tried! The only thing this film had was that he was expanding the character "mole", making it both more likeable and three-dimensional. Take it to me, judge this junk from the cover of the video box. The cover is poorly designed by Disney Schlock, looking for easy money for an unsuspecting parent. If it were an independent film, it would not be so bad, but rolling on the images of a brilliant film like Atlantis makes it totally inexcusable.
