If you want a good April Fool's joke, show this film, by any means, to someone. However, it is important that you never criticize the film, but rather talk about what is an artistic triumph and how "they just do not make great movies like this". While your victim is looking at many disconnected and absurd scenes (like a cute dog getting stung for no apparent reason, a cow standing on the bed, a woman licking the feet of a statue or Jesus apparently raping a woman), do many comments using words such as "Shine", "Juxtaposed" or "Transcendent" - while acting as if the film made sense and was not a total loss of one hour of your life. Also be sure to keep your face impassive and simulate a shock when (and if) they say either they did not understand it or they thought they had all the artistic talent of a cow slab. Then, to complicate them further, show them all the comments on IMDb, because almost all (with the exception of some troublemakers like almagz and rooprect) speak eloquently of the genius and art of this film! When you are done with this little charade, they will probably say they are idiots and will make an appointment with a psychologist. <br /> <br /> This is, in my eyes, the ONLY possible reason to watch this horrible mess of a movie !!! That, or you can show it to the Guantanamo prisoners to make them talk! <br /> <br /> If you ask me, the famous painting of dogs playing poker or an Elvis velvet painting is superior from an artistic point of view.
