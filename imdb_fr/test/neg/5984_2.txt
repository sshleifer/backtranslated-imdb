It begins by giving the impression of going somewhere, then quickly leads the main characters in a circus with three rings of remarkable stupidity that permanently destroys any sympathy of the characters. I am a huge collector of stoner movies, but I would not consider this a valid addition. Bong Water is a waste from the deepest areas of the dumpster, and I would not be caught off guard on my shelf. I am convinced that this film was created by a partnership for a drug free America. If you are a fan of Jack Black, I would say that you may think that 5 minutes of films are acceptable because Jack Black continues to sing songs to delay them. I really can not say enough bad things about this movie.
