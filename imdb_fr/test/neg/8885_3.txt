This movie had very few positives, the special effects and the acting of the actors was horrible for sure. But it was a film made with a small budget, so you do not expect much, it has bursts of laughter (I doubt they are intended however :)). The scene where the old woman bends down and touches the droppings that were on the floor, then puts it on her nose and goes CHUPACABRA! in a really stupid rasping voice was priceless. All in all, if you do not have anything else to watch and just want to laugh at a really crappy movie that is trying to take advantage of the success of the Blair Witch project, then grab it otherwise so do not mind .
