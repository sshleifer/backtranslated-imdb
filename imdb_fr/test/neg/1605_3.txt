I hoped this show was a bit realistic. It caressed me just like another mainstream show after watching it. I did not feel the characters at all. Is this glorified idea of ​​the Americas about the functioning of terrorism? The main character does not behave like a fundamentalist at all, and the way he passes for a terrorist is beyond my comprehension. None of the other terrorists managed to seem authentic. One of the members, a blond white boy of American descent, would never be accepted by Muslim terrorists. Another member, a former French skinhead, is not part of an Islamic terrorist movement. In addition, the terrorists have sex with white American housewives, which I find very strange. This is just another stupid American TV show gone astray. It's about as realistic as Prison Break.
