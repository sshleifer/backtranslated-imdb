OK, so this movie is well played. It works in the right direction, but the fact is that it undermines everything that gay and lesbians have been fighting for years. The heterosexual man "deciding to be gay" and the homosexual man "Deciding to be heterosexual" I enjoyed it until the last 20 minutes, after that I really offended. Like what usually happens in these films, heterosexual actors play the main roles and homosexual actors play secondary, secondary roles. The main roles are played by handsome men, but do not be distracted by the fact that this is a film that leaves you uncomfortable. All the romance and relationships you hope to see happen are not. Unless you are a priest, in this case, God bless a righteous woman who heals our homos.
