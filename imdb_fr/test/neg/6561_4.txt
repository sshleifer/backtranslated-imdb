The weakest of the "old" Star Trek team films, this film suffers from a horrific scenario and obvious budget constraints, especially in the mismanaged final. The strengths of a good movie are there, and the staging of Shatner is not as bad as generally believed, but the characters end up talking and behaving very differently from the style that the previous 3 films had carefully put in place. Lawrence Luckinbull is convincing as Vulcan renegade with mysterious and mystical powers to influence people. These powers are responsible for some of the best scenes, especially Deforest Kelley who shines as 'Bones' McCoy in his latest film. However, as good as these scenes are, they do not finally advance the plot and end up feeling more like a distraction. A good score from the always reliable Goldsmith and some amusing scenes in Yosemite between the top three are not enough to cover the gaping abysses of the plot, and frankly embarrassing attempts at humor only serve to alienate even hard hikers. All in all, a wealth of possibilities that, although it fails to deliver, has its moments. Watch the pool table in the bar fight scene ...
