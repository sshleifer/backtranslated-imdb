this show bothers me. it occupies slots that could be reserved for the new prince or George Lopez. even full house and Roseanne. they are all better than home improvement. First of all, Mother Jill annoys me so much. she is a hypersensitive whiny baby and I really despise her. Brad is a big toad and he's also annoying. and youngest brother, I do not even know his name! I do not notice it at all! it's probably not the actor's fault, it's probably the writer's fault. Tim is just a stupid ass. Although Jill is definitely my least favorite, I do not like them. The only reason I gave this stupid three-star show is that a star goes to Randy. as a child in the middle, he is still a pesky little brother, but a big brother and I like his funny character. the other star goes to Al. as a chubby friend, his character is sympathetic. other than randy et al, this show is bad.
