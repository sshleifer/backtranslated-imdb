I am an avid reader of Temperance Brennan novels by Kathy Reichs. As such, I am extremely surprised that she even consulted for this show. <br /> <br /> It's horrible compared to books. The character of Temperance Brennan is, in the books, a relaxed, alcoholic and divorced mother, of an old college girl. In 'Bones', she is arrogant (rhyme with rich), who, in the typical manner of P C, is not a mother. The focus on his support staff, with sordid details about the perpetrators of many sexual exploits, contrasts completely with the books. <br /> <br /> By total deference to the PC movement, she portrays the enemies of the United States as a peace lover (!). Some information is not even correct, such as having an Afghan character as an active member of an Arab-American friendship group. Since when is an Afghan Arab ?! I am sure that if negative references were made to "disadvantaged minorities", to women or to GLBT, the producers / writers / directors of the series should apologize. However, in the far left, all racial insults go to the most successful minority group: Asians, David Boreanaz's Booth agent constantly calls Angela Montenegro "strabismus". <br /> <br /> Forget that, and forget about this show. After the episode 'The Man in the SUV', I thought I would try a second episode to see if it was improving. It only got worse! I do not even care if the teenager in question was murdered or committed suicide, and I will never watch the show again.
