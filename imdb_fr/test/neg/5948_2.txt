In fact, all those responsible for this sinking must be flogged, dragged and hanged! If that's Eugene O'Niell's big drama, it's like I never want to be a victim of watching him again. There are so many things FALSE with this feature, where to start? First, the impressive score of Elmer Bernstein is present throughout the film, even in quiet scenes where the background music is removed from the motivations of the character. Secondly, these characters are NOT nice people and although some critics may appreciate that I do not personally like every scene in which Ives eats the scenery, but that's how his characters were written: being hated. W / Loren you never know if she is good or bad ?? and all her bulletin boards on the fact that she was going to change things as they were before the arrival of the baby ?? Well, I saw what would happen clearly. Perkins is a bad start and then he plays a warm-up for Norman Bates (whom he played two years later), even wishing to be held responsible for the murder at the end. Hokey! Third, this film is a sound production on stage and suffers. The story would have taken advantage of the local shots to develop a feeling of "place" vis-Ã -vis the farm (on which all the main tracks are disputed). As it is filmed, the property has no value because the film has a studio-stage feel that is not convincing. It's a really awful movie.
