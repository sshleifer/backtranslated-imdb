There is something in a movie that features female bodybuilders that makes me face to face every time. <br /> <br /> I saw "Pumping Iron II", "Aces: Iron Eagle III", "Raven Hawk" and even the TV movie "Getting Physical", which featured big names in the sport. They were tolerable in their own way (mainly because they featured Rachel McLish, ROWWR !!). <br /> <br /> Then I went to watch "Nemesis III: Prey Harder", only because he Sue Price, Debbie Muggli, Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev. I love ladies, I will always love them, but after that, I'm pretty happy to have missed the first two films of "Nemesis". <br /> <br /> Well, the first, anyway. Most of the pictures here are lifted bodily (and guessing, I guess) from "Nemesis II". In fact, it seemed slightly entertaining in light of the evidence provided here. <br /> <br /> But even if Price and the company are flexible, they have little chance of doing anything else (like, for example, ACT!) In fact, all this film is an exercise ( Get it? Ha-ha ...) oblique tales, ambiguous characters and open shootings (in terms of filming and screenplay). <br /> <br /> Nothing makes sense, but even if it were, there would always be problems, such as creating pieces as small for women as big as life. What crime? <br /> <br /> Of course, it was written and directed by Albert Pyun. What did you expect from cohesion? <br /> <br /> A single star, in consideration of all the hard work that Price, Muggli, Bruneau and Sarcev have obviously put in their bodies, NOT the "craft" work done in the very frame of the film. <br /> <br /> Thank you, ladies.
