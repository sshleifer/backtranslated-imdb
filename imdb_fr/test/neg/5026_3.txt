Let me say it from the beginning. I do not hate this show. In fact, I like certain aspects. In fact, when I started to watch him, I quickly became hooked. I was just getting out of the whole stereotype "the anime is for kids", and the mature elements of the show intrigued me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after going through the entire series and movies, I can say that my overall disposition has changed, and it falls into almost every trap that plagues "bad" anime. Seven or eight friends and I started watching this series on television. In the end, only one friend and I were still watching and we did not like it. <br /> <br /> Let me explain the plot. You can ignore this paragraph if you do not want to know. Kagome is a middle school student who falls one day in a magical well near her family sanctuary. When Kagome came out again from the well, she was transported back in time to the feudal era of Japan. She meets many other characters and they form a group of about five companions who begin a journey of revenge / justice / groping in a case of characters =). On the whole, they are trying to recover the fragments of the sacred jewel, which reinforces the power of the demons who use it. <br /> <br /> Although there are many side stories and story arcs, there are not enough. material to occupy 167 episodes. The only interesting story to be watched is always boring (the group of seven). After the mid-run of the series or perhaps even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen and that the creator of the series has decided to set up dozens and dozens of episodes of filling. <br /> <br /> These episodes have little or no impact on the story, and rarely even on the characters. In some cases, some characters who have played an important role in the story disappear for dozens of episodes at a time. Many episodes follow exactly the same diagrams as the previous stories. Inuyasha pulls a wind scar on the enemy. Windscar deviates. The characters pant with horror. Enemy turns out to have a barrier. The characters spent three episodes trying to kill the enemy before Kagome finally pulled the sacred arrow at him and turned into dust. <br /> <br /> Also ** BIG SPOILER: THE CONCLUSION WILL BE ANNOUNCED ** The absence of any conclusion gives the impression that you have lost 80 hours. <br /> <br /> ** LARGE SPOILER OVER ** <br /> <br /> The animation itself is above average and, in some cases, excellent. Even so, reused animation cells spoil most action scenes, and it's very hard to ignore them when it's clear that the same block has flown over a character five or six times in a row. <br /> <br /> The best part though, all the characters are very well developed and the novels between some of the characters were really captivating. Plus, the character designs were brilliant and sometimes some of the best I've seen, especially with the group of seven. Here, the opportunities for cosplay are not lacking. Nevertheless, I found myself in the hope that a character would die just so there was some kind of movement in the plot. And some of the humor in the series between the characters is used again and again. A particular joke (sit boy) is in the first five episodes and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes. <br /> <br /> Although the series has some positive aspects and it's easy to see why it's a huge hit, the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan fans who flirt with Sesshomiru and InuYasha. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's definitely worth watching, but not worth watching the entire series. The first 30 episodes are very intelligent, original and enjoyable for everyone. But after that, it just becomes boring and tedious. Watching a TV show should never look like a chore, but in a way, this series accomplishes exactly that. Do not expect a lot of "InuYasha" because you will only feel disappointed.
