I have seen this movie many times, it is certainly one of the cheapest action movies of the eighties. So, I think that many viewers would definitely change channels when they meet this one. But, if you like trash, "Dragon Hunt" is for you. The main characters (the McNamara Twins) wear big mustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses. One of the best scenes is when one of them gets shot in the leg and always hits his enemies with nirvana. This movie is really awful, but again, it's a great party tape!
