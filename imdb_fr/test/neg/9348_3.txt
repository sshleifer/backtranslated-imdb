Sensational. The plot about it was incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comic genre. Nevertheless, even nonsense is supposed to give at least a vague meaning. <br /> <br /> Water has become an incredibly rare substance? <br /> <br /> Well, it's strange, because hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most abundant substances in the universe. And easy enough to do. Glow together atoms of hydrogen and oxygen and that's water. <br /> <br /> Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or something like that would have been used as a plot, as pirates would have it. Water, as intriguing, was just idiotic, idiotic, silly. <br /> <br /> The "comedy" seemed laborious, invented and forced. The comedy of the TV series "Red Dwarf" was laborious, artificial and forced, but in fact it was amusing. Here, instead, I wanted to say, "Oh ah, it was so funny, I forgot to laugh ..." <br /> <br /> Sigh ... all that money set, costumes, actors .. What a mess ... <br /> <br /> Rather than whining and complaining about lameness, my recommendations are: 1) Use a credible plot device. 2) Get rid of "comedy". None of the actors were really good at that. The film would work better as a "serious" action adventure. <br /> <br /> The obvious intention of the writers was to make a deceptive comedy, but they did not quite quite successful. It is unlikely that I will look at this again. It's too much of a total piracy job.
