Detective Burt Williams is on the trail of the infamous Poe killer for almost three years. Kris Williams, the daughter of Burt, homicide agent for the FBI and her partner, Sean Michaels, take over. Burt reluctantly leaves the business and retires. Seven months later, the "Poe Killer" continues his lethal murder until Kris discovers that the killer uses Internet chat rooms to seduce his prey. She connects under the name of Annabel Lee and is quickly captured by the Poe killer.It's time for Burt to find the sadist releasing his daughter before it's too late.Hamorous horror film and supremely braindead without suspense and a bit of nasty gore.The acting is hilarious, the characters are painfully dumb and the killer is not threatening.I saw the worst indie horror movie .3 out of 10.
