This film essentially tries to depict the heroism of firefighters by making sure that the entire film revolves around an American father with a good heart that puts others in front of himself. Now, I know they're trying to show Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) a typical American father who's a firefighter, but like anything else, nothing interesting about him. emotion. This movie basically tries to make the life of firefighter exciting, but it is as boring as any other job, except that you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire. John Travolta plays the captain of the fire station but anyone could have played his role and he is a dull character like the rest of the movie. What could have been a good movie is that firefighters are considered heroes because they are firefighters and turn the whole scenario into an uninspiring melodrama. <br /> <br /> 4.9 / 10
