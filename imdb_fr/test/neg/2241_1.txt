Countless historical and cultural mistakes 0/10 <br /> <br /> (1) A Jewish guy named OMAR !!! Hahahaha (2) The brilliant detective was kidnapped by the least intelligent guy in the movie! (3) Jewish suicide bombers !! It was fun. (4) Hitler and his best guns went to watch a movie in downtown Paris !!! With two guards at the door. !! pulls me. (5) Brad Pitt was overexploited and it was painful to watch him. (6) Mr. QT is rewriting the story. "Hitler was killed in a theater, really!" the funny thing about it is that people "and I mean stupid people" will actually believe this plot. <br /> <br /> And finally, can anyone tell me how this film managed to be among the 250 best films of all time !!! Shame Shame Shame, I wonder how anyone can like this movie.
