I saw him late at night on a minor chain and I put him on hold for a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor and I thought he could be a good actor / actor of the same quality as Richard Pryor. <br /> <br /> I could not have been more wrong. This concert was awful. It was full of racist comments directed against Whites, Muslims and Indians (Muslims and Indians are the same thing in Lawrence's narrow mind) and a misguided and clich√©d philosophy of the cod (Lawrence, as many of comics and black filmmakers, can not resist Do we really need a lecture on Martin Luther King and the civil rights struggle at a humorous show?). Then there were his favorite comments intended to make him love to women, it made my skin crawl to listen to him. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, the show was just not funny and I found it boring. I turned back halfway and went back to find him, still preaching, or again and again and again and again on the birth of his child (there was no humor in the story the birth of his child and it was quite indulgent on his part to bore us with the details, he obviously had not much to say, otherwise he would cut this part of the show). <br /> <br /> This show was bad: Runteldat!
