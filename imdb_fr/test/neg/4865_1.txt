I always wonder why I sat through this whole thing. There was only about 3 minutes of entertainment left, the rest was just total boredom. The acting is not great and the action scenes are so bad that it's not even funny. I wish I could say something good about this movie but I can not think of anything for the moment. There was probably something inside that some people can appreciate but the end of it has to be the most stupid idea of ​​all time. What kind of person would get a small remote-controlled helicopter with a burned-out machine gun to assassinate the president? This idea could never have been considered in the beginning, let alone someone stupid enough to try it. I guess the writer had to be obsessed with the toy car scene in The Dead Pool, but he actually tried to make that look serious.
