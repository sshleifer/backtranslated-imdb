A large variety of snakes organize an uprising on tourists "invading" their island because of the damage caused by the boats of their captain. The few surviving survivors who are not caught vulnerable by the snakes will attempt an escape mission, their goal being to flee to the available boats that can get them out of the island safely. <br /> <br /> Presented straight ahead with injected doses of visual humor with many snake gags, Wayne Crawford's SNAKE ISLAND features many different breeds of slithery predators, in striking position, ready to attack their prey . Star William Katt, as an author in search of snakes for a forthcoming novel, enjoys acting alongside writer / director / co-star Wayne Crawford (.. as captain of a tour boat ) as passionate heroes crisis. Kate Connor is the attractive love interest of Crawford, a lawyer on vacation. The other members of the cast are either tourists or crew members, mainly snake feed. <br /> <br /> As in many other films of this type, the director Crawford presents snakes live with those generated by computer, and the violence is really docile. Crawford even incorporates the point-of-view technique with the camera as the snake's eyes facing the potential victim (with the actor looking directly into the camera). Never be taken seriously, the ironic approach was probably the best way to photograph SNAKE ISLAND, because the principle is simply ridiculous to accept alone. <br /> <br /> The scenes of effects and suspense rarely work. because Crawford is often unable to successfully stage sequences where humans face snakes. Snake attacks themselves never arrive on the screen (one or two vertices), or are so softly presented that they leave little impression. It's a no-no for a genre like this. Katt fans will probably want to check this out because it provides a facial comedy that sets the general tone of some scenes where it has to defend itself against snakes. The scenes of CGI where we see a large number of snakes in a general area are not very effective, which removes the realism that Crawford would have tried to establish. There are many better horror movies depicting snakes as sneakers compared to SNAKE ISLAND. Surprising moments of nudity, relegated to a scene where tourists and crew relax after a long day with the bubbles, not knowing what danger is waiting for us.
