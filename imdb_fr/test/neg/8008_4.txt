I think that saying that this film has too much is not what makes it bad. Twists are not the problem of the film. The story is pretty smart and could have been very cool if filmed properly. The main reason everyone complains about the film's twists and turns is that the film is not fascinating enough for people to follow. The film is badly shot (at least in comparison with his brother Lock, Stock). Worse: the characters are (although often well played) simply flat. The characters do not have enough time to be introduced enough to allow the viewer to get involved in one of them, let alone to understand them. Oh, and the places are just terrible: person-places (I did not bother to look at the credits of your name) - get another job (maybe still photography or interior design)
