My mother did not let me watch this movie when I was in Grade 2 because she said it was too violent. Well, years later, and the only reason I remember this movie is because of my mom, I stayed awake and I watched it on PBS. Well, maybe the accumulation after all these years has led to the big disappointment of this film, but I found it lame. It has not aged well, which has caused tremendous and incredible agitations in the screenplay, but there are some cool scenes like car chases and a big fight. I will not be coming back for this movie.
