Jill Ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a renowned actress and producer, was the penultimate appearance in the film. Ireland made a lot of waves in the press when she abandoned her husband at the time, David McCallum, in 1967, at the beginning of his long relationship with Charles Bronson. It is very ironic that Bronson, probably the number one on-screen death, has had one of the most enduring marriages in film history. <br /> <br /> "The assassination" seems to be a movie that has been inscribed in Cannon's production program in the interest of Bronson and Ireland. Ireland was already suffering from cancer-related diseases in 1987 and you can almost imagine that both actors want to do "just one more, for the good old days". "Assassination" is done carelessly as a whole, which shows the lack of financial means and the decrease of the funds that could allow Cannon by 1990. But it is rather nostalgic to see the couple gathered one last time and one wonders which helps relationship to survive in the chaos that is Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Bronson plays Jay Killian, a senior secret service agent to protect First Lady Lara Craig (Ireland). The president's wife has the reputation of being difficult, directing public service agents and wanting to do things in her own way. That everything changes, however, when attempts are made in her life and that she must travel with Killian by car, train, motorcycle and, believe it or not, a buggy to escape the potential killers. There is little surprise here because Killian thinks that the murderers are part of an internal job, perhaps organized by the president himself. On the way, Killian and Mrs. Craig develop a tacit affection among themselves in very amusing scenes between Bronson and Ireland. <br /> <br /> What really makes me understand is how this film was promoted when it was released and how it is still made to look like a DVD. The original trailer gives you the feeling that Assassination is another senseless shoot-up-up of Bronson. But much of this film - which has also been rated PG-13 - is in a comical vein, putting it on the model of a romantic thriller like Bronson and the Irish western movie "From noon to three". Even the DVD case shows Bronson with a rocket launcher, ready to blow everything up. What he does, but to a lesser extent than his other cauldrons of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Assassination" is the end of the movie Cannon Slop Work and does not really know what type of movie he wants to be. . In addition to going from actor to romantic thriller, there are serious mistakes in continuity, the value of real estate is cheap and the effects are terrible; many explosions seem to be a dull job, rather than being done on the spot. Robert Ragland, who had shown good composition skills in previous films, teamed up with Valentine McCallum on a largely synthesized and better adapted score for television. <br /> <br /> The scenario of Richard Sale has a real dialogue, with the conversations between Bronson and Ireland are the only positive point. There is no explanation as to why the first lady is suddenly called "One Momma", nor why Ireland ends up with her British accent when the character is from Wyoming. Jan Gan Boyd, who plays the role of Killian's main assistant, has a kitten personality and is very poorly received as a federal agent. Stephen Elliott (former Tony Award nominee who died in May 2005), Randy Brooks, Erik Stern (as Bracken Assassin) and Michael Ansara (Senator Bunsen) are acceptable in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, This was the last concert directed by Peter Hunt, who appeared in 1969 with "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and collaborated with Bronson and Lee Marvin on "Death Hunt" in 1981. "Assassination" is available on DVD at MGM Home Entertainment; it is presented in both widescreen and standard format with subtitles in three languages ​​and theatrical trailer. <br /> <br /> ** out of 4
