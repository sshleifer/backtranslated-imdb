There is an adjective that describes everything about this film - acting, scenario, effects, continuity, etc. - and that word is poor. The government wants to evaluate the effects of space travel on some organisms, but the capsule crashes and a mutant (something else) (looks like a guy in monkey costume wearing the top of a football helmet on his face) wreaks havoc in the scene accident, which includes a favorite spot for the fog party fog out of the window. As a result, some youths, as well as a law enforcement officer, are among the victims of the creature. You must be extremely discreet about how you spend your time - or rich, if you spend money - to view this epic.
