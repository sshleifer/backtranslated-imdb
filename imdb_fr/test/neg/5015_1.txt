If you want a film character to have a disturbing sexual encounter that would make him feel ashamed later in life, there is nothing left but the bestiality that an audience considers as shameful: it's done. Judging by some of the other comments, even those that failed. I do not remember a funny scene, even if I have to admit it, I had to extinguish it before the end. I watched a part of the director's comment and it seems he was as surprised as anyone about the fact that the movie was going well. If you want to have the same feeling as this movie, but only cheaper, put your head in a pile of manure and breathe deeply.
