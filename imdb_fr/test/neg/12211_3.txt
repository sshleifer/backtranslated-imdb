This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I thought at least that I would be able to bear it. But I was wrong. First, the strange loop? It was like watching "The Funniest Videos of America". The damn parents. I hated them so much. The typical Latin stereo family? I have to talk with the person responsible for this. We must have a conversation. That little girl who was still hanging on to someone? I just hated it and I had to mention it. Now, the final scene transcends, I must say. It's so gloriously bad and wicked that it's a movie of its own. What a crappy dance. Horrible and beautiful at the same time.
