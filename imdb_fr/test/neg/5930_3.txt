This film was OK, as far as the movies are concerned. It could have been done as a crossover in secular movies. However, it had little to do with the Left Behind books on which he was supposed to be based. The premises on the main floors have been removed and new premises have been added. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me most is how Nicolae was portrayed. He was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have at this stage in the books. The Antichrist is not Satan, he is neither omniscient nor omnipotent. <br /> <br /> Faith and beliefs have been described in a strange and surreal way, which seems to make the film ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Non-believers who look at it will have more ammunition to make fun of Christian beliefs.
