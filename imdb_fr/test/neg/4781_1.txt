This movie was really awful. It was not at all scary, or even surprising. I went to see him with a group of friends and at the end of the night we said, "The ruins ruined my night." <br /> <br /> I would not recommend seeing this movie in movie theaters, renting it or even watching the movie on television by accident. It's an absolute loss of an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The plot was almost non-existent, the characters were horribly underdeveloped, and they gave no story, whatever happens, and left it completely open at the end, as if it were was preparing for a sequel. .
