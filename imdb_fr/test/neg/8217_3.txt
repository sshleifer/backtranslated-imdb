The film successfully gives a graphic representation of the suffering of forced sex work, but nothing more. The leftmost agenda behind this movie could be seen one kilometer away and leave the viewer so embarrassed by watching if you know that feeling. Thus, women are kidnapped and sent to former Yugoslavia to work as sex slaves because (breathe deeply), the US military institution is corrupt and turns a blind eye while their private security contractors sell people to abroad. You do not need a half-brain to understand the relevance of the war in Iraq and the Black Water Company. <br /> <br /> What a load of excrement left! It seems like all my life I've been fooled into thinking that this and many other problems were a direct result of communism's hold on this region for 45 years. But no, it's the American war against Iraq, which is also responsible for the earthquakes, tropical storms and constipation I had last week. <br /> <br /> The film ignores the fact that 95% of the sex trade is women wanting to sell their bodies for cash and enter the Western bloc. You also see scenes so stupid that you want to pull your hair. We have someone chasing a woman in the streets of London in broad daylight, beating her, then dragging her unconscious body half a mile from the apartment where he raped her. No one sees him or calls the police, and the running woman does not want to scream during the pursuit. Better yet, we see four or five women later lined up in central London under the same day for sale, one of them has a broken face and people are shopping in the background, as if nothing was happening. You can not invent this stupidity. <br /> <br /> I thought such wastes were exclusive to Hollywood, but apparently I was wrong.
