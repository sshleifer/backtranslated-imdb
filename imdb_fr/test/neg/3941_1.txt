Honestly, I was a big fan of the 'Stay Alive' trailer when it was released a few months ago. I kept telling my friend how this movie had a fantastic story - and maybe a good one. Anyway - this movie is a bit below my expectations. <br /> <br /> The plot has great potential, but the way the story unfolds, as well as the acting, the staging and the bad CGI - this film is a disaster. The ghost makes no sense, and including murders - everything is too hasty, which creates an "unrealistic" feeling in the minds of the public. <br /> <br /> This film could scare some audiences - but the fear in a sense of shock (because of the sound effect, etc.) rather than endure the fear because of some valid factors in the film. <br /> <br /> You should reconsider watching this movie.
