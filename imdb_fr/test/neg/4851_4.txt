I do not see what's wrong with this movie. Patricia Kaas sings, yes, and that makes the film charming, but singing is not enough. I mean, if you want to get all the benefits of it, go buy Patricia's CD and enjoy! The plot is simple (if omit the "dreams"); the main characters seem to love each other instantly and immediately forget their other knowledge. Relationships seem almost "mandatory", and the little "police report" added only makes matters worse. What at first seemed to be a perfect movie ending, is first messed up, and then is just a dream. I measure the movies according to my memory, and for this one, I already started to forget the details.
