Superhero Movie (2008) is the latest in the long list of "parodic" movies that I despise so much. I wish this film is the death of the genre, but I know it's not terrible enough to put the last nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> If Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel for Hollywood movies, Super Hero Movie is probably near the top. Unfortunately, Meet the Spartans was actually miles below the barrel, and this movie barely arrived. <br /> <br /> The Superhero movie has a decent cast of celebrities from the C-list. He has Drake Bell (Disney's Drake and Josh kid), Leslie Nielson (Plane!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock) and a few others scattered. Although it has the star power to light a 40-watt light bulb, the movie did not manage to use humor. <br /> <br /> This film lasts about 80 minutes, most of which is devoted to tracking Spiderman's screenplay. no one joke is funny. I did not laugh, laugh or smile all the time. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie. Do not even think about it. For the love of the movies, skip it and maybe they will not go out with another one. <br /> <br /> ... oh, who am I joking about? They will probably go out with another one by the fall.
