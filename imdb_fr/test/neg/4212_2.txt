Breaker! Breaker! Chuck Norris, as a truck driver and karate master, talks about juggling two disparate careers. He gives a load that he can not hand over to his younger brother Michael Augenstein, and when the young man does not show up, Chuck goes looking for him. <br /> <br /> In what did the young Augenstein commit to a speed trap held by Judge George Murdock from Roy Bean School of Jurisprudence. Of course, Norris deals in the usual Chuck Norris way and when he gets in trouble, a call is made by the BC so that all truckers come to help their good friend. This speed trap known as Texas City has a bad reputation and drivers are only too happy to help a friend. <br /> <br /> Chuck is of course a little younger and has no hair on his face. He has the tight look of a man who realizes that the Academy will not look at this gobbler. George Murdock is outrageously scandalous as Justice Roy Bean wants it. <br /> <br /> This is reserved for Chuck Norris fans.
