One of the worst theater films of the year, if not all the time. Anthony Hopkins depreciates by appearing even in this joke. I can not believe that the names of David Mamet and Ridley Scott appear in this parody. Jody Foster's best career decision was to refuse this one. Julianne Moore was as impassive as a Keanu Reeves woman. Gary Oldman was, of course, his brilliant self. He is a crippled victim of Hannibal and the makeup is so good, I did not know it was Gary before the final credits. but eaten by trained boars ??? Leave me alone! Rumor has it that he did not even want his name mentioned in the credits. And fry and feed his own brain to Ray Liotta ... I laughed at the nonsense, do not do this stupidity of this movie at this point. I have not seen so many people coming out of a movie since Who's That Girl. <br /> <br /> Pay someone else to defend you if you must, but do not see it AT ANY PRICE !!!
