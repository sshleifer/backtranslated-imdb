***** Classic **** Excellent *** Good ** Good * Average * Tragic <br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> Oldboy is not for everyone. It is an omnipresent violence, a live octopus consumption and an unimaginable story. <br /> <br /> The film is centered on a kidnapped man imprisoned for 15 years. Oh Dae-Su is released. find his abductor in 5 days. Now, the story may seem captivating at first, but once we look at this swollen and unoriginal feast of blood, it turns into a bitter blood mash and a punchy movie. <br /> <br /> The achievement is comparable to that by no means the standards of what a South Korean thriller should be. Oldboys' play scenes are paralleled with monotonous humor and a badly written script. <br /> <br /> Oldboy is sometimes presented with fine performances in straw on which we could only feel ashamed. <br /> Verdict: <br /> <br /> Not for everyone but its range and vision are not clear enough to see beyond the gray abyss of fog. <br /> <br /> * Tragic
