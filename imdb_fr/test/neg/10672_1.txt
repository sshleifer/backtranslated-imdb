Ego. Looks like that's the only reason this movie was made. This film is so bad in so many ways that it is against the dignity to write a lot about it. Each character was good only for self-praise, and the main actors (I use this term liberally, as the director did) become enmeshed in stone. the little story, if that, fails on fundamental aspects such as logic, feelings and drama. Management leaves a lot to be desired. blatant defects are omnipresent (motivations of the characters are not defined, the future husbands are discovered overnight, the windows of broken cars are corrected among others) <br /> <br /> Let's be honest, Himesh can not do anything make. Hansika Motwani either, it seems. In her defense, she is still a chubby child who looks older than she is with tons of makeup. Raj Babbar overreacts and makes his little presence as false as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughs a little too much. The actor who plays the friend of Himesh is the only natural. <br /> <br /> Some questions come to my mind: how can such a film cost Rs.500.000.000 ?? Where did the money go ??? Granted that a chase sequence had been relatively well drawn and that Mallika Sherawat had received an obscene sum of 15 million rupees for her 15-minute appearance and her 2 songs. but the stupidity of the movie is staggering. (including 3 automatic rickshaws from Mumbai going up and jumping on a police car) <br /> <br /> good: Himesh is brave enough to allow the film to make fun of his nasal voice and his trademark "topi". Give his due to the devil: Himesh, as usual gives good music. <br /> <br /> The Bad: Realization, History, It's still hard to ignore the singing of Himesh <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Dialogs and all the rest !!! <br /> <br /> Final word: Painful in every sense of the word! only watch this film if you liked Subhash Ghai's "Yaadein"
