This film was, in a word, terrible. It was boring, predictable and downright scary. I waited until the end and when that happened, I was horrified. The end has left a bad taste in my mouth, to say the least. My advice to those interested in films about female sexuality budding: stay away from this film. Movies like this give a bad name to classics like Lolita.
