I saw this film and anyway, I did not care. I would not think of going to Paris because I do not like this country and its national capital. Anyway, I do not like to learn French because I do not understand their language. Why should I go to France when I prefer to go to Germany or the UK? Germany and the United Kingdom are the nations I tolerate. Apparently, the Olsen twins do not understand the French language like me. Therefore, I will not disturb the trip to France, no matter what. I might as well stay in the UK and meet single women and play video games if there is a video game room. That's all.
