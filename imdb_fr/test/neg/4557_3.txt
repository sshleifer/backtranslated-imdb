Another stinker from the PM Entertainment group and, thankfully, one of their last. <br /> <br /> "Firetrap" is actually a remake of "The Towering Inferno", whose budget is very modest, "Firetrap" plays no role in the lead role of Dean'Superman'Cain, which is an absolutely terrible actor. Seriously, he has all the acting abilities of a porn star, but he turns out to be the best actor here and who says something, the rest is just a group of non-hopefuls given the start of various soap operas by day. The special effects are just rubbish, the shots showing the building burning on the ground are some of the worst I've ever seen, the fire looks like someone who has scribbled an orange pen in front of the camera. On top of that, there's not one character you're rooted for - you hate everyone and hope they all die well before the 90 minutes are up. <br /> <br /> The script is embarrassing - The red herring are well reported ahead, someone else mentioned that, but 'The scene where the janitor fights a fiery fire engulfing the building with his broom ... hilarious or the same janitor going to a room marked "Dangerous Matter", were these scenes supposed to be the tongue in the cheek? somehow I doubt it <br /> <br /> The only positive point, and the only positive point, is that there was quite a bit of action in the drama series that caught my attention, but so little attention has been given to film, I can not recommend it - look rather 'The dominant hell' <br /> <br /> 3/10
