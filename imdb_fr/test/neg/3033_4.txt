The film goes pretty well, but the acting, the direction and the editing leave a lot to be desired. The characters are mostly from other films and the Vinnie Jones look-alike is quite out of Gone in 50 Seconds. The comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have a lot of contrast, the stupid croupiers of Lock Stock and the shoot that leaves everyone dead. You should never know whether to laugh or just sit in shock. This film had the right elements, but it is too easy to sit like a knitting person and to master the little details that should have been settled somewhere on the line and once the conviction has been suspended, one becomes more in more critical. Too bad, it's a brave attempt and although Clint Eastwood is famous for saying that it would be OK for a scene, he puts the work on stage before shooting and he's Clint Eastwood. Here, a little more imagination with the camera and a little more coaching and repetition for the distribution of the lines would have made a big difference.
