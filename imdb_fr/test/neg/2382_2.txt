Ugh. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. None of the characters are remotely friendly, making this movie difficult to watch. They are all unfortunate thirty-year-olds who do not take responsibility for their lousy lives. I could only survive half an hour of the movie. It is possible that things have improved afterwards, but I doubt it. I can not imagine five people as egocentric as they would be able to stay friends for ten years. <br /> <br /> Three scenes of sex during the first half-hour were also disappointing, as they were a free attempt (failed) to give life to this otherwise dull film. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money, and skip this movie.
