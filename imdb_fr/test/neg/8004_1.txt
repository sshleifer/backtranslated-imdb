This film could have been much better if they did not use Brian Conley as a gangster and if they had not started the film with Christopher Biggins. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, I had absolutely no idea what was going on. There were too many double crosses and intrigues to make the film credible. The film deserves a 0, but since I'm not there, I gave it one. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to my worst enemy, I would prefer that my eyes start to sting. rusty scissors that watch this movie again. I tell you, it was an hour and a half of my life that I would not come back. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a gangster movie, do not worry. Look rather "Going Off Big Time" or "Lock, Stock and Two Barrels Smoking".
