I watched this movie with a group of friends at a Halloween party last night. I must say that the sarcastic comments never ended and I must say they were well deserved. Although I felt that the staging was well done, the madness in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese. I think I went into this business for about an hour before I even realized that the goal was that they were trying to get home by car. You soon understand that this whole family is pretty weird and that something is wrong with them, it's a bit too slow. This film would have easily lasted about 45 minutes and would have been much better. The only thing that made it bearable were the two bottles of wine I swallowed during the movie. Bring the movies to slasher, because at least I know what to expect. It was not my thing, too much black humor, and the subject of cannibalism was a little explicit and rude. I must say that Randy Quaid played the role as well as he could have been, and I'll give him props for that, because I normally see him as a drunk idiot or a hunted fighter pilot who likes to kill extraterrestrials . > In conclusion, I give this horror / comedy film a very generous 3 out of 10.
