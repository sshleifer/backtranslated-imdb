This film was beyond horrible, it was a button among the main players in the film industry. I know that every film can not be a hit, or even a medium, but the responsible parties that came together for this epic movie should have been able to see that they had a time bomb on their hands. I can not help but think that the actors would meet between two scenes and would be consoled to be in such a pile of dung. I can hear it now, "Are you paid?" "Nope, you?" I understand that this film was most probably made on a shoe chain budget, but even with the one taken into account, it could have been better. You wait for the appearance of a monster / creature and when you finally see it, it's a big yawn. I'm so mad at myself for spending 1.07 on this sneaker !!!
