When I saw this for the first time 9 years ago, when I was 9 years old, I thought it smelled bad. I'm 18 now and I still think it stinks. I mean damn it, no special effects or anything, it was boring and a little anti-climatic. My cousin once watched and George Takai (Sulu) went on to say that it was supposed to be so much better, but they continued to cut the budget. It would have been a good episode, but it was a terrible movie.
