It is rare to find a film as bad as it achieves the often-sought-after paradigm of having so little redemptive value that it alone makes it interesting to watch. "Cyclone", I'm happy to announce that it's such a movie. <br /> <br /> I knew something positive would happen as soon as I found the videotape. I'm at least his fourth owner: he wears a "$ 9.95 Used Film Sale" sticker on the front and a yard sticker for a dollar. I picked it up at a thrift store for fifty cents. <br /> <br /> The sale of used films! The sticker covers a large part of the pouch, which means that what I see is a really strange mix of the front of the Cyclone super bike, a car on fire and Heather Thomas, wearing the hair of Flouncy Eighties with open mouth in an expression that says, "My skin hurts." I saw that and thought, "All right." The case, honestly, was enough ("with nowhere to turn and no one to trust, Teri is plunged into a labyrinth of danger and deception"), but I caught myself looking at her. I always take time for very bad movies. This "Fight Club" tape can wait. <br /> <br /> Meet Teri. Teri is an incredibly well-crafted character, as we can see in her introduction, in which she and her friend do exercises that highlight her breasts and, later, her leggings. Then Teri goes to join her boyfriend for the evening which goes terribly wrong. Before she knows it, Teri is trained "directly into a web of deadly double crosses in CYCLONE". The VHS box says it as it is. <br /> <br /> Staying out of the box summary - perhaps just out of hope that actual copies of this movie will be sold - is just how bad the acting is. It may have been just me, but I kept thinking that I could read the characters' thoughts through their eyes. "It's silly," Heather Thomas thinks. "I know," thinks Bad Guy with his mouth too wide. <br /> <br /> A driving force (no pun intended) for the second half of this epic image is the car chases. These were actually pretty good, although I'm inclined to think that gas does not need help to know how to explode. What really impressed me was that, in all the lawsuits, the streets were almost empty. It's as if there were only twenty people in this huge city. <br /> <br /> I know what you think. You think, "Gee Wilikers, I must see this movie!" The sad thing, though, is that you can not find it. Oh no. "Cyclone" is a movie that finds you. Hold on. One day - perhaps during lunch, perhaps late in the evening, perhaps "when the military scientist Jeffery Combs (" resuscitator ") will be murdered by hired assassins" - you will hear the rustle of the leggings and know that 'It's time.
