It's the only funny thing I've ever seen. It is sad to see how much he tries to find a good joke. He only curses and thinks his disgusting vulgarity is funny. He is the most bitter person I have ever seen. Throughout his act, he tries to show how much he does not care, and by the same to show how angry he is with the critics and people greedy of taste and humor who would prefer to undergo an immense torture rather than watching his "show". There are good comedians, there are some bad ones and some horrible ones. But this guy is in a league of his own. I'm sorry for him and even more so for the people who find him funny.
