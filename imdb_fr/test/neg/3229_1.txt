I hated the book. A guy meets a smart dog, gets a virgin girlfriend, and all the while, they are chased by a hitman and a stupid monkey thing (who both want the dog). Dean Koontz really does not know how to write (I read the book at the recommendation of my sister, I should have known better). When I saw this (mostly out of morbid curiosity), I found myself criticizing it because it was wrong, whereas it is a book that can not make a good movie. I thought at least that if they made a film adaptation of the worst book I've ever read, the filmmakers could just as well be precise. They turned the guy and his virgin love into a boy and his mother, for a reason that bothered me the most (although I seriously doubt it, a guy and his girlfriend would not have improved it). Quite simply; bad book, bad movie, do not see it.
