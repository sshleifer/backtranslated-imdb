It's a very interesting knowledge! "Two-handed tales" contains three silly and childish episodes - the genre is not really a horror or an action, but rather an intermediate element. Where is the suspension? Where is the pleasure? Where is the common sense? Absolutely not here, but if you do not expect to get it, you will not necessarily miss it. <br /> <br /> The first segment is called "Showdown". It's a violent and absurd western. I failed to understand the whole idea of ​​this. "King of the Road" is a silly story starring Brad Pitt. At the time of the "two-handed tales", he was only a pretty face who did not know how to play yet. Fortunately, he learned the technique later and is now a fantastic and talented actor - one of the most important of the younger generation. The story is almost ok in all its stupidity. The final episode "Yellow" is the only segment that has almost entirely succeeded. It's stupid but funny. We must thank Kirk Douglas for that. <br /> <br /> This movie is something to watch while sitting in an armchair and eating popcorn. (I should know it, that's what I did) If you like "Tales of the Crypt", you'll love the "Fist Tales" also because basically, it's the same thing. I understand that these three episodes are in fact a "work of art" extremely rare and very difficult to find anywhere. I have the whole package on VHS but I do not think it's a great privilege. You will have to be a Brad Pitt fanatic to search for it. Otherwise, do not worry, it's not worth it. Crap stupid.
