I was not old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad, but I knew everyone thought it was cool. Some of my "books" have been written from the series of my silkscreen-to-paper collection. They are quite light so I did not expect much from the movie. This is a good thing because this film was badly kept on a leash. <br /> <br /> I admire the risk of creating a film that is so faithful to the hit of the 1960s. The audience of the film, however, has gained sophistication in 30 years. At least I think so. I certainly expect more than an hour and a half from the original Mod Squad concept, with car chases (now old), camera work (now considered mediocre), a soundtrack (metal sound) and a script (mediocre) and the rest, screen. In the 1960s, we did not care as much because our expectations were minimal. An integrated police team of young people wearing something other than suits was enough. That was it, another thrilling episode of "Ironsides" or "Password". <br /> <br /> In evaluating this "episode" compared to the usual drama, the story was ... well, I'm not even sure I have to say it because I'm not sure that there was one. Drugs are bad? It does not matter. The script was silly. When the characters exchange dialogues and advance in the plot with lines such as "I heard him say on the phone" and "I think I have a plan", we really have problems. No wonder the acting was appalling: no one knew how to say such an idiotic line. <br /> <br /> If I were Claire Danes, I would chase my agent with a flamethrower. (In fact, I think everyone watching the movie has the right to seek redress.) <br /> <br /> And where was the Mod in this team? I realize that these children just came out of the juvenile room, but no one had a velvet suit? "Mod" meant only young and integrated? What happened to the white boots? Maybe the costume department was perfect, but all they got was dirty and dismal. <br /> <br /> Since the film was completely faithful to the original series, it demanded special behavior from actors, cameramen, stuntmen, etc., we should appreciate it more. Unfortunately, I still do not like it. If I wanted to watch the crime drama of the 60s, I would buy DVDs. No thanks.
