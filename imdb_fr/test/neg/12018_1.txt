I saw this film in the cinema and it was a terrible film. The way Michael Oliver, who is still growing in the future, is the biggest intolerance I can not stand. Junior upset his father because he was not going to school, which made his father Ben madly mad. Also, the operator of Crazy Dance is not fair to Junior for not letting him do it. And this Lawanda Dumore is as horrible as a serial killer for Junior because she has uttered insults threatening to him and that's why I can not tolerate this movie. Even if the film is reissued in theaters in the extended version, I still would not see this movie because this movie is not something I can not even tolerate. In fact, it stinks!
