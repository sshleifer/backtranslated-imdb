This film is absolutely horrendous and awful. It's not a small budget, it's a budget-free film that makes Ed Wood's films look like art. The acting is abominable, but the sets and props are worse than anything I've ever seen. A regular subway train is used to transport people to the demonic zone of mutant killers, Woddy Strode has a bullet and the fight scenes are shot in an abandoned gravel pit. There is sadism as one would expect from a nasty Italian video of the 80s. No talent was used to make this movie. And the feminine interest of love may have a huge Italian flavor. Even for the Italian standards of the 80s, this movie is really horrible, but I guess it came out at a time when there were not many movies available on video or the audience did not really discern. This shit piece has no entertainment value and it's not even funny, just boring and extremely cheap. It is in fact and insult to the most stupid public. I'm just wondering how an actor like Woody Strode ended up becoming a turkey like this?
