There is nothing good to say about this movie. Read Revolution For the Hell of It or one of his other writings. Abbie was often considered the clown prince of the 1960s, but he was a man of ideas who used his wit, sense of humor and pop culture, as well as his flamboyant personality to draw attention to his ideas. . The media has too often focused on the man, not on the ideas, and that is also the problem of this film. Later in his life, he suffered depression. But this film looks like an Abbie version of National Enquirer. He deserves better. If you do not know Abbie or his time, this movie will not help you. <br /> <br /> This film is a lie. I give him a zero. <br /> <br />
