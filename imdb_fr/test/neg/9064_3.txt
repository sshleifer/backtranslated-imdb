Honestly, this short film is nil. the manikin used in the necro scene is pretty well done but still pretty fake to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is clean and clear and I have not made a decision if it helps or prevents it. If the film was a little grainy, it might have added a "factor of lugality" to what was happening. I do not understand why this film is as much hype as the subject - but to be honest, necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q, among others, are more shocking than after AFTERMATH. All this talk about the film being about loneliness and any other way of deep philosophy is twisted. It's a shit beautifully filmed and expensive. It's not so shocking, it's not so disgusting. if you insist on looking at it - praise it. I give it a 3 for the fact that few people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos;) - the shoot is good and it has a bit of "gore" (if watching a rubbery doll cut itself is considered gore ...) but other than that - absolutely nothing goes for this hyper-hyped mess. GENESIS - Cerda's "sequel" in AFTERMATH (now available in "double feature" by Unearthed films) is the absolute masterpiece of a short film, truly showing what a good director, Cerda, is like we give him the right equipment. . Although I do not like it at all AFTER, GENESIS is so well done that I will forgive Cerda and will certainly be watching him in the future ...
