The other critics with the lowest ratings have summarized the wastewater so perfectly that there seems to be little to add. I want to emphasize that only Cockney Filth was imposed on my children's visit, who are very keen to watch the Sunday bus. My god, it's depressing! Like all soap operas, it consists entirely of totally unfathomable characters that are unpleasant for each other, but it's ten times worse than the worst. The critic who laughed at the "true life" hold projected by his defenders was on the spot. If someone lived in a social environment like this, he would cut his wrists in a few days. And I can assure anyone who does not know the true East End that he is a little more "ethnically enriched" than you will ever see here. Follow my advice - avoid this nadir from the UK television industry. It's evil.
