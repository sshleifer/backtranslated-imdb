I do not remember a film more trivial, more stupefying and more superficial, in other words a real film of chicks of the worst kind. How can we watch this film and recommend it to others? Only if they do not like to admit that they made a mistake. This seems to sum up the worst of women's aspirations. No real substance to all this happy and superficial. Yes, it will please the masses. Well, not this member of the masses. What a trivial charge of drivel. I wanted to leave the cinema less than 5 minutes after the beginning. And to say that I paid Â£ 7 to see that! I think, however, that this is a mess of film as in most media today. So, I like a bit of reality in my musicals that call me sad or what?
