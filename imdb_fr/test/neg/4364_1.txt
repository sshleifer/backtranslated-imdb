I'm sorry but this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I can not believe that after creating the first in the series, they were able to get a budget to create another one. Not that the budget could have been a lot - it's the least scary movie I've ever seen and laughed to the end (in fact I can not believe we watched it at the end) but I think it's because we could not quite believe it.
