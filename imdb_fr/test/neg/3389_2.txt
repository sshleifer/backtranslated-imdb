I completely disagree with the previous comment: this movie has fun moments but barely a riot of laughter. (unless you really think that sipping in a septic tank and the heads explode in a vise are a real riot) In fact, the only reasons I gave a 2 to a 1 are because a.) two of the actors are decent b.) the soundtrack is above average with some melodic pop songs added as contrast and c.) the truck monster is rather terrifying. <br /> <br /> This film is a film with intermittent, disturbing or interesting ideas that are overwhelmed by implacable cruelty, cruelty and wickedness. The old character of the best friend is one of the most boring I have ever seen and the little grace that the character of the hitchhiker has lost disappears into a new artificial twist that makes little sense. <br /> <br /> A waste of the main actor who shows a certain nervous charm and the aforementioned actress describing the character of hitchhiking ...
