I was interested in this movie because someone had made a nice video for Bj√∂rks "Bachelorette" with excerpts. So I watched the movie. And it's really beautiful. A masterpiece of animation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, history does not follow. Everything starts well, with interesting intrigues about people fighting for the possession of the Rose Bride, but suddenly the lifts fill up with water and lose their walls, people move away, and finally, for no reason, Utena is transformed into a car and a high speed chase follows. <br /> <br /> I really like Anime for her ability to create alternative universes, but this universe is just stupid. If you watch this movie, put the sound, it's better that way.
