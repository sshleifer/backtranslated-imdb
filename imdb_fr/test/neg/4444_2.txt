The Altman Quintet should be considered as a significant element: as many other critics have pointed out, the basic ideas of the film, even some of the choices to represent them, must work - and yet, very little in this difficult film. The lens of the partially fogged camera - I pointed out to my wife that it was the most entertaining director vanity of my life - had never allowed me to penetrate "into" the world of movie. <br /> <br /> In In general, the staging used here poses serious problems. It is clear that factors such as costume design and production design have been conceived in a significant way, but they are also not very effective at evoking a credible world. Maybe it's a question of scale; the film is so closely related to the scene that I burst out laughing when it was mentioned that "five million" people lived in the city. (Yes, I understand the budget constraints of the film - pictures here and there might have helped.) In all of Altman's most disappointing films I've ever seen. Good ideas and great metaphors are not always present in art - it's just a part of the game.
