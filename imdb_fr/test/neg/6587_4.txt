I borrowed this on DVD from a friend the other day. I did not really know what to expect. I have not seen many Russian films and I do not think I have ever seen a Russian war movie. Maybe it made me hope for something different, something more in the mind of an imagined Russian mentality. But whatever these expectations are, they have been confused. It's a pretty ordinary war movie. <br /> <br /> The whole formula that allows you to follow a few young people since their recruitment, through training, deployment and some battles, is well known. We have seen it done many years ago, as well as more recently (as with Jarhead). Of course, there is a difference here because the film is about Russian soldiers instead of Americans, as is almost always the case. But in general, it could just as well have been a movie about Vietnam. I guess this only underscores my feeling that Afghanistan was the Soviet Union of Vietnam. A country that should have been a pioneer for a superpower has dragged on the war for years, causing tremendous loss of life for both soldiers and civilians. <br /> <br /> The positives of this movie, I thought they were good There are some very nice shots of atmosphere) and decent effects for what I suppose was to be a movie to small budget What made me disappoint is mostly the story itself. It just does not create an emotion in me. Mainly because the development of the character is ugly. And to really feel something when people are shot, you have to make people, not just cardboard cutouts without a face. They fail to do that in this movie. Also, it's too long, and it seems to be a kind of trend lately. In my opinion, a movie of more than two hours must have a lot to offer, and this film does not cut it. In addition, there is disturbing music that covers every scene like a wet blanket. Especially in action scenes, it's very disturbing, not that you need action music, but something more than slow keyboard music would be nice. Otherwise, the production values ​​were pretty good, that was not the problem. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to watch this movie. To remember the fact that no matter where you are, war fears? Russian filmmakers have already watched American war films too much to create something original? Anyway, this film is rather cliche, lack of spirit and has acceptable technical qualities, but it also lacks scenario and development of the characters. In the end, it becomes another of all those war movies that do not make you think and that adds nothing to the genre. I saw a lot worse, but a lot better too. I note this 4/10.
