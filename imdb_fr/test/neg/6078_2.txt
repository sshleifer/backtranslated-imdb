Let me start with a personal note of amateur film and television, more on the fun side of life: I like what James Woods can do and what he did, and I still love Melanie Griffith, and Natasha Wagner was very good in this dreadful. miserable and stinking essay on the "real crime". <br /> <br /> Anyone who has written this film has apparently never spent time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents: yes, some thieves are addicts but their careers are very short. . Really successful thieves are rarely trapped because they do not make "junk" or drugs before playing a role. <br /> <br /> The character of James Woods was faithful to this paradigm at the beginning of this film. , then the script completely collapsed. He turns into a crazy and alcoholic crazy ... good job for a high-ranking guy like Woods maybe, but not at all credible. <br /> <br /> Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work, they would work. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are beautiful narcissistic losers self-indulgent and drugged. They could not get a real score in the real world, the real world where a big and sturdy security guard who beats the devil of a lean kid (as happens in the early scenes of this "dog"), the keep fighting and do not let him go up. Never. <br /> <br /> How many times have I found this movie hateful? A lot. Even totally vulgar people - like most devious thieves and junkies - have a wider vocabulary than these idiots. And the scenes of "scam" with neo-Nazi bikers? Puhlease. All rednecks are not neo-Nazis and those who are neo-Nazi speed merchants are not so stupid! <br /> <br /> This film earned the prize of two because Natasha Wagner was extremely talented in her role of Rose and because Melanie Griffith always has "this something special" or at least had it for this brutal and offensively stupid film. I'm not one to sing praises of real criminals for any reason, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible film is that they would all be dead or imprisoned before Act 2, Scene 1. Watch A lousy zombie movie is better spent than that .... thing ... and I hate zombies.
