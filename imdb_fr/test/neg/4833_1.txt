In fact, I do not tell the main plot in this comment, but with only 2-3 sentences, I can make a spoiler. OK, here it is: <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is only 85% conversion of Hollywood movie Cellular to Bollywood using Vikram Bhatt software. The title has no correspondence with the story, only it goes in the direction of the thriller. Only that!! He does not even deserve a single star for his imitation, imperfect cast, mediocre story, and predictable story. Without a doubt, I can now say that Viram Bhatt is slowly disappearing from his status as a director, with no mature audience enjoying his recent work, including this one. Beside him, Aftab Shivdasani has also adopted a cartoon style. Who knows how long will it last in the film industry? Sometimes, the level of performance and cinematography is lower than a category C film. But the most important supporting role was played by Zayed Khan, who was somehow identical to Chris Evan's role as Ryan in Cellular. Sanjay Suri has no contribution in the film because he has nothing to impress. That's why those who have already watched Cellular I advise you never to waste your time again with this dummy bag.
