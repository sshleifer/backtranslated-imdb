The film is nice Although the photo, but no originality ... <br /> <br /> this film is directly copied from "The Hitch" where Salman plays as a Date Dr. as Will Smith, and Govinda like a big jerk , who desperately wants to love his boss at the end of the film returns to an old Flimi Indian style, the bride's father does not like the lover of the bride and gets another groom, and Govinda, the lover of the bride, come and save she was from the new groom and had a fancy dance and other things. <br /> <br /> The comedy was really good. No doubt, when the hitch meets Hindi would be funnier .... <br /> <br /> Finally worth a look but when he comes on TV after a few months ...
