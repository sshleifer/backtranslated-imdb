When a BBC thriller is plagued by heterosexual dysfunction, you know who should be the murderer: the homosexual. ? Let's see, could it be the mother who (against all good sense) lets her teenage son make non-chapret visits to her serial killer father behind bars? Could this be the son of a bad mood, impressed by his father's thoughtless attitude towards women? Could it be the serial killer himself, who seems able to manipulate the events behind bars, to the Hannibal Lecter? Could it be mom's boyfriend, a school teacher whose affair with a former student led to his wife's suicide? Or could it be the daughter of her boyfriend, who reviews everyone's secrets at school, causing indescribable misery? No, it's none of these probable suspects. It's ... the homosexual! <br /> <br /> The only mystery for the viewer is to guess who is the homosexual. Of course, this could be anyone, since the only features of The Homosexual are a shameful secret and a propensity for murder that complicate the lives of "normal" people. The homosexual is the invisible cause of the ills of society. It is only when this person is exposed and eliminated that the fractured family can regroup and things can return to normal ... anyway. <br /> <br /> As for casting, Jemma Redgrave and Robson Green are now officially past their expiry dates. The world could go well without ever seeing either, but as long as the BBC has roles for The Aggrieved Woman and The Misunderstood Man, I guess they'll come back in movies like this.
