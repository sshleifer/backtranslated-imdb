Well done, yes. All right, I must say, even if I do not speak Chezck. Beautiful cinematography. But the script is lame, really lame. A predictable soap opera in which you know exactly what will happen. OK, maybe the end is not so predictable, but is it good? This is one of those movies you already feel and you forget the next day. <br /> <br /> I just received a note from IMDb saying that my comment was not long enough. It's really sad because I have no idea what to say about this movie, which says a lot about it, do not you think? The thing is ... He has no soul or originality. Compare this film with Barrio, or Riff Raff, shot over ten years ago (or the extraordinary filming of The Child). It's sad to see that it's a much worse movie.
