The most remarkable thing about "Talk Radio" is how bad it is. The voices of the callers all sound deceptive and read a script. An evening with an annoying big mouth in a Dallas radio station is told with the improvidence of a glimpse of Hell by Sartrean. Stone tries an existential revelation and obtains an involuntary comedy. Whenever a caller expresses a "deep" (empty) point about something, Stone pushes the camera onto his character's face as he is struck by a traumatic realization that will never be revealed to the public. Bogosian overactive throughout one of the most irritating performances ever spread on celluloid. An underrated classic? Leave me alone.
