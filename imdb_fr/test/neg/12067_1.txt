The cover and the postulate written there are so promising. As a slasher maniac, I expect a lot of that. But what the hell is going on. The film is awful. The staging, the plot, the suspense and the acting are so amateurish. I even thought they were using a home video camera to take a picture of it. Fortunately he still manages to give me good times that make me love. Thank you for the bad pack of "Camp Blood". <br /> <br /> 1/10
