I love watching Australian movies, but this steaming pile of shit was just embarrassing. The DVD cover looked promising, but you know what they say, do not judge a DVD by its cover. <br /> <br /> I also noticed that the film won the best actor award, but the competition must have been really bad, because playing in this film is pathetic. It just seemed like the director thought he had enough talent to lead and act when he really had to focus on some of the film making and do it before he dispersed. The music was pretty ordinary. The story is not really going anywhere. It was just a sequence of fights related to a mediocre scenario and a nerdy dialogue. <br /> <br /> I will say this however to all aspiring filmmakers. Watch this movie This will give you hope that your film will win something at a festival. <br /> <br /> But good for them to have managed to participate and try. I hope they have learned a few lessons and that their next venture is a little better.
