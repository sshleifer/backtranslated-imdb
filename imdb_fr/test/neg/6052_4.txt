The problem with this movie is that it tries to compile a movie of 6 hours and more in 2 hours. The result is clear. It seems too forced, unclear and too simple of mind. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is the beginning. This explains why and how was born Hercules. The rest of the movie was ... just a gibberish set up. It has the potential to be a good movie like LOTR if only it is not forced to take 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The acting is not very convincing either. OK everything is not bad. But most of them are. The special effects are stupid and seem to have been made ten years earlier (although the 1st monster is good enough) Overall, I give it 4 out of 10 for the reasons I've described this -above.
