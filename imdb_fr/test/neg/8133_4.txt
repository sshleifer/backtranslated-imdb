Julien Hernandez is certainly an attractive and friendly character on the screen. In fact, his character carries almost all this film, or what is worth it. The problem is that, with the exception of his gal buddy (played by Marisa Petroro) and Paul Lekakis (as a turn / date / boyfriend for some of the characters), no one else approaches it. Hernandez embodies about thirty directors of Cuban history and unknown sexuality, who comes to L.A. and gets a job shooting a gay documentary. While meeting a group of gays while finding subjects, he goes out ... but very discreetly. Even at 88 minutes, the film has obviously been expanded and endowed with various film school devices, most of which end up unnecessarily interrupting the narrative (which is not very useful at first) or emphasize the amateurism of the film. film making. <br /> <br /> Which is a shame, because there is a love story here somewhere, and the last three minutes, when Sebastien de Hernandez finally clicked on a wealthy West Hollywood party organizer (well minimized by Lonnie Henderson) and that they share some sexy kisses, it works despite everything that has been done before. But we do not really care about the other characters or their situations: why would the beautiful Dante have a Eurotrash priss for a boyfriend? He would not do it. And do not even get me started on the "rules" of Paulie, Sebastien's friend, in terms of attendance - no homosexual man that I know, no sane person, at any time, would put such restrictions on himself or others. And tell me, how does Sebastien have a peeled banana (which is normally pretty crunchy, no?) Stuck on his buttocks and must go to a doctor to have it removed? <br /> <br /> I noticed that Hernandez won an award for this film as a "short film" - it probably should have stayed that way. All that being said, I would be eager to see Hernandez again on screen, in a better scripted comedy and with a more assured direction.
