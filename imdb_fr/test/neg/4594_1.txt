Where to start with "Speck", the true story of Richard Speck, an assassin of eight nurses in the 1960s. Director Keith Walley has worked on some of the very small budget Full Moon Releasing movies (such as Birth Rite ) and here it is taken from a screenplay by Don Adams, a regular at Full Moon (at the time). Unfortunately, while the film seems to be a faithful representation of the horrendous crime, the scenario is not great, perhaps because Speck's real ramblings were not terribly interesting !? Despite the care taken to ensure that this authentic is authentic, it gives way to an inexpensive retribution for the famous film serial killer films of the same period (as "Ed Gein"). Filmed in a dirty brown, not quite sepia, and narrated by star Doug Cole, the film does not present the horror of crime, because the narration is irritating, the distracting color of the story and the crime, although macabre and upsetting. to look at it is just that and no editorial work seems to have happened on what is a very poor quality camcorder and viewing the events. There is no review of Speck's motivation or life, but a low blow for a horrible crime. Released by Full Moon, there is little evidence of the best Full Moon release here. Charles Band has ignored his own rule that his movies include fantastic killings (eg, dolls, monsters, etc.) and do not really know what to do with this new reality. Incidentally, the band has launched a special label for these films called "Shadow Entertainment". Band said he regretted the release of Full Moon alongside Tempe Entertainment (whose creator J.R. Bookwalter and the usual Danny Draven also speak very badly of Charles Band). The Tempe era features uniform editing on Apple Mac and shooting with a handheld camera, such as a home movie. Speck retains these qualities and although Witchouse 3, for example, has managed to use them well, Speck is simply boring and disgusting.
