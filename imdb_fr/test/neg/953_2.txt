As a flagship show, Attack of the Show (AOTS) is endemic to the larger drop of G4 TV. it is a show (and a station) that has fallen so far that it scrolls sex to try to cover its glaring faults. Its predecessor, The Screen Savers, was a place to troubleshoot technology issues and detect the latest and most advanced technologies. It was a beautiful show with friendly staff and it was fun to see some of the modding work and experiences that the team could achieve. <br /> <br /> The acquisition of TechTV by G4 has upset some long-time fans of the station, but early returns were promising. The focus on the game was a good addition and I really enjoyed the coverage of the E3 and other major entertainment events. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, AOT is only a shell of yesteryear. The people who oversee the channel have turned away from technology and games to turn to anything that could make young men drool. The result is that AOT spends as much time parading Olivia Munn or extolling the merits of the adult film industry as she covers games. It's so bad that it's almost unassailable. <br /> <br /> Some may find childish joy in this sort of thing, but those who really enjoy playing games may wonder where the good coverage has gone. Equally troubling, young players who could connect to the G4 thinking they will start playing - this group of active players between 10 and 15 - are rather fed with content for a more mature audience. On a channel like HBO or Cinemax, things like that are expected. On G4, it's tragic. <br /> <br /> At least SpikeTV, another male channel, offers good programming like CSI. AOTS, and G4, has very little good to offer. <br /> <br /> Too bad, really.
