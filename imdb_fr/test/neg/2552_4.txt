First, "The Mexican werewolf in Texas" is not a movie about werewolves. This title is bullcrap. The story is about a chupacabra that kills all the villagers in the small town of Furlough, Texas. I guess the distributors have renamed the original title to earn a little more money. And I guess it actually works because that's why I bought this piece of shit, it sounded so stupid. Anyway, the movie is not good. In fact, it's awful. But I did not expect anything else when I bought it. It's a low budget horror movie with a Chupacabra monster. If you like low budget horror movies with bad dialogues, actors and some gore, then you should check in this movie. But I must warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad. <br /> <br /> This movie has some of the worst movies I have ever seen. The actors try too hard and it becomes completely ridiculous. They almost never say a line in a normal way. They always have that tone completely wrong for everything they say. It's so stupid that it almost looks like a fucking parody. It's as if they had shot each scene once and were happy with it. The worst of all is the blonde girl who is supposed to play a bimbo. She is the worst of all. I've never seen an actor so mean (and I've seen Pteradactyl). Even when her boyfriend dies, she can not stop being a bimbo about it. I hate her. <br /> <br /> Some of the pictures in this movie were pretty good. Those who were shot during the day are all pretty decent for a low-budget project. But most of the film is shot in the night when the Chupacabra hits and the light is too dark. The gory scenes are short and short, but really grizzly and violent. The effects are really hilarious, but that's how I like them. The Chupacabra looks so messed up and it's easy to see that he's a guy in a suit. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget movies and it is very important not to watch it alone because you will probably be bored to death. I recommend watching this movie with your friends and some beer.
