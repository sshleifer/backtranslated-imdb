The Girl in Lovers Lane is a strange little budget movie. On its surface, the film tells the story of a hard dinghy named Bix (Brett Halsey) who spends his time looking for a boy named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the daughter Carrie (Joyce Meadows), whom Bix meets like to watch him. Nothing really interesting happens (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix puts Danny at ease, Carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes from the movie when Carrie is murdered. His father blames Bix, pulls him out of a prison cell and beats him to death. Now their roles are reversed and Danny has to save Bix. <br /> <br /> Until I read the reviews on IMDb, I thought maybe it was just that I was reading Bix and Danny's relationship more than she really was, but I see now that I am not alone. It occurred to me early enough that Bix and Danny had more of a relationship than what is usually seen in a 1959 film. The homosexual nature of their relationship, although never expressed openly, is still pretty obvious. Their life and sleep arrangements, Bix's reaction to finding Danny in bed with a prostitute, her inability to get involved with Carrie, and this phone call in the end when Danny tells her parents to bring him back at home a friend are some examples of the moments that led to I'm sure that their relationship exists, but I can not think of any film of the 50s that I saw that screams a homosexual as strong as this one. <As for the film, I do not know any other way to say it, it's boring. As I wrote earlier, nothing happens at all during 90% of the execution time. The characters are boring. and the actors are not good enough to give a spark to The Girl in Lovers Lane. The only exception is Jack Elam. His madman, Jesse, is the only character interesting enough to be watched. Elam had been scared! But I guess the biggest problem I had with the movie was with the character's motivation and logic. D and Bix is ​​immediately blamed? What about crazy Jesse who has been tracking Carrie for most of her life? Does anyone think to ask Jesse where he was that night? His father saw him bother Carrie at dinner, but he never thought that Jesse could have anything to do with the death of his daughter? Not much logic there. And what about Jesse's confession? Danny grabs Jesse by the back and that's all it takes to force a confession out of Jesse? Really hard, huh? Why would he confess so easily? And after he confesses, nobody thinks of catching him? It's terribly nice of Jesse to stay put and not run away. In any other reality, he would never have spilled his guts and would have run like a rabbit had he been caught for murder. I'm not prepared to do the fact that The Girl in Lovers Lane is asking me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the characters. Overall, I give a 4/10 to The Girl in Lovers Lane.
