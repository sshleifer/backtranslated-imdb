I would like to sit down and write an intelligent and thoughtful review, but I feel that I would devote more time to the writing process than the filmmakers. I live in Los Angeles and I am sorry to say that the characters were so much like under-employed and overly selfish actors. There is not a moment in the film where I was able to escape the sensation of watching the demented conversation of unemployed actors at a trendy Los Angeles caf√©. One of the worst "independent" films I've ever seen with so little to recommend that hearing it win at Sundance has effectively erased any previous interest that I might have in attending, let alone considering a criticism Sundance postitive as significant. Look at your own risk.
