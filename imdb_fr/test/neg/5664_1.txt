I watched the Halloween episode ... oh my god I wanted to die. The acting game was just horrible. The lines were pronounced without any conviction. It's also a bad idea for a show. I mean, who would watch a web show like this in real life? Miranda Cosgrove played very well in Drake and Josh, but does not have the strength of character to anchor her own series. I'm even more upset because his departure is one of the main reasons Drake and Josh ended. She was approached with her own show ... she boarded Drake and Josh. They then decided they might do something with Drake and Josh going to college, explaining the loss of Meagan as a character. Drake had already had the idea to move on to bigger and better things and he figured that if Miranda did it. The best part of the show was the theme song ... a good catchy song in a quagmire of mediocrity. Of course, Drake Bell doubled Miranda's voice and wrote the melody ...
