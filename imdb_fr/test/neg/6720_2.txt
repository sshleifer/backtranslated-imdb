Three words: What a pile ..... Two words: Do not bother! One word: sucked! There is no reason to see this movie. Even these Seagal groupies should avoid this movie. The martial arts, the typical Aikido, are horrible. The martial arts movements themselves are good but the cinematography is pathetic. The movie is slowed down each time Seagal gives his "kill move" to his victims. Worse still, it shows the same movement three times in succession in rapid succession under three slightly different angles. So stupid. Seagal's acting was completely stupid, but I still give the film a "6" for its role in the secondary cast, whose "nasty" roles were actually quite amusing. <br /> <br /> The plot is just stupid. Seagal plays a Federal Express agent with a license to kill. His character also has a dedicated work ethic, which means that all his parcels are delivered to the right people on time, at no extra cost, and nothing prevents him. Not murderers, political leaders, explosions or even death. <br /> <br /> I expect some level of violence in a martial arts film, but this film contains several scenes of random and horrific acts of violence itself in no way to advancement of the film or its history. There is a reason why this movie went straight to the video and there are plenty of reasons to avoid it. Nobody should bother with these guts. <br /> <br />
