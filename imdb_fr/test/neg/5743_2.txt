It is a relatively watchable film (+1). After looking at UKM: Ultimate Killing Machine, this one looks good, by comparison. There are no obvious technical blunders, although vampiric teeth seem strange. <br /> <br /> History does not make sense. Let's see. An American GI fights vampires. Returns to the states and is rehabilitated to see ... Vampires. His commander is the aunt of his ex-wife. Who is doing research on biodiversity in the South American region where vampires are? Huh! Do not accumulate too many coincidences. Who cares about the vampire's head? Or his daughter? Or someone in this movie? The only originality is that most myths about vampires (allergic to crosses and garlic, can not come out during the day, etc.) are false. But they can only be killed by decapitation or by a wood wound in the heart. Yes indeed. It's obvious that they just did not want to shoot in a dark film because it's a movie made for television. <br /> <br /> It would have been good for the viewer if they had hired actors. Oh, they have Lynda Carter (TV Wonder Woman), and a big black guy with an extremely serious voice, who is scolding appropriately to show off her vampire teeth prostheses. But, otherwise, you would never know that they really paid people to read these lines. <br /> <br /> There are enough fight scenes and some vampire blood, but no real violence.
