The first question is: how many stupid idiots are needed to make a movie go crazy? Answer: It is sufficient if he writes the script and directs it. The second question is: did anyone teach the actors to handle the firearms well? Answer: hell no. I wonder if Kristy Swanson was hit in the face with hot brass - because it seemed so! The third question is: how many times have we discovered the plot "of a super secret government agency"? Answer: a good couple in excess! The fourth question is: are Michael Madsen and Ron Perlman overestimated? Answer: In this film, unfortunately, yes. The fifth question is: can a pair of breasts save this movie? Answer: even three (the pair of Kristy Swanson and the director / screenwriter) did not do it. fools from the accessories department give it a completely different set. The first bloody thing of the film, the counter "suck" reaches its peak. Time elapsed since the beginning of the movie until I turn off the TV: fifteen minutes. Just a little more than it took me in the case of "Alone in the Dark".
