This TV movie (allegedly) based on a true story is about a fleeing FBI woman and a * seriously * stupid guy. <br /> <br /> First we have Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson), a guy "ordinary guy" with a stultifying job, an ex-wife, a child he almost never sees and cats. <br /> <br /> Then there's "Elaine-Lisa-you name her" (Tracy Pollan), an elegant, sexy and beautiful woman whose tongue would ignite if she told the truth. <br /> <br /> Roger and Lisa meet each other when they respond to a solitary ad. Roger is one of those poor saps who can not bear to live alone. This is why, after the overthrow of his wife, he deposits his advertisement. <br /> <br /> Roger is quick to understand that Lisa is * not * a good person, but he has no idea how to get rid of it. He does not even have enough sense to change the locks on his apartment door after throwing it out. <br /> <br /> Go ahead, look at her if you have nothing else to do. <br /> <br />
