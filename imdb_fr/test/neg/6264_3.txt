The sequel to Slasher (fourth film of SLUMBER PART MASSACRE) is about a group of nubile cheerleaders stuck in a mountain hut in the snow, attacked by a crazy killer. Typical slasher items for hardcore fans, gore, wonderfully free female nudity, no intrigue. Although she ends up exhausting her welcome, even at its short duration. <br /> <br /> The original star, Brinke Stevens, makes an appearance that only seems to be there to include in the film.
