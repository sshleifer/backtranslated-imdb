Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It is filmed so nerdy that the accent is not even put on this supposed "real half-caste", but rather on the team from Hollywood to make the film. No cinematographic meaning whatsoever, and if I could resume the almost 1 hour and a half I spent watching this film, I would feel much better. <br /> <br /> At first, it starts by giving you the impression that it will be filmed quite generically, like a real Hollywood production. However, they then enter the narrative of the story, which is filmed so fucking. It's supposed to be an interpretation of the "Blair Witch Project" really, since they use what you think are "real camera images", it's not, make no mistake. <br /> <br /> The worst film I have ever seen. . . On the positive side, there is a scene half scary, and the visuals of the Metis are not too bad. Do not rent
