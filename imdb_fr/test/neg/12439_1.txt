From time to time, I encounter a movie that is so embarrassing that I wonder why the movies exist. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody The Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds and a bad dialogue. Eddie Deezen is simply annoying because Tony, an idiot who, at the request of his father, Don (William Hickey), takes charge of the family's business. Tony, as I said, is an annoying little idiot. This makes the entire movie a complete mess. The film is terribly sullen. It's too caricatural. What I really want to say is that you can not make a parody of an acclaimed drama like The Godfather with so many cartoons. It does not work like that. Believe it or not, you must take seriously the parody of a dramatic movie. If you do not take it seriously, it will look like a parody. The thing about making a parody is that you can not seem too much like making a parody. You must give the impression that you are taking the film at least a little seriously. We also have the impression that they are making fun of Woody Allen, and that's what makes this film absolutely terrible.
