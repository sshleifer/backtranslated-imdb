When my parents rented this movie, I was expecting a very funny movie because Randy Quaid is very funny in comedy movies. However, this movie is not so funny and it's a bit boring too. You can see the surprise coming one kilometer away and it lasts a long time for a film supposed to last only eighty one minutes. So I can honestly say that it's not a movie on my favorites list. It may work for some people, but it just did not work with me, which turned out to be rather slow in construction, with virtually nothing that amused me in the whole movie. Randy Quaid is lost and the rest of the cast is a list of actors and actresses very bland. The premise of the movie had potential, as did Quaid's cast, but all that was spitting and the inclusion of the horror element seemed quite useless. Certainly, the sequence of a dream that the kid had when he jumped on the bed and suddenly became a whirlwind of blood was very well done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be a pure horror, instead of one who lists comedy as his first genre.
