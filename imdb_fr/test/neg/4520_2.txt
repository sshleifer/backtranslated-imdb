Wow, even American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance have more adult content than the WWE (at least the auditions have a number of people abusing the judges) and here's the WWE, which is walking with one of the worst moves of the history of television, to change into PG. Now, when I exchange sometimes to see what happens, that's what I get: <br /> <br /> 1) Hornswoggle, the naughty midget sharing his space with the main organizers for apparently no reason apart to move young people of course, beating Chavo Guerrero, a capable wrestler, every game <br /> <br /> 2) A host (arghh ....!) every week to mess up the teaspoon of entertainment that was present. All of these guests are class B celebrities seeking to catapult again for fame, throwing horrible 5-year jokes and making silly references. <br /> <br /> 3) Cryme Time and a wrestler most likely Eve) giving lessons on various "street" (sob) words that are neither street nor cool. Before, they had fun stealing stuff and talking loudly. <br /> <br /> 4) The divas are dressed in unassailable clothes. They do their best to look sexy, smart and powerful (by the way, I hate this slogan) Do you remember when Torrie, Trish and Sable were there? bad wrestlers, which adds to the misery amateur. <br /> <br /> 5) The movement of PG limits a lot of things: almost no blood during matches, DX is terribly irritating, John Cena is still doing more than his act of patriotism, a crowd of many children (who are so boring), almost no "heels", etc. <br /> <br /> 6) And yes, why keep the PPVs so often. Have they lost? No enmity or real rivalry has ever been created and the ones that are completed look fake and just-up-the-PPV-gets-over ones. <br /> <br /> 7) Vintage Michael Cole and some of his quotes: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, you are wat ching the longest TV show in history" (c every week) <br /> <br /> "The brutal and vicious assault of (he does not use it for anyone else) Randy Orton / Legacy" <br /> <br /> "A vicious attack on Stephanie McMohan, the husband of Triple-H !!! ??? "<br /> <br /> WWE is about to disappear Hope Vince is recovering from sleep and doing something (bringing back the TV-14 or attitude era) 2 out of 10 for the current state of WWE.
