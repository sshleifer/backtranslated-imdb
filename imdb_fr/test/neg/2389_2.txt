On paper, this film has advantages: a street child who overcomes trauma, rebuilds his life and succeeds when the world has let it down. All right, everyone likes happy ends. <br /> <br /> However, at the movies, there were omissions that left the film dead inside. The dialogue was hollow and uninteresting, the characters were almost caricatural in their lack of size and complexity, and why did everyone have to be gay? I have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie, but when used in this way, not only is it offensive to homosexuals, it trivializes the lifestyle and depreciates the film. If the story works without this cheap trick, it should have been deleted. <br /> <br /> Each character seemed to come out of the same cookie-cutter shape: everyone had a major flaw and a minor flaw, whether or not each character had a good heart, and each one of them had had or has an abusive relationship with someone? <br /> <br /> The most annoying fact of the film is that they never let you forget the name "pip". comes from great expectations. They give it to you once and that should be enough. The story shares enough with Dickens' classic to make this fact obvious. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the cassette he left for Pip and how Pip, the main character, learns to develop from the lessons taken from the band. Finally, with the lessons learned, Pip confronts his dark past and movies with his life.
