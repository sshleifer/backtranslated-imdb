'Book II' is not a movie, it's a sermon. This nauseating, unhealthy and almost insupportably tedious misfire probably functions as a religious propaganda but has no entertainment value beyond a few sarcastic remarks by George Burns. Louanne plays a little girl to whom God asks her to mount an advertising campaign that will lead people to believe in him again. No really, it's the story. It's a lead load of old shoemakers who have far too many "explanatory" religious waffles that justify themselves, but hardly any decent dialogue and certainly a total absence of anything that even comes close to the magic or charm. "Miracle On 34th Street" it's not. Suzanne Pleshette breathes life into this fast-paced, rancid puddle, but the pudding scenario and the disgusting performance of the ironic Louanne quickly send her into the inflamed depths of your skill.
