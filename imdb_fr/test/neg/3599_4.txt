Ewww! A Disney suite that is garbage! Who would have thought? In fact, many judging by the reviews here, and they are not mistaken. I was looking forward to seeing this horrible film based on the taste of the original. And that's the whole Disney cash-in mentality. Drop all the old junk on the back of a hit and people will go there. Do not you think they're so cynical? Ask yourself this, then .... How many Disney movies have suites? And then .... How many of these suites are followed up? A significantly lower number. <br /> <br /> The new Kronk groove is just another example. The plot is ridiculously simplistic and stretched. Even more boring was the growing number of "displaced" objects and scenes - an old man at home for example and, God forbid, an Aztec version of the Boy Scouts! Worse still, Kronk's opposite leader, Chippamunk, has a completely confusing English accent for no reason. An accent that was, after a very short time, intensely irritating to the nerves. <br /> <br /> There are some good things. The animation is very nice and the talent of the voice agrees well with the sub-standard dialogue that is given to them - especially Warburton in the lead role. But other than that, there is really nothing to recommend. Of course, little kids may like it, but there is little to entertain mom and dad as they sit down through this tortuous mutilation of the original concept. <br /> <br /> Avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal that you would use to avoid a pack of devouring lion devouring men.
