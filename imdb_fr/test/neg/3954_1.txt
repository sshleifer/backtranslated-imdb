Bad, bad movie. When I saw the synopsis, I was expecting something like Ring only with a video game instead of a tape. Nothing like it happened. I admit that the idea is interesting and that it could be turned into a good movie, but that's not it. <br /> <br /> First of all, choosing the real life, Countess Bathory, is a stupid gesture that adds absolutely nothing to the story. . Anyone even vaguely familiar with his story would begin to wonder why and how this noble Hungarian woman found herself in this film. Choosing a generic revenge spirit would be much, much better. <br /> <br /> Then there is a whole concept: you die in real life, as you die in the game. As I said before, an interesting story, similar to that of Ring. But instead of turning it into a good script, it happens without explanation, given why this game has become what it is, why it was created, etc. Good idea waste. <br /> <br /> And finally, this movie does not even contain any funny stuff that could at least save horror movies of poor quality. The scenes of death are too fast and the acting is too much wood to be funny. <br /> <br /> Avoid if possible.
