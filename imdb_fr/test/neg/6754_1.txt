Let's see how you can insult my gender in different ways: 1. Of course, the # 1 girl is a horrible skank who cheats on her boyfriend and looks like a heroin addict. <br /> 2. Of course, the # 1 girl sleeps with the guy the first date after being wasted. <br /> <br /> 3. Of course, lesbians are "Germans" who are fond of S & M. <br /> <br /> 4. This was actually a surprise. Finishing the film on a note of torture celebrated by the majority of the characters was disgusting. Seeing a battered woman is not my idea of ​​comedy. <br /> <br /> 5. Director's comment - It is rude and incredibly unprofessional to talk about encounters with actresses in the film.
