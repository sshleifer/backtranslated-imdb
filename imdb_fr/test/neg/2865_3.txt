I really enjoyed several GÃ©rard Depardieu films and I was expecting a lot more from this film. The main reason was that I just did not find the movie very interesting or funny - so it did not interest me. In addition, although he does NOT sleep with his stubborn daughter, the idea that she lies by telling everyone that he is her oldest is simply disgusting! Yes, I know that there is no incest and no one around them knows he is really his father, but I found that any child who passes his father as a sexual mistress is too disgusting and prevents the movie from being really funny. Plus, I really did not really like this little brat. Outside of her lies, she seemed very impertinent and involved. I would have preferred if, in one way or another, she would receive it and be punished because I just did not like it.
