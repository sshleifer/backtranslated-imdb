A young man, who has never known his biological parents, receives an old farm in an isolated area of ​​West Virginia on the death of his natural father. He visits his property with a representative sample of potential victims, including comic black and a fashionable lesbian couple. (Hmm, will there be a dip?) Guess.) Unfortunately, the party ends when the spirits of vagrants killed by his devilish great-grandfather and used as scarecrows come back for revenge. This film starts well. A clever montage of depression-era photographs and phony newspapers against a FDR speech - I believe it's his first appearance in a dreadful movie, the scarecrow - sets the mood. I developed some hopes for the film, which have been partially achieved. The story was quite useful. The decor was bucolic enough. The photography was mainly in focus. The acting game, even though there are no super shakes, was slightly above normal for horror movies in this budget range. The film might have worked within the genre if the scarecrows were scary. But they were not They looked cheap. They were not scary at all. The best of the monster, the best of the movie. These scarecrows would not scare Dorothy, let alone Toto.
