First of all..I saw better acting and more realistic makeup in porn movies. How was "Chris Moltisante" as Stewie Ungar? On the Sopranos, Chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered a comic relief. And then add "Bobby Baccala" as one of his Vegas acolytes. It's just too much to take in a dramatic movie. Neither of the two actors can assume a serious role and is better suited as a second banana to Tony, Paulie or Uncle Junior. And I want to know who made up this disaster? I want this person to be MY make-up artist over the next 25 years so that I will never get older one day either. That's all I'll write about this movie, because I do not need to waste too much of my time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirippa are their real names.
