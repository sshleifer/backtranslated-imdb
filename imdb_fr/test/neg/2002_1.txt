Please do not waste your money on this sorry apology for a movie. The only way for me to see someone who looks at this is if he is a hardcore fan of Erika Elaniak, but you'd better surf the internet than watch that shit piece. I would rather watch dry painting than look through that. <br /> <br /> They train you with Casper and Erika and make you think it's a sci-fi Dracula movie, but it soon becomes a joke about Van Helsing's awesome (you understand) grandson, here is an ironical last fight between him and Dracula. <br /> <br /> The film also tries to make a political statement, I believe, when it appears that none of the characters in the future knows who God is that they did not learn and understand not when they see a cross. I could have done a lot more with this idea. It's a shame that it happened that way.
