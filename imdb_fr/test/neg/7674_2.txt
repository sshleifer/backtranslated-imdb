This is what happens when a franchise becomes lazy and no one can think of a new twist to add. Remember what happened to the "Childs Play" series? The first three films were horror films, with real (though predictable) fears faithful to the theme of the film. Then they ran out of people for the harassing doll and decided to play it for a laugh, the other two being black comedies ..... <br /> <br /> Well, that's what's happened here, but I think it was not supposed to be like that. A bit like saying, "I wanted to make pancakes for dessert! I did it on purpose!" when your puff accidentally freezes flat. But the milk was poured and it had some value in the theaters. <br /> <br /> When the floor tore under the passenger seats, I sort of waited for the passengers to stretch their legs through the hole. , launch Flintstones-Style, to land safely in the Alps. I did. It would have been in the ridiculous theme of the rest of the show. <br /> <br /> Instead of highlighting the obvious physical impossibilities of the film, what about social improbabilities? Is it like George Kennedy's character calmly reacting to the news that her date was a whore? Even in 1979, a man would not easily accept the idea of ​​giving his heart to a paid companion. He would have had the feeling of forming a connection with a close spirit, who would eventually prove to be a mercenary sex worker with a permanent telephone line. Who would not feel deceived by the experience? And yet, he laughs and runs his arms around the size of his friend who walks away cheerfully. What an inexpensive conclusion of a shady scene. Ouch. <br /> <br /> I had an appetite for the soufflé and I was served tasteless pancakes. And no, you did not do it on purpose!
