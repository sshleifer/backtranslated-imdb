If you're like me and have watched the original Benji phenomenon by far and finally saw the film for the first time more than 30 years later, you might be shocked to find out just how awful it really is and more mystified than ever of his popularity. in 1974. <br /> <br /> My judgment is not entirely objective, I tend to favor children's films and reduce them considerably. On the other hand, I have always hated this particular dog, a feature of the last two seasons of "Petticoat Junction". Never a big show, the first episodes without dog were at least a beautiful showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut their time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Benji is an 86-minute dog megadose, following him on several daily tours through the city of McKinney, Texas. If this sounds boring, we advise you to give birth to "Benji" and never let your remote control fall into the hands of a "Benji" fan (if there are any more). <br /> <br /> Unlike "My Dog Skip", "Monkey Business" or "Thanks to Winn-Dixie", the cast human actors are extremely weak. "Big Valley" "Peter Breck plays the role of the stern father and seems simply embarrassed at the thought of performing in something so lame. <br /> <br /> If any of your children (of any age) seems to find "Benji" entertaining, you should consider reducing his medications. <br /> <br /> Here again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
