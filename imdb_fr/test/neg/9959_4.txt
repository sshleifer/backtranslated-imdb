Okay, I recently saw George Zucco in at least four horror / suspense movies as I scanned various collections of packs of 50, and I have to say that the guy had a limited scope, but he was good at it he does. He was not Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him. <br /> <br /> But the poor guy was stuck in some sort of ghetto of horror movies, and he was not good enough to take them to another level of interest ... not with the thread - scenarios, direction and budgets under which he worked. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> This film is, for the most part, slow, heavy and not very exciting. The "heroine" seems to be destined to be a profitable version of Judy Garland, the "hero" is bland like white rice, and the poor guy who plays the monster does not even have a good transformation scene to deal with. His makeup effects are not at all scary - he looks like a slightly more shaggy version of a farm worker, that's all. <br /> <br /> This is not a total waste. Zucco looks good in front of the camera, he chews the landscape while being able to pronounce very affected and artificial speeches without flinching or losing the thread. There are here and there black-and-white moods that are not completely nil. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this film has helped some actors from "C" to "Z" to pay their rent a month longer, and it never goes below a certain level of quality. Watch it once if you like George Zucco or feel the need to see all the Wolfman-themed movies that have been shot.
