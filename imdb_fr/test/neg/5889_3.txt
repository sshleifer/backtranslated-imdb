Born and raised in Odessa and graduated from the "other" high school in the late 70s, Odessa High School, I had mixed feelings about this film. I do not live in Odessa, but I will always be a Texan at heart. I did not like how this city of more than 80,000 people was described as a very poor little town. If I'm wrong, do not hesitate to correct me, but I think that OHS also plays in the stadium of the city and that the panel "Home of the Permian Panthers" presented at the stadium was on the Permian training ground. I would have liked to see a little recognition of the rivalry between big city cities every year, OHS vs. Permian. I'm curious to know why the result of the game was changed, I think it would have been just as spectacular if the actual result had been described. Overall, the movie was ok, gave me a little homesick, remembering the "good old days" of MOJO.
