This one was really awful. Looking with a fascinated horror, I kept asking "why did they do that?" That is to say, we took all the scenarios of "The next day and tomorrow", "The Perfect Storm" and "Twister" and remixed them in a three-hour mini-series, directed by the director of junk TV, Dick Lowry, with all the sinister movies. clich√© known to man and not an ounce of real suspense. Most of the actors were unknown Canadians and the shoot was shot in Canada, Winnepeg doubling for Chicago, so there is no doubt that tax breaks are for something. Although some ambitious special effects have been attempted, the performance is so mediocre that no decent show is achieved. Actors can be a competent lot; the script is so bad that no one had the chance to show it, except perhaps for Randy Quaid in the role of Tommy the Tornado Hunter, who went very high and was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, Since then, producers have made another of these stricken turkeys in Canada called "Category 7 - The End of the World", which was presented with great taste on CBS to United States a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina. How could the network of Ed Murrow and Walter Cronkite do such a thing? In prime time? PT Barnum "Nobody ever went bankrupt by underestimating the tastes of the public" is proven again.
