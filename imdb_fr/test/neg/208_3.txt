The film had moments, but was disappointing to me anyway. It was a reshuffle of Trespass (Walter Hill) and therefore of the Sierra Madre Treasure, with less tension, bite and human emotion. There were good actors, but the story was soft and lacking in depth. I watched the movie for Mr. Reno and Mr. Fishburn, none were inspired and both had little to say or to play with their skin. This film was made to death in the past and does not have to be realized, consumes money that could be used for better films. For an action movie, it was little action and as a thriller, it did not happen. Better than watching the snow fall, but not for me.
