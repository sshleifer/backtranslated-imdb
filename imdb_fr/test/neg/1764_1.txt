*** MILD SPOILERS *** Dear Inman, It's hard for me to find nice words to describe the film I just submitted to this star. The problems are distant and difficult to tell. . . However, I feel that I must do it, if only to prevent others from suffering the same anxiety as me. This is not a film for the under 50's, it's sloooowwwww, soooooo slowwww, and when the big reunions of Ada and Inman occur. . .the most important and important scene of the film, NOTHING happens, it's an epic disappointment. Now, as the director should have done, I'll keep my words short and end with this warning, your movie is disjointed, boring, does not run and Jude Law is tragically misguided, he showed more emotion as a robot in AI - be warned, the film should be renamed. . . Bored Mountain. Love, Ada
