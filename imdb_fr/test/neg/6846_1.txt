The most hardcore moviegoer will be surprised by the general inefficiency of this "film" of grade z. Mary Woronov, an intelligent actress known for her roles as Mary Bland in Eating Raoul and Miss Togar at Rock 'N' Roll High School, is by far the best thing about this tripe. This movie is almost a pity, even for MST3K - Honestly!
