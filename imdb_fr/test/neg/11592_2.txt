If you're looking for a fun movie to watch simply because you can make jokes about not-so-great acting, nerdy special effects and sci-fi intrigues ... then this movie is for you ! Not at the theater, in fact, some actors were pretty decent. The special effects were not the best (to say the least); the animals looked completely computer-animated. There was a boring chuckle to cover the curse and there was only one song played again and again throughout the film. Overall, a good movie if you are looking for something completely cheesy and fun to make fun of. This is not a good movie to watch if you are looking for something serious.
