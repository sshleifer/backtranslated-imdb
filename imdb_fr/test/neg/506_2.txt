This is the film that sounded the death knell of the author in Hollywood. With more than $ 40 million, Heaven's Gate is so poorly designed and executed that it would take a lifetime to eliminate all areas of failure. What annoys me the most is that technically it is very serious, an unforgivable sin for the money that is devoted to it. John Hurt's opening speech at Harvard is inaudible, as is a conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the station. Some people seem to think that Cimino had planned this as a "style". He does not have. It's just a bad sound recording. The characters are not particularly well drawn, except for the four or five tracks; On the decisive battle scene, it's hard to tell who the bad guys are and who are the good guys. Even at this level, it is impossible to enjoy the movie. The casting of Isabelle Huppert in the role of Madame de la ville is a joke, her French accent makes the whole character fraudulent. The acting of the actors is generally stiff, without any extension nor depth of feeling; Even Christopher Walken is bad. The character of John Hurt is the only one to have a braggart or vitality (though Hurt, in his forties, playing in a Harvard young graduate with dark circles under the eyes is completely ridiculous). <br /> <br /> I guess saying that it's too long is excessive. The sequence of roller skates could have been easily cut, the cock fight scene is becoming a cinematic clich√© and the final scene aboard the liner is just outside the Twilight Zone. Appearing Rod Serling in front of the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale. In reality, these scenes in themselves are not bad, but Cimino did not win the right to include them, because what he gave us as "meat" of the photo is incomparably bad. The editing is mediocre, especially in the climax of the great battle. At one point, the same explosion with the same car wheel coming out of the explosion is used three times. I wish I could say something nice about this film: a beautiful scene, a great performance, even a memorable dialogue, but I can not. It's just a big ungodly mess. The only thing I liked was cinematography and the places in Montana, which are breathtaking. Even Cimino could not spoil everything. It's a long, boring, bad movie on every level. And people who say that this is done only because the costs have been exceeded just make fun of themselves. 1/2 * out of 4
