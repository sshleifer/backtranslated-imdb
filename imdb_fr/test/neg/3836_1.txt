The worst movie I have ever seen. I still do not understand what Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen intend to do. Maybe they had bills to pay ... The best and most cult takes place during a flashback that brings us during the Second World War when a Nazi officer hides his Jewish wife. This is the beginning of a typical serial killer life! It seems to be made in the early 80s but then appears a New Beattle ... Amazing! This movie was made in 2001 ... I'm pretty sure it took less than two weeks to make this movie. I heard that Dennis Hopper's wife had filed for divorce after seeing this picture and that Michael Madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor confessed to being the man under the yellow baseball hat. Pathetic!
