Yes, this film obviously tries to be a Conan the Barbarian, and what surprises me is that it is a sequel (people have asked for another?). The first part of the film is a flashback showing the original. From what I've seen, it does not seem worth checking out (and apparently, Ator still kills a huge puppet in his films). Well now, Ator lives at the end of the world with his mute sidekick Thong. A girl is looking for help because this evil guy has his father in his custody. Let me say that this villain is extremely patient, the old man constantly insulting the bad guy and chatting incessantly. The villain waits for the end of the movie and ends up hitting the old man while letting you ask, "What took him so long to snap?" Meanwhile, Ator, his sidekick and the girl go from adventure to adventure. They fight cavemen, invisible soldiers (do not ask), hire a hooligan and snake worshipers. Ator also fights a giant snake puppet and flying (again, do not ask). All the while, you'll think Conan is kicking Ator.
