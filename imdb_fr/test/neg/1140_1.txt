I watched the first 30 to 40 minutes of this film on television the other night and I agree that it is by far the worst of the series. None of this is funny, even Randy Quaid can not save this mess. Eric Idle was not funny in N.L. Euro. A vacation and it's even worse here. The only fun scene is the one where they are at the airport and where a guy dressed as Santa Claus passes the camera shouting, "Has anyone lost that?" as he holds a prosthetic leg ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 a star on ****
