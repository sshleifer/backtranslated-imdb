I'm a big fan of the original version of Assault On Precinct 13. The ice cream scene still haunts me today. I'm 33 now and I still remember being horrified by that when I was a kid. When I heard they were doing it again, I thought maybe it would be, but when I saw the movie, it's not the same 100% movie. This is not a remake. It's a bad idea stolen. It was completely ruined. The actors, Maria Bello, Laurence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Burne, John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are excellent actors, but they could not save this film. It was just wrong. Even the decor was completely opposite. And how on earth did anyone in this city notice that there was a war next door? Why did not we help sooner? Stupid. No Sens.
