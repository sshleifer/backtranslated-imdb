This show is great and we took full advantage. In Alaska, I do not agree with the homosexual content of tonight's show. I think you're pushing too hard to get New York to Alaska. It's one thing to have a New Yorker wrestle in the wilds of Alaska, but to try to turn the city of Alaska into New York? It's a nice show about the delicate women and the real men of Alaska, and bringing a same-sex couple into the mix is ​​a balancing act. Alaska should be portrayed as a man and New York as a woman. I think the first 9 shows have a perfect balance with what you all do. Can not we have a beautiful show without the imbalance of nature.
