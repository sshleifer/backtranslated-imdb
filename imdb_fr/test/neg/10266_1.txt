Why on Earth did Bava have to add an insult to his wound by making that pathetic piece of shit that follows? <br /> <br /> For starters, we, "viewers" from home are treated with an unknown narration. -Keep us aware of the events of the previous episode, revealing the triumph of humanity over the demons (yes). <br /> <br /> I can tell you right now that it makes no sense. -you have something to do with demons because it is a completely new story with a totally different backdrop. Bava, as usual, makes a casual appearance that does not even seem to fit the main context of the story at all. Acting in this one beyond the dreadful and all the concept of the demons appearing through a TV, Oh God, I will not continue. Go see for yourself. <br /> <br /> As usual, you'll be treated with laughable dubbing, crap scenarios that make no sense and mostly unanswered questions. As is typical of a suite that distributes the first batch of shit. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those Argentophile DVD collectors, you might want to try your luck otherwise, otherwise avoid like the plague, it's not close to the first, so you may want to to be avoided like the plague.
