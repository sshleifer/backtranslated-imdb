This movie has a premise that is good enough for anyone to talk to, and a surefire conversation topic. "Do you want to sleep with someone you do not like or do not know for a million dollars?" Although the film has a lot of potential, a bad performance turns it into a quality B soap opera. The film has a good lead and after the proposal is made, we are really in the film, but then it falls dramatically. The last three quarters of the film are spent by characters who lament, complain and regret what they did! The end was so cliche that it made me cry! This has a principle very similar to "honeymoon in Las Vegas" which is much better. See that instead.
