They call this movie "euro trash horror". <br /> <br /> Well, it's not a horror. The film happens in Europe, so yes, it's "euro". Trash can? Oh yes, everything is fine. <br /> <br /> You know you're ready for a good movie when, from the beginning, the DVD displays text on the screen to apologize for the quality of the print. 're about to watch. Expect crunches, strange cuts and non-adaptation of the film on the screen. Plus, there is the sound - at first I thought I was watching a dubbed movie. Then, carefully observing the lips, I realized that no, it was that the quality of the sound was awkward and poorly synchronized. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is pretty clumsy - a disfigured old woman named Dr. Bannister kills a scientist for her youthful formula. I do not give much because when you see the "old woman", it is quite obvious that she is under a thick and poorly applied makeup layer. Any sensible person who sees old age knows what will happen. Yes, the "old beast" miraculously morphs into a beautiful young woman - complete with face makeup and a long hair wig! Zounds! <br /> <br /> When I say that the old woman is disfigured, I mean she has corn flakes stuck to her face. The film does not attempt to explain how the cornflakes arrived there. Besides, nothing is tempted to explain the characters. They are never developed beyond the level of finger puppets. <br /> <br /> The two policemen who are pursuing our anti-heroin have just strolled, apparently baffled by the simplest clues. The murdered scientist was working on a youthful serum, the old woman disappeared and we continue to run into a young woman - how do these pieces fit together ?! What does all this mean ?! One of the cops is sweating a lot and patting his face with a rag. The other smokes a pipe. That's about all we have in terms of character. <br /> <br /> Dr. Bannister (the horror, who is now a beauty) dresses in weird costumes and then removes them so we can see his flesh. She has business with men. She is fighting with a young woman in a nightgown. She goes to Geneva so we can see the lake there. She does some water skiing, then takes off her diving suit to reveal a strange beaded bikini. She undresses again in a strange striptease of ninja costume. <br /> <br /> The end? Well, without revealing anything, it's a weird and sharp conclusion that has little more meaning than the rest of the photo. This is the kind of thing that a writer proposes when the director wakes him up at 4 am and says to him: "Quickly, we need an end for our film, what will happen next?" <br /> <br /> The writer mumbles something half awake, and the director runs with it. <br /> <br /> What is good about this film? Part of the music is campy and fun. This classic organ music from the 60's is so old-fashioned that it makes you laugh out loud. There are strange seduction scenes, weird dialogues, weird moments. <br /> <br /> It's so close to being so bad that it's good. I managed to watch it from beginning to end without tearing my eyes or crying. I guess it's praise.
