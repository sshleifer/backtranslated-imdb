I'm not a big fan of musicals, although technically it's not called a musical. But I thought I would give a chance to me because I like war movies. At best, she was mediocre. <br /> <br /> Hudson seems totally unbalanced in this role. It just did not work for me. Julie Andrews probably played her best, but I have a hard time buying her as a misleading spy. Sorry, I know these are classic stereotypes on my part. But I must say that I think it is Julie who is at her most beautiful female appearance. I've always considered her more matronly, but it's probably the result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. Without a doubt, they were desperately trying to get her out of this cast of characters in this role. She was very attractive in appearance here, but I still had not bought her as a spy. <br /> <br /> I could not stay focused on the whole movie and I found myself going back and forth - and conversing with those in my room (which I usually never do - I always mess up everything the world). This tells you how little this has caught my attention. Do not waste your time!
