It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther who wears metal prostheses, bites people around his neck and walks around chuckling like a hen without the arms beating. He also thinks he is a chicken. <br /> <br /> That sounds weird, does not it? Well, for me, the more weird and strange the person, the better. The most gore, the best and so on. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the board deciding if they want to free this maniac from their establishment. They mention that he created in prison prostheses that he used to bite his neck. He also chuckles like a chicken and thinks he's a chicken. <br /> <br /> If I had a patient like this, it was impossible for me to release him. <br /> <br /> First, Luther walks to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a bench and walks away. Then he sneaks into the back seat of a woman's car and goes to her home. <br /> <br /> While he was at home, Luther tied the woman to bed. When the daughter of the woman and her daughter's boyfriend come home, Luther hides. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, a police officer comes to the front door and asks for news of the mother. You can clearly see that the girl is scared and crying, but the agent continues to ask if everything is fine. She answers that everything is fine. The officer finally gets into his car and leaves. If I saw a woman who was constantly crying and looking scared, I would at least go into the house to investigate a little. <br /> <br /> The end is stupid too. As the woman enters the barn, she begins to chuckle and enthusiasm Luther. He begins to walk, beating his arms and chuckling like a maniac. She shoots him and sits just a minute before finishing. <br /> <br /> Then, the credits are launched. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen! Nothing happens in women! NOTHING! <br /> <br /> I sometimes like camper movies but this one really bores me. <br /> <br /> I give this film 1 star out of 10. Good idea, bad direction!
