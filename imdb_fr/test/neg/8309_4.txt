I come from Texas, so I thought I knew the big hair, but the wicked woman of this movie had huge hair. Every time she was on the screen, I could only focus on her hair. Take on the stage presence! There also seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in this movie. There was a traffic policeman writing a parking ticket that, in one way or another, did not notice the owner who dives to the car shouting loudly up to it hits the car. Then there was a guy in a phone booth who could not hear a huge bulldozer coming to him until he was 5 feet away. All the men in this movie seemed a little deaf, no one had to sneak into it. The "hero" of this movie was so whiny and inefficient that it was funny. The fight at the bar was pretty funny. There is an inestimable scene where the hero and his girlfriend have just had sex and judging by their expressions, it was not good for one or the other. It made me laugh out loud. This film is on the set of 50 Martial Arts Pack movies if you want to see a lot of bad movies (with some decent movies).
