Have I lost my time? It's a very pretentious film. At first, you will think something is going on, but after 30 minutes you realize that nothing is happening. I waited another 20 minutes and by then I was so frustrated that I started reading IMDb reviews and realized that the director was wasting precious time for many people . <br /> <br /> Needless and incredibly boring film. Stay away. So many good soundtracks. I will give a point for the police inspector's joke because it worked for me. I laughed a lot but otherwise it's a very bad movie. Stay away.1 out of 10
