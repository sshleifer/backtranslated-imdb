The concept of this movie was pretty good. But one way or another, the execution failed on many levels. There are not many horror movies that I can think of this worn doll that seemed so realistic. Especially when these dolls begin to blink or move their hands. So much could have been done with this principle. There were many scenes where there was room for tension and suspense. And I was really expecting some scary things. But never has the film been able to scare. One of the main reasons is that the story is too small and predictable. In fact, I thought they did it on purpose to surprise us with a wonderful twist. Unfortunately, that does not happen. At least not as I hoped. The distribution has also failed to make all this credible. It would have been nice if more details had been given about the characters. At first, when we are introduced to the main character. It seems that she and other characters are invited by some kind of artist. But it is also obvious that they themselves do not have an idea of ​​what they are invited to do. Of course, this is part of the mystery. But that seems unlikely. If I received an invitation without having any idea of ​​the deal, I would simply not go. Also, most characters are not really friendly with the end result that you never really entertain them. Another flaw is that the director departs from the basic premise that is quite frightening and brings new elements that are never explained and that are not even relevant to the "mystery of the doll". Overall, this movie was a big disappointment for me. If you want to see a good horror movie featuring dolls, check out "Dead Silence"!
