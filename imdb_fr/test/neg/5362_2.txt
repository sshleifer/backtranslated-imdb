I give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called Haunted Houses. But this kid and his friends are investigating like idiots. They assume that there are ghosts right off the bat and if they find rational explanations behind these experiences, they have to give in to drugs and scream to admit it. But beyond that, the format of the series is incredibly boring. Although it seems largely written, the university-educated children who make up the cast can barely speak English but still insist on trying to use "big" words that they obviously do not understand. And the voice of senior investigator Ryan, which seems ridiculously important to me, makes me want to throw the television out the window. (and he looks smashed all the time). In short, this group makes TAPS guys look like Ghost Hunters to MIT scientists!
