Note for myself. Never again watch a serious movie with Charlie Sheen in it. Great comedian, horrible seal. This film gives Navy SEALS the appearance of a group of reckless rangers as they are in fact the most elite military form in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy Navy SEAL's reputation. Thank you for making such an incredibly selective group of people awful in one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. It's a beautiful story that could be turned into an incredible action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but Sheen decides to destroy them with "funny" comments.
