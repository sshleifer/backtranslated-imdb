In addition to the beautiful images made by New Zealand director of photography Alun Bollinger, this film is not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The scenario is so fragmented and lost that it's hard to know what's going on at any given moment. just when you think you're following, the direction is still changing, like a bi-polar puppy dog ​​gone astray. <br /> <br /> The score is terrible, it relies too much on extremely emotional plays that try to force the audience. Feeling a certain way, as if the instruments acted like a queue of emotions? 'to feel sad here'; 'feel shocked here'; "be afraid here". In addition, the repetitive samples used over and over again leave viewers on the verge of laughing out loud. <br /> <br /> The era of the silent film is over, where musical instruments are the only representation of the voice ?? but you would not think so while watching River Queen. <br /> <br /> The voice over was so overexploited that one has to wonder if this movie really needed images. It could easily have been a radio play, although it would be difficult to follow the story. <br /> <br /> And the stolen ideas in Jane Campion's The Piano are too obvious to be ignored. Not only are the cliches of the beach and the forest are almost identical to those of The Piano ?? maybe part of it comes back to Alun Bollinger's camera work on it? but the voiceover feeling and the levels are also very close. And who could forget that the character of Holly Hunter is cut wings, in the form of his index cut by Sam Neill. Does this remind you when Wiremu amputated his "trigger finger" and, surprisingly, with an ax? That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> In the end, I can not recommend this film for visualization, unless you wear an earmuff and do not stick to the landscape.
