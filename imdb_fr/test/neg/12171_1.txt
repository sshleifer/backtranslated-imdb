When this series was released, I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long series in the vein of "The Fugitive" and "The Incredible Hulk" where the protagonist is pursued across the country in search of a solution to his problems. In this case, the problem of the hero is its progressive aging in the opposite direction. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good, especially the painful relationship between the main character and his wife. The problem is: they canceled it before it had a chance to end. (either that, or I missed the last episodes). <br /> <br /> They never had the opportunity to conclude the story either, knowing that it had been canceled. Pouf he was just gone. However, as I said before, I may have missed the last episodes. But my proof to the contrary is this: I rented the tape. Where I stopped in the series. The main character's wife dies in a fire triggered by a lawsuit involving King's famous organization, the shop. Going away, the hero is kidnapped. It ends when his friends realize they have to leave to save him from the shop. The end. Last episode. On the video: His wife does not die but escapes fire with him. By the time he should be caught by the shop, he and his wife share a strange moment and then gradually disappear. Abrupt, silly and cheap to the extreme. They just wanted to release this video and decided to end it without worrying about the seriousness of the situation. They might as well show some pictures of the first atomic bomb blast. Almost Pythonesque. <br /> <br /> The show had a nice opening start sequence on David Bowie's song of the same name
