August 25, 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is one of the greatest players of all time and I'm his fan since the 50's. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor. I had not read any reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie. The film surprised me a bit. The landscapes and views were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. In my mind, it was not one of his best films, it could be the worst. Why he chose to be in this film is a mystery. For me, going to this movie was a waste of time. I will continue to watch his films and add his films to my video collection. But I do not see wasting money to put this film in my collection
