Jack Lemmon was one of the best actors ever to grace the screen. He could easily switch from dramatic to comic roles, making most of his peers green with envy. While his performance in "Save The Tiger" is worthy of the Oscars, I think it was given to him, because he had missed his other chances of winning the prize because of other better roles that had preceded it. > <br /> It's also one of those pretentious movies that showcases the talent of the cast, or in this case, a particular member. It's a pity that the exit of the screenwriter does not correspond to that of Lemmon. Do not waste your time with this one.
