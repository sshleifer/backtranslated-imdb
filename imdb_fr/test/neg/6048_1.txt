I just saw it .... the story, the plot, the script makes absolutely no sense !! His Samvise the courageous part 2 (without the RING), his characters appearing unexpectedly (without reason), his Hercules hated by all (no one knows why), his Leelee Sobiesky showing his true talents (two of them) , its crappy special effects, some good actors wasting their talents (did I mention the two talents of Leelee ??) ... should I say more ??? ITS JUST AWFUL, even for NBC-TV standards !!! It's just the lowest .... what a mess! by the way: how can you give this mini-series so many stars ????? It's beyond me! .... Shame on you! I have to do 10 lines, so that's my last word: AVOID, AVOID, if you plan to buy it!
