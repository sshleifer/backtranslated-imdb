A terrifying and boring sequel to zombies is only slightly better than Uwe's first horrible movie. This is a group of soldiers who visit a university campus infested with zombies to find a certain type of blood that could help find a cure for the infection. These soldiers are your typical slaughter lambs and none of them are attracted (or at least not very interesting). You do not feel sadness in the pit of your stomach when thrown away. The movie has typical zombies biting humans and splashing blood. It even has the same nibbling tripe. It just does not do anything for the zombie genre to give it any memory. And the climax of the story is rather anti-climactic and ridiculous. One wonders how two people can immerse themselves in an army of zombies and not be bitten (because they are the main stars who always seem to handle the escape) while others seem to be bitten quite easily. The only motivation for the film is to show people to get caught .. nothing else. Just go watch a Romero movie for a lasting effect.
