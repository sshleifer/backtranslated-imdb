Dear Mr. Dante, <br /> <br /> Dude, seriously ... the title of the series is "Masters of Horror". And anyway, it's supposed to be an opportunity to show off your horror chops, to show the world why you deserve to be called a "master" of the genre. Apparently, you misunderstood the exercise. Apparently, you thought it was your opportunity (or worse, your duty) to educate the American public about your political beliefs. And your attempt is disgusting, domineering and especially preaching. <br /> <br /> The only reason anyone who scored your short film as a high score is because their political views coincide with yours. It does not bother you that this kind of policy is imposed on them. <br /> <br /> Me, I do not care what you believe, they believe, or I think ... I just want such obvious messages (not subtle) and not funny (not satirized) out of my horror . And although there are certainly other "Masters of Horror" that have been huge disappointments or for which I have just been confused in general, why would this director (william malone?) Be considered a genre "master" ... misses the whole point of the series. <br /> <br /> So next time ... can you please just keep your policy preached for you?
