This film is poorly written, difficult to follow, and shows poor performance and dialogue from filmmakers Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The credible but weak premise (an undersea agent succumbing to the world of drugs) deserved better than this flop of Lili Fini Zanuck. The competent support cast (Sam Elliott, William Sadler, others) was not enough to save this film. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film also contains the worst scene "love" of cinema. <br /> <br /> In addition, the soundtrack is largely overestimated; especially the "Tears in Heaven" revolting and without substance on the part of the legendary Eric Clapton. <br /> <br /> "Rush" is totally unforgettable from start to finish. <br /> <br /> 2 of ten
