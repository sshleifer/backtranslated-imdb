Susan Slept Here turned out to be Dick Powell's swan song as a big-screen performer. Of course, he made other films and appeared frequently on television until his death. Too bad he did not go out with his performance in The Bad and the Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Frank Tashlin has made so many better films that I'm still not sure what's got him to do it. The premise is absolutely laughable. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is a screenwriter trying to do more serious things than the fluff he wrote. He had an idea for a film about juvenile delinquency, so two friendly police officers at Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon left Debbie Reynolds, 17, at his door. She is not really bad and they do not want to put her in the system. So they give it to Dick Powell at Christmas time. <br /> <br /> I mean, is there anyone who does not see a problem? The term jailbait comes immediately to mind. Plus, Powell has a girlfriend, the sexy young Anne Francis. Why Debbie Reynolds is a competition here is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Susan slept Here has an Oscar nomination. The song Hold My Hand, sung by Don Cornell in the background, was nominated for the best song, but was lost to Secret Love. <br /> <br /> Powell and Reynolds have fun times together. Alvy Moore (Powell's factotum) and Les Tremayne (his lawyer) also had a few bursts of laughter. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough.
