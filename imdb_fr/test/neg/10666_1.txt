I watch films of the last 10 years, I think, and I must say that I have never felt so bad, what I felt after watching this very big movie, it was really bad. There were songs and songs. Nobody should watch this movie. The director showed English speaking Germans, which is so bad. The Germans do not speak English. & In one scene, a white girl asked Himesh for an autograph. (In short, he must have given him money) In the promo they showed, get ready for the Laughing riot. But I could say there was only one scene where Himesh was laughing for no reason, maybe he thought he was funny. Hansika is fine. she is like an angel. But too young, only 16 years old. If you have a lot of time and you do not know what to do, you should watch this movie, if not its waste of money
