Please ... if anyone has the chance to read this BEFORE watching the movie, if you can call it that, do not do it ... do not waste your time !!!! Me too, I watched this movie just after finishing the book, and I was seriously disappointed ... the main character is basically a new Fanny, because she has NO resemblance to the book ... she is so Lives and laughs all the time ... if there was one thing that the author wanted to highlight is that she was a very shy and introverted character ... please !!!! ! All the most important parts of history, which are supposed to transmit until the end, are simply not taken into account ... and the rest is invented !!! I think it's better to use the time needed to read an excerpt from the novel or do nothing.
