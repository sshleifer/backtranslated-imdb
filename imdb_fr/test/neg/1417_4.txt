I saw a showing of this film last night. I was expecting a lot, but I was disappointed. Less than 5 minutes after opening, Williams is already campaigning for his presidency. And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. So, there is all this aspect of the film. The first half hours are hilarious. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments. But after the first half hour, the worst is coming. It becomes less a comedy, more a thriller / drama / love story ... which is useless. the film goes nowhere and stays still for a good 30 minutes. there are bursts of laughter interspersed here and there, but the always funny part is at the beginning and only at the beginning. At one point, the greatest joy I've heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd shouted "boooo" during a very confused scene. Williams gives an excellent performance, at the height of his comic style. Walken also plays an important supporting role, as he can not do. I think the character who is underestimated is Lewis Black. Constantly vulgar and political, it is amusing to see him downgrade to get a PG-13 rating. Overall, I would not pay to see the movie. After all, I saw it for free and I was even disappointed. The first half hour is solid and everything is downhill. Not really corresponding to a category, the film realizes midway that it should not have been more than a one-hour special show. 4.5 / 10
