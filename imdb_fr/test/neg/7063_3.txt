Nobody will confuse THE SQUALL with a good movie, but this one is memorable. Once you have assimilated the performance of Myrna Loy as Nubi, this gypsy with warm blood, you will not forget it. When this film was shot, Miss Loy, an exotic beauty, was still considered a foreign fox, often Asian and generally sinister. She is definitely an eyeeful here. It seems that his skin is darkened and that his hair is curly. In most scenes, she is barefoot and wears little more than a skirt and a loose blouse, while in a scene she wears nothing but a patterned towel. I guess I'm focusing on Miss Loy's appearance because she's by far the best, if not the only, reason to tune into this crisp antique and keep looking. You will certainly not be attracted to dialogue, which is hopeless. In a typical passage, Nubi looks out of the window at the caravan that leaves and waxes poetically: "Always the gypsies, they sing ... weird and sad, when the great sun has a hot flash that burns and when the pale moon looks from behind a cloud and breathe cold air like death, they sing. "Poetic or what? Lovers of purple prose will have a day on the field. I can not help wondering if, in her last years, Miss Loy preferred not to remember her involvement in this project. <br /> <br /> Like so many previous discussions, this one was an adaptation of a recent Broadway hit. . The theatrical version opened at 48th Street Theater in November 1926 and lasted more than a year. The play provoked a famous episode featuring humorist and theater critic Robert Benchley, known for his dislike of characters speaking a thick dialect or English pidgin. According to an anecdote repeatedly repeated, Mr. Benchley would be uncomfortable during the first part of this program. The Spanish village setting (moved to a village in Hungary for the film, for some reason) gave the actors some leeway to practice their accents with varying degrees of success, but Benchley's patience reached its limits when, At a family dinner, a door burst open and an actress dressed as a gypsy woman rushed into the room shouting, "Help, help, he keel!" She threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the house and exclaimed: "Me, Nubi, good girl, stay here!" At that moment, Mr. Benchley stood up and announced to his companion, "Me Bobby, I'm a bad boy, go now" and left the theater. <br /> <br /> The movie version offers many examples of unintentional humor, but never gets close to Benchley's level of mind. The melodramatic plot concerns the Lajos family: Father Josef, mother Maria and son Paul, studying at the nearby college. We would consider this prosperous family as a "middle class superior", since they are landowners and enjoy all the comforts of life, but their comfortable existence is suddenly put to the test when a caravan of gypsies arrives in the village and their house is invaded. Nubi the nubile gypsy girl. She comes to their door during the storm of the title - symbolizing the stormy emotions, I can say. The girl flees an abusive relationship and asks for refuge. After considering the issue, the Lajos family agrees to hide it from her angry lover, who comes up soon after but is turned away. Nubi becomes a servant in the house. Kindness motivates the family's decision to take her, but soon enough, Nubi reimbursed them by seducing all the valid males around, starting with the Lajos' servant, Peter, then up the hill. to his son Paul. Nubi breaks Paul's relationship with his fiancée Irma (played by Loretta Young, still a teenager), loses him from school, and then invites him to buy his jewelery by stealing the savings from the family's maid, Lena (ZaSu Pitts). Lena, for her part, is still mourning the loss of her own fiancé Peter, seduced and thrown aside by Nubi when she turned her attention to Paul. In the end, Nubi is interested in pater familias Josef, and I suppose that if the race time had been longer, she would also have attacked Uncle Dani, Maria, the village priest and God does not know who other. <br /> <br /> I guess it goes without saying that a scenario like this is easy to parody, but during its first half, THE SQUALL nonetheless exerts the undeniable fascination of a daytime soap : we watch, hypnotized, as the Bad Girl exerts her charm on men people and havoc as an irresistible force of nature (almost like - a storm! Ah-haa, another metaphor!). But as the machinations of the plot squeak at the party, the joy of living disappears. In later scenes, Nubi is less emphasized and the focus is on the dysfunctional dynamics of the Lajos family. After a while, these people become a real brake. The son in particular behaves like an absolute heel, but parents never recognize him or face their own weaknesses; Everything, we were told, is the fault of Nubi, this not-good wanderer. <br /> <br /> The cast men are sad. In addition to Miss Loy, the only actress able to play in walkie-talkies is ZaSu Pitts, brilliant as usual. The mother of the Lajos family is played by Alice Joyce, a long-time silent star who was out of her element with speaking roles and who retired shortly thereafter. Loretta Young's pretty beauty offers a nice contrast to Nubi's dark look, but her line readings are so awkward that it's quite endearing. No, there's only one reason to watch this movie, it's Nubi herself. I can not think of another actress who could have played this silly role and managed to get by half. I am not an objective observer, however. I have a desperate crush on Myrna Loy and I will look at her in anything, even THE SQUALL.
