Peter Yates's film from Steve Tesich's pen is a relatively unobtrusive "thriller" that really fails to take off. The story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential Asian businessman and the subsequent involvement of a pathetic veteran from Vietnam (James Woods) who, according to the police, could have taken revenge on his former employer. As an "eyewitness", William Hurt never believes that his friend is capable of such an act. <br /> <br /> Hurt is well below his usual strength and it is difficult to sympathize with him or with an uninspired Sigourney Weaver. James Woods and Christopher Plummer are doing a little better in their supporting roles. It should be noted the appearance of Morgan Freeman as Black detective. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the story of Steve Tesich is just an unlikely plot in the form of a mysterious movie. The plot is far too artificial. <br /> <br /> Friday, October 17, 1997 - Video
