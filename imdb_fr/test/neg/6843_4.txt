Ireland's most fertile man revolves around Eamon Manley, 24, still a virgin. He lives with his mother in Belfast. He is also a very shy guy towards women. Everything has changed for Eamon when he is seduced by a woman (as much as I can remember a neighbor). It is not because he loses his virginity but he discovers that he has a great power. Despite her protection, this neighbor becomes pregnant. The doctor tells him he has a very large number of sperm. His mother brilliantly advances an idea that makes us see babies with red heads at the end of the film. He's starting to help women on both sides of Belfast to conceive babies. First voluntarily, then with the help of his colleague, runs a business. Ireland's most fertile man had some fun times, but he needed better jokes and a better script. I could not help but think that it gave me the impression of a TV sitcom rather than a movie. Kris Marshall is a different name on the big screen but does not shine like a star. It's more like the guy you saw in this or that movie. It's like he's in love (actually, I think he was very funny in that one) ... Well, it was normal to watch but I could not stop myself from falling asleep in time. ** out of *****
