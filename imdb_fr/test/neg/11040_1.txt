When one of my friends recommended it to me, pleased with the quality of the film, the underlying themes and the overall greatness of the film, I was obviously expecting an amazing film, at least entertaining. <br /> <br /> Both The hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge waste of time disappointing. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film is supposed to be surrealistic, but even in surrealist films, there is something that anchors it, even if it's just the least bit. This film, on the other hand, felt forced and false. Many shots were useless and it made me think that the director was doing his best to be artistic. <br /> <br /> The acting was mediocre and the relationships between the characters were not developed enough. Maybe it's just that I miss something that others might see but I did not even realize there was any attraction between Dae su and Migo before they started doing it like rabbits at random from the movie. Again, maybe this movie was just bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not against violence in movies, but in this one, almost all was useless. Through all the fight scenes, I felt frightened by the painful clarity. <br /> <br /> And the plot? The word laughable comes to mind. I would be amused if I had not lost two hours of my life following this ill-conceived and ridiculous plot. Despite all the flaws of the film, in the end, I was expecting something interesting to conclude. I will not discuss the end, because I do not want to "spoil" the film for those who have not seen it. Just that the metaphor "Be a rock or a grain of sand, in the water they flow like the same thing". can not be used to explain everything. <br /> <br /> All video has been designed for shock value and shock value only. I just hope that sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognize a bad movie for what it is. I have seen many other great Korean movies and I am depressed by the fact that people have called Oldboy the best.
