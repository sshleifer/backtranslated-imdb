Evan Almighty continues Bruce's almighty consumer franchise, this time with Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), a new Buffalo Congressman in his center. A man totally inoffensive (and not even really self-doubting), God (Morgan Freeman) decides to impose a kind of quest on Baxter, to illustrate the importance of reciprocal kindness, so that Baxter can "change the world" "(ie, pay it in advance). <br /> <br /> Think of Evan Almighty as a healthy derivative of" Distinguished Gentlemen. "Baxter is not a scammer, but his colleague, Long Congressman (John Goodman), wants his full support for a bill that, in essence, harms the environment and well-intentioned, Baxter, aware of the the importance of networking and visibility, is willing to support it. <br /> <br /> In addition, with the new job, more and more responsibilities, and Baxter is, in a sense, vilified not to spending enough time with his family. <br /> <br /> Then God decides to guide Evan Baxter by forcing him to become the Noah of modern times. es: build an ark, except that while it may seem a bit humorous to see Baxter's transformation into "weirdo with a beard-o", there does not seem to be any reason to think about all this, which becomes much brighter when the film's climax crumbles. (SPOILERS: If no "population" is killed by the "deluge", then what was the point of summoning the animals ... or at least those who were obviously not from the suburbs of Virginia? Or, more importantly, if all Baxter had to realize that Long's projects were faltering in their quality, so why did he need to build an arch?). <br /> <br /> Thus, although a comedy like this should not be a hysterical laugh-riot, was surely a much less enjoyable rendering because it was cluttered with homilies (and not all of Morgan Freeman's ) and actions that seemed destined for a film of more epic events.
