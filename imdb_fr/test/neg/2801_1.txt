It may be the worst of the worst. I am a big fan of the horror film industry and I can believe that this movie has been licensed. The acting was juvenile and the story completely stupid. The camera work was also juvenile. A scene that comes to my mind is outside a store. It's dark and you can see the moon, but the characters all have shadows projected on the wall. There was no street light to see. A character is eviscerated at one point, but manages to resurface later after retiring from a position. Come on !!! I felt like I was watching a college play. I was still expecting the characters to greet family members and say "Hello Mom". I can only give him two positive comments ... it ended and it was good to laugh. Please do not rent this movie !!!!
