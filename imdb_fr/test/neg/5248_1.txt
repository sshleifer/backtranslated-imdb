By renting this movie live, I was not expecting an amazing cinematic piece. (Not to say simply because a movie is in the cinema, it will do so.) This film, which follows only very vaguely the story told in the epic poem, offers a unique look at the story of monsters and super humans. General photography can be summed up in conflict, with its mixture of medieval and post-apocalyptic (reminiscent of Mad Max). With a soundtrack rock and techno, it comes out a little distressed. The battle scenes, while incredible, are fun and Christopher Lambert has some of the most interesting weapon combinations I've ever seen on film, though often a bit inefficient. The special effects used for the Grendel monster are surprisingly effective and are one of the few strengths. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert has an average performance of Beowulf. It will not be as memorable as Highlander, but at least it was not as poor as Fortress. The support troop is rather neutral. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good action-adventure story with a complex and appealing plot, I would not recommend this movie. However, if you want a film that has little substance, contains many scenes of battle and a fairly predictable plot, find a copy.
