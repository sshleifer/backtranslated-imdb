I thought it was a very bad movie. As long as I watched this movie, I could not help but think how bad it was and how much it was $ 3.69. The plot was so nervous. They did a great job early on, explaining who was coming out with whom in high school, but they never really explained anything afterwards. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it a regular thriller? Apparently you can decide for yourself because they did not see the need to explain. I understood essentially what happened, I think. What baffled me was all this before, what was the problem with bloody noses, phone calls, etc.? Did this guy come back? Did the woman channel "Carrie" or something? Who knows? You certainly will not do it after watching this movie.
