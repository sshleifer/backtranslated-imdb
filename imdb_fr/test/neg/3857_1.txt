I can not believe there are people who voted 10 for this garbage! Did any of you have access to a computer in the madhouse where you are undoubtedly guarded, or is there a special colony in which particularly rude people are secretly imprisoned and I do not not know? <br /> <br /> If I were to say what I really thought about this film, none of this would be published. <br /> <br /> For starters, his "star" is an idiot without talent who behaves like a bad impersonator Jim Carrey who has upset enough An angel sprinkles his nose to resurface the desert of the Sahara. His name will be a total guarantee that I will not watch a future film with him, even if he plays a rock hidden by a crowd. <br /> <br /> As for the plot. Another crime we can say to the Nazis is that they were so awful that they can be considered fair play as "bad guys" in guts like this; simple criminals and murderers would have the public on their side in the blink of an eye. <br /> <br /> To the people who made this film - Give up the cinema and if it's not the case, limit yourself to advertising, where your efforts will carry less have the virtue of being ephemeral . <br /> <br /> Finally, a criticism of the BDIM: why do not you have the opportunity to vote "Zero" for a film? Or maybe not. To express my contempt for this tripe, I should then vote double zero, or something like that.
