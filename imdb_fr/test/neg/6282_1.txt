SPOILERS <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> It is Tenchi? </ br> <br /> It's not Tenchi. <br /> <br /> Virtually everyone is horribly written out of character ... As far as characterization is concerned, the only good thing is the friendship between Ayeka and Ryoko. Moreover, the wicked is not punished for her actions, which amounts to mind-controlled rape. If a perpetrator had inflicted on one of the women what Haruna did to Tenchi, he would have (painfully) bought it at the end of the film, dying horribly, and the public would have applauded it. But not only does Haruna not pay a price for his crimes, but Ryoko forgets and understands his actions. No! The real Ryoko would have disintegrated it for what Haruna had done to his beloved Tenchi; the audience with whom I saw this, myself included, was booed audible at this scene <br /> <br /> Fans of anime, avoid this film. Fans of Tenchi, avoid this film even stronger.
