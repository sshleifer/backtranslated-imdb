Let me start with a dreadful story and an awful control system. good animation but not too much graphics. that's why I give this game 4 out of 10. THIS GAME REALLY NEEDS AN IMPROVEMENT IF YOU ASK ME !!! I would like to redo it and improve this control system so that the jaw is not so difficult to control. If I did it to improve it, I would make these graphics more beautiful than on the film. it will drive everyone crazy when we get killed so easily. I played this and was killed by a diver when he had one of these knives in 2 shots. the dolphins are going to kill you so much that the shark is going to pray to get to the bottom of hell. this game sucks a big ass. sorry for all swearing, I think I'm done now. it's just that this game sucks so much that it should be removed from the store shelf. I challenge you to play in the trash and you will probably become so angry by dying so easily so do not play !!!!!!!!!!!!!
