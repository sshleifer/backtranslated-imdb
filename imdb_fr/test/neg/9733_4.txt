Basic Summary: Ipswitch was a community of wizards and escaped the Salem witch hunt by forming a secret pact. The firstborns of these families have supernatural powers and have to deal with the seductive and addictive nature of the use of these powers. <br /> <br /> Well, I usually give the movies the benefit of the doubt and start from a 5, from here: <br /> <br /> Production: -1 for a very obvious sound out of sync , +1 for special effects well done, the darkling gave me chills, +0.5 for a beautiful colorization (I like the dull blue), -0.5 for the stupid soundtrack, +0.5 for the sequence d Opening - I am an idiot for stylish compositions and dazzling title titles. <br /> <br /> History / scenario: +1 for decent main idea, -0.5 for DBZ / Matrix / Street Fighter ripoff / pastiche, -1 for not explaining some threads of the plot (spiders, darkling ), -1 for a boring and predictable ending, -1 for free exposure, both in the form of words on the screen and as a fictitious soft monologue <br /> <br /> Acting / Characterization: -0.5 for a bad acting, although it gets a little better as the movie progresses, -1 for lake k character development, especially for all women <br /> <br /> Others: +1 for the free male and female nudity, which is fun to watch, and +0.5 for non-sex scenes that are usually made for this genre very badly and end up being boring rather than hot, +1 to have hit its target audience, teen science fiction / horror / thriller fans, even though this movie is not exclusively of this genre. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's not a "film", it's a FILM. There is really nothing to analyze, it's just good, fun (relatively) clean. Many actors and actresses really attractive. Many boys are fighting in the style of DBZ and Street Fighter. If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects and / or funny intrigues, this movie is for you. If you prefer Oscar-winning film masterpieces and exquisite production with tons of multi-layered allegorical tricks and revolutionary visualization techniques, this film will probably not please you. <br /> Using my twisted logic, this film gets a 4/10 movie.
