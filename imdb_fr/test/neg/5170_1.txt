There is no doubt that the Kokoda Trail describes a truly memorable event in the history of the Australian Army: the brave defense of Australia against the cruel Japanese barbarian army. However, this film does not take into account the history of the "Fuzzy Wuzzy's" or the natives of New Guinea that the Australians used to help them carry out military operations there. The film also fails to give a credible account of the Australian soldier and his behavior at this event. This is more like a contemporary vision misinformed of what was then. <br /> <br /> Once again, the Australian film industry has failed to give this important chapter in its history the film it deserves. It's the worst film with arbitrary cinematography, bad scripts and dialogs, no character development and jungle clich√© war scenes. <br /> <br /> He fails to imbue the audience in a perspective other than the Japanese army that was ruthless and cruel murderers of a group of poorly equipped and ill-trained Australians fighting in a jungle. <br /> <br /> The film failed, unlike most Australian films, which attracted a large Australian audience. I'm not going to join the usual parish bin to say it's great because it's an Australian movie. I say either do a great job or leave it to someone who knows how. This government-funded film is just another failure for the rich and spoiled children of Australia. <br /> <br /> I do not give him any star because it's an insult to the descendants of these great Australians and their enormous sacrifices. What a shameful waste and disrespect and I know this criticism will cause more negativity in the Movie Show team and most critics, but I get my opinion and that's what the Australians fought for OUR FREEDOM, which includes freedom of speech and the right to express an opinion.
