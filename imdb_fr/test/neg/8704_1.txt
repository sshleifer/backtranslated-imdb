As a Christian, I am outraged after seeing only the first half of this picture. The film's website says they did some research before writing, but I think they forgot to check out the ultimate source, THE BIBLE. I sat down with two different versions of the Bible and could not find half of what was happening or was said in this picture. It was as if they were composing what was not in the Bible and changed what was in the Bible into what they thought modern movie buffs would like to see in the place of truth. Personally, I'm too young to remember the Ten Commandments of the 1950s, but that can not be worse. I have written to the network and I can only hope that they will apologize publicly for this tragedy.
