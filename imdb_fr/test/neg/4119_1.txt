I do not remember the last time a movie was so boring that I went out. The Weatherman and The Island were both so bad that I thought about it but I even stayed to the end. This movie was incomprehensible, not funny and continued again and again. Like other commentators, I wondered if some parts were just French humor that I did not understand or if the characters were serious. I finally finally gave up and tried to take a nap because I did not want to disturb my husband if he liked it, but he noticed and let me know that it was OK if I wanted to leave and we leaving by the door. He would like to know how it ended ... if Denevue lived or died, etc. (I do not care).
