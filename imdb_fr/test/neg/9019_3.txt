This slightly heavy sci-fi-horror story of the late '50s is not quite a loser. It is an inhabited space rocket that crashes into a remote area. A group of scientists will investigate and discover that the astronaut is in a kind of coma; he is kept alive by extraterrestrial embryos mysteriously implanted in him. Anyway, the title of alien monster is quickly raising its head, causing widespread havoc, including a partial withdrawal of the head. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is its stimulation. The appearance of the Bloody Beast takes a while and it only really takes off in the last 20 minutes or so. It's definitely a completely ridiculous creation, but it's really not a problem because it provides a sufficient amount of comic relief. At the end of the movie where we have the last clash and where this ridiculous creature starts talking with the doctor's voice that he killed earlier, you'll do well not to laugh. The same goes for the brilliant x-ray scene where we see extraterrestrial embryos floating in the astronaut's body - it's too funny for words. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, the fun times in Night of the Beast Blood too little and far between. If you're a sci-fi crazed fifties, then it's worth checking out this one. Do not expect too much.
