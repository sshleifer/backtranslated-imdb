He was very much loved by Flesh and eager to find Heat, but he could not help but think that Morrissey grossly exploited most of the "performers" presented here. Stumble naked in a stupendous stupor seems to be all that Dallesandro was capable of in this feature - a huge and heartbreaking contrast with Flesh. His semi-erection in some scenes is the only indication he could play; for the most part, it sounds like something he did to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation, she is the epitome of the Lower East Side. But this is a female show - she rarely engages other performers, even though her sex scene with a bottle of beer definitely leaves Halle Berry in the shadows when it comes to presenting a cinematic of raw passion . When she throws herself on a potential young lover, it's with the ferocity of a vampire. Andrea and Jane, two female performers, have such an annoying voice that you will have to cut the sound to get through their scenes. The fact that many of these artists committed suicide or were murdered a few years later only adds to the air of exploitation. But they were probably desperate to find themselves in front of Morrissey's camera anyway. There is probably no worse way to spend a Saturday night but at least it gives a specific time and place to life.
