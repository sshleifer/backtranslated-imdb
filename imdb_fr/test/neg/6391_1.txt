I never intended to write a review of this movie. In fact, I was just looking for the name of the star of the movie, and then I started reading reviews ... I guess I'll never learn. This movie is horrible! I will not justify my comments for specific reasons, because I really have a hard time believing that anyone with any taste LOVES that. A guilty pleasure? Okay, I suppose. But such a bad film that wastes such good talent (Caine, Gelbart and Donen) is not a reason for mourning to be a pleasant diversion. A weak point for all participants, except perhaps Bologna, who has to spend the night trying to determine which bomb was the bomb that destroyed his career.
