The housekeeper was by far a very pitiful film. I do not use that word roughly because it was really a bad excuse for a movie. I finished looking at this feature with one word in mind ?? "Why"? Honestly, you can use this question at the end of every scene in this movie and it seems like it's okay. There were so many inconsistencies that led to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters), which ultimately led to a very confusing movie with actors browsing the movements instead of giving a explanation. Scenes would occur without prefiguration, understanding, or conduct towards a complete end. It was as if I was looking at several different ideas gathered without any resolution. The actors set in motion events that did not seem to match their character or were really resolved. It was my biggest problem with this movie. The total and total lack of structure of this film caused all traces of foundations to collapse with a real "training effect" felt in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Let me explain more about this lack of coherence throughout the film. I would compare this film to a lumpy bowl of gruel containing a zebra. It made no sense and there was no logic behind it. Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this act. The features of his character were very vague and almost transparent. She did things like talking sex all the time with her sister, but she always seemed very open to sexual experiences. She has her first moment of passion in this film, without pain or excitement. It happens nonchalantly and that does not seem to correspond to the initial conversation we had at the beginning of the film with Rosina and her sister. She is a very intelligent woman who accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full right on her invention? It was confusing and completely random. Is it not obvious to anyone that his teaching methods were non-existent? Any sensible person could see that she was not teaching anything to Cavendish's daughter. The sudden and delicate relationship between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers at random almost made me laugh out loud. I thought maybe I had discovered some magic in this movie when Rhys-Meyers had literally "screwed up" in the scene and suddenly caused a useless drama. He thought that the director (or the writer) thought that the original story was not going anywhere fast, so by adding this random character, we may be able to advance a little in the plot (or confuse the greatest fans movies). Well, that did not fool me, I saw that he was almost a cut-and-paste character used to reinforce an already weakened story. Do not throw me in the end, which has no coherence with the rest of the story. Using the cut-and-paste method again, the screenwriter of this film needed a way to end the story, and that was the only way it could happen. It's sad when the actors are forced to do things out of the character but I guess that's the name of the game in Hollywood. Corrected until it is completely broken, or at least recoverable. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story was an irrelevant dribble. There may have been a handful of neat cinematic moments where you could see that there was a hint of creativity that was trying to break through coupled with some decent-time piece music measures, but nothing for which to write to grandmother. A more family-friendly structure with stronger introductions could have strengthened the movie a bit more, but as I said before, leaving open scenes around the movie, you'll experience a crack in your movie. face powder. What may seem like a solid story will eventually wear out over time and at the end of this movie, I felt the house collapse on me. Wilkinson plays his own normal role in this movie, while Driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone knew it too (I will have to see a doctor after these pictures get burned in my eyes? In addition, she wore the same dress every day. It was disgusting and I could feel it on TV. Sex and dirty laundry. Now, there is a good movie for you! There seemed to be potential to float here, but instead, it was just garbage. Nothing was answered, the questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to reign to perfection. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film could have been a decent film combining both the powerful themes of science and love, it was just pitiful. I can not emphasize enough the disturbing fact that characters went through movements without any explanation. I do not need cinematic moments like a child, but something should have been done to build a foundation. Just remember oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used. If you were as confused as I am about this, you would perfectly understand the movie The housekeeper, whereas if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal? so, maybe this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Note: * on *****
