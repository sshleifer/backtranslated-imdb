. . . and only if you like the sight of a beautiful woman with pretty inflatable jugs running around the so-called African jungle. So, no problem for most men there. <br /> <br /> I looked at it as one of those bundles. Forget the plot, which is essentially a fragile plot for our heroine to show her pots on the screen at every opportunity. Just to give you an idea, our heroine turns from vine to vine and climbs on the most beautiful animals for no reason, just to allow you to see its carafes from every angle. Again, no complaints. <br /> <br /> "Battle scenes" are laughable and borderline pornographic material. Our heroine was caught by the bad guys at least five times in the movie. In cases where she has to fight, the "fight" is to roll in the ground, growl without conviction and fight like kittens. I am surprised that there is no hair pulling. It gets so bad that the evil leader had to remind the "fighters" that "I said, whoever gets the first blood wins!" to avoid watching more stupid fights. <br /> <br /> The witch doctor Kuku was a bloody explosion. Big bear hug at first, he became manic-depressive when he was captured, then completely psychopathic. He spent the whole movie whispering irrelevant sentences. <br /> <br /> Beside Liana (our heroine) leaping on her legs, you will also have the chance to see many other Amazonians, as well as a woman who decided to jump naked in the lake to to bathe without good reason. Yes, it's that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Look at the beautiful Liana in her inflatable glory. Although the film is over 20 years old, it's never old to see blond women show off their pretty carafes on screen.
