(May contain spoilers) This film is the epitome of strangeness. I rented it in the hope of a film so bad that it would be funny. However, honestly, I still can not decide if this movie was supposed to be scary or humorous. He combines emotions in a rather disturbing way. Apparently, it's about being smart, but it's not. For example, when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher, he starts playing a joyous music. When we go to Toxico, we almost beat, almost Mr. Roger's neighborhood music. However, when the small child dreams of falling into the "blood" and finding the leg, it is clear that these symptoms are tense. So, watch this movie and decide for yourself. It's too weird to be described in words and for that I say, well done. <br /> <br /> "Nose-pique ... WOW!"
