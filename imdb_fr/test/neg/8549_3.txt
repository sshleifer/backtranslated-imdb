Despite an absolutely horrible scenario (we will talk about it later), this film is still vaguely watchable simply because it features two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Aside from one or two REAL pubs, I would probably watch just about anything with them in the movie, as I'm a big fan of the golden age of Hollywood in the thirties and forties. However, no matter how much I love their movies, I just can not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation in a ski resort. The two have not met yet, but the film begins noisily and odiously with a scene in which Fonda horribly gloating while skiing. It was done so quietly and I cringed, but I stuck it - especially when Fonda fell into a snow bank and it stopped the yodel !! In hindsight, I should have just had to turn it off! Fonda is stunned in the fall and Barbara goes for help. Back at the ski lodge, he seems to be doing well, but luckily, she is also a doctor and gives X-rays and heals him again. In turn, he is passionate about her and offers him. Although they hardly know each other, they get married and until now, the film seems a sweet but very light romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Once home, however, not everything is rosy, she immediately resumes her job as a family doctor and he begins to show signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man because of his jealousy. The movie plays for fun, but frankly, Fonda's behavior was really scary: spying on her and her male patients, attacking or threatening ANY man she heals, tripping an already injured woman on the back, insisting that everything the world (men and women) is here to steal his wife. He presents himself as a combination of sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic, but everything is supposed to be made to laugh. Considering he seems to be a dangerous fool, one would think that Stanwyck is asking for a cancellation with a no contact order! But, oddly enough, she gets angry but just can not stay angry at Fonda because he's so ........? I can not think of the right word - 'creepy' is all that comes to my mind !!! Later, Fonda, a multimillionaire, finds a job out of the ordinary in a department store. Then, through a magical thought, he and Babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is a thing of the past - a job thus apparently heals anger and suspicion. When this work fails, the film ends when Fonda buys her own hospital, gives Barbara a job and allows them to live happily ever after. They will not go further in history, but I suppose that, according to the character of Fonda, he spent most of his time as a hospital administrator beating all male patients. <br /> <br /> The first part about the ski lodge and the next did not fit well, nor did the final section "Horatio Alger" inspired by the rich boy from the business world. They looked like three separate intrigues, but even so, the film's most serious problem was its appearance of excusing domestic violence and delusional jealousy! What a scary little movie! Thank goodness, neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other beautiful films.
