This movie is one of the most boring horror movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen a lot of it). Personally, I liked the fact that everything is original, but other than that, it was rather unassailable. I could not stand Dee Snider as an actor or singer. It seemed to me that he was trying with everything he said to make a memorable quote, which they were not. I can get free movies and I still did not think it was worth it.
