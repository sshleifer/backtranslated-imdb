My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable television on a lazy Saturday night, thinking it might show an unusual role to Juliette Lewis. The film keeps its promises at least: its character is ineffective, adhering to almost all cliches of slasher horror movies. Like the movie. A cataloging of his studied membership would be a reminder of something I hope to quickly forget, so I will not do it. Basically, it is a thriller, burdensome: everyone seems guilty, rather than the two suspects of the beginning. The rule "exclude logic and obvious, and what's left is it" rule of bad horror movies works well on this one. The only surprise that had an impact on me was her final clash of the indefinite end shot: will Jane keep her appointment with her lifeguard attempt, which will indicate to her the identity (obvious to the public) of the second conspirator, propelling her into another hysterical victim's turn. Fortunately, I will never know.
