I have to admit, I love horror movies ... especially slasher films from the 80s. Hell, I even like cheeses like Sleepaway Camp and Night of the Demons. But I did not think much about this movie. The scenes of death were not very well done, the CGI was horrible, and the acting was awesome. The worst was the story that made no sense. I would say that you will save money, but chances are that if you want to see this movie ... you will do it anyway. I did not hate it ... it's just not very good. All in all, it's just another bland and lifeless horror film that's lacking in life (it's not surprising that it's been on shelves at Dimension for over a year after it was completed) .
