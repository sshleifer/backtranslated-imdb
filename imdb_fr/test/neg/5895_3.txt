Am I the only one to have thought that the purpose of this movie was graphic violence? I did not know anything about Leigh Scott when I rented it and I would not have done it if I had known that most of his previous films were horror movies. I'm not at all in that, I was just expecting an informative documentary on the 9/11 report. <br /> <br /> Instead, I had a film that was almost incomprehensible and violent. The only good thing about it for me is that it made me want to read the report, to understand what this film was about. <br /> <br /> I wrote this because I'm shocked that we've become so insensitive to violence in movies and on television that the bloggers I read the reviews were not even worth it to be commented.
