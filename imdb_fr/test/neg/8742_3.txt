Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. The young mother Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell) is struggling with a very serious illness and her husband, the self-proclaimed inventor, Sid (John Tururro) is a bit lacking in the emotional department. Unhappy with the new situation at home, their sensitive son Steven (Nathan Watt) decides to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny (Michael Richards) and Melvin (Lou Cutell) until his mother is well. Steven seems to be happier and is even interested in the lifestyle of his strange uncle. he even decides to change his name to Franz. Set in the early '60s, this drama is a little comical ... change it into wacky. Not being a fan of MacDowell, UNSTRUNG HEROES ensures my attitude; Although I enjoyed the movie and it is not a total waste.
