After a little over 50 years of passionate watching movies, I have come up with simple rules for making good movies. <br /> <br /> 1. Introduce your main characters early, certainly during the first half hour. 2. Keep your characters to a minimum. If you adapt a novel, combine the characteristics and actions of minor characters <br /> <br /> into one person. 3. Make sure the actions of your characters have credibility. If necessary, create additional scenes to establish motivation. 4. Keep the action clear. Violence does not have to be explicit, but it should not be confusing. 5. Get the best music you can buy. Often, it matters more than acting, photographing, etc. 6. Generally, if a movie is not very good in the first 10 minutes, it will have no improvement. <br /> <br /> `Cannon for Cordoba 'is a classic example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's score is rinkydink, one of the worst I've ever heard in a modest-budget movie. This is quite surprising considering Bernstein's skills ("The Man with the Golden Arm", "The Seven Wonders", "The Great Escape", "The Sons of Katie Elder"). The management of Paul Wendkos is dull and confusing. The performances vary from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti) with the very reliable George Peppard in freefall. This should not surprise you, given the poor orientation and the amateur scenario, which violate rules 1, 2 and 3. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I give "3 for Canon" for "Cordoba".
