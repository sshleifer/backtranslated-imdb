I imagine that the producers of this low-budget horror movie wanted a serious movie, but the filmmaker's heart was turned to a parody. So ... that's what we get. Installed in an abandoned spaceship 1000 years later, populated by characters and accessories from the 90s. The whole is an industrial complex, maybe a tanker, it does not matter. They use is as is, so the controls are composed of old television equipment. One of the locations is obviously the employee dining room, an old television and VCR, as well as a plastic water fountain. Tiny Lister and Coolio get the best lines by arguing throughout the story. The dialog is filled with terms that are pretty dated, even now ("A-OK, Daddy-O"), but maybe the 30th century is very retro? When the captain declares that the cargo of the ship is a cargo of coffins from "The Transylvania Station", you know that all this is a stunt. It's a bit Alien, a part of JasonX, a cheeky scam of all the best sci-fi and horror titles. At one point, Casper VanDien even told his pilot to "do it" with an impassive face. This film would have been better if he had just let everyone run with satire, but he continues to try to make the story serious ... maybe the fans were on the board that day. Anyway, not a bad killer of boredom if you are not too difficult. The effects are as good as the sets are bad.
