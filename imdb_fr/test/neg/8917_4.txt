Today You Die was the 4th Seagal movie in a mini marathon I had just held. Wow, I do not know where to start. He seems to be murmuring more and more his lines as time goes on and the scenes between Seagal and Treach where they seem to be improving are embarrassing. And what did his girlfriend's dreams have to do with anything else in the plot? I can not recommend it to anyone but Seagal's fiercest fan, and even then, his previous work is better. Of the 4 films in my marathon (Immersed, In the Sun, Foreign and Today You Die), today was the worst. A previous comment mentioned this, but the use of archive footage was pretty obvious.
