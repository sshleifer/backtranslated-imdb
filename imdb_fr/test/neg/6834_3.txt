I could not wait to see Bruce Willis in this play, especially since I remember being fascinated by the original when I was young. <br /> <br /> This movie is a perfect example of how movie companies can take a very good story and stupid until it's just another hype from the legendary American app application system. the law / army VS ((the Russians ... no, the cold war is over, do that WITH the Russians) VS the TERRORISTS, similar to probably 50 other films. <br /> <br /> In addition, it deals its public as a group of idiots The choice of the weapon is good, ridiculous, do we seriously believe that the most feared and experienced man of the strike / terrorist in the world would choose this for an assassination? /> <br /> The whole purpose of the original story was The double of intelligence between the ordinary detective to whom one entrusts the responsibility and the professional who elaborates a pitiless but elegant plan to reach his target and then flee. None of this has survived, all we have is the tired old American CIA / FBI / army against the evil terrorist plot, we have already seen it 1000 times before. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the MBA's filmmaking company realized that a new intellectual angle existed would lose the revenues of the reduced attention band, so the answer is ..... Bruce Willis, BIG explosions and a crippled plot. They assume that the American public will not be able to tell a threat to a foreign statesman (where France is on the map after all), so it must be an American! <br /> <br /> Another example of a film stained by the conference room.
