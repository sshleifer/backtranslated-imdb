It looks like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class and the teacher to sleep. <br /> <br /> Long silent speech sequences (yes, silent) of unrelated video clips. <Br/> <br /> Instead of this movie, watch the paint dry or the grass grow - it will be more interesting unless you want to see the Arabs being mean to everyone around them. <br /> <br /> Sulieman (the director) should be embarrassed by this movie mess. <br /> <br /> He deserves one for the quality of the film, a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the scenario (or lack thereof).
