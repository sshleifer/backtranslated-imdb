Every night with Jonathan Ross now mean to me his mind at first agitated and annoying with carefully chosen words, a 78 year old man by phone, then suggesting that he and Russell Brand do home and masturbate while he slept, as a means of apologizing. for making obscene calls to him. Kinky! And illegal. To laugh, maybe next time he should try it on someone he knows well, like his boss? Or a follower of Abu Hamza? Would he be amused if someone did it to one of his daughters? <br /> <br /> During all these years, I may have seen less than 30 minutes of the BBC Star Man Ross discussion-debate, because I found so many of the guests I saw were OK , it's probably most of them who appeared are OK, as far as I know. In cat, it seems pretty poor ?? Why is he so talkative about asking Conservative Leader David Cameron on this TV show if he's already masturbated to photograph Margaret Thatcher? He talked to Gwyneth Paltrow just asking if she wanted to fuck him. However, Ross's yob mentality was finally fully revealed by the revelations above, and I thought I would take this opportunity to warn the few honest people around the world who might not know how bad and ugly this man is. away from him and his family. - unless you think that all comedy should be "pissed off", that is, obscene / empty. We are not all the same here yet, although BBC and Channel 4 are abandoning all standards. <br /> <br /> In October 2008, Ross and fellow countryman Russell Brand made a series of premeditated obscene phone calls to Andrew Sachs. an answering machine (Fawlty Towers Manual) broadcast it as planned on the BBC national radio against Sachs 'request, then tried to convince Sachs' granddaughter to burn the evidence in case they were prosecuted. A significant number of people here (probably most of them who do not pay BBC license fees) found this hilarious and / or that the national scandal was exaggerated, but many people still seemed to know what was wrong and 42,851 people complained to the BBC about the incident. . Many fools of media and others have sneered about those 42,851 people who have never heard the radio show (and never want to do it) - using their argument, they probably also consider a event as the Holocaust justified, because at the time relatively few people complained to the media, and no one here among us should be horrified because we were not there. The two BBC producers initially involved in its broadcast thought it was a "very funny and brilliant" comedy and only 2 people complained about Brand's radio program at the time - which, I fear, would indicated the moral level that his 400,000 weekly listeners had leaked. using the expertise of the BBC. Very moral, the BBC tried and failed to use it to mitigate its effects in the last survey of OFCOM. Fly over Aristotle, announce the news to Lord Reith! The Sachs agent complained to the BBC, but was ignored until a conservative national newspaper got its hands on the story. The punishment of an ordinary pervert would normally be a dismissal and prosecution, or even a jail sentence, but Brand and the director of BBC Radio 2 were finally summoned to resign from the multimillionaire. Ross had been sentenced to 12 weeks of leave by the BBC boss (I suppose he first asked Ross for permission if he managed to reduce Ross' salary by £ 1,500,000 in order to prevent prosecution) to return to this program again in 2009 before the end of his contract. All this time to think of more junk and / or more insulting spirit that his 4,000,000 viewers could admire - but at least he could still laugh as usual to the bank, as usual , to keep up the morale. Some people think that his position will be untenable and that he will not be able to continue. I think his skin is so thick because the stakes are so high that he will come back without resources and reinvigorated with repressed vitriol. (Update 23.01.09: I just watched the first 5 minutes of his new series - the "most enormous cock-up" - to use its reference expression - continues to allow this ruthless and unrepentant puzzle to take money from the public like this.) But who knows: maybe in the future, after the thin British film and television industries will have comforted it for the moral attitude adopted by the 42,851 and having rewarded him with rewards, he will become a gentleman for his services rendered to Perversion by the perverts of Government. I hope at least that these two edgy deviants will register with other perverse commercial television and radio stations and stay there. Therefore, I will not pay for their violation of the law and their illegal inconsistencies in the future. In 2009, OFCOM sentenced UK television license payers to £ 150,000 fine for this "unfortunate" case - thanks to Ross for offering to pay! No. <br /> <br /> Apologists: get a sense of life / sense of humor / sense of proportion! It's not the end of the world to have a pair of talentless perverts like your heroes and there are many more worries in this world, like the price of real cheese! To sum up the family man Dross: a comedy genius for apparently millions of people (especially himself), a mere obscene telephone contact receiving an obscene pay packet from an obscene multimedia company to others. So much for our society of rectitude and political respect! As you have guessed, this does not apply to the rich and famous and will never, but only to the poor. To sum up BBC: Stumbling blindly since Huttongate, Campbellgate, Dykegate, Springergate, Crowngate, Phonegate now Rossgate I hope his next crisis will be Abolitiongate. I also hope that anyone who thinks that comedy should always be a challenge and push the boundaries, that is, offensive, is not challenged or offended by my opinion of this pervert who breaks the law, his perverse programs and his current evil employers.
