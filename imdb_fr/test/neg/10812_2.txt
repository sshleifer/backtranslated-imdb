Take your video camera, turn off all the lights in your house and shoot people who run with flashlights for an hour and a half and you have a basic idea of ​​what this movie looks like. It's very irritating to watch this kind of movie. To be fair, there are daylight scenes at the very beginning and end of the film. I love horror movies and creature functions, but this one just did not help me. Sorry. I really tried to like that. There did not seem to be much of a plot other than we have to find a way out of here. Did not learn much about the characters, so it did not matter if you lost one or two on the road. This is not the worst film in the world. "Open Water" holds this title for the moment.
