This is another example among "Americans who discover a charming stranger in an exotic European environment". This type of film has been bankrupt since the 1950s, but it continues to be rejected. I let my girlfriend convince me to see that - bad idea, we hated both of them. If all you want to see is Tuscany, try watching "Stealing Beauty" with Liv Tyler - a slightly better movie. <br /> <br /> These types of genre films are very pretty.
