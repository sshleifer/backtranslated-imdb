Like "The Blair Witch Project" before him, "Hatchet" garnered its own share of bottom-up advertising (as a passionate Fangoria Magazine reader, one-page ads are hard to miss); even after its mediocre theatrical release, the film will only survive on the hype surrounding it and will probably become a cult piece at some point. With a MySpace URL and a powerful promise (so subjectively confusing) to preserve the so-called "old-fashioned American horror", "Hatchet" will attract many curious researchers with its release on DVD (where this statement is engraved on the disc itself). even). . It may have been the large-print text of Is not It Cool News on the ads that led me to approach the movie with some trepidation (it seems Harry Knowles and his henchmen will approve any movie for VIP passes and free food), but "Hatchet" leads me to wonder what is really the conception of the "old American school" by Adam Green: "according to the evidence presented here, it means the tasteless scams of the end 80's of "Friday the 13th" and "Deliverance." The characters are unpleasant stereotypes (black guy Chris Tucker, surviving chick, topless bimbos, older couple required, Asian tour guide) whose interactions are ruined by painful and intimidating dialogues and especially obvious blows of humor (not quite bad like "Cabin Fever", but still), the script has too much padding (the "rustling" scene, for example), and "Hatchet" is also typical than any postmodern slasher of the last decade, with its only distinguishing feature, a cleverly calculated media slot machine. I will praise the gore - if you can go through the padding between eliminations, the red vino is really a wonder, and the only real reason to look at that.
