This movie really made me think ... but not the plot, the direction, the characters, an underlying message or a clever script. Far from there. I was asked what was wrong with Sam Hill behind the scenes. Clearly, something was not going at all from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I am amazed by the positive comments about the film and the performance of Jodie Foster. From the beginning, it was clear that Foster had telephoned her. A previous comment had even made a favorable mention of his facial expressions. I had to watch a different movie since Mrs. Foster (usually a personal favorite) seemed totally disinterested. <br /> <br /> In one of his first scenes with Foster, Fred Ward also seems to be distracted by his lack of energy and he strives to deliver his own lines with enthusiasm. By the time he is called to take part in a so-called desperate search for fugitive Foster, Ward also seems to have become embarrassing for the project. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dennis Hopper has always been a one-dimensional performer, so I did not expect much from him ... and he held up. <br /> <br /> Yes, this one let me think long after its end. The fact that Joe Pesci and Charlie Sheen refused to have their names associated with the project suggests that this was a real trap for everyone involved. But then learn that the director has preferred to hide behind a pseudonym says a lot. <br /> <br /> But why listen to me? I still think that Foster looks ridiculous in a dress, yet she is sensational in lace underwear.
