I remember this bomb appeared in the early 80s. At first, it seemed like a good idea. Resume an American classic using the modern cinematographic techniques of the day. The treatment of the original "Lone Ranger", Clayton Moore, was slightly foolish. The movie studio had threatened legal action if Moore continued to portray himself as the lone ranger. (Moore performed in children's hospitals as a solitary ranger for sick children.) For many Americans, Clayton Moore was just what it was; the only ranger. I had always thought that the studio could have done justice to both the fans and the legacy of the solitary tidy if Moore had been better treated. Maybe even a cameo in the new movie. Anyway, that was not the case and a lot of viewers left in droves. Also the story and the game were weak. All of this resulted in a big box office bomb, and rightly so. Personally, I'm glad the studio lost a lot of money after the way the real Lone Ranger was treated. You do not treat an American icon that way.
