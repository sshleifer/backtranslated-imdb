... if you have laughed too much for a long time and need to take a break. <br /> <br /> After reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show, I decided to activate it and check it. for myself. Everything that each of these people said about this show is absolutely true. Mind of Mencia is like a half-hour version of Mad TV, but with far worse jokes. <br /> <br /> A skit I had the displeasure of watching was "The Second Annual Olympics of the Stereotype". What is funny about blacks who have difficulty swimming or gay men named "Sparkles" who win a banana consumption contest? None of these concepts are particularly new, insightful or fun. Do we really need a joke about Star Wars every episode? This film was released 30 years ago. Mencia's solution to fun things is to mix up some stereotypes about Hispanics and throw some "beans"; and call it one day to go home to roll in his pile of money. A pure comic genius. <br /> <br /> Then, he flagrantly ripped off Jeff Foxworthy on a second show I watched, with a song "Your gay if ...". You can imagine the laughter he had when he embarked on a Ryan-Seacrest-is-gay joke. It's not as if one of them was already dead. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big fan of Jason Friedberg and Adam Seltzer movies, please stay away from this show. Especially when there are authentic comedians like Dave Chappelle who can joke about race and racism while remaining insightful.
