Red glasses <br /> <br /> I loved Avalon, I think this director has created impressive visions of the future madmen. This film was boring but pretentious. The opening scene has shown great promise that the cover and description promise a surreal action on stage as in the future black amimae. I feel like I had that with Avalon. <br /> <br /> With Red Spectacles, I was only made to feel uncomfortable wanting to understand what was going on. The film barely made sense to me and I did not care about his characters. Everything would be fine if the film was an effective art. While the opening scene seemed interesting and the scene with the giant robot-costume holding the giant machine gun in the rain looked cool, the film was not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Bravo.
