Although I watched this movie alone (thankfully), I still felt embarrassed watching him. I was encouraged to rent it by the critics on the cover and the bloody / jerky photos on the back - which led me to believe it was a kind of documentary. These actors are laughable throughout the film without being convincing. The story features an Australian Italian gang (?) Who has just fought off other gangs, then runs, fights and repeats. Supposedly, they train extremely hard, which makes them much better than other gangs. For some reason, I do not think they could hit some of these guys who are twice as big. I could be wrong ... no I'm not mistaken, this movie is not pleasant at all levels. and laugh and try to look hard. This film is not worth your time, save your money or throw it in the trash, but do not waste it for this movie.
