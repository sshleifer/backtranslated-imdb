Well, this movie was not as bad as I thought. I was expecting to give him a star. I chose to give him three. Why? Well, for a horror / science fiction movie, it's not that bad. Of course, the characters are sticky (just like their acting, including young Leonardo DiCaprio), their inexpensive effects and monsters ... well, let's say I've seen more effective Halloween costumes in elementary schools ... there was something in this movie that made me watch it until the end. A little humor helped a little I guess. And if you have always wanted to see a foreign gas pass, this film will allow you to live your dream. 3/10
