TANDEM is a strange cut in the Japanese rose genre, because he has the sex scenes and the misogynistic tone necessary for all these types of films, but he also proposes a dramatic scenario / a black comedy that seems to be his. d have been better suited to a different type of film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two isolated guys in a restaurant, each dreaming of a previous sexual relationship. One is a metro groping, the other a typical scenario of semi-rape (for this type of film). The two guys meet and start talking after one has lent a cigarette to another. They spend an evening together and talk a bit about their respective sexual lives. The film is interspersed with scenes in flashback of men's interactions with women who are at the center of their lives. The two men argue and the film ends on a strange but predictable note ... <br /> <br /> I really do not know what to do with TANDEM. It is kind of a soft-core anti-boyfriend film, like "odd couple", but does not really explore the subject satisfactorily. Nor is there much of the typical extreme thinness that is often so prevalent in these types of movies - so I can not really understand the interest. I can not say either if the movie was supposed to be funny, depressing or both. I think TANDEM could have had potential as a more serious drama with a dark side of comedy, but as a soft-hearted sex movie that tries to be too "smart" for its own sake - it does not work just not. I can not say that I hated this one, but I can not say that there is anything remarkable about it either. 4/10
