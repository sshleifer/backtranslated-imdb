On the bright side, it ended. Of course, that's the only thing this film can do. <br /> <br /> It's the worst film I've ever seen and I've seen bad ones. This movie is actually so horrible that I went to change my Children of the Living Dead ranking into a 2 just for not being Raptor. <br /> <br /> Official one-liner rating: "Come with me in another movie if you want to live."
