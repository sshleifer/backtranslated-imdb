I was hoping that Pulp would be an interesting movie, but I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pulp has very little scenario, and that never holds your interest. It was a real struggle to keep watching. When it's over, you say, "huh? This is it?!?" This is where you think after watching the movie - why did they ever bother? <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because Michael Caine is a good actor. I was also hoping to see the brilliant Lizabeth Scott in this film, but she only appears on the screen for maybe a minute. Scott is one of the best black women of the femme fatale film noir and it was her last film. <br /> <br /> Oh well ...
