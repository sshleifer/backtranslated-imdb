I am a big fan of the first four projects Ju-on. I own them and watch them every few months. I lend them to colleagues and friends so they can have a good scare in front of a quality Japanese movie. I think Takashi Shimizu created a beautiful story and presented it very effectively in these four episodes. <br /> <br /> I was a little excited about the opening of The Grudge 2 in theaters. I saw the first American Grudge before looking at the four originals. The grudge was actually quite good. Of course, the originals are better, but the 2004 American Grudge scared me for Halloween. <br /> <br /> The Grudge 2 started badly, then fell from there. I was still waiting for it to get better, make sense, show Shimizu's talent - nothing like that happened. The great thing about Shimizu's work on Ju-on is the story. Admittedly, it's usually said in a rambling style that you have to think about connecting its components, but it's still a nice story. There was no story in The Grudge 2. It was a series of free dead characters that you never had time to start worrying about. <br /> <br /> The editing was atrocious. Disjointed (as in the Japanese originals) is one thing, but the totally random character of the sequence was exhausting. I kept thinking, "It's so stupid" and "No, he did not really sell that much, did he?" It made me want to get out of the theater, go home and watch the original work, just to reassure me that Shimizu did not always realize these stupid, generic, boring, non-sensual and assembled guts. <BR /> <br /> If you really want to see this movie, I suggest you wait for 2 months to rent it. Really. Two of the five people in the theater with me went out about 45 minutes later. I wondered if I should do it myself. Going home and cleaning the house seemed like a better way to spend my time at that time. <br /> <br /> I am really shocked by the gravity of this film. Pray that Sam Raimi will not make more money to do The Grudge 3. It's not worth it anymore. Sigh.
