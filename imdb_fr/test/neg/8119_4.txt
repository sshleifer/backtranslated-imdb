Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the pretty adopted daughter of a recently deceased Japanese businessman, inherits control of her father's business. his uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), angry at not leaving the company, decides to hit his niece. When soft-eared head Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) mistakenly enters the hotel room and knocks Invincible (Jung Yuen), he is mistaken for the murderer and sent to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls in love with the beautiful heiress and ends up swearing to protect her. However, she is kidnapped by Kazuo's men while Kensuke is busy playing an arcade game with policeman Daniel (Sam Lee). <br /> <br /> Uncle Kazuo keeps Yumiko in a hypnotic trance and takes control of the business, but manages to worry himself when his gangster friends threaten to reveal his illegal activities unless he do not allow them total control. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Kensuke is teaming up with two martial arts experts, Lam Kau (Yuen Baio) and Lam Doi (Candy Lo) chasing Invincible. He learns kung fu and tries to free Yumiko. <br /> <br /> A mix of comedy, spoof and fight scenes, No Problem 2 is a disappointing film, considering the talent: the 80s superstar, Yuen Baio, directs a few scenes from fight but begins to get a little old for acrobatics; director Kar Lok Chin delivers the kind of parody that I would expect from a scary movie; Jung Yuen tends to make fun of his character in Operation Scorpion; and Sam Lee ?? Well, Sam Lee is still so annoying! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Collin Chou, like gangster Ben, impressed me; his presence on the screen is obviously strong, which has not gone unnoticed by Hollywood. Since then, he has appeared in two of the Matrix films and will be appearing soon in D.O.A., directed by Corey Yuen. I was also impressed by Wakana Sakai, but for quite a different reason: this beauty is nice to watch and should go much further in the film industry. <br /> <br /> It's fun to practice which movies are parodied, but at 104 minutes, I found this movie a real chore to go through. If people who make funny faces with stupid sound effects make you laugh, No No 2 might please you. Otherwise, I would leave well alone.
