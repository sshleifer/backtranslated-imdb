A classic recycle bin! Essentially, here we have a story about two American teenagers (a man, a woman and two beautiful people of course) who seem to be psychically linked, in that every time they fall asleep, they can live in each other and Express your most intimate desires ... think that Mills & Boon meets X-files and you will be somewhere near the mark. In fact, it is rather an unfortunate hybrid between one of Ed Wood's infamous movies and a particularly stupid episode of Melrose Place, as the special effects are void, and the acting as an actor is amateurish. The actors who live (I would not say act in this film) say their lines as if they read memory cards and sulk when they are supposed to show an emotion, and that does not represent a big shock (nor a loss for industry) that they have since disappeared in the dark. All this is just a ridiculously misguided mix of styles that are not going at all, and the end result is an intriguing curiosity that will undoubtedly be spoiled by so bad film providers, they are good, over the years come. I'll probably be the only person to ever comment on this movie, but if you read and see it, come back, it feels a bit lonely here ...
