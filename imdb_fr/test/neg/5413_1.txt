Wow, where to start with this one. Well, if you like to laugh at the failures of the filmmakers, then this one is for you. I bought this film for $ 5 because I never miss an opportunity to laugh at B-movie gaffes, God Casper Van Dien, and the boy is one of them. It may be enough that this film contains the most lame movie monster of all time. This thing, which is supposed to be an Indian ghost, looks more like a plastic candy skeleton that you put under your porch at Halloween. He dons a cloak that is clearly a garbage bag, with what appears to be a bucket-shaped cap on his head. At times, it is a man in a suit, at other times it is clearly a plastic accessory placed on top of a horse. This monster has the amazing ability to see with a "predatory" vision, a real scam, and may appear miraculously after throwing his spear. Sometimes the spear cuts people, sometimes no. This thing also manages to get off a helicopter with a single arrow. Wow, that makes a lot of sense as when the kid explodes a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of "Critters". This creature is insensitive to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the film. At the end of his slaughter, where you never really discover why he is, he blew himself up. It's an incredible feat, because we've seen this thing explode three times in the movie. But, I guess this last time was the charm. <br /> <br /> And do not even get me started on the lameness of the other characters. First, which Delta Force unit employs women? The last time I checked, the army still refuses women to combat situations In addition, this unit is "under cover". Why? What possible reason should they be under cover? And they're not even good at it, I guess no one would realize they were military if they did not wear uniforms, BUT they were all carrying machine guns (which change any sound effects anyway) throughout the film as BB air guns and in others guns). There is a part when the skeleton man throws construction workers on a podium, and you can clearly see the slab on which they fall. At another point. Michael Rooker falls on a hill that is clearly a flat land. They tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of a tilt, but it is clearly heading into this looooooonnnngggggggg fall scene. Then, when he is helped back up the hill, the rope is flat and when he shows the woman at the "top" of the "hill", the rope rises from her grip, not as if she was pulling someone. at the top of a hill. Rooker actually has a line that says, "I'm not pursuing it, I'm pursuing it." What? It's perhaps the most stupid thing I've ever heard, and I watch these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest part of this quote is that you can say that everyone involved in writing / producing this movie thought it was so mean. Believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialogue, that's fine. <br /> <br /> The acting game, bad. Makeup, really bad. These characters had scars or wounds that liked to change sides of their faces. Maybe these are extraterrestrial scars that like running on your face. Yes, I think I'm going to make a movie about that, "The attack of the alien scars that move on your face." This villain would be more intimidating than the skeleton man, and the movie would probably be more scary.
