The Salena incident takes place in Arizona where six death row inmates are transferred from the state prison for reasons that have never been explained. The heavily armed bus traps an apartment and the driver is forced to leave the road. Then two fair-haired birds present themselves and after seducing the incompetent prison guards, manage to defeat them. The six prisoners are released but during a shootout, their car van is damaged, leaving them all stuck in the middle of the desert of Arizona. They decide to head to the nearest town, Salena, several miles away, and take the cops with them as hostages. Once in Salena, they find it odd that the city is completely deserted and no other person is in sight. They soon discover that the whole city was killed by flesh-eating extraterrestrials and they are firmly placed on the menu ... <br /> <br /> Also known as Alien Invasion Arizona in the United States on DVD and having apparently the working title Terror Town, this disordered, low-budget science-fiction horror movie has been co-written, co-produced and directed by Dustin Rikert and has no real redeeming features. To be honest, The Salena Incident is the kind of film that gives a bad reputation to movies. . The film could basically be divided into two parts, the first forty or fifty minutes of opening being centered on the prisoners in a thriller feeling open, the guards and the escape although it is poorly written and staged. The dialogue between the two blond birds and the prison guards is so bad that it's unintentionally funny, as the two fit birds argue with the two less-form prison guards. It's funny, in fact, unfortunately, the Salena incident is supposed to be a sci-fi horror movie, not a comedy. Then, once we get to Salena, the escaped hostages and the prison guards are horrified by science fiction as the aliens come forward and start killing our clich√©, which is good because they are annoying. . Look, the whole film is bad because it is poorly written, thought and manufactured. Believe me, the Salena incident is awful at all levels. <br /> <br /> In addition to being a bad film, boring and stupid, the Salena incident is also of poor quality. . The scenes of action scenes are awful, the extraterrestrials are awful and are never shown on the screen at the same time as those of the human character. It is therefore sometimes difficult to say what is happening. The special effects are mediocre too, the extraterrestrials look disgusting and the CGI computer effects are just as terrible. The editing is mediocre, the cinematography is mediocre, the sets are not expensive and the whole is only a real horror. There is a little gore, there are some gunshot wounds, someone is torn in half and a cut hand is seen. <br /> <br /> Visibly with a small budget. The Salena incident has low production value and seems cheap from start to finish. finish. Filmed in Superior Arizona. The acting is terrible, I have never heard of it, although the actress who plays the role of the female doctor is pretty pretty. <br /> <br /> The Salena Incident is a miserable sci-fi horror movie that horrifies anyone about any means, not worth 90 minutes of your time, mine or anyone 'other.
