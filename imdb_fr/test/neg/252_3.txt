The reputation of "RVAM" preceded it. I've heard about it for the first time in one of those Medved style books, "The 50 Worst Movies Ever" or "The Golden Turkey Awards", or something like that. All the critics of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed. So, when the company Exposed Film Society finally had the opportunity to show it, I was expecting a cathartic experience that only a true cinematic flair can offer. <br /> <br /> However, "Robot" was not so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's really a movie "Z" from side to side. Part of voice dubbing (as is generally the case for K. Gordon Murray imports) is terribly old-fashioned, and the film itself seems to be structurally a kind of Frankenstein, since much of this film seems to be a sequence from a previous "Aztec" Mummy "filmed, commented by a voiceover of the main man.A dead gift: at any time the question" So what happened? "When you ask more than twice in In the dialog box, you look at reassembled images assembled without much concern for the consistency of intrigue or momentum.In RVAM, "So what happened?" or "What happened next?" is pronounced at least four times in the first hour. <br /> <br /> Even without structural problems, intrigue and dialogue do not translate well for an older American audience, for example, as the hero explains. (and explain and explain) the story backwards, it includes a remark to About Dr. Krupp, "a doctor who has suddenly become a bad criminal criminal" and began his search for the treasure kept by the guards of the Aztec mother. No background, no explanation, he just "suddenly turned evil". Obviously, this was aimed at a fairly discreet audience. <br /> <br /> The decisive, however, is the "Robot", the supposed "showcase" of this film. This robot is the worst special robot effect since "Undersea Kingdom" or even "Santa Claus Vs. The Martians". Compared to this piece of junk, the Wizard Of Oz Tin Man resembled the Terminator chassis that had chased Linda Connor through the T2 foundry. The Aztec mummy itself is well designed and executed; He is recognizable as a living creature, familiar enough to look like a mummy, yet distinct from the bandage collection "Boris Karloff" well known to the American public. But whoever designed the robot in this suite had no idea of ​​the concept ... or budget. They could at least have given him knees, for heaven's sake. <br /> <br /> In addition, the incumbent battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I saw matchsticks jostled on junior-level playgrounds that were more convincing.) Then the movie simply stops. This seems a bit of a scam given the amount of time the film spends on the battle itself. <br /> <br /> Despite all these problems, the film is not horrible or incompetent as Coleman Film Francis or a film by Larry Buchanan was. Compared to "Monster A-Go-Go" or "The Attack of the Eye Creatures", "RVTAM" looks like a Coppola movie. It's just a little boring and silly. The actors are competent (in the manner of film B) and reasonably photogenic; Dr. Krupp, in particular, seems to have a wonderful life as he scans, plots and capers in his cloak and his "Phantom Of The Opera" combination. I often found myself rooted for him, despite being the bad guy. <br /> <br /> In any case, I saw a lot, much worse. File this with "Samson Vs The Vampire Women", under "Mexican juvenile curiosities".
