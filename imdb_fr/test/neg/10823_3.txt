I rented this movie from Blockbust because of the cover and the title! This intrigued !! This film suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense. The "monsters" needed more time. We needed them to have some kind of special power and certainly more "Oh Sh--" moments. The photography did not bother me except for the scene where a breath repeats itself. There were too many close-ups. But other than that, the movie seemed to be hanging out and the heroes were not really working for their freedom. Overall, I would say that everyone has put a lot of time, even writers. But this movie is really below average rent. <br /> <br /> There are certainly better choices. I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 to this choice.
