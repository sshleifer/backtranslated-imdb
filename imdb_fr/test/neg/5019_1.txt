This movie is totally incredible. The only way for a girl to perform this act on a dog is if she has serious mental health problems, a history of sexual abuse or if she is under duress. However, we are asked to believe that a healthy woman, otherwise "normal", just bored a little, make a small mistake and that oops had sex with a dog. Moreover, it never again caused her any detrimental effect, except when she told someone. <br /> <br /> She was not raped by a dog or the dog did something she could not resist - she actively initiated oral sex and completed this activity with a dog of her choice . She was not taking drugs or thinking about anything. "<br /> <br /> The rest of the film seeks to bring this action to light:" it can happen to anyone if it is honest ". <br /> <br /> But for this to be really credible, we must believe that this is a woman who can do absolutely anything if she wants to, think about it - could she have taken into account the pros and cons of this action before leading her to If she had had it, she would have stopped.Human beings have instinctive limits for reasons.If we now have to consider bestiality as a little "cute" aberration, what is the next step? Yet, "the heroine" is portrayed as a well-made, hard girl who had a moment of aberration - if she had been forced to commit this act by an abuser - the story might have been more logical and could have accepted the scenario, but there is no way anyone can do the activity prolonged required and mentioned even once - if there is not a deep disturbance that requires significant psychiatric help. It is absolutely not a unique event in an otherwise perfect life. <br /> <br /> I know it's just a movie, but it's by normalizing behavior like this via the media that society desensitizes and more and more terrible realities become possible . <br /> <br /> I could imagine an abuser showing this to a child to convince him that it's not so bad, then move on to the agenda. An abuser could also use it to emphasize to a child that he should not talk about violence because you will know how people will react if you do. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with the truth. The director WANTS that people think it's the truth. This is the degradation and ease with which people (viewers) can be manipulated to accept the most appalling concepts if presented in the right way. Spectators are manipulated, degraded and ridiculed. <br /> <br /> It's a film in which actors and spectators are humiliated and ridiculed in a very sophisticated way by an intelligent film but extremely disturbed screenwriter. <br /> <br /> This film seems to me as a way for the creator of the film to excite himself to the idea of ​​playing in an abusive way with the spirit. I do not know if it's conscious of them - but it's the most classic example of Mind F *** k I've ever met. <br /> <br /> I hope this does not offend anyone. too much. But if you watched this movie - I do not think there is any room left to be offended by anything.
