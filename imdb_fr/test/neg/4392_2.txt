I have no interest in seeing another horrible movie, which is totally missing from any new creator or funny, abusing the National Lampoon tag. How something caught my attention in the distribution of this film. I see the name of Danielle Fishel, I am a big fan of boy meets world! But the movies are terrible. Even more as a fan, I'm not rewarded for seeing his awful movies with the treasure of the bare chest. This is where my question comes in. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen this movie? And if so, is Danielle Fishel naked? Would save me the 2 hours of my life that I would never come back to watch this awful movie. thank you so much
