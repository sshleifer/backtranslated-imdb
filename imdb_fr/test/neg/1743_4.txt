Some modern horror movies of Janapese are very good. Intrigue strong, scary moments, good acting, while others are only .... unfortunately, Uzumaki belongs to this last camp. <br /> <br /> I will evaluate the film according to 3 elements: Terrain, Scary Factor and Act. <br /> <br /> 1) Intrigue - True to the name of the film, the plot moves in a circle and never really explains itself. OK, the city is captivated by the spiral curse, but why? And why do people act so stupidly? There is an ephemeral attempt to explain what happens to the journalist .. unexpectedly ... <br /> <br /> 2) Scary factor - if it was a horror movie, it failed miserably. I do not really remember a good scary scene with a lot of preparation. <br /> <br /> 3) Acting - very monotonous. People walk around, saying meaningless phases. I can not really feel a lot of empathy for our tragic heroes. <br /> <br /> In total, there are much better modern Japanese horror movies with a consistent plot and strong characterization. Do not bother to waste time with this aspirant.
