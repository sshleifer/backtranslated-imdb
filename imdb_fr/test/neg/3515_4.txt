I recently watched this film on Sundance and that has always interested me. However, it seems like it takes forever to go wherever he wants and in the end, I felt a little cheated. In summary, Noble Willingham (Walker, famous in the Texas Ranger) plays the role of a boat salesman who begins to be harassed by phone by a man who claims to be his son. According to the mysterious interlocutor, Willingham has a dark little secret that affects the son and he (the son) takes pleasure in reminding him. I will not spoil anything for anyone but for me three things prevented me from loving this movie a lot. First, the movie has more foul language than Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino and Glengarry Glen Ross put together. 99% of this is vomited by Willingham himself. It did not take me long to tire myself with constant words of four letters. Secondly, I simply could not believe that someone answered the phone so often, especially when you know that a crank caller is at the other end of the line. No matter where Willingham is in the movie, be it at work, at home, in a restaurant, etc., the phone rings and he always responds by spitting venom at the "son" and then hanging up ONLY BY RESPONDING CALL BACK IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS! How many of us would do that? Now, I realize we probably do not have a movie if it does not respond, but I just could not suspend disbelief about it. Third, and this is the smallest criticism, why is the director so opposed to showing us the "Corndog Man" (as appellant / son)? Most of the time, it boils down to a voice that rings on the other end of the line. I would have been able to live with that one if other things had fallen into place, but since they were not, it's just something to focus on. I consider the film to be a bit of an original idea and have caught my attention from the suspense from the start, but that's about it. Do not see it, only once. However, if you are like me, you will say "Triple K Marine!" in your sleep for a night or two after you finish watching it.
