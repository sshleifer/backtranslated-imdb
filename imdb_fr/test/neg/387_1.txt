It may be the worst movie of all time, done and taken seriously. And not as a result of the act, since being an actor, I must say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best, just to escape the need for electro-convulsive therapy after the main photograph was packed. As one of the 57 people who saw this film in theatrical version, I must say that I have never experienced a film where the film ended, the credits have run out, the lighting of the house turned on and nobody left his seat. About five minutes after lighting up the house, people started coming out of a coma to look around me, and I think most of us thought, okay, that's a joke, no is not it ?, They will now show the real movie. Finally, after the bailiffs handed over the disguises and swore the secret of never admitting we were there, we felt it was safe to leave, praying that we would not leave the auditorium. I've seen some very bad movies during my day (I have Cinemax for God's sake), but I'm always bitter of never being able to, forever, recover those two hours of my life that I've lost looking at Closet Land.
