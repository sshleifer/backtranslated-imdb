Eugene O'Neill's 4Â½-room play of 1927 is on screen in less than two hours. The combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama of the piece has not aged well and the casting has some difficulties, especially Nina de Norma Shearer and Marsden Ralph Morgan. Clark Gable in the role of Ned Darrell emerges better, but mainly because his character is gruff and he is not given to the philosophical thoughts of others who is better suited to the range of Gable. Once the plot is set in the quadrilateral of love and the audience adapts to the voiceover, the movie becomes more enjoyable. The technique used here for asides is another problem. On stage, the action froze while the actors shared their thoughts with the audience. Here they are done in voiceover. One might think that it would work better, but since the action does not freeze, the actors are forced to pause and wince at the camera to match the emotions of their thoughts. Moreover, it is difficult for any moviegoer to watch this film and not to think of the hilarious parody version of Groucho Marx in "Animal Crackers". To these drawbacks are added cuts made for reasons of censorship (the promiscuity of Nina is sweet and nothing indicates that she suffered the abortion that is more central in the room) and a miserable score (uncredited) which looks like weepie background music from the beginning of the century. O'Neill described the film as "a terrible attempt at condensation and silly censorship", and even though "Strange Interlude" is not nearly as good as his movie "The Iceman Cometh" and "Long Day Journey Ino Night", he certainly deserved better than that.
