I do not think it can legally be called a film. The plot was so fragile, the dialogue so superficial and the lines so terrible that I could not believe someone was actually writing the lines, said, "Good God, it's a masterpiece" producer. For my part, I am always stunned and I will always remember this film as the mark of the degeneration of intelligence in America - that, and "Carrefour", of course.
