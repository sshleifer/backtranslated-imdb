This film is a hodgepodge of various idiotic clich√©s. For example, a boy who meets a spoiled rich girl and makes her fall in love with him by harassing her at university (a context that has been overused in recent Indian commercial films). A male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (having been used ad nauseum in several other films). Like many other recent commercial films in Hindi, the film abounds with incongruous insertion of songs, which have probably contributed to the success of the film more than anything else.
