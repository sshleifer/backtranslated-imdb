A movie "Wacky Chick". A beauty competitor eventually dies and the usual suspects are gathered. Another entry into the vein of the Texas Cheerleader is an average example of this type. <br /> <br /> Yasmine Bleeth turns in her usual healthy girl performance, and Jill Clayburgh does a good job as she is slightly stressed obsessed mom. <br /> <br /> Some slightly fun moments to listen to the tasteless and selfish public relations that come out of the mouth of the candidates. ("I'd like to own a restaurant so I can give food leftovers to the homeless.") <br /> <br /> You have to wonder what people are using as brain when they think of a great place for cheerleaders or crown of beauty is worth being killed for! <br /> <br />
