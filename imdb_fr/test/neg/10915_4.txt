Do not get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And it's a very good movie above all else. Enraged Cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful. But after the first few minutes of the captivating St. Bernard, poor Donna and her grandson Tad were held captive in their Pinto. I began to wonder why she was doing nothing to help herself. She could have stepped out the door and pushed the car back (I mean, it was a Pinto for Pete's sake and they were on a downhill slope) and roll towards safety, but that would be a movie very short. When she started the car, did she turn it around and hope she could at least partly be in the driveway? No, she's trying to do a three-point bend in a car with a bad alternator. She managed to get out of the car and look around for about 45 seconds at one point trying to get to a baseball bat that lay on the ground nearby - what a waste of time! I mean, if you want to run for the baton, do it and at least you will have something to hit the dog. But forget the bat. Was there no tool in the car, like a tire iron or something else? I did not see her looking into the spare wheel well of the car. Really, why wait until you get stung and weakened by dehydration and your son has fits before taking a stand against the animal? At the end of the movie, she was beaten and torn, God still wearing high heels!
