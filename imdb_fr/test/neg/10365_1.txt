This film is a cheap movie that tries to be a stoner movie because the characters are looking for pot but none of them is a smoker, it's a pile of trash that Thomas's church Hayden should not realize, especially this film which is a loss of film. People who liked this film gave good comments, but among all those who are here, some are simply behind the scenes and do not watch the movies, so they think that any bad movie is good, the actors suck and the movie sucks balls. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people are going to be upset because this movie is trying to pretend to be the ultimate weed movie when it's the worst weed movie I've ever had never seen. I hope people will prevent the director from directing shit like this weed can not make this movie funny or entertaining.
