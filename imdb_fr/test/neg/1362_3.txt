This film is full of pseudo deep reflections and it is disgusting, it includes a canned voiceover and an incredible dialogue. A tight and deaf dialogue like Spike is sometimes (not always) when he writes "some" characters. For those who like crazy movies like Pieces of April and One Hour Photo, here is another example. <br /> <br /> That said, this comment has nothing to envy to Ryan Gosling who showed his remarkable qualities in The Believer. A film that proves that the film is a support for the director, and when a film is rotten, it is fair to say that the fault lies with him and not the actors.
