OK, this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by previous comments, but I would like to add a few things. The mad scientist produces a serum from the blood of a caged animal to turn a man into a werewolf. If we suspend enough disbelief to accept that, that's fine. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werecoyote. In 1942, did the public not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They are easy to distinguish. It's weak. <br /> <br /> Second, this film was covered in the third episode of MST3k (on the comedy channel). It took Joel and the bots a number of episodes to emancipate thoroughly, and they were not yet at the height of it. They added enough to keep you awake until the end, but it was not one of their best episodes. They never even mentioned the blatant omission of a real wolf, and THIS joke was suspended in the air waiting to be slapped.
