I would give them a zero if they had that rating. Having fun was not fun at all. I got tired of the movie about ten minutes later, but I persevered until the end thinking that he had to get better - that was not the case. Others with whom I watched this film also accepted. The game was annoying. I'm fed up with Jim Carey playing hard. The support cast was not better. While this film was a declaration of greed on the part of businesses and the plight of the worker being trampled on when a big company goes bankrupt, the way to do it would have been better served otherwise. In fact, I hated the main characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic. I try to remember a scene where myself or someone I was with was laughing and can not. A worthless movie and a total waste of time.
