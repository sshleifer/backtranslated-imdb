The worst movie I have ever seen. Like other honest critics, it's just an excuse to bring out naked birds with their bottles. Do not get me wrong, nude women are not a bad thing, but there is another kind of movie for that. <br /> <br /> Little friends, beware. I sold it to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang festival (because of the critics) so that it would be welcomed with all the other scenes full of naked women girting around the place. Blows in the hands for me. <br /> <br /> What makes me laugh the most is that all the bike dives they saw in the movie were full of models whose works were aesthetic - what are the biker bars? They are usually slightly haggard with tattoos and much more saggier juggs! Completely unrealistic. The acting is terrible, a profusion of useless curses and a story in lost time. <br /> <br /> Has anyone brought to light Vinnie Jones's attempt at an American accent? It's as embarrassing as his soccer skills. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. The only reason you would like to watch this movie is if you are a young boy who can not access p @ rn and stole it from his parents' movie collection for some perverts!
