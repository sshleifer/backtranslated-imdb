It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> I can usually watch a Van Damme movie if I have to, because they are usually a little fun and do not need much thought. This one does not have redemption features. <br /> <br /> There is a clear lack of intrigue, humor, acting, role playing, direction, etc. A real problem at all levels. <br /> <br /> I never came out of a movie theater, although I came near here. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
