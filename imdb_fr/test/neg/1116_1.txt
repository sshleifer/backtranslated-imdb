Even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan, I found this movie beyond terrible. It was a huge disappointment as it was featured as one of eight Horrorfest movies. I can only hope that the other seven were better. I was really embarrassed for the friends that I managed to convince to see this, and it was the same friends I met who watched the remake of The Wicker Man. He has all the clichés in the book. In fact, he did everything to include them. Let's start with the characters. Instead of a young lady in distress, we have three: the single, hot mom with two girls ?? a thriving but brainless teenager and a cute but scary girl at a time that you know you are going to have "special" skills, including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. The little girl is the same as the one in the remake of The Amityville Horror. She was a little annoying but not as irritating to Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> All in all, these characters looked like escapees from a LifeTime movie. I thought that horror movies might have gone from scenes where female characters go to bed with makeup and run in the dark, announcing their presence to anyone with ears, but not this one. I also find it inconceivable that none of them can bother to make sure that the front door does not open arbitrarily day or night. To give you an idea of ​​my lack of involvement in these characters, I spent most of my time thinking about the coldness of the set because everyone was well dressed, even at home, and the whiteness of their teeth . /> <br /> Despite all the machinations of the plot according to a formula, the film does not create suspense, except to ask when it will be finished. There is more atmosphere at the local giant in the middle of the most ordinary afternoon. As for the dialogue, I could have tasted quotes from ten other films and concocted together a better and more credible speech. The gore level, the candy in the eyes for a horror fan, was at best minimal. Without their tiny weapons, the "zombies" were not at all threatening. You could probably drop a few of them in the room. <br /> <br /> What really kills him is his banality. Horror movies, more than any other genre, can not survive mediocrity without inspiration. Give me a comic or outrageously disproportionate horror movie. I can even take the new ones with their grinding inducing torture. From time to time, I would appreciate a really scary event, other than that.
