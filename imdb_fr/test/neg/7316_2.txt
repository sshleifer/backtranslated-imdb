A tedious mixture of puerile efforts of humor and melodrama of romantic relationships gives no flavor to this faintly realized film. As the action begins, Reno (AJ Buckley) walks into her apartment and discovers her girlfriend in flagrante delicto with her roommate who gleefully tells her "Well, at least it's with someone you know ", which led Reno to never have a roommate again. this decision was announced to viewers by means of a soon-abandoned voice-over. The scenario then unfolds for ten months and we discover that Reno is really true to his word about roommate avoidance, although that seems to be the question because of his attachment to a living lover, Holly (Holly Fields), with who he has conjugal plans generated. The plot briefly passes to a Hollywood striptease club, in which Reno's uncle Charley, in love with a "dancer" whom he finds eminently desirable, falls over the bar of the club after seeing the unadorned charms displayed by the object of his affections. It is obvious that Charley was aware of the evil state of his heart, because he had created a videotape in which his commentary left Reno his big (and mortgaged) residence in Hollywood, and we see him decide, unlike interviewing two roommates as tenants, while Holly and he share the selection process in an organized manner. Following a senseless sequence involving queer tenants, whom Reno and Holly unsurprisingly find unfit to live by their side in their home, each one, without their knowledge, selects a tenant of the opposite sex, with lovers obviously cold for the choice. of their partner. The newcomers (Chad and Nicole) would seem to have only perceptible arguments about their existence, if not a very auditive fornication with a wide range of partners and the jealousy is not long in damaging the harmonic relationship of Reno and Holly. Reno is committed to patenting and marketing a type of sports travel bag and, as he has offered Holly an engagement ring, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial importance if he is to advance his matrimonial project. Unfortunately, the rapacious team of Chad and Nicole, whose every action is ostensibly lustful, is likely to disrupt Reno's wedding intentions. Management is flexible, far from meeting the basic needs of players, although an irregularly composed script provides little material with which actors can work, and a free and embarrassing fall. As a result, the performances are not distinguished, not helped by irregular fixtures, while the way of working with the camera changes as abruptly and often as the taillight of a firefly. Filmed with a small budget and on-site, only a minimum of skill is required for the design processes, but a larger measure of value could have been placed on the inadequate D. background soundtrack, usually deafening and almost invasive. Many discussions were stimulated by the final sequences of the film that the viewer apparently does not expect based on what happened, but which, in reality, are probably the only thoughtful parts of a badly paved scenario. work almost visible, despite the poor quality of production as a whole.
