I'm willing to tolerate almost anything in a sci-fi movie, but it was almost intolerable. Although some special effects are very cool (landscapes), it is not a "fighting space", but rather a strange mother / daughter relationship disjointed with science fiction concepts. with more funny body-to-body combat scenes than any Hong Kong chopsocky movie, this movie is boring. The plot is complicated and the devices used to advance it (narrator), jumps of unexplained scenes and many deus ex machina reinforce the idea that screenwriter and director is not a good idea. Save your love of science fiction for something else instead of losing a bit of it here.
