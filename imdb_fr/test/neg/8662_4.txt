I started to take a critical view on this adaptation in the first minutes, but as a fan of Jane Austen, I persevered to the end ... However, it is not a program that I I would not recommend that this makes the book justice, nor makes the television particularly entertaining in itself. There was something about this adaptation that lacked credibility - a lot of costumes and even actors did not have an authentic look and I found acting sometimes mediocre. There is no doubt that the actors were all very beautiful, but it did not give enough variety to create memorable characters and very diverse. It was far too static to be in exactly the same place and to miss Fanny's return home, one of the most interesting parts of the story. The best actor was Blake Ritson, who captured Edmund very well. The Crawfords were also chosen. I like Billie Piper as an actress, but this role did not suit her and was much better interpreted by Frances O'Connor in the 1999 version which overall gave a much more subtle and convincing performance. Jane Austen's adaptations will always provide a love story to make you feel good, but unfortunately, it's one of the worst I've ever seen.
