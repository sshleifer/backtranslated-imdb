This thing. oh my god this thing. I can not even call it a movie. a movie is something that does something. go somewhere. has a semblance of conspiracy or something. I do not know how I do it. truly not. I say first that Dark Field is the worst movie of all time. and I thought it was. so the pirates of the ghost island proved me the opposite. and now, for the third time in a row, another film goes beyond the call of duty to prove me wrong. <br /> <br /> (sighs) OK. Dark Harvest II: Corn. Lord, it's awful. Let me explain to you. The man feels that the girls are in danger thanks to certain magic psychic powers that his popcorn of act II conferred on him and that he tries to find to find them in a field of corn. Of course, it's the biggest cornfield of all time, the size of the cornfields of Jeepers Creepers, Children of the Corn and Signs together. the main character, named Shy (awesome name btw) then crosses a cornfield .... finds ghost girls, talks to them and ... crosses a cornfield. dig a little ... and cross a field of corn. and the incredibly sad thing? I really do not leave anything. That's about all the movie. The only thing I can leave out is the way he is being chased by two police officers who want to arrest him for ... I do not know. pretend to be an actor. I did not care at this point. He walks away and the police are - something drowned - by the off-screen killer. holy shit, is there a killer? apparently yes, he introduced almost 4/5 in the film. but wait! he then fled for a while and, you guessed it, there is more running in the cornfield to dig. Then there is the end where he saves his daughters. huzzah. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is that it's boring. it's incredibly, inhumanly, boringly boring. I can not explain how horribly dull this thing is. nothing happens, the characters are as attractive as a root canal, and it's just an hour and a half of NOTHING. The ONLY good thing that came out of this movie is that my friend and I may have found enlightenment because of the state of nirvana in which this film put us after the effects of the drugs in our brain had to rock to keep us alive. During the madness that followed, I found it much more pleasant to press a wall against me and my friend discovered a new passion for laughing hysterically while collapsing on the floor, as if he had had a crisis. This is the kind of crazy that this film brings. it's not just bad. it's bad for your health. The cover is superb with a picture of an awesome scarecrow killer that I would consider quite dressy as a scam, but it was THE most misleading box of all time. DO NOT ALLOW YOU TO DAMAGE! do NOT watch this movie. watch a better movie about corn. ANY film on corn is better. just do not let him get you! do not! a 0 out of 10
