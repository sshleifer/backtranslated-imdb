This film begins with an interesting scenography and a promising premise, but fails to provide the products of the cult film. Located in a grainy parallel universe where everything is owned by "Blump" Corporation, it's a horrible comedic who succeeds when he finds a third arm behind him. <br /> <br /> All the potential Because a good cheese has arrived - Judd Nelson, washed 1980s star, Wayne Newton, quirky images and strange digressions, obese women in thin lingerie, necrophilia - but that does not matter never reports. <br /> <br /> Stimulation is the main problem. Every scene is incredibly slow. Nelson's stand-up routines are supposed to be funny because they are not pathetically funny. But each performance goes on, until it's not even funny, but boring. <br /> <br /> Imagine someone telling you the longest and strangest joke imaginable, full of self-congratulation for the degree of funny and strange he finds. Imagine that after two insulting hours, you never had a typing line. You have just spared yourself the trouble of watching The Dark Backward.
