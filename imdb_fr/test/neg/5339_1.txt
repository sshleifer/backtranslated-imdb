I've watched a lot of Asian horror movies lately, but this one must be the worst so far. It started interestingly, but lost momentum after the first 15 minutes of the film. The added dramatic scenes, the flashback sequences and the holes in the serious plot have left me suspended. What really happened in the tunnel? Just "something terrible" ??? Who started all the massacres if it was not the ghost? What did she want to make him ????? No answer whatsoever! Overall, it's not very scary and filmmakers have to come up with better ideas than this one ... <br /> <br /> One of the positives is the pretty actress, but that's about it . <br /> <Not recommended.
