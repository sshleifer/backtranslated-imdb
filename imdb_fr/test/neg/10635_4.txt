How can a film dealing with illegal immigrants stolen and beaten at the border be boring? "Border Incident" is not surprising. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that George Murphy's career in song and dance ended shortly after the release of this terrible film. Politics was certainly an issue for this future senator who dies of a horrific death in this slow-moving film. The movie stereotypes the typical Mexican migrant worker as a terrified and dull character. <br /> <br /> The film only intensifies when the identity of Murphy and Ricardo Montalban were discovered as federal agents of the United States and Mexico. . <br /> <br /> Disappointing at best, we are seeing similar problems in our own society today.
