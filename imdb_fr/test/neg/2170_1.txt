By voting, I was going to give a 2, but seeing that 1 meant horrible, it struck perfectly. The portrait of Native Americans as bloodthirsty savages deeply disturbs me. This is the third film of D.w. griffiths where the races of men are stereotyped in ugly ways. The man is not able to tell his story, so I will try not to attack Mr. Griffith personally. In my opinion, the three films have probably influenced the thinking of millions of people and the children of their children. Films like this one have probably contributed to most of the resentments that still pass through us ... Some may say that the Camera work was great, as the action is a first for its time. the negatives, it's like someone taking you $ 10 and giving you a dime to make up for it.
