Digital effects have been made cheaply and action sequences lack suspense. It was basically made for television and it shows. David Suchet looks bored and Nigel Planer looks down embarrassed! and as for Robert Carlyle's Dick Van Dyke accent in London, no comment! If you want to spend an hour or two when you have not lit anything, it'll be fine. If you are going to buy the DVD, wait a few weeks and get it to the basket of good deals of Asda, because that's where you go! If the budget was larger and Richard Doyle's book followed more closely, it might have been something special, but in its current form it is a little poor. Watch the trailer instead! Or read the book and see what could have been.
