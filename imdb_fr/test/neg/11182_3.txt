Last Stand has been great on the purely theatrical level, as the re-enactments and the soundtrack are very entertaining, but there are better reports of this battle found elsewhere which, although less long and as vivid, are much more complete historically. . <br /> <br /> Some small details, such as the misuse of the word "hoplon" for the Greek hoplite shield and the mis-pronunciation of names and words, really gnawed at me. <br /> <br /> I guess it would be, because "Last Stand of the 300" was aired on the eve of the theatrical release of the movie "300", History Channel was just trying to echo the hype of the film. <br /> <br /> If you look for a historically accurate representation in all respects, you would have more luck elsewhere.
