The idea that nine stupid prisoners escape and go on a road trip seems pretty good for a movie. Especially because it's supposed to be funny and I guess it's hot to the heart in a strange way. The problem is that the movie was very rarely funny and often seemed simply useless and rudely useless. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being prepared again and again, but nobody was bothering to finish, there was simply no profit. In addition, the film was just brainless and the scammers roamed Japan, even though they left so many victims of crime alive that it's impossible to believe they would not have been arrested immediately - all the more so. that they continued to use the same stolen camper. For days. And as for the rudeness, I just did not need to see scene after scene of guys pissing along the edge of the road. Plus, believe it or not, there's a scene where four guys are raping sheep! <br /> <br /> In total, I really hated this movie. And that's a shame, because I almost always like Japanese movies - but not those that are poorly made and uninteresting like this one.
