Snakes on a Train begins when the Mexican couple Brujo (A.J. Castro) and Alma (Julia Ruiz) cross the border into the United States, and then board a 17-hour train to Los Angeles illegally. However, Alma's family did not approve of the relationship between her and Brujo and placed on her an old black magic spell that turns all her interiors into snakes, is not that a crazy life? As the snakes emerge from Alma's mouth and move to other parts of the train, they begin to infect other passengers with the same unusual discomfort ... <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by the Mallachi brothers (although the IMDb says it's just a guy who uses a pseudonym, Peter Mervis) I must say that I thought Snakes on Train was shit, it's as simple as that. It seems that the entire film was designed to take advantage of Samuel L. Jackson's cult film Snakes on a Plane (2006), by all the fans of the most beloved horror films like the favorite production company Asylum, specialized in the big budget scam of Hollywood movies. This style of money and movie making is no more obvious than here with Snakes on a Train, making a movie simply because the title rhymes with a more successful movie is not a good starting point. Eric Forsberg's scenario is nil. At first, snakes on a plane was a lot of fun, while Snakes on a train was a lot more serious. When you break it down, you should have been a lot lighter. In fact, it probably would have worked better as a parody like Scary Movie (2000). You know something, I have a hard time finding a positive thing to say about Snakes on Train, it's so bad. For starters, the characters are garbage and it is impossible to move with anyone, the story is downright horrible and makes no sense (if people spit all these little snakes where do the huge ones come from? Did Alma turn into a giant snake, why did Bujo kill the train driver, how was he going to stop the train once he arrived in Los Angeles, where did the typhoon come from at the end? he takes himself far too seriously, the first seventy minutes are so boring and uneventful that I am surprised that I have been awake and that it is a very, very poor film at almost every level. <br /> <br /> The director Mervis only has a few sets of train cars that are very similar, so the film becomes very repetitive and boring to watch. There is almost no blood or blood, there are snakes borrowing under the skin of some people, someone is shot and that's about it. The special effects are zero too, the giant snake in the end is really horrible and the better we talk about it. It's not scary, there's no atmosphere and it's a little boring from start to finish. Real live snakes also pose a problem, they are so docile and non-threatening. If you look at a scene with a real snake and an actor, the snakes never go to them or do not show aggression and seem to always want to sneak in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> Shot in California technically, the film is obviously small budget and it shows, basically, it seems cheap because it is. The acting is not great, not that actors have all kinds of documents to work with. <br /> <br /> Snakes on a Train, it's hogwash, I'm sorry but that's how I feel and I do not know how else to describe it. I really do not see what anyone could get out of watching Snakes on a Train, it's just as serious.
