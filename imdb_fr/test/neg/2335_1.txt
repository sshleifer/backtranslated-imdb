seriously, if I wanted to make a meaningless movie, which would never do, and whose lesbian scenes are the only strong point I could have had. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is the worst, like this movie. anyone could have made a better movie in which at least some answers were given and the story was not so slow and long. history means nothing without something in the end besides the credits. what a waste of time. I will never find those 147 minutes of my life and I hope others can learn from my mistake.
