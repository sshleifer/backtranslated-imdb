I like to play, write and direct, but I'm not famous yet. My friends and I often rent bad movies, just for fun and laughter, but when we went to Family Video, we found a movie called Biker Zombies From Detroit, we knew it would be the worst movie of all time and this movie was! Biker Zombies From Detroit does not have a script! They can say they have one, but they are liars! There was a 4-minute scene with only two guys discussing women and sexuality, and you can say that it was improvised. And if they improvise, it should at least be decent, but it is not, and both actors could say that they are actors who have screwed up everything to say things that do not even make sense. <br /> <br /> To give you an idea of ​​the gravity and the delay of this film, here is the beginning: a girl chases a guy, he hits her face and hits her, then rapes her. Then we see zombies attacking and they both turn into zombies. <br /> <br /> It's the beginning of the movie! Not to mention the main zombie voice that runs through the movie, trying to be sinister and provoking thought, but that resembles that of Marylin Manson. His worst fit. <br /> <br /> The worst movie of all time. In the end, people. But look at it if you like movies without script, without plot, bad game, bad editing, bad music and more than 100 words used in the movie. <br /> <br /> If this can hit the video libraries, my future movies will win Oscars.
