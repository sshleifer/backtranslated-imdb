Ridiculously horrible. One would think that all the major actors involved in this film would make it at least believable, but this is not the case - this one is a sniffer. <br /> <br /> The characters execute without reason. to know where they are going, or they are standing up to make constipated grimaces when they should save their lives. <br /> <br /> Check your brain functions above the door if you intend to try watching this movie. You can also gather your most intelligent friends and offer them the treatment "Mystery Science Theater 3000". That's what I did during the second half of this turkey. <br /> <br /> And PLEASE, do not confuse this with the excellent movie "The Jackal's Day", a much higher thriller 30 years ago.
