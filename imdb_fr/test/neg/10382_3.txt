This film seemed to lack direction. The plot developed so many twists and turns in such a short time that it seemed to lose all appearance of what the real story was. There were a lot of lost dialogues and it seemed to me that the writing was hasty and a little too wandering. The scenes of exorcism and possession began to take precedence over the character's stories (which were a little weak at first). <br /> <br /> In the end, I would say you have to dismiss it if you have not rented the rest of the horror section of your local video store and you have a Jones for a movie you do not have. have never seen before. You'd better watch The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose.
