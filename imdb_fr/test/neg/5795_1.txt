In the last years of the reign of Ron Miller (son-in-law of Walt Disney cum Producer), he shot bullshit live-action on a stick often featuring the boring Dean Jones, whose career was entirely based on that genre. of light, empty head fare. Other horrendous films from this period include Dragon of Pete, The Last Flight of Noah's Ark, Oddball Flying Unidentified and the dreaded Condorman. I will not talk about Tron because I thought it was ambitious and Miller was just the executive producer, so he did not have much to do with production. However, he was in full force when this horrible piece of human scrap was thrown out of the bowels of creativity. Herbie goes to Monte Carlo. The second sequel to Love Bug's beloved narrative finds Herbie in love with another car that also has a brain and a heart. There is a race, lame villains, a diamond and Barney Fife. Shot in France, the film is well photographed and the campaign is beautiful. But we have the idea that the film was shot so that everyone involved can spend three months of vacation in France. The rest of the movie is a wreck. Prat falls, rowdy thieves, fierce German competitors and a pretty bouncy feminist are all in the inventory category. The biggest insult of the film: trying to further develop Herbie's love personality with the help of tremors, beeps, flashing lights and indicative movements of an excited seventeen-year-old girl, Disney writers make an injustice to our pretty little VW. Again, I would think it would be difficult for anyone to get past Helen Hayes by guiding Herbie on a skyscraper ledge on the second outing.
