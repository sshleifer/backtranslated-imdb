I guess there are two ways to make a movie with kids as a target audience. You can either say a) "Let's make a movie that today's kids will love!" or b) "Let's make a movie I would have liked when I was a kid!" The second approach explains why Steven Spielberg often makes movies that appeal to a younger audience. E.T., The Goonies or Indiana Jones are excellent examples. This Darn Cat is an example of the first approach. You see these flat and unbelievable characters say things that are supposed to be funny but are not. The plot itself is enough for a ten-minute short film, but it goes on and on. And although I'm not a kid, I do not quite understand what in this movie is supposed to be fun for kids? The clumsy cops pursued by a dog, the old lady with the tweety bird or the sarcastic insinuates of Christina Ricci? An actor showed a spark of talent with his very acrobatic humor: Doug E. Doug playing the FBI agent.
