I am very surprised to see the good results for this film. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie 9 years ago and I still remember my anger at sitting at the movies and watching this mess. I am a big fan of John Boorman's work. I really like his films. So I went to "Beyond Rangoon" with great expectations. But I felt like watching a jungle movie Chuck Norris cheap, with all the action scenes cut off. Even the soundtrack was very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that John Boorman was the director, because this movie was so badly done. I think the Burmese people deserve better films to illustrate their fight.
