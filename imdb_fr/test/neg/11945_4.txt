I'm a long-time fan of the original of this film (Bella Martha / Mostly Martha), and it misses everything that makes this movie awesome and enjoyable to watch. I miss the slow pace, the constitution of characters and their style in small gestures, the domination of lights and moods and dialogue. I do not think the story itself is enough. Martha / Kate is more isolated and Mario / Nick is not a clown. In most cases, things that make a great scene in the original do not work in its copy here. Small modifications remove the tension. My opinion is that you should go see the original. It will be worth the inconvenience of the subtitles.
