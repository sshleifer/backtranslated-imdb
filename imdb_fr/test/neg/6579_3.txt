I do not see the purpose. It's heavy. Animated people are scary (look at the mysterious valley). The scenes continue again and again without much interest. The plot is skeletal and must be complemented by many senseless dramatic rides, as if Disney or Spielberg were planning an amusement park based on the film. Most characters are boring and inconceivable. Some of them continue to present themselves as if they have something important to add to a climate scene. They do not do it. They simply disappear without lasting impact. Someone summed up the situation in these terms: "If you do not believe in Santa Claus, you will be kidnapped on a train on Christmas Eve". That sums up just about everything.
