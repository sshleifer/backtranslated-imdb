Especially if you like horrible movies. When I started to watch him, all I could say was, "I hope there is a dance sequence." Imagine my pleasure when the two main characters did not ONLY dance, but the main ghost also started to break dance. AND on top of that, Sherman Hemsley sings the break dance song (not to mention the theme song). It makes me a little sad that he went bankrupt because of this film, but I never liked him as an actor and he really should have known better. Even the director would not accept this film (and you should take a look at the other films he has made!). <br /> <br /> A word of warning, though, the author seemed to really like the jokes about the, um, the lower regions of men. For example, one of the characters discovers a book called "Groins of the Darker Species". I am not joking. And for me, it's the most disturbing part of the movie. Apart from that, find the darkest video rental store in your city, get the movie, invite all your friends and laugh until you cry with Ghost Fever.
