The creative ideas in these movies do not really bother me, but seriously. There is not a consistent part of the game in this movie. That seems to be the trend, buy the rights and then make a movie that has nothing to do with what fans want. This butchery is almost fun because you know you will escape by hiding behind a lack of skill and a control of money (not yours) that allows you to do it. Play a game, or hire someone, and please make a real movie, or stay in the ring and have your butt, because you pretend it will not happen. <br /> <br /> wow, 9 lines of text and I was done. had to add blah to bother you, sorry
