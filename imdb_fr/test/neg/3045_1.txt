What should have been an evening of routine babysitting in an isolated lakeside home turns into a night of terror, while high school student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) receives threatening calls from a stalker sadistic while trying to stay one step ahead of him. fr /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the original movie were pretty good, but everything was downhill. The remake takes these first 20 minutes and extends them in a feature film of 80 minutes. It's a good idea because it eliminates everything that made the original bad. However, if they wanted this film to work more effectively, they would have had to hire a better lead actress, a better director, a writer, and so on. There is no suspense, everything can be understood long before it happens and it's a very boring film because there is not much going on. At least there is not much to wait for less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If this premise was to work, the lead actress had to give a realistic performance. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen and, throughout the movie, she seemed to read her lines. You get a lead role in a Hollywood movie that will be seen by millions of people and you make no effort! Why did they hire this girl? Of course, she is pretty but she can not act at all, but I guess it will not affect the target audience who will probably eat this movie. The rest of the cast is bland and forgettable, especially the woman who plays the maid, Rosa. Even the stranger was nil and his lines on the phone were not at all effective. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of the disappointing horror film of last year, Boogeyman. This film was a group of cheap scaring and false alarms and When a Stranger Calls is pretty much the same. Jill enters a room because she hears a noise but it's just a false alarm like a cat or a maid. This type of scene repeats itself again and again until after about 50 minutes the stranger appears. He must be one of the deadliest. He carried no weapon and did not seem to pose a real threat. The end is bad but it fits the rest of the movie, so it does not really matter. The film is directed by Simon West and it's really bad to create suspense. He used all the clich√©s he could think of and the results were not very good. The house was fantastic and I will thank the movie. It was a secluded house, so it was pretty scary, but that's about the only good thing this film can offer. In the end, if you are not a teenager, you should skip the movie. Note 2/10
