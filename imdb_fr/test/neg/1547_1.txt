I bought this movie in a garage sale when I was about 15 years old. I hated it at the time and watching it again, just for fun, it's even worse now. You can hear the director and the cameraman in the background shouting commands such as "Zoom, zoom, zoom !!!". There are no special effects, just a piece of raw meat that is supposed to be a brain. It's shit, and I originally thought it was a movie at home or something I bought. But it has been distributed elsewhere and it's really weird to know that other people have seen it. Oops, I need 10 lines ... well ... this can be an interesting thing to watch to see how movies without budget were made before the invention of digital cameras. That sucks. In fact, yeah just look to see if you can get through the worst. If you can succeed through this, you can do it through anything.
