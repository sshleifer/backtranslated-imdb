Arthur Miller has always been recognized as one of America's greatest playwrights for such works as "Death of a Salesman" and "The Crucible". "Focus" is one of his less known pieces, brought to the big screen. However, knowing what the great playwright Arthur Miller is, I doubt that his original piece looks much like the movie. The film appears as empty and unpretentious, William H. Macy being a non-Jew taken for a Jew by antisemitic neighbors in Brooklyn, World War II. Do not get me wrong: the acting is OK and I guess the writers of this movie have probably tried to make their point about racism, but the movie just does not work. Macy, Laura Dern and David Paymer simply can not create an effective story with the material here.
