A plane carrying scientists and a prototype of a DNA machine, a powerful and revolutionary inventor, fall into a Pacific jungle. The insurance company is sponsoring a rescue expedition, led by Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), owner of a very large company, owner of the prototype and father of a scientist. There, the group finds the remains of the plane five miles from the planned location, the machine and the remains of the people. In addition, they realize that a Sasquatch, a kind of Big Foot, pursues them. This film is so ridiculous that I do not know what I'm doing again in this trash. The management is awful, the actors and lines are horrible, copying parts of `The Predator 'and even' The Blair Witch Project '. To summarize how bad this movie is, its best scene is when Andrea Roth's character, Marla Lawson, is injured, and the expedition guide says she needs a tetanus shot. Andrea undresses her jeans and the guide says: "Beautiful buttocks, but the blow must be in your arm". Ridiculous! My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Sasquatch, O Abomin√°vel '(` Sasquatch, the Abominable') <br /> <br />
