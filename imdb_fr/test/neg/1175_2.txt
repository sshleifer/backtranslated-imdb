Ed Gein: The Plainfield Butcher is located in the small American town of Plainfield, Wisconsin, in 1957, where the solitary Ed Gein (Kane Hodder) lives alone in a farm after the death of his mother and brother. The local police have had a series of burglars to deal with and when local maid Sue Layton (Ceia Coley) suspects more and more that something bad is happening. Ed is a sexually deviant, violent man who kidnaps and kills girls. Will the police find the truth in time to rescue Erica (Adrienne Frantz), daughter of the sheriff (Timothy Oman) ... <br /> <br /> produced and directed by Michael Feifer, it was about an attempt to found a horror movie about the real events surrounding the famous serial killer Ed Gein and turns out to be crap. Ed Gein's real life was only found guilty of two murders and died in 1984, but several films inspired him, including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Deranged (1974) and Ed Gein (2000). ). the worst film of Gein ever. Even if Ed Gein was real, nothing in this film is based on facts, Gein never had an accomplice, none of his victims were linked to the investigators, there was no victim of a car accident, although Gein keeps his name The name changes, kidnapping and murder of the two women depicted here actually occurred at four-year intervals, but in this film, it happens in space of a few days and while here, Gein is portrayed as a big muscular and imposing man in reality he was skinny, old and rather small. As a factual drama Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield is worthless and as pure entertainment, it is not better with a deadly and tiresome rhythm, the characters are all boring and when it does not kill someone, Gein is shown working or walking around and it is very dull. There is no suspense because we know who the killer is and it's just a tedious wait until he gets caught in the end. There is no real attempt to penetrate Gein's mind, the decision-makers giving him no more motivation than him, occasionally, hallucinating his domineering mother. <br /> <br /> There is not much gore here, there is a scene with a woman hanging on a hook, there is a really badly mounted scene where Gein cuts a leg, there are usual pots of body organs and skulls lying around and some blood, but there is really not much to do to be excited. It is obvious that the film has been treated to whiten much of the color of the photo because it is not very far from black and white sometimes, I personally think that the lack of color makes it even duller. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 1,500,000, I do not really see where this money went in a very forgotten production. Although located in Wisconsin, it was shot in California. Kane Hodder has it all wrong for the role of Ed Gein, just from a physical point of view, Hodder does not look at Gein remotely & he gives a pretty mediocre performance while he looks at the camera a lot making silly grimaces. <Ed Gein: The Plainfield BUtcher is shit and it's as simple and straightforward as that. Factual drama or entertainment based on pure exploitation, it's a total tripe from start to finish, nothing to recommend.
