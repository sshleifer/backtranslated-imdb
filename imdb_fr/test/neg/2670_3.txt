Avoid this one! It's a terrible movie. And if it's very exciting? These are just useless murders. And the spell with the curse of Thorn and Michael was the worst thing they could do for the show! Why could not they leave Michael's story mysterious? He is supposed to be the Boogeyman, not part of a stupid cult !! Ugh! Thank God for Halloween H20, who eliminated Halloween 3-6! They all sucked! Anyway, if you see this movie, do not wait for anything more than useless and bloody murders.
