I think the company that made this movie wanted people to think about Conan's movies, but unfortunately for those who made this movie, that's what she does. You will think that Conan's movies were pretty cool ... this one is totally boring and nil. The story, who cares? This will not help you like this movie more or less as it looks like a really cheap movie. Arnold, he does not seem to belong to this one, the reason he agreed to play the role is beyond me. Most likely for the money. I love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. Lame! This film is simply and simply terrible.
