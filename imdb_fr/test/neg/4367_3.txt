It would be wrong and reprehensible of me to advise you to watch Killjoy 2, you must have better things to do: wash the car, throw rocks in a stream, but at the same time, it's not nearly as bad. as you think. It's almost a proper movie, that much more than most DVD sludge can handle. Killjoy 2 is helped a lot by the maniacal turn of Trent Haaga as the eponymous clown. big shoes. Tammi Sutton presents the most entertaining director since Roger Corman in Creature from the Haunted Sea. Everything is almost destroyed by the hasty and sweet end. Everywhere and almost fun.
