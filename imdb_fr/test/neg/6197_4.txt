A muffled walk through the banalities of Mormon prosthetics. Absolutely not funny. Testimony of the widespread theory that, for bathroom humor to be funny, it must necessarily be vulgar; it also reinforces the claim that a close relationship with Jesus does not make you funny. More propaganda than film, do not worry about the thorny social issues that may come up at the table after this one. The saving grace of this film is its precise description of the particularly attractive young Mormon women. Oh well, it's your $ 7.50.
