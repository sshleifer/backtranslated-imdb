First of all, I must admit that I did not see Vampires: Los Muertos, but I have already seen the original Vampires movie and I like it a lot. I rented this movie having heard nothing about it. I did not expect to be impressed. I was not. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​moving the action to the Far East, which should have opened up many new avenues for action sequences as well as for the screenplay, but not enough . was done of that. The fight scenes and motorcycle chases were terribly boring. <br /> <br /> There were some parts that I liked, such as how the killer's team was not portrayed as a heroic person, as in the first movie. <br /> <br /> I've been hoping since I saw Hammer's old movie, Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires, a few years ago, that someone would make another good vampire movie based in Asia . It was not that.
