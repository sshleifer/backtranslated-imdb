Dreck tired, deformed. The chemistry between Argento and Madsen was as exciting as a wet donut. Their dialogue was dramatically uninteresting. The scenario was messy. Forced play Cinematography has focused on the uninitiated. Lazy and useless. Kim Gordon and his character had no reason to be there. No one else besides. I could not have given two farts for any of the "characters". Their emotions jumped and jumped like a junkie who hates her heroine. Empty and dull. Why do I have to write ten lines of text here to make my point? I think I have summarized the first three words. But, of course, that is not enough. I think this is the last time I'm going to waste my time criticizing a movie. Anyway, I saw "Clean" and found it just as ineffective. Once again, I did not care about the characters, whether they live or die.
