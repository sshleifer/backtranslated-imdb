For starters, I love Steven Seagal, this man is a genius. But recent movies let me wonder: is he trying more? His latest films show almost no effort on the part of Seagal. In Out of Reach, it's too obvious that his lines are doubled. . What Seagal does in this film is not only a slap for its fans, but even more for Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In the second scene around, as he prepares to tyrolize drug traffickers in the flat to steal the jewels and the money, he shows him how to install the gun and hang it on a neon sign. Perhaps you could say, "Yah, what does this have to do with Van Damme?" This scene was stolen in a film by Jean-Claude Van Damme called the Order. Rent both, look at both, compare the two and you will lose respect for Seagal. Today You Die was not just a garbage can, but it was, I dare say, an insult. Seagal's aikido movements are always good, but why does not he make great movies such as Marked for Death or Above the Superior, he still has the moves and the attitude, I just wonder why "Seagal, why ? ". There are such silly scenes in his new movies that have nothing to do with intrigue, and such idiotic narrative lines on top of that. I hope the next Black Dawn movie will be another release, Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice, because his latest movie channels, especially Today You Die, really made me wonder if he was able to do anything. other action movies like Double Team. . Please, do not watch this film unless you hate Seagal, if you like his films, do not look at him, it will make you question his future in the action movie genre.
