A serene, but sadly sad, satire of crime movies, starring Michael Caine playing the role of a British author telling stories of trashy crime traveling to the Mediterranean to help write memoirs of a so-called gangster; Soon he realizes that he is being followed and that his life is in danger. Caine tells the debates with a lot of sly wit and sarcasm, but his current performance is devoid of energy (Caine's outbursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere and he is not in contact with anyone at screen). Other members of the cast (including Mickey Rooney, Silver-haired Lionel Stander, and Lizabeth Scott) play very well in colorful roles, although Al-Lettieri has an insulting role as a seemingly disfigured homosexual (Lettieri is insulted without being able to defend himself). himself, an unenviable position). Screenwriter-director Mike Hodges has the seeds of a good idea (satirizing 1940s crime movies without compromising hard speech and the medium), but he does not have a keen sense of humor. When a Bogart look-alike - ask a question about a hawk - is the best joke, the following is anemic. ** from ****
