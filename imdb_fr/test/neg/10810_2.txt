Okay, I saw this movie via Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I saw the movie so I thought I'd leave a comment on it. I love once again how Joe finds himself stuck in shabby roles while his brother and nephew just get the winning roles of an Oscar. Soultaker is technically what you would call the supposedly good movie. It seemed that the director and the actors were taking this film very seriously and producing very tacky effects, a story that did not make much sense, not to mention the rather sullen playing skills. This is one of my favorite episodes of MST3K, simple because what they mention is largely what we think throughout the film and I will explain why in a moment. <br /> <br /> Natalie and Zach are a broken couple and are now trying to work things out. But since Zach is in the upper class and Natalie is in the middle class, it will not work. But on the way home, their friends and those of Zach have a car accident and now, the Angel of Death / Soultaker is chasing them to reach his soul quota. But it also seems that he has had another relationship in life with Natalie and does not seem to be able to move forward. So now, Natalie and Zach have to race against the clock five million times a minute to save their souls and their lives. <br /> <br /> Well, I guess Zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there was a stairway to heaven, I wonder if Black Sabbith was wrong too, lol. Basically, there are a lot of holes in the plot in this movie, as no one can see the characters and they can not be killed, but they can still press buttons and open doors? The Angel of Death had a very strange face and distracted the story a bit. Soultaker was just a ugly film that was rushed and made you feel so bad for Joe, the under-appreciated brother Sheen / Estovez. <br /> <br /> 2/10
