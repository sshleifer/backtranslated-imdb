One would think that a movie starring three of the greatest male stars of the post-war era would have become a classic. These three people, who are also my three favorites, walk in a vertigo, seeming to prefer any place, but there. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that The Way West definitely has the potential to be a classic. In these times of political correctness, a film about the American pioneers and the difficulties of their westward migration is not done now. It should have been better done at the time. <br /> <br /> Kirk Douglas is a former US senator who heads a wagon train westward to build a colony in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. As an ex-politician, he is above the job he directs. The scenario requires him to have not only a boxcar, but also a car to drive the train. <br /> <br /> You think it's ridiculous, you must see the flogging scene where Douglas orders his black servant, played by Roy Glenn whipping him. I will not spoil that by saying what makes Douglas demand that from Glenn, but believe me, it's bad. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is the guide to the track and the three stars for which he seems most bored. There must have been considerable friction between Widmark and Douglas on the set, but Mitchum is not taken aback by the film. <br /> <br /> Maybe the frictions have helped a bit because the movie calls the widower watch Mrs. Widmark, played by Lola Albright. Now she is the best thing in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film says to introduce Sally Field. This was done between his time Gidget and his day Flying Nun. She plays a piece of southern white trash with the musical name Mercy McBee. We see her first in the movie sitting on the back of her parents' cart, legs akimbo and inviting. Of course, she receives the invitation. <br /> <br /> His character resembles what is found in all caravan parks in America and what was still a train of cars, but a large caravan park in motion. <br /> <br /> Despite this film, Sally Field began a career of two Oscars. What this woman had to overcome. <br /> <br /> Andrew, the son of Victor McLaglen, directed this element and, with an ugly scenario, turned everything into a turquoise mess. Andrew McLaglen would be ashamed, he certainly did better in his career. <br /> <br /> And you too, unless you're an observer of stars.
