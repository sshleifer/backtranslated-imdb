This film is a mediocre and low budget film. I saw worse on MST3K, I want to assure you, but it's still a pretty crappy movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about Clonus, a very secret government facility in which clones are used to give organs to politicians. It is an almost Orwellian society, in reality: almost (but not entirely) effective. <br /> <br /> The film begins to tumble when the main clone (Tim Connely of the fame "Emergency") falls in love with a female clone (Paulette Breen, who appeared in this film and at most four other films {and it was not his first film}). They start to suspect something. After finding a can of beer in the nearby river, the plot begins to crumble. The clone receives no response from the main scientist (Dick Sargent of Bewitched) or the "Confessional", a computer supposed to know everything. He enters Clonus' main building and (in a hilariously destroyed scene by Mike and the Bots) discovers the truth (including a cloning video that strangely shows the same method used to clone Dolly ago five years ... and this film was made more than twenty years ago ...) about Clonus. He frees himself, pursued by two guards. He had a hard time getting through the two-foot high fences, although he had a much harder time climbing rocks. From there, he continues to slide. Also present are Peter Graves ("Beginning of the End", "He conquered the world") as presidential candidate and Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "Piranha", "Once upon a time in the West ") and Lurleen Tuttle (" My Barker's Killer Brood "," Psycho ") as an elderly couple who helps Clony after his escape. <br /> <br /> The MST3K version was invaluable; one of the best episodes so far. <br /> <br /> Four stars for the movie, 10 for the MST3K version.
