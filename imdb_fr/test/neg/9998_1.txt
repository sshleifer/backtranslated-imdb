I sometimes let my kids look at this trash so they understand how pathetic the "competitors" of the show are. They are pathetic not because they are fat, but because they plead their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune. <br /> <br /> So that anyone can go on national television, bluffing, snorting and moaning about its size (entirely their fault) is nauseating. What does it say about us as a nation? Does this suggest that your life choices and their consequences are not our responsibility? <br /> <br /> "The Biggest Loser" is an appropriate title, but it has nothing to do with his weight. <br /> <br /> An absolute trash bin.
