NO WAY ! I hated Mamie. First, she's way too big - of course, it's Tom, whoever her brother is, who plays it - and I hate what she does when she brushes her fake silver hair back, but: there's has fun roles in this movie. For example, the fact that each actor looks like V.G. (very German), and also that they think that, even left to themselves, they should pretend that this guy (Tom) is their "grandmother" or something of the sort. I particularly liked - not - that moment Charlotte left and started walking to the nearest petrol station to ask for help. She suddenly finds herself in the middle of the woods (where were they before? No one dares to explain) and turns, turns, turns like a ballerina, staring at the stars ... and ... ignoring the fact that Mamie is behind her , ready to hit !!! Anyway, the music was not so bad, the haircuts were acceptable and the end terribly provocative ... Mmmmm ... I'd love to have the German version.
