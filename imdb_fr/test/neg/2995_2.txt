I should live this movie, but not me. He has won international awards, he is a foreigner (I usually like such films), he is slow (once again I love him) and he has no free sex or violence. the problem is that it's boring. We have two friends from the same village in Turkey, one "successful" the other not. the one who failed comes to Istanbul to stay with the one who has managed to get a good job at sea. Both live unsatisfactory, useless and mean-spirited lives. <br /> <br /> Well, this is not the first time this type of film is made. I have not seen anything new added to this tired theme. There are long shots that simply consist of standing and watching the sea, sitting in a cafe or watching TV. I understand that this kind of thing is there to show the emptiness of their loves. Even if it is so, I got the idea in the first 15 minutes. I do not need to be beaten to the head with for the rest of the two hours. <br /> <br /> The symbolism is also a bit heavy. the plate of minnow-like fish living with one of the plate and flipping over in its skirmishes. The symbols are best when they are not obvious but they are there, in the background, creating an atmosphere slightly inferior to the viewer's consciousness. <br /> <br /> 1, so I gave him a 2. To score a 1, the talent is bad. This movie did not have a lot of energy.
