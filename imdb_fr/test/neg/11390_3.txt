The cross-cut boy finds his success on the Spelling Bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional education. Shirley MacLaine directed and embodies the grandmother of the child. It is always fascinating to see long-time actors give themselves the chance to make a film, the material that attracts them and the actors they choose to work with. Here, the only person well chosen in "Bruno" is MacLaine. The children actors seem to have been chosen for their flickering and kindness, and MacLaine, with a tender heart, holds their close-ups for extremely long periods; nothing about these cherubim seems natural, not the lines that fall without the awareness of the mouth or the interaction they have with adults or even with each other. As a disgruntled father of the boy, poor Gary Sinise hovers over the edges, in shameless shame, still with a pained look. Towards the end of the film, MacLaine transforms everything into a passel of tight scenes, and even concludes with the kid kissing the pope in Rome! Another unholy treat of a talented actress turned director who, like Sally Field and her movie "Beautiful", can not stop winking and nudging the audience. Shirley uses ethnicity for shtick and the innocence of childhood as a line of force. The children in this cast have mature eyes, use dirty words, but when a very talkative boy calls our small hero "gay", MacLaine's grandmother orders him to pass and hit the child (in front of him). the media!). How is it for progression? * from ****
