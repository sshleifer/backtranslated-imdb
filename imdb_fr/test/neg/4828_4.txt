I watched this film about thirty years ago and it's been in my mind until now. When I found it on DVD, I did not hesitate too long, even more, because I have a predilection for the first films of Belmondo. But what a bad surprise! Some films should be allowed to leave the public, retain some memory and not shock their audience. <br /> <br /> Widely hailed as one of the few cynical works of Chabrol, the only lasting impression I have to observe it is ... boredom. Some movies do not really age. But what about movies that have no sense of style? <br /> <br /> The flaws of the scenario, a little inspired action game - presumably because of the lack of direction -, a kind of does not deserve its name, less than poor photographs and, lastly, the Worst editing work I have ever seen in a long time makes it really hard to bear. <br /> <br /> My impression was that there was a group of people with too much money and equipment, but obviously, no idea or skill. It's really surprising that this one did not abruptly put an end to Chabrol's career. Do not blame the bad general taste of the 70s, this one is a shit in its own right and a serious candidate for the most useless waste of celluloid.
