This movie is without a doubt the worst action movie I have ever seen. I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. In fact, the best part of the movie (this movie is supposed to be serious) is when a chicken rolls on the road, on foot, at about 100 miles per hour. This pathetic editing error makes the movie absolutely hilarious for about 2 seconds, then it returns to "without stopping, on the edge of your seat, while you're trying to find a comfortable position to sleep, in action!"
