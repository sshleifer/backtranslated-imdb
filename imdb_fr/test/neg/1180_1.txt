What a waste of time to watch this movie. Poor image quality, mediocre sound, poor quality of action and no real foundation. The member's "girlfriend" acted so much, as did the sheriff, that it was more of a comedy than a horror. The member tries to make an emergency call by dialing 911 ... PROBLEM ... in 1957, this emergency number did not exist. This is just one example of glaring inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> The "scary" aspect was underused. It just did not seem horrible. <br /> <br /> I thought the actor who played Gein had done the most admirable actor work of the whole film. I could see mental disorders in the description of his character. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... this one does NOT have it!
