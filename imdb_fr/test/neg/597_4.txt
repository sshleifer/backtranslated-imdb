I attributed to this film four stars for several reasons. First of all, I felt that this movie was really a preaching and I hate it. It's still my fault that I watched a Christian movie. <br /> <br /> My friend and I rented this movie because it sounded interesting. The back of the case said something like a spiritual battle, someone opening a kind of border allowing demons to enter our world, and so on. Something interests me a lot, indeed. This film has almost reached the target. It was more like on the edge of the target, more on the tree than the target itself ... <br /> <br /> The basic plot of this movie is that two couples are kidnapped by a group terrorists they experience experiences. However, as their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and spiritual realms, couples' men can now feel, smell, hear and see demons. of the spiritual world. In this order. Apparently, the sense of taste is not present in this area. <br /> <br /> This film is very clich√©. They took the title seriously, because the men, while chained to the beds, demand that their wives look behind them because there is something there. <br /> <br /> Although this is an interesting effort, I think the special effects could have been done so much better. The demon scratching against the woman was, in a word, hilarious. The woman was odious and everyone in the room was happy about her death. We all hoped she would be beaten by the other woman in the chair. <br /> <br /> The message is one that I do not want to comment on, except that I think Christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for that. <br /> <br /> And so I give it four stars because it's not the fault of the film. I am not a Christian and do not like this type of message. to make comments throughout. My friend and I watched this movie that seemed like an episode of MST3K.
