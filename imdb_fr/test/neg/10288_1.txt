After a frightening and crude opening that gives you that terrifying feeling of "chainsaw massacre", everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI officers start beating, you know they are the real killers. Anyone who has seen enough of these "fool" movies can understand this. <br /> <br /> This film is conceived with only one idea in mind: to represent brutal murders. Why, then, is the little girl not so tortured and murdered? Will it be the next for us moviegoers? Torture and child abuse? What is the problem with you people? Lynch is really a disgusting and ugly mind.
