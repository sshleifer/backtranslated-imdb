I noticed that this movie had been on Cinemax a lot lately, so this morning I decided to watch it. I had just finished Infiltrator, which is an excellent movie, and I thought it looked good too. From the description, the cable had, at least. This film was awful. It's slow, the pace is horrible, it feels like it lasts 4 hours. There is no real plot to speak of ... ah! How can we say something good about this movie? Rickman is good ... but still is ... the other two characters work well, but there is no real story to support that. After 2 hours, you sit down and wonder what is happening, where is the plot, ends with a surprise that, frankly, just made me sick. Do not bother with this one.
