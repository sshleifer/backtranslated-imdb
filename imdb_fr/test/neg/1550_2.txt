Well, the episode I just watched had caused the old "Gastineau Girl" who was wondering why people kept mentioning her husband (Mr. Gastineau, a famous American football player apparently). She does not seem to want to accept the fact that it's the only reason she does not spill hamburgers, she's married to a celebrity and that's why she has cameras pointed at her. <br /> <br /> When an investigator challenges her to explain her work, she gave a wonderfully circular reason why people should pay attention to her: "I work really hard for my reality show ". Then she said "I'm not a celebrity ... I'm a personality." <br /> <br /> I'm not sure who this series is for, except people who have already had their intelligence removed. This is certainly a model for anyone but gold diggers because the two stars only spend money, and all he says about the rich is that they have no problem money.
