If you have described one of the scenes; nightmares of children killing in your sleep, your little girl talking to ghosts, looking for your child lost in an abandoned mine at night, so petrified by the fear that you can not move even if the blood of a murder victim trickles from the floor above ?? so I would say that you had a horror movie. But some how "Wicked Little Things" was not scary. I am a horror fan and I loved the location, the plot in principle and I liked the three main ladies. I did not want to see them hurt, I wanted the "bad guy" to get his desserts, the rest of the cast always being just cannon fodder. the book - even until the battery of the torch runs out in the dark as you begin to whisper voices that bring you closer. <br /> <br /> Horror movies or under 12, you will have seen everything before.
