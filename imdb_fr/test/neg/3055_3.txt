When I saw this for the first time, I thought that fragments were pretty scary. But the horror is a little sapped by the fact that sleepy teenagers are so irritating that you do not care what happens to them. There are really good moments like Angela's speech about demons and the demon briefly seen is effective. But that does not really stand up to repeated viewing or in-depth analysis. All this is rather tacky and cheap, and often downright stupid, pornography and unusual jokes too often replacing the horror. The music is excellent, however, and the epilogue is certainly fun, but this film does not have much to recommend, it comes as another tariff type Jason.
