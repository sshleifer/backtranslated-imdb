I like movies, but I did not find anything loved about The Box. I was interested in the "hook" of the plot, but unfortunately he never went anywhere and was impossible to follow. Anyone who claims to understand this movie is probably pretending to think that it is part of something, well I have news for them, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> The only nuance in this film is that women are responsible for the original sin and the corruption of humanity. I've heard this story before, and it makes less and less sense. It is true that this film is different from many movies currently in theaters, but that is not worth the price of the ticket.
