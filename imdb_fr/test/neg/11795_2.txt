This film is a good companion of Blair Witch, because it is so wrong that BW did well. Like BW, this one claims to be a documentary of ghostly events, each member of the team having his own camera. <br /> <br /> However, the sense of reality is never at the rendezvous. The participants are badly written cliché characters and the events that take place are just as clichés (the cat jumping from a cupboard, a falling chandelier, etc.). In addition, the low-key dialogues and unparalleled improvisation works of the overly appealing distribution undermine the docu sensation. And even worse, cameras presumed by participants record too many events to be perfectly credible. In fact, with a few reissues, this thing could have been a parody of Blair Witch. In fact, there's a scene in which the blond historian is eating a sandwich with a huge cockroach that's actually quite funny, which reminds me of a similar crude scene from "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Got It . " But in the end, the event is played right without a punch. It's hard to say what was the intention of The St Francisville Experiment except to glean a few dollars of lost BW. But it is quite sad to see that the only real interest I found there was to know if the blonde historian was going to have her t-shirt tied on her stomach during a given shot or not.
