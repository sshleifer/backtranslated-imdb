It's not a good movie at all. I can not believe that after fifty years, this film won the national prize when there were such jewels of the Marathi cinema that were systematically ignored. It's a very overestimated movie that was very lucky. He received the national award, garnered popular opinion and will now represent India to the international audience. Anyone who has a marginal understanding of good quality cinema will know very well that it will not even be nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> I do not understand where to start. There are so many things that are missing and missing in this film that it is surprising that he was even considered for the national prize. The fact that this film is awarded as the best film of this year reflects the biased judgment of those who hold the reins of Indian cinema and the diminutive understanding of those who blindly appreciate this film. <br /> <br /> The chosen subject is great. It is important that such films are made ?? but only by people who can handle them. Sandeep Sawant is not up to the task? not even close. His direction is nervous, confused. There is no clear thought process. He tries, but is not able to explore the depth of the characters, especially the grandfather. He is not able to show the initial horror, the anxiety, then the hopeless detachment and yet the insurmountable courage of the grandfather. He wastes our time in the hospital when we should have shown the time together. He tries to stuff everything without any priority. He does not understand his subject well and that really matters to him. <br /> <br /> However, casting does not help Sawant either. Worst job ?? Amruta Shubash. She is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this job or any other sensible acting job. How did she get 'Tee Phulrani'? Extremely lucky and / or extremely influential and / or extremely pitiful. That said, she does her best to do a terrible job in this movie. His MSW act should have gone to the more responsible actor ?? Sonali Kulkarni. Amruta Subhash did not understand it. MSW's work is under constant emotional stress, but it is important for them to project a calm and powerful exterior, which reassures patients. Asawari of Amruta Subhash seems even more frightened and needs support than the people she works for. <br /> <br /> Second worst? Arun Nalawade. I have never seen a more wooden face in the Marathi film industry (it is however abundant and everywhere in the current Hindi cinema). He is the producer and he chose himself; no second thought, no consideration. Any good actor would have jumped to play that role even though he had to pay the producer to do it, but Arun Nalawade would not let anyone do it. More ambitious and obtuse, it helps to make the film fall more than everyone else. His game lacks research and even basic skills. My choice for this role would be Vikram Gokhale. <br /> <br /> The music is not inspired. The film is technically missing. It could very well have been a FTII project work. <br /> <br /> brilliant performance of Ashwin Chitale. It is amazing that such a young boy can give such a respectable performance. He has shamed many of today's actors. Unintentionally maybe, but he brought his own innocence to his character and it made it a memorable performance. In addition, Sandeep Kulkarni really gave a very credible performance. Really put in all his efforts and it shows. The script is also well written. <br /> <br /> "A minimal budget" can not be a valid argument for renting this film. Lack of funds is the cause of all Marathi films. The cricket and Hindi films are mopping up all the money and the rest is left to fight for the remains. It's a sad state of affairs but not enough reason to rent an immature movie that comes out. 'Doghi' was a brilliant film, made with a limited budget. 'Doghi' was also technically lacking, but it was well studied and well done. It was a host of details, backed by great performances from everyone, making it a rich cinema. Why did he not receive the praise he so deserved? ?? only prove my point of partial judgment. <br /> <br /> The lack of research and not funds, is what makes "Shwaas" such a bad film.
