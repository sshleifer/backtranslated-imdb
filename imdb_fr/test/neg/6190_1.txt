Algiers is not a classic, it's a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko, directed by Duvivier and featuring a much more attractive and charming Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to fully experience the Casbah and the characters in Algiers, I recommend you do not even watch this film or see Pepe the Moko, because it is much more elaborate and filmed, the lines are not clich√©s and the characters adhere much more to reality. Moreover, the end is so dramatic and so essential to Pepe's character that the version of Algiers is intolerable. Although Algiers does an almost excellent job imitating every scene, the acting is up to the credibility of the characters. In addition, the wardrobe is truly breathtaking in all scenes, especially that of Pepe in the last scene and that of Gaby (at any time), but also when she is on the boat. Frankly, Algiers is cheap when it comes to imitations.
