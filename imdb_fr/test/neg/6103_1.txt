<br /> <br /> This film is best appreciated among a large audience thanks to the rants. <br /> <br /> Very often, the characters of KADOSH look intensely without looking at anything. Unhappy faces very intense, very pensive, very serious. During these moments, the music is very serious for the viewer to realize that the scene being watched is not a fun game. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining parts of this movie are placed between the many options look. We learn that women in the KADOSH community have two homework assignments. One is to raise as many male babies as possible for their husbands. The second is to stay employed to free their husbands from work. What do these men do with their free time? They pray. And we learn that at home, they pray aloud: "I thank you for not creating me as a woman". And at their place of worship, they pray to give thanks for possessing functioning male genitals. <br /> <br /> Parallel to the prayer, many scenes of frantic antics, screams, and uncontrollable movements of the head and body swaying in fourth and fourth position, many complex and bizarre ritual activities (or simple, but just as strange). <br /> <br /> The cream of unintentional comedy comes from sex. The imagery of a hot, disturbed man actively exchanging bodily fluids with his bedridden wife while trying to keep his hat from falling off his scalp is unforgettable! <br /> <br /> Every sex scene is funny, but it stands out when a husband rubs his face against the feet of his beautiful wife (Yael Abecassis). Oh yes, we finally enter the country of sensuality ... but NO! The rubbing feet stop before anything happens and the husband begins to move his head and swing until the scene ends! <br /> <br /> There are three pretty, almost undressing females, but KADOSH does not contain any nudity. Technically, the director uses interesting images and pleasant uses of light and colors. <br /> <br /> For a more credible, educational and entertaining treatment of the fate of an impure woman unworthy to hold a book in a world where respect is measured at the speed at which a man can quote a sentence of ancient writings, I suggest the YENTL of Barbra Streisand. <br /> <br />
