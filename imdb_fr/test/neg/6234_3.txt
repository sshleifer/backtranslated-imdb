I'm sorry but I do not understand how the studio gets away with it. The film is not worth it. Perhaps as a play but certainly not as a film! And why do they call it a thriller ??? Delegating the acting is good but I did not expect less than these perfect actors. Robert Redford plays very well and Willem Dafoe is quite convincing as a sweet "bad guy". Helen Mirren can play just about any role and always seems (always) beautiful;). I am also a fan of his British detectives. Still, they just can not save this film so boring, I'm sorry. I hope that the director "Pieter Jan Brugge" will not present a lot of films because he clearly does not have the meaning of the words "suspense and thriller".
