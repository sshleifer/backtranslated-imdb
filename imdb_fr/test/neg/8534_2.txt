Let's cut everything in the first paragraph. "The Messengers", the latest film by the Pang brothers (Danny and Oxide), as a horror film, is deeply bad. And just like a movie in general, it's a big disappointment. This is only a "Sixth Sense" warmed up and, as long as this image is still available, there is no reason on Earth to pay money to see this turkey. <br /> <br /> Lately, horror / slasher movies like the "Final Destination", "Wrong Turn", "Boogie Man", "The Ring 2" and "The Grudge" series increasingly depend on big unrequited shocks (for example, something jumps to the person on screen, elicits a sigh from the audience, but turns out to be a cat or a raven or something.) Few things go into making it a real frightening experience like "The Sixth Sense", or "Signs", or the classic horror movies of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. <br /> <br /> "The Messengers" is based on the same tired old clich√©s as these new movies well below, and so is old, tired and - to my surprise - has become one of the most boring movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> The plot has another stupid family, headed by Father Roy (Dylan McDermott, "The Practice"), Mom Denise (Penel Ann Miller, "Awakenings", "Kindergarten Cop", the series televised "Desperate Housewives"), the big sis Jess (Kristen Stewart, "Zathura: a space adventure") and toddler Ben (Evan Turner), who moves to North Dakota from Chicago. <br /> <br /> The reason for this move is never really described here, but it has something to do with the father's inability to find work and Jess's drunk driving escapades. We know that there will be problems immediately because they are moving into a large Gothic house in the middle of nowhere; a home that looks like the summer house of Munster. Oh, and the first five minutes of the movie show that something really horrible happened there. <br /> <br /> Jess hates the place (hey, who could blame her), but an optimistic pop hopes to be able to raise sunflowers (despite the unusually high number of flapping crows). But when he meets Burwell (John Corbet, "Helen Raising" and resembling Kevin Costner in the film version of "My Name Is Earl"), a traveling vagabond and an expert in sunflower breeding, things start to take the extent. <br /> <br /> But then, strange things start to happen; Jess is terrified by a violent and invisible force in the house (of course, no one other than Ben, two years old, can see it, so she is called a snowflake) and the crows continue to drag. Ben is also able to detect supernatural creatures, but since he is two years old, he can not articulate it. Scene after scene, people were telling the boy to tell them what he was seeing, and finally I wanted to scream on the screen, "He can not tell you, he's two years old - panicked! only protagonist who can solve all these things being a dumb child is really smart. <br /> <br /> Anyway, we still have to think about Jess's mental health, when and if Ben will describe correctly the paranormal visions he sees, whether daddy is going to run the sunflower, if the high-plains dinghy is a good guy or a bad guy, what's the interest of the real estate agent looking for George Plimpton how a fork diving in the back can only be a plague of flesh, what is the role of mother in the family, and where all the crows come from. <br /> <br /> All this while waiting and wondering that something - anything - happens The conclusion is also very lame and asks again estion of how a mind without a physical body can harm a living person. Very dull, useless and most terrible of all, not scary at all. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there are a lot of crows in this movie.
