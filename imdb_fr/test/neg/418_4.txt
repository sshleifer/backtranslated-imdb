Why did not they follow the book ... I'm really sad and disappointed. I could not wait to see this movie. However, if you have read the book (perhaps recently), it might be very difficult to stay objective. My wife did not read the book and she loved the movie. <br /> <br /> The reasons for this disappointment are as follows: 1) The involvement of Cern ... carried away by the wind, such a shame, there is a very small part at the beginning, where the antimatter is created, but even that does not fit the facts (why not, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand, that's how Langdon got involved would have been a perfect start for the Movie_ 2) The narrative thread between the (deceased) pope and Camerlegno is completely over ... it completely distorts the reason for the theft of antimatter. 3) The narrative plot between Langdon and Vittoria Vetra is totally non-existent <br /> All-in-all, too flaky story, and can not understand that Dan Brown allowed them to put his name against it. Maybe I should revisit this film in 10 years, when I do not remember the excellent book (I'm afraid I forgot it) <br /> <br /> Really sorry for the negative criticism, which was ruined by expectations
