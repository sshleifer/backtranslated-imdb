I came across this movie while surfing on channels and it seemed to me that it was another poor Christian movie on The End Times (which I find quite amusing because they take themselves so seriously). To be honest, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed UFO and science fiction stories. But it was long enough for me to classify it as an embarrassing and frightening representation of the Christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in the artistic sense of the term. <br /> <br /> The writing of the film was terrible, the game was mediocre and the pace was mediocre. The cinematography and the realization were below normal: no interesting graphics, no layered plot, no creativity. Do not blame only the budget: movies can always be interesting without special effects. It was not. Christian films can not excuse their mediocrity and lack of originality in the artistic field simply because of their message. And the message here was hardly "Christian". <br /> <br /> ** Disclaimer: the rest of this review is for Christians ** <br /> <br /> First of all, it's not ethical in any business to bait and change your customers. I do not like being told that I can win a free iPod just to realize that I must first spend $ 300 in participating stores. Non-Christians do not like to be told that they watch a sci-fi movie, and then get bombarded with Christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Hidden programs do not make you win friends, let alone converts. <br /> <br /> Second, you should not use overt threats to convince people that your beliefs are true. The actors who represented the Christians appeared as harsh and insulting bullies in the face of the skeptic "unbeliever" - they even staged the kidnapping to scare him into believing. Dialogue of representation: "Turn to Jesus or go to hell!" "Very good, do not believe me- BUT YOU WOULD BE SORRY!" "On the day of your death, I can guarantee you that you will want you to pay more attention to this matter of Jesus - WHEN YOU LATER IN THE BELL OF HELL!" OK, I'm exaggerating maybe, but it certainly happened the same way. If you think it's a "clear message for Christ," you're wrong. I do not remember Jesus using threats and coercion. And I do not think people can make a genuine decision to believe in him out of fear. So, please do not use this as a "testimonial tool" for your "unsaved" friends. It is heavy, offensive and inaccurate to represent a true Christian message. <br /> <br /> Third, theology was bad. In addition to calling Jesus a means of assurance of hell, he left no room for debate or discussion and did not seek to debate the question of whether UFOs or extraterrestrial life might exist. Instead, he offered a simple answer: "UFOs are the devil's ploy to deceive people when the rapture occurs," which is neither biblical nor widely accepted by most Christians. Since the Bible does not mention UFOs or extraterrestrials, you can not use them as a source to draw conclusions in one way or another. Abduction is not even necessarily a solid and widely accepted biblical concept, even though today most Evangelical Christians seem to believe it because of a series of popular books. If you do your research (as many supportive reviewers suggest), the idea of ​​two Christ arrivals (the first as rapture) is a relatively new phenomenon in the tradition of the Church, popularized by some evangelists roving at the turn. 20th century. The majority of Orthodox Christians will probably find that the message of this film is a rather large piece based on many unsupported assumptions. <br /> <br /> This film misses the target, both as a meaningful entertainment and a clear representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I would not recommend it.
