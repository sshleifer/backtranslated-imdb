My companion and I chose to look at this obvious element of junk food only because of its slogan? After nearly 30 years of unhealthy and rudimentary teenage slashers, I can not believe that only now, a nerdy brain of horror has invented the brilliantly spiritual slogan "They've done what's needed"! Other than that, "Miner's Massacre" is just as random, boring and forgettable as everything else out there. Maybe even more! The script contains all the typical clich√©s and presents all the terribly stereotyped characters to whom you wish a horrible and painful death. The effects of gore are computer-designed and are therefore much worse and the "big" mandatory stars (Karen Black, John Philip Law and Richard Lynch) are completely ruined despite their excellent reputation. The cursed mines and abandoned ghost towns form an ideal horror setting ?? the creators of "My Bloody Valentine" have already understood in the early 80s ?? but his dull film simply has no innovative idea, or even any surprising element to offer. A group of greedy 20-year-old losers, who consider themselves friends even though they can not stand each other, desecrate an old mine in search of the hidden gold. Of course, they unexpectedly resurrect the zombie miner in this way and he only has 150 years of rest to prepare for a mass slaughter of teenagers. Yay! The casting is exceptionally irritating in this one. The girls all have impressive shelves but refuse to show anything. Instead, they prefer all endless moans and unnecessary risk taking. The stupid types are obviously only used as screen fillers. In just five minutes of play, Karen Black still manages to ridicule herself by describing the most prototypical and hysterical woman in the region. The zombie has a stupid and unconvincing face, but it looks good and reasonably threatening when it is shown in the distant shadow of the moonlight while swaying around its pickaxe. Since the best thing about "Miner's Massacre" is the slogan mentioned above and you can read it on the box in the video store itself, there is very little to recommend here. Director John Carl Buechler had some modest successes in the eighties, including the first "Troll" and the sequel to "Friday the 13th," but it is clear that it is time to retire now.
