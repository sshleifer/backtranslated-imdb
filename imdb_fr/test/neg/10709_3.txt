It is a male bashing bonanza. I saw it on Sci-Fi some time ago, and the idea seemed interesting. It could have been a good movie, and the plot itself, I do not see it as a denigration of men, but some specific references to men are really embarrassing. Maybe I'll be able to watch the movie again because it's at least trying to redeem itself by suggesting that the women in the movie may not be as nonviolent as they claim, but that still does not make up for the fact be a really tiring man. -bashing. I mean, I can understand a little, it's part of the plot of the movie, but hey, it gets really tiring after a while. Not only that, but to assume that the majority of women in the world would agree to become homosexuals so easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority that they would find themselves "in the closet". It's so amazing. There are far too many women with cultural or religious restrictions who would not want to say that it is totally implausible. I mean, I know his science fiction and I love science fiction, but the best science fiction has at least an allusion to it being possible, and that is too implausible. The phrase "The truth is stranger than fiction" was created because fiction must at least appear plausible to be welcomed, but the truth is not always so. This film is not that. Other than that, the film has a good acting and the eventual moral of the story, that something like what happened was wrong, buy it back a little, but not enough.
