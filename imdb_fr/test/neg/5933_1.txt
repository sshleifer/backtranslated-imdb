Lou Gossett, Jr. is an excellent and captivating actor, but to make him play the role of "president", then make him act as if he were James Bond, running with a gun and entering a warehouse to discover a conspiracy to kill Christians and not being able to escape the so-called high-security facility to live another day does not do it justice. This film has so many unresolved issues. <br /> <br /> I will try to list a few: <br /> <br /> 1 - what was the purpose of "storing" a vaccine if nobody is vaccinated? - for example, the preacher could have been vaccinated if the "tribulation force" already had the vaccine on hand - later, Buck Williams' wife will join the sick preacher and she herself becomes ill; Was the virus contagious? - If it was contagious, then why did Ray and his wife go to church without adequate protection? - Why did not they become sick too? - and when Chloe drank the wine and was "healed", how did she suddenly know that the wine was "the antidote"? - Was it California wine, an ordinary red table wine? - Could the red grape juice have been enough - and if the preacher had received "communion" at least every time he preached, perhaps he had already received antidote through his body? - Buck and Chloe received a "heavy" box of vaccine that has never been used - what mysterious message should we see there? <br /> <br /> 2 - the presentation of the "evil" forces that collaborate with the Antichrist Nicolai to destroy the world, as Russians, Chinese, etc., is actually a relic of the 1950s and early James Bond, showing an ignorance of modern society and humanity - should we believe that Russians and Chinese are constantly trying to destroy this planet? - and for what purpose, pure destruction? - It was such a narrow vision of this world and it was so clich√©d that it was laughable <br /> <br /> 3 - the main purpose of this film was the scene towards the very end where Kirk Cameron and Lou Gossett , Jr. proselytizes to non-believers in the public (showing Kirk to Lou's proselytizing): it was a film without history, too much disconnection with reality and a conspiracy completely inappropriate for a great actor <br /> <br /> Therefore, I classify this as a 1, because zero is not available
