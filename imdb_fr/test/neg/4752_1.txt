The production value of AvP2 can be described by an adjective: AWFUL <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous, even in the fictional area of ​​AvP: What are the Facehuggers on the Predator ship doing? Why does the predator suppress all the signs of his influence and lose precious time in eviscerating and even presenting the body of an insignificant human cop? Why is the predator alone? Why does the predator only equip himself on the earth but on his home planet? Why does the predator make his work so uncomfortable looking for aliens rather than bombing the entire campaign like humans do in the end? Why does the predator abandon more and more his few weapons rather than collect them to keep them together after using one? In the end, he even drops his armor before fighting the Predalian melee: what bad plagiarism of the first final fight between Arny and the Predator. The actions of the predator are so exaggerated that he moves more like a Japanese sumo than a highly skilled extraterrestrial safari hunter. As can be seen immediately, the whole story is messy. But it gets even worse because this botched job is filled with boring mixtures of senseless interludes, like a long episode of pizza ordering or detailed information about the two brothers' criminal past (Dallas and Ricky). The sheriff is of course the friend of these two criminals whom he regularly puts behind bars. (not convincing and absolutely superfluous for the plot). <br /> <br /> In addition, the casting of actors is horrible. Compared to the high class of directors and actors of the old Aliens or Predator films, AvP2 is an embarrassing shit. <br /> <br /> Finally, the action of the film is really mediocre. There is not a single action fight scene in which the audience can see the whole thing. Each fight is filmed in short bursts and shaking with a close zoom at dusk. This results in an excruciating experience for the public, as one can usually only see a dark and shaky screen. <br /> <br /> I suggest to the two brothers Strause filmmakers to buy themselves a camera and follow a lesson of modern CG so that the next film contains visible actions of visible characters and may not need to hide their poor leadership abilities in this way. <br /> <br /> I would advise anyone (even AvP enthusiasts) to watch this movie: I prefer the original Aliens or the original Predator films, but do not be disappointed in losing your precious time on this failure.
