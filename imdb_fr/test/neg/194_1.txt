This film is an insult to the room on which it rests. Claude's character has been distorted beyond recognition, leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot. Shame, shame, shame. They also cut many of the original score to change the context in which the songs are sung. This distorts the film's air and causes the viewer to be aware of the seriousness of the situation while the scriptwriter of this play gives Hud a wife, transforms Sheila into a rich and spoiled girl, characterizes Claude as a cowboy and kills Burger. by sending it to Vietnam instead. If you do not know the original plot, I assure you it's not a bad movie, but if you want to see the original or if you are, like me, a fan of the classic game, you'd better avoid the movie altogether. We really have to stick to one or the other.
