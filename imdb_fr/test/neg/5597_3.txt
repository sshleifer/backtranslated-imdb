After seeing the film in one of my classes and talking with the filmmaker, I discovered exactly why the film had bombed that way. The creators of the movie had no intention of calling the movie "8MM 2." Originally, the film was called "The Velvet Side of Hell" but was modified at the last minute by Sony Pictures in 8MM 2 without leaving the filmmakers their say. By doing this, he took them out of theatrical releases and dedicated them to a video output with minimal advertising. <br /> <br /> Say what is the truth and what is the hype. <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie as "Velvet Side of Hell", it's not that bad. It's not great, but it's not awful. It would simply be a B-movie that likes to show breasts. But as a result of "8MM", the film fails terribly.
