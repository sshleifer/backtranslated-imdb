J.S. Cardone directed in 1982 a small video "Nasty" little known, called "The Slayer" and since then he has participated in a handful of feature films; including the 2001 vampire garbage film The Forsaken. His latest feature film, Wicked Little Things, claims a decent storyline and a scary poster that I remember was surfaced a few years ago in connection with a film that Tobe Hooper was supposed to make. Well, I guess he felt that this one looked too much like his stupid zombie mushroom movie "Mortuary" and that he therefore rejected this one. I do not blame him for that either. The plot concerns a mother and her two daughters who settle in an old mountain house that belonged to her late husband. However, they do not realize that about a hundred years ago; a group of children used as miners were trapped in a mine shaft. Naturally, this is not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now roam the area in search of revenge ?? <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a collection of clich√©s; the youngest child with an "imaginary friend", the mother who rejects him and all the usual zombies. J.S. Cardone tries to rally horror fans to shocks and bloody scenes (mainly involving children), but that is not enough. The story does not go very well either and it really reminded me of the previous morgue, and it's not a good thing (although Mortuary is actually a better movie than this one). The acting game is not written at home; Lori Heuring is decent, as is her eldest daughter, Scout Taylor-Compton; but neither manages to provide an interesting performance. Chloe Moretz is slightly better than the usual actor child. The plot has little credibility and the scenario does not even have to explain the reasons why the children are attacking the premises. It all comes down to a typical and rather dull end and, overall, I must say that if you know your horror movies, then you can feel free to skip this one!
