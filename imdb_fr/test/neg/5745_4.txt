Slayer is a brainless vampire movie with some twists on an old plot. A special operations team is sent to South America to track down blood-sucking natives. Their leader is a real old man who has aged well. Vampires attack villages because their rain forest and old wild animals are disappearing because of greedy societies and farmers. Lost in fights and blood, they never bothered to wash the cast for the whole movie. It looks like they slept in bloody clothes and were covered with blood. Although each member of the cast brought his own talents, not everything was made like a movie. The effects were OK, with the exception of vampires hanging from buildings on wires. If you are looking for a lot of blood and violence, this is for you.
