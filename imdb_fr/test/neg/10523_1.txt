OK, we were following the stereotype of the bad orphanage and explaining to our son, adopted in Russia, that it was an exaggerated comedy and dramatization, so that we could play with the dog (since he plays soccer). But the last scene, in which the dog found his original owner, put my son on the brink and he cried for 15 to 20 minutes. "He has been replaced !!!!" This of an elementary child. I do not recommend this movie to a family who has an adopted child. it does not really display adoption, orphanages, and adults - and ultimately, even if they win the game - the dog the boy has tied with must leave - and that's too much. PLEASE be wary of adopted children and families with biological children, as the impression that adopted children are not positive and represents an unhealthy and unpleasant stereotype. (The dog is cute, but not enough to save our family's reaction to this movie ....)
