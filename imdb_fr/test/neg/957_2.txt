POSSIBLE SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan. I could not wait to see them together, to be married and all, I wanted to see their chemistry on the screen. That being said, I guess the fact that they are actors, their off-screen relationship does not have to imbue their performance, especially with this scenario. <br /> <br /> How can a teacher be so sticky? himself to anyone. I do not remember the original, but I can only assume that O'Brien was probably handcuffed to his main wife, probably more inevitably. If I were "bound" to someone, I would be quite angry. The crush I would have had would have dissipated quickly. Meg did not show even a little annoyance, only a slight surprise. Dennis should kick me and scream. This whole section of the movie was so horrible - especially that Meg had to go to the bathroom (# 2) between the dumpsters in the dark at night. Ewww. No way! <br /> <br /> What is Dennis blocking every suspect in the movie? Sock first asks questions later. Not once, not twice, but too many times - I could have counted if I had been so inclined. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the movie was Nick and his family drama. Too bad it could not have become more of the plot. The supposed off-screen drama that led to this tragedy. I think it could have been written without distracting from Dex's quest. <br /> <br /> My author is responsible for this scenario. Unless the director and others have treated him so badly that it is unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> I will not even go into the real reasons why poor Dex was murdered. It's ridiculous! Even when Dex faced the real killer and the reason was explained (everyone was in the movies), everyone on the screen seemed bored. Oh, ____ has arrived. Oh. (yawn) "Dex even says it's a silly reason for a triple murder, oh the tension, you could cut it with a spoon. <br /> <br /> If someone other than Dennis had been in this movie, I have to give him 1/2 star (only because I really saw worse), but in this case 1 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> For Dennis and Meg stars, see OTHER.
