This film would be a great piece of history if it was actually a film about Kennedy's assassination. There are far too many errors in this film for me to report. It's a movie about Kennedy's assassination, but many of the important facts have been changed. It lacks scenes, and many scenes, once the president's limousine has passed the panel, do not fit. Both Kennedys move much more slowly than the other four in front of them. The next time you watch this movie, look for things that do not complement each other, like the Texas governor and his family, as well as the SS at the front, soar, but you can see that the limousine is not stop or slow down, in fact, it is accelerating. This film is clearly an attempt at concealment.
