Remarkable only as an actress debut for future Hollywood star star Sandra Bullock, this ridiculous action movie is so full of holes that one could easily suspect a termite infestation. The scenario is incomprehensible and very badly thought. Production values ​​cheese. In fact, a total LACK of production values ​​would have been better ... at least, the film might have seemed harder in this way. ADR is ridiculously bad and ubiquitous in the movie. One wonders if ALL the dialogues of the shooting were used. <br /> <br /> The performances are mostly horrible, with a few exceptions. In these exceptions, however, the performances are undermined by the fact that the director obviously gave the actors a mediocre direction and sometimes made them completely false. (ie passive or panicky characters in the blink of an eye, wrong direction.) In addition, the "sound effects of the weapon" (magazine loading, slide editing, etc.) are constantly overused and, most often, totally out of sync with on-screen actions. Add to that a "Bad Guy" vocal distortion for the main villain (mainly so that you KNOW that he is the villain in this incomprehensible clutter of a movie), and you have a recipe for disaster. <br /> <br /> The situations in the film go well beyond the usual "suspension of disbelief" and become downright ludicrous. One of the main characters spends much of the film attached to a chair before DECIDING to use the butterfly knife tucked into his sock to free himself. So my questions are ... why did not he do it earlier, and why does he even have the butterfly knife. It was not searched? RIGHT. This is one of a hundred examples of completely ridiculous situations that have somehow been crammed into this 90-minute package. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Hangmen" plays the role of an intolerably bad television movie. 80s Without the success of Sandra Bullock, it would NEVER have ended on DVD. But that's the case, so my only advice is to stay clear. Watching this movie can actually hurt your IQ.
