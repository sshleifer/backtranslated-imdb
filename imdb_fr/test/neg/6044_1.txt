There is so much trouble with this movie. Greico with a girls wig, repairman of the old man scientist, the tough guy Jones who stays with a three-shot shotgun, people spider with sprawling hands and bad teeth, etc. The spider people visible on the screen at one point (the Aliens Cameron technique could have been used) instead chose to dress each spider person ... badly. The good thing about Greico's game is that he blames each syllable for counting the number of words he will have to write in the script. It surprises me that with all the information available on DVD reviews, there are still people like this who make movies. This film could have been worse, how I do not know. Oh, and one last thing. I go on a hunt for SCI-FI cinema. The people who run this channel should not be allowed to procreate to continue the existing nepotism in film and television.
