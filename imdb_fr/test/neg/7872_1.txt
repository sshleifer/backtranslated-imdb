I rented this movie when my girlfriend left, hoping to attend a serious military / specialized action. <br /> <br /> After 10 minutes of watching this "movie", I was terrified, horrified and sick of the quality of everything. in this film, I was ready to destroy the rented disc with a flamethrower. Fortunately, I could not find one. I saw a lot of bad movies. But it's not even bad, it's a total waste and it does not even deserve to be considered a movie here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the people who participated in the making of this film. total shame. I hope he wins some Oscars though: D.
