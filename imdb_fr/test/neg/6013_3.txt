This film should be called adventures in Cinemascope. It's as if the screenwriter and the director had taken Cliff's Notes page 3 and decided that it would be a great vehicle for a film about the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is very good here, but the dialogue is nothing like Hemingway. This is a version composed of Hemingway. Hecht, the screenwriter, is a hack. Look at the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. It's a very good cinema, made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very, very good compared to his performance in For whom the ringing sounds where he is stiff as a board and thinks he is in a western. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're a fan of Hemingway, then a favor and do not watch this movie. Your best bet is to get the unabridged audio CD and listen to one of the greatest novels ever written.
