I was surprised that the directors of this film managed to say that this film was a true story. The majority of the scenes seemed to me wrong. For example, when a girl was eating her sandwich and there was a cockroach in it. While she was eating the sandwich, the camera on the opposite side showed that there was a cockroach on it. It's funny to see how the camera films the sandwich when the girl eats it. Another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of it or should I say it was thrown to give it an effect. This movie was not realistic at all. It is highly doubtful whether the events that occurred were true that evening during the "St. Francisville. " I think the house can be haunted, but not the night this movie was shot! The end was fun when Tim and another girl were chained to some sort of basement. Paul and Madison found them and saved them! I'd rather watch the Blair Witch project again, and then go back to watching the St. Francisville Experiment movie. As I said, if the filmmakers did not say it was a true story with real events, I might have liked it more. You'd better get more fun with the Blair Witch project (even if it's not a true story either) !!!
