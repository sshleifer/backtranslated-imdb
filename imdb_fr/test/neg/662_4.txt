I did not know that this movie was produced by "WWE". The fight is pretty lame. Why did they have to defile their name further by making a film as bad as this? I thought it was a complete disappointment. If I had known that this movie was going to be so stupid, I would have stayed home and done something more entertaining. Of course, I will give them credit for cool effects; but the killer did not seem as scary as he could have been. He missed a number of things. But I will let you report them yourself. The plot was a great idea, it could have been done in a much better way. Maybe in the future, WWE will stick to its moronic struggle and stay out of the film industry.
