A spaceship in an unspecified future where human beings are equipped to travel in space and have laser guns for weapons, lands on a young and strange planet where dinosaurs have also evolved by chance and are not extinct. .. for the time being. The survivors of the crash, a dozen bland characters dressed in blue, white and yellow suits, fight for their survival against prehistoric alien monsters. <br /> <br /> "The planet of the dinosaurs" is a singular film. As I said in my summary above, the animated stop-motion dinosaurs of the movie are the only colorful actors. The models are crude, but actually animated. And they are much more fascinating and intriguing than these characters portrayed by inexperienced actors and replicas of a scenario that must have been written overnight without any revision. Obviously, most of the budget has been devoted to dinosaurs and, although they are quite numerous, there is not enough to save us from our boredom. These human characters are only there to scream, run and mumble these poorly written and verbose discourses on survival. And unfortunately, not enough of them are eaten by dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Planet of Dinosaurs" is not a film I plan to revisit. Some people will just love it for being so cheap and so badly made. Sometimes I like movies like this one. But this film is too long, too boring and very tiring.
