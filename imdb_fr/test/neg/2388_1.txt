Four Guys (Jacks) starts the restoration with a fifth type and loses all sense. They allow themselves to be mistreated beyond the textile workers at the turn of the century without simply leaving the situation. It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I just hope to sell this item to someone who might like it. <br /> <br /> It is true that this holds your attention if you can let the illogical developments of the plot do not bother you too much. It's very stupid but especially when a stranger enters the restaurant. Who is he? Guess. <br /> <br />
