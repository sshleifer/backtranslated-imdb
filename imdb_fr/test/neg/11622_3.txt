The plot outline of this movie is similar to the original. Someone gets kidnapped, the prince is incest to save her, Odet turns into a swan, the turtle / frog / puffin first of all the "bad" magician as best as they can and ultimately ... Whatever There is not much new here. With the exception of a lack of well-known vocal talent. Sorry, no Palance nor Cleese and so Jean-Bob was a disappointment.
