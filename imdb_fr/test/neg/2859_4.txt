The revenge of Pinocchio is not a good movie. It's not terrible either. <br /> <br /> The acting was at least wooden on the part of Pinocchio.The puppet had both expressions. Like most actors, except strangely ... the secondary characters ... most of them were nice. <br /> <br /> The special effects of this film are rather "B" and, as I said earlier, the puppet really blew. <br /> <br /> The 2 best scenes of the movie is the knife in hand ... looked pretty good, I think they spent about a third of the budget on it ... and the shower scene ... WOW ... I think they had to spend the other 2/3 of the budget to talk to the actress who did this scene to do it. Exceptional. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a slightly lower "b" horror puppet movie ... praise Chucky if you want to see puppets kill themselves. <br /> <br /> The story had some interesting ideas, enough for me to watch until the end.
