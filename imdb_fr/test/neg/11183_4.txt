Fred Astaire is reinstated with Rita Hayworth a year after their big hit for Columbia, "Will Never Get Rich". This is the film that put Hayworth on the Hollywood map, but his performance in this romantic musical hardly suggests his popularity. Down in Buenos Aires, a tyrannical hotelier demands that his four daughters get married in order of age. We can think that the film takes place in the 18th century, but no, we are in 1942. Astaire is an ex-saboteur become a player who starts dancing again to earn money and who mingles to imitate an admirer of letters. to the beauty of Hayworth's cold stone society. Fred looks at Rita with a fraternal smile, but she looks so much like a model (her lips look like a song, like a mechanical doll with wide-eyed eyes) that all the romantic sparks sputter quickly. However, they dance together very comfortably, and Jerome Kern's score is immutable, but not too bad. ** from ****
