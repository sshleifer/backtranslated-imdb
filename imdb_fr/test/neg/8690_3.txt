I rented this movie, after hearing Chris Gore say something to the effect of "five stars!" on this attack of the show. Well, when I shot the DVD and showed the 3 stages of hell, I had to buy it. Just to see the sight of a mother yelling at her son to drop his other son into a burning pit. <br /> <br /> I was not expecting ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I was expecting at least a summary version of what seemed to be the highlight of this movie. Unfortunately, there was nothing like it. The 3-stage stage of death happens from the beginning, and its descent is rather low. Nothing really happens in this documentary. It was rather crude, sparse and impartial. This is not a bad thing, but there is a narrator in this one. You expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary, but he does not have it. What would have been nice to have a message or a reason for this document. There was no real reason to have a narrator, there should be only one text explaining some of the less obvious scenes. <br /> <br /> This does not really explain the life of these wrestlers either. It shows a few moments of dramatic scenes that seem interesting, but the reality is not as good as it seems. For example, mom watches her son struggle for the first time with light bulbs and bed bugs in a public park. instead of seeing her reaction to the fight, they show it in reaction to the camera, instead of saying an interview later or just watching her reactions. <br /> <br /> According to a Legitamit document, this is not the case. The source material was fragile at first. Nothing really deep or interesting is really happening. No conclusion to some of the most interesting stories, no real point or last thought about wrestling in the backyard, poorly edited together, and his and basically a cheap and failed scam from Beyond the Mat. <br /> <br /> Wrestling wise, it's pretty boring. the best bumps are at the beginning and slowly become less surprising and shocking. If you've ever seen Japanese wrestling, independent wrestling or even Backyard Wrestling DVDs, it will not shock you or leave you indifferent. If you want to fight, do not make the same mistake as me and see this one. Go get CZW ECW or XPW DVDs instead. <br /> <br /> The only thing I get from this documentary is how stupid people can be. Not to support self mutilation or dangerous stunts, but their reasoning for committing these acts. Rear runners seem stupid for the fight. Most of them are unemployed and probably have some problems in mind, and wrestling is a type of therapy for them. That the fans seem even more stupid. The mothers basically think "if you can not beat them, join them" to face the fact that their sons are committing suicide. The school authorities support their students in their dangerous stunts, because it is an alternative to gangs and drugs, which is quite funny since this segment took place in a rural town where people live about thirty kilometers from the other. People are stupid. That's what I extracted from this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the reasoning and the thoughts of someone who wrestles in a fight and what promises on the back of this DVD, get UNSCARRED: The Life of Nick Mondo. It's more amazing and interesting than the backyard and a lot more fun. Oh, and that's really good.
