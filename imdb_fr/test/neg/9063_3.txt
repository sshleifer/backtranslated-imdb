As a serious marathoner, I was seriously disappointed by this movie. His target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon or novice marathoners. After the stories of two new marathon runners, a senior runner, an injured runner and two elites preparing for the Chicago Marathon, the film devotes most of its attention to a novice woman whose story is, for lack of better word. , boring. Although I enjoyed the brief glimpses of Deena Kastor's workouts, the brief history of the Boston Marathon and the marathons in general, let me emphasize: These were briefs !! Watching some Joe Runners prepare for a Saturday with their water bottles and explain how they see the marathon is not inspiring, and the flawless clich√©s about the success and good mood of the runners will make you wish the movie was about a shorter hour. If you are a beginner marathoner, this movie can give you the feeling of "I can do it". For someone else, run away.
