I did some research on Ed Gien and found some interesting things. As the fact that Ed Gien is silent and solitary, it is not a buff that supports the shake as in this film. I will say that I have not finished this film but I will do it. I will forget that all of us Wisconsinans speak as if we were Kentucy. You know the funny, but oh so sad factor in this movie is that Wisconsin is not as appealing as it looked. but it is a complete insult to a man who turned out to be a mad and lonely man. He killed two people and the film did not even succeed. Ed was not so close and personal and did not scare people, he shot the two and only people he killed. So why do these films lie and say "BASED ON TRUE HISTORY"? It's not based on anything but on the lies that the director found in his nauseating head. <br /> <br /> A joke and nothing more! <br /> <br /> OK, I would like to add something to this. I finished this film so sad, and I would personally like to laugh at the director. Do your homework when you make a movie. I would like to inform you that there are no mountains (for those who have never been to Wisconsin) and oh there is no desert! Hell, there were more pines and snow in Ravenous and it was supposed to be shot in Californa. <br /> <br /> OK, for those who do not know anything about Ed Gein, I would like to give you your history lesson. Ed Gein would have killed his family, but this has never been proven. He killed a bartender, she was shot when there was nobody. He brought the DEAD bartender home. Ten years later, he filmed and killed the store clerk, stole the cash register and the truck from the store. He was caught because of this murder, he arrived the day before his son's arrival and asked questions about antifreeze. The day he killed her, he was there to buy the antifreeze, and the receipt that contained only antif ..... was the only evidence they had to start a manhunt in the whole world. He stole graves, in fact he stole 56 graves. He hates the people he has dug up and he made furious; lampshades, sofas, chairs and other things. <br /> <br /> He had a family with whom he had dined once in a while and they had thrown away all the meat he gave them when he was caught, knowing that he had been caught at home . He was arrested and hid in the back of a police car for fear of what could happen to him. How can I know all this? I read the book that the judge who tried it wrote. <br /> <br /> After the end of this film, after watching all this horrible thing, I'm not only offended by the director's horrible view of Wisconsin women's appearance. I mean, it was hard to tell who this guy had half the time on this guy, you know because Wisconsin women are all BLONDES. Please! I am too offended by the lack of homework this guy has done and the poor work he has done in making this film. I do not know who this guy from Kane is and I think he might agree with something else, but he did a horrible job playing Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> After all this, I am so sad to have wasted the 3.99 of the film. <br /> <br /> The film after finishing was completely wrong, this film is as if I say that the world is flat and that George Washington was not our first president. Go people, that's your story, and that's the story of Wisconsin. Finally, how would you feel if I made a film and George Washington looked like Brad Pitt (some of you might think it's good, but it would not be true) and that he lived and n was not the president and no matter. You can not rewrite the story.
