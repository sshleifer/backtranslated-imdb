A friend warned me it was the worst movie he had ever seen. I was curious because it had developed a bit of cult status. I like a lot of indie cult movies so I started. I agree with my friend. It's a pile of smoking manure. I'm sorry for the people who love this film, but I can recommend much better things to you if you want to watch an indie cult movie. Try Dead Alive by Peter Jackson (Braindead), the man at the Dellamorte Dellamore or modern vampires.
