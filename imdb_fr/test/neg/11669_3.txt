Even admitting my absolute love for the first two films in the franchise and sweeping away all the skewed tendencies I might have for Max's character, I simply can not bring myself to evaluate on average that waste of cartoon space who so near the earth what was before her. <br /> <br /> Finished the tough series that made feel the character Mad Max Rockatansky, the feeling of desolation in an apocalyptic world has disappeared, and more crucially, gone is the passion of director George Miller for the franchise. The appalling score is the heart of the cartoon, it seems that the directors do not really know what to do with the amount of cash awarded to make this third installment and, fortunately, the last. Of course, the stunts are on hand {to be expected}, and of course, Miller manages to paint a desert landscape by simply backing what he had done before. Yet, he has clearly struggled for new ideas with action since the coronation of Petrol Tanker's pursuit by The Road Warrior is reproduced here. Only he uses a train instead !! <br /> It's just a very mediocre show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn of events in the mid-1980s; but when you watch the three films together now, Thunderdome presents himself as a director who loses his nervous approach when he is unfortunately caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is that none of these trends would have worked in a singular way, anyway in the context of this series. I give 3/10 to the film only for a real good fight sequence in Thunderdome, while the stuntmen here deserve a credit at a minimum. But this is the third time I try to love this film, and as greedy in punishment as I am without doubt, I will never try again.
