As a victim of the whole Enron scandal, my mother made me watch this movie with her. How many times can I say horrible? The script was so weak, using snapshot after snapshot. It seems that the authors have reconstructed this story with some articles on Enron. Watching the movie, we were able to complete about half the lines and thoughts of the one-dimensional characters. I realize that it would have been adapted from a book, but was the book so bad? I do not know what to say. Simply terrible. The best thing about the movie? Shannon Elizabeth has actually kept her clothes. Other than that, this film becomes a big F.
