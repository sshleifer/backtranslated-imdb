I have seen a lot of horror movies, splashes and monsters in my life. And of course also a lot of monster movies from the '50s and' 60s. The first time I came across this one, I thought it was from the '60s until I recognized it, as of 2007 In fact, the character of Jack Brook is interesting and the acting is more for a splashed movie. Good, but .... I was expecting a splashing film and not a dramatic story about an aggressive twisting thread. The film lasts 80 minutes and I think the first murder takes place after 65 minutes. Although it takes hours to explain the story, the reason the monsters arrive takes at least 3 minutes ... we still have 20 minutes of boring dialogue and finally, in my opinion, a splash sequence not very well managed. Although Robert Englund plays the main role, I recommend this one only true fans of hardcore horror.
