I do not think I've seen a horror movie that bad since ... damn it, I do not think I've ever seen a horror movie that bad. The act of acting alone was enough to make one's head shudder. The bad game goes well beyond the horror movie. It was just horrible. And have you checked these terrible special effects of god? When the demon (who looked more like a cheap puppet) came out of the wall, I could not tell if I was supposed to be scared or laughing at me. As a big fan of the horror genre, this movie was more than slightly disappointing. I could not help but notice that the director was from Portland, OR, which happens to be my own hometown. I must say that I am deeply ashamed. If I could, I would give 500 negatives to this film.
