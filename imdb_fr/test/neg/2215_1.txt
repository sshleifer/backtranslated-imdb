The appearance of Doug McLure in a film is a guarantee of misery. His DG initials look like a special cinematographic certification, which comes somewhere before "U". <br /> <br /> Cushing, on the other hand, seemed to be suffering both from an agent of dilation and from a lack of judgment on the part of him. He did a great job in Hammer films as Dr. Van Helsing. I saw him do a very good Sherlock Holmes in "Hound Of The Baskervilles". And his most famous work was probably Grand Moff Tarkin in the first movie "Star Wars". The only man, except the emperor, who could tell Dark Vadar to "stop bickering" and get away with it. But - crykey! - He made turkeys. There was this lamentable movie 'Daleks' for one. And here is another one. <br /> <br /> There is a machine that has been diverted from Tracy Island. It is a cylinder with a screw at the front and pulling devices on the sides. I am surprised that Jerry Anderson did not sue for plagiarism. Maybe it was bought. Still, if the movie is a guide, they can not have paid much. <br /> <br /> We are in 1976 and we continue to play in latex suits. <br /> <br /> That's about it. Some movies have an entertainment value in the category "Too bad, that's good". This one does not even manage that. He would not even entertain the kids. The "Crash Corrigan" of the 30s is more for its money.
