The premise is interesting and the casting does its best, but the scenario and the effort of the staging are so mediocre that it is not surprising that this film was buried - which is perfectly suited to the scenario. Looking at this, I could not decide what was worse, the scenario or the staging. The actors are on top, the art direction looks like a Disney movie, the music is artificial, and the feeling so sweet that it gives cavities to the audience. It is a bad attempt to imitate "Our weddings and funerals". If you want to watch a comedy as flat as a pancake and the wrong direction can transform a story smoothly, it's a good thing to watch.
