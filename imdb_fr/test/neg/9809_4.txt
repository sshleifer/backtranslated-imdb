Twisted horror movie, which has some good moments here and there, with some scary blood transfusion scenes, but it's just too dull for its own good. All the characters are acceptable and the story has a lot of potential, but the blood transfusion scenes seemed terribly real and, therefore, extremely disturbing. It's well done and well written, and the start was very interesting, but it could not keep pace, and I found the end disappointing. Linnea Quigley has only a small role to play in this role. I was also disappointed, and Stephen Knight did a good job as the lead role because he was rather crooked. Plus, I got it in a set of DVD Horror called A Taste. Of Evil, with a bunch of other horror movies. There is a lot of blood, but it is not so gore, and for its small budget, it was rather well done, however, as I said, it just could not support his interest. It's a pretty twisted horror movie, with some good moments here and there, with some blood transfusion scenes, but it's too boring for its good, I would pass, but I guess it's worth it to watch if you have nothing. do better. The direction is OK. Elly Kenner and Norman Thaddeus Vane are doing a good job here with decent camera work and are doing a good job with their reduced budget, but the pace is too inconsistent for my taste. The game is actually good. Stephen Knight is awesome in the lead, he was scary, twisted, sick and gave a very terrifying performance, the scariest thing about him, although he seemed to be a normal person. Linnea Quigley did well in her small role. Christopher McDonald is fine, I guess his time is short. The rest of the cast is OK too. Overall, I would pass, but I guess it's worth watching if you have absolutely nothing better to do. * 1/2 out of 5
