.... is where I guess this movie came from. I mean, I watched a lot of B movies during my youth, and I would not even say it's a B movie. I remember seeing mass media movies in my high school that surpassed that one. -this. <br /> <br /> So the principle is ... there's a lot of dancing numbers and crappy stuff going on. Women in bikinis, who are not very good at first, dance at first and sing. Guys with hairy chest appear and girls with fangs that are out in the sun. I mean, I can hardly compose a coherent sentence just by thinking about this movie. According to most users on this site, Manos at the hands of fate and Pod People are the worst movies (MST3K Classics :-D) ... I was one of them. Then I saw this movie. I usually do not try to miss a movie, but those who created it really deserve it. It's SO DIFFICULT and DIFFICULT, and I guess the director or a film actor is the only person to score 10.
