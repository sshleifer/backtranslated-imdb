A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing his wolf blood into a quiet, but very tall gardener to prove a hypothesis. Thus, the gardener begins the night stains and the scientist tries to use it to recover his references, but his former colleagues repel him for having altered the nature. Island of Dr. Moreau, Frankenstein and various Wolfman films have combined to form a terribly dated and awkward piece. <br /> <br /> Although the subject is at best pedantic and unoriginal, this film is not too badly realized and interesting to watch as a representative of the horror film making of his time. Like most crazy scientists movies, this is a weak warning against playing with Mother Nature. He does not have the power or the intellectual challenges of Frankenstein, but he never extended his reach anyway. The acting is passable, as is the cinematography, and the film advances in an entertaining video. Some dialogues are quite ridiculous, but hey ... it's just a movie - and a B minus that one. There are also some pretty pictures of a wolf and a bit of humor to prevent the film from being taken too seriously, which is always an advantage for this genre.
