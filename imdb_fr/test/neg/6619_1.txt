I did not really get this movie because I'm not a pervert like you who loves lesbian things. <br /> <br /> The girl with the red wig tries too much to be funny (her lips are so silicone!), but she is really lame and uncertain. She tries to disguise herself as a surfer (it's better than dressing up as a slut, but she's still weird and definitely old-fashioned); the film does not explain why she tries to pretend to be a man. Oh, okay, to "get" the poor stupid girl. I forgot. She's doing all those stupid inventions that are not funny, and she's a really ugly actress. Plus, this look is so OUT! <br /> <br /> This stupid blonde from Melrose Place is playing (surprise) a stupid blonde. <br /> <br /> She thinks the girl with the wig is a guy! They even go out! Ewww! I guess this part was a bit funny.
