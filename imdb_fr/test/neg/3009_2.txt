Most of the films I really like are house art movies and rarely appear on the top ten box office list. That said, I found "Northfork" quite incomprehensible. I do not know what was happening. Stephen Holden, who wrote in the New York Times about a different film, once remarked that some people seemed to think that they could project everything on the screen and make it work like a fairy tale. I thought about it a few times while watching "Northfork". <br /> <br /> On a scale of one to ten, I gave him a two.
