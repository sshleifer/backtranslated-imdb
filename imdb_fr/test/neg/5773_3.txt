Oh dear oh dear I'm really pissed off when a low-budget, goal-less horror story tries to look interesting in the credits by bringing up a group of well-known names in the cast, then involving everyone in the most minuscule roles and the most vile. In this film, we have Richard Lynch in a scene, a momentary appearance of Martin Kove, a short spot for Vernon Welles, a little more time on screen for John Philip Law and some time for Karen Black. This group of random cameos does not do much, even though Richard Lynch and Karen Black only bring up some of the smiles from this film, and it's very painful, no major actor being really good. I could not help but think that if more scenes were filmed with one of the film's veterans, above the film, it would be much better, but as it is, there are just a few glimpses tantalizing a good entertainment without the film actually reaching a lot Entertainment value. Among the main actors, the only charismatic or sympathetic representations in my opinion were Steve Wastell, as well as Axel and his girlfriend who, I believe, was played by Elina Madison (she had never heard of her before, but she has a certain presence on the screen and is a good observer). The conspiracy in this one is simple, a harmful miner and undead attacks on those who seek to steal his gold, and that should allow to have a good time, especially considering that he is directed by John Carl Buechler, who has done special effects for many of them. kinds of films, including having worked on the three big slasher franchises (Halloween, Elm Street and Friday the 13th) and small gems like Mausoleum. Unfortunately, the film is sorely lacking in suspense, sympathy and satisfying gore. I would not say there are a couple of bloody moments, but nothing beats the effort to watch the movie. In fact, aside from the aforementioned cameos, this entire movie is actually pretty flawed and unfathomable, with characters that could not be broadcast fast enough for my taste and an unfortunate lack of real interest. I did not even find it amusing in a bad sense of the movie, which is rare for me, because I like a lot of pretty, shabby movies. I would say, avoid.
