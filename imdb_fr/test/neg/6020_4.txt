EVALUATIONS IN STARS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Danny (Mel Raido) is a solitary factory worker who tries to get by his work and be a good father to his two daughters after a complicated divorce with their mother (Maxine Peake.) But after an altercation with the said girls present in a men's work club, he enjoys a trip in dance class for a glance at Louis (Colin Salmon) and his band of hard men who train in the boxing / weight room / free weights section and train to become a harder person and more assertive. Shortly after, he took Louis's philosophy to heart and joined him as a nightclub doorman as the 1980s faze nightclub set in ... but when partner Sparky (Scott Williams) tries to make a pass in the drug trade, everything turns into a pear shape. <br /> <br /> As Robert De Niro once said in the movie A Bronx Tale "there is no greater tragedy than wasted talent." The writer from Clubbed had a good idea and the talent to turn it into a kind of film ... but without the ability, it seems, to put everything together in a sort of coherent film. <br /> <br /> As a brummie, some filming locations (especially a scene outside the Ring O 'Bells pub in Moseley!) were pretty easy and fun to spot ... but the Dark aspect of cinematography is really disappointing. . Some really mediocre actors, for example lead actor Raido with an indecipherable accent, and a martial scenario with deceiving dialogues are more important issues for the film. More established actors like Peake and even the big favorite of TV, Neil Morressey, are marginalized, while the disastrous villain Raido and Ronnie Fox take center stage. Williams gives the impression of a poor man sick of Trainspotting, leaving Salmon and Shaun Parkes apparently the only remaining performers with absolute integrity, while excessive violence and splattered with blood (become a common trend for British movies!) the top. Really a missed opportunity. **
