I absolutely hated this movie! I was 9 years old when I saw him. It's the only movie I've ever seen coming out to the movies. My mother, my father and I watched each other during the movie and we knew we were wasting our time. This film flew about 45 minutes of my life. Everything was ridiculous. The premise was too distorted. At 9 years old, I always had fun. This film proved that I could not do anything and that I could always entertain myself.
