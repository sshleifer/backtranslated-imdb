My opinion is divided into questions that you should really ask yourself: <br /> <br /> 1. The plants that eat people have been made hundreds of times. It has been used by Nintendo in all areas, from Mario to Zelda via Metroid Prime. It has been used in many low-budget movies of the 50s, tied with the lowest of the Godzilla franchise. And that brings to a whole new level of cheese with talking plants. I do not know anyone who came out, but I know a lot of people who absolutely laughed hysterically during some parts of this film. I was one of them. Does not the kind of horror deserve something a little better than that laughable pile of shit? <br /> <br /> 2. The characters could easily have been copied / pasted from Hostel or Wrong Turn or Wolf Creek or any other film with collages of unlucky children. Yet, this is called "characterize" when the movie takes hours of your time to tell you clich√©s that hundreds of characters have already had? Would not you ever want a movie to have characters that were not just pieces of meat with forgotten thighs? <br /> <br /> 3. It was not bloody. A guy cuts his skin. Oh my! (No.) A guy breaks his legs. Oh my! Gasp! (No.) I showed movies like this to my mother who hates everything about horror because it makes her sick. She then said, "I have seen PG movies worse than that! Why is it rated R?" So why was he ranked R? <br /> <br /> 4. Here is the only conspiracy that the film / book has: Collage kids drink, have sex, get naked, cruse, bleed, and eventually die. This is perhaps the most typical example of a cheap and unthinking horror movie, but people call it "mature"? That the. . . <br /> <br /> 5. I do not think I've ever seen anything less original than the one I saw in A Beautiful Mind. <br /> <br /> You've never dreamed that the horror genre, easily the most diverse genre, would do anything. . . well, diverse? Something really original? <br /> <br /> I just want more horror movies to have real horror, not just cheap collage nights filmed with some splattering of fake bloodshed. <br /> <br /> 1 / ten
