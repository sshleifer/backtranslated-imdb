I really should have known about this movie before renting it. It was one of those movies where we keep looking, thinking it must be better. Then when that ends, you feel stupid that you have lost precious time in your life that you will never be able to recover. Ice-T did his nasty thing and, well, that was the highlight of the evening. The images of the shuttle seem to have been made with a small toy in a box and the scenes of exit in the space were funny because one could see the strings attached to the combinations. The scenario was missing and the scene of the car chase with the bleeding and losing guy was unbelievable because he drove better than I could have one of my best days. Overall, I have seen worse, but it's certainly not a choice I would recommend or would not want to forget.
