I woke up and it was a beautiful day; the sun was shining, the birds were singing and I wanted to make a movie, something new, a horror movie maybe? Like many other commentators, I came across what can only be described as a piece of poo in a golden envelope. The cover of the cover is excellent and the comment on the back is hypnotic - "it will scare you." Oh, how I laugh at watching this naivety and ignorance. <br /> <br /> One of the many scariest things that this movie is the acting skills of these "actors". I think, no, I really applauded when they were shattered by these "scarecrows", who wore classic costumes. I was walking fast past the cornfields because I thought they were pretty scary at night, but after watching this movie, I almost got wet (laughing a lot) just in plain view. <br /> <br /> I very honestly saw omelets more scary, but not mine. I'm a cook at home, and if someone associates this movie with my omelette, let's say I would create a situation where they would have to watch this movie 3 times in a row. <br /> <br /> If someone has good movies about corn (without pop culture) that he can recommend, do not hesitate to let me know. It's a great comedy if nothing else, OK it's nothing else. Enjoy it, but a quick tip - before pressing the play button on your DVD player, throw it out the window.
