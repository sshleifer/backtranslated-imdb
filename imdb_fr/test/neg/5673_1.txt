Look, I practically lost all hope in Nickelodeon after watching their new "hit", The Naked Brothers Band show, and "ICarly" is no exception! If you have not noticed, ICarly is now the # 1 hit sitcom on TV! After hearing this, I decided to watch some episodes myself to see what the hype was about! I have a word to describe this show in general ... "EFFORTLESS !!!" I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT DAN SCHNEIDER SHOULD REACH THIS LOW LEVEL AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DIFFERENT !!! IT'S HORRIBLE!!! Let me give you the details ... <br /> <br /> The ICarly distribution starts with a girl named Carly Shay, played by Miranda Cosgrove! Carly, unfortunately throughout the episodes, does not really have a personality so to speak! I guess she's supposed to be the average girl in the series! (Because LOTS of people have an army veteran for a father, an artist for a brother, and a popular teen web show recorded and produced with thousands of dollars of equipment!) And to say the most about Miranda, HIS ACTION IS PATHÉTIC !!! She looks like a 3-year-old girl with Tourette's syndrome who has high sugar levels half the time! <br /> <br /> Then we have Sam Puckett (good god where do they find these names !?) played by Jennette McCurdy! Sam is the "CO-HOST" of Carly's Webcast! (Wait a minute, if Sam hosts the show with Carly, should not the show be called "ICarly and Sam?" Sam is supposed to be the tyrant of the cast! (Yeah, because ALL girls wear shirts and very feminine skin-skin trousers with blonde hair extensions!) I would find it a bit funny, but it's her picture PUNS WHO'S THE RUINE !!! The play on words "Give me a bucket of fried chicken "is too much used !!! GIVE THIS GIRL WRITTEN !!!! and give her a coffee because, make no mistake, Jennette's role is fine, but, throughout half of the episodes, she seems to be about to fall asleep !!! <br /> <br /> Then we have Freddie Benson, played by Nathan Kress Freddie is the technical producer of the Carly and Sam show! There is not much to say about Freddie, other than the fact that he is a techie and has a crush on Carly, which will never work out! core with clichés !!! Does not it stop !!! Nathan's role is also correct, but sometimes seems excessive! It is too boring !!! <br /> <br /> Finally, and my favorite, we have Spencer Shay, played by Jerry Trainor! Let me make it perfectly clear; IF THAT WAS NOT FOR HIM, THIS CLUSTER OF A LIVING ROOM WOULD BE MUD !!! Spencer is the one who keeps the show alive! Spencer is Carly's big brother! If you had a 5 year old boy who was under the influence of both caffeine and constipation, you would have summed up this character! Spencer also earns money as an artist! (Hmmm ... I wonder ...) One would think that a professional artist would make promising sculptures ... yeah, I love sarcasm! HIS ART IS PRETTY MUCH MUCH UTTER !!!! I mean, what kind of sculpture is called "MERRY SNIFFMUS !!?" WHAT!!? IT'S A GREAT CREATIVITY AS A DISCOURSE ON DRUGS HILLARY CLINTON !!!! IT'S STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> THE PARAMETERS OF THE PART-FIELD AND THE MORALE ARE BAGS WITHOUT EFFORT OF POOP !!!! These shows now show kids that stealing, lying and being a jerk of your parents is a good thing !!! IF THE TYPES OF AWPUL CRAPPY SHOW THAT THEY ARE PLAYING ON THESE DAYS, I DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN WATCHING THEM !!!! IT'S THE GREATEST PIECE OF JONGE I've NEVER watched on TV! BAR NONE !!! NICKELODEON, "I AM THROUGH YOU !!!!" END OF THE STORY!!!! 1/10
