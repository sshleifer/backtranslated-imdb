Dull, monotonous characters without development, unimpressive performances by people who sound like they're just reading lines, and ridiculous special effects combine to make it a true flair. The story begins with the Russo commando, eminently gentle, attacking an Al Qaeda training camp. The scene tells us that Al Qaeda has recently come in search of an ultimate weapon and that it also illustrates Russo's unique trait, a tendency to shun teamwork. With the help of a collection of blank slates and traveling stereotypes, including a Russian spy, Russo travels to Chechen territory to catch a mad scientist working for terrorists. Along the way, they encounter vast hordes of carnivorous bats that fly in broad daylight for whatever reason. From there, the film becomes nothing more than a shuffling jumble of ridiculous action, including a scene in which a swarm of bats slice the arm of a soldier!
