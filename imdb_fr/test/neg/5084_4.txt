It may have been exciting for an audience in 1946, but the film is now a bit boring. I had a hard time understanding all this, and it was very predictable: I mean, we know from the beginning of the film that Welles is the Nazi war criminal, and I'll let you guess if he's caught or no. and punished appropriately at the end. <br /> <br /> Not worth watching. It's unfortunate that Welles shot only three worthy movies in his long career: Kane, Ambersons and A Touch of Evil.
