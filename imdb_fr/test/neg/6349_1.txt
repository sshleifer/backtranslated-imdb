Last night, I got bored and decided to watch a movie called 'out kold' that I had bought once with a lot of other cheap movies in a video store. It sounded like a good old action movie, so I pulled out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. Well, the pain started from the beginning. The main character is a boxer who is the nicest guy I have ever seen. As a good person, he must be nice of course, but he is only a cat! This is not appropriate for a boxer who has 28 knockouts and starts working for a pimp to earn extra money. Even good guys can always be cool. Well, his first fight happened while he was working for this pimp. Each punch was clearly missed and it became even more annoying because the sound effect was not synchronized with the punches. Then there is this totally worthless game on the part of the cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is. I gave him a 1 because I have never seen such a bad movie.
