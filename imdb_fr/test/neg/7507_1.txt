Just when you think you've seen the worst sub-genres of zombies, another budding Romero and his team of unskilled buddies come to prove you wrong. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, endured in Death Valley: The revenge of Bloody Bill, remained semi-comatose in The Zombie Diaries and laughed hysterically during Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence, and sincerely thought that the making amateur films could not sink. However, as I have just watched Zombie Planet, a bunch of two-hour incandescent lyrics by writer / director George Bonilla, I think I have found the pinnacle of horrendous zombie movies. <br /> <br /> In this terribly amateurish effort, is part of Mad Max and Dawn of the Dead (but EVERYTHING is bad), Frank Farhat plays the role of TK Kane, a tough fighter who gets kicked in the ass zombie for a hobby, armed only with knives, a machete, some grenades concussion perceives a very bad glare. <br /> <br /> After a desperately vicious opening sequence in which he confronts a horde of zombies at the shady mine, Kane teams up with a group of survivors who must not only repel the attacks of the undead, but must also appease a gang of vicious thugs who have taken control of the area (by searching for and handing over any valuables they find). <br /> <br /> Of course, Kane is not the kind of man to take the lead of a group of Z-rated post-apocalyptic bullies, and he's committed to teaching the bad guys a lesson (mostly glaring at them), only stopping to save their zombie friends periodically. <br /> <br /> Presenting awful actions by almost everyone involved, a terrifying scenario, laughable effects, and poor-quality production values, there is virtually nothing in this film that is worth the effort. to be watched. To be honest, I really like the basic premise that zombies are the unexpected result of a very popular slimming drug that blocks carbohydrate cravings (it's learned when a character conveniently explains the story of Kane, who Strangely no idea what has happened), but that's pretty much the only vaguely interesting aspect of all production. <br /> <br /> I have a certain respect for anyone who manages to finance and make his own film, but when the results are that poor, this respect is lost when they decide to make it accessible to the public. I would have kept this one in secret if I had done it.
