Honestly, one of the worst movies I have ever seen, written, directed and played. Seemed to be a movie made for television. And a bad one to that. I can not believe that people always engage Danny Huston after seeing it in this movie, or that they always allow John Sayles to make movies. My husband and I came across this movie on TV one night and we were so bored that we ended up cleaning the house while it was on. . . and it still bothered us! That made me think that the critics had been so gullible with Sayles' previous films, such as Lone Star, which was all the rage at the time but did not bring much in the end. Spend your time on something better. Whatever.
