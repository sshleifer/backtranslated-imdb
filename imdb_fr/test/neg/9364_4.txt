Tonight's film was "The Legend of the Fortress of Suram" and in 87 minutes he managed to quickly jump into the top five most difficult films of all time. It's hard to watch. movies so different from anything you see something totally alien. Here is a brief summary: A group of Georgians are trying to build a fortress to defend themselves from the invaders, but every time they prepare to refine their project, they collapse for no apparent reason. Then they go to see a fortuneteller who tells them that if they want the fortress to stay up, they have to find a young man, a big boy with blue and blue eyes who will be buried in one of the walls during construction and his presence. will ensure that the construction work will be completed smoothly. And of course, in those moments of closure, he is willingly coated with cement and eggs, chuckling while he is buried alive, with only his mother crying. <br /> <br /> The story is rather simple. But the director, Sergo Paradjanov, who worked in Soviet Georgia in 1984, shortly after a 15-year prison sentence, does not follow any of the shooting rules we are used to. There are very few close-ups. Very often, the action we must follow is hidden in the lower left corner of a landscape shot, extremely easy to miss. There are very few close ups and sometimes it's hard to say who does what to whom and why. From time to time, the film launches into digressions that have no relevance to the main plot and usually serve to baffle the viewer. The music is completely crazy, with sounds found, instruments on the screen and church organs apparently falling at random. In moments when nothing seems to be happening, someone breaks into a template, playing almost until the next scene appears. But there is an obvious cinematographic voice behind all this, so you have to try to understand the message, whatever it is. One of those times your eyes are stuck on the screen just because you can not believe what you see.
