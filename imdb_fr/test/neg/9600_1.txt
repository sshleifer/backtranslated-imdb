I am a lover of bad movies. I own "R.O.T.O.R." and "Boa vs. Python" and I work to develop my collection with titles as great as "Troll 2" and "What's up Superdoc?" But "Storm Trooper" is not even serious enough to be on the terribly terrible movie list. It's just bad. The guy who said he had a better dialogue with his potted plants is right. Everything in this movie is stupid. When the robot gets into the car, it almost seems like he knows it's going to explode, there was no reason he would run in that direction. "Judge, jury and executioner", "The perfect policeman ... but they have gone too far", I mean, why do people bother to make these films? ROTOR. because it is hysterically horrible, but Storm Trooper is just a mess of cinema because it is not even serious enough to be as bad as it is worth watching. It belongs to someone's personal movie collection, something he can be proud of, but that's it. I'm sure it was on an HBO channel (with only one star, that's why I watched it) because it was not there. Even if you like bad movies, do not watch this movie. It is shameful.
