What a terrible movie it was! I did it about 50 minutes and I started skipping chapters until the end. The plot is nothing special, and the movie's dialogue deviates so much from the main story that your head will explode with rage. Many unnecessary minutes were lost while listening to characters telling stories unrelated to the plot, and / or something that could be said more quickly. The camera work is fragile and grainy. It seemed that Mr. Milligan had to remove his finger from the zoom button! I also noticed that at times in this film, it seemed that Andy had epileptic seizures and that he was going to shake the camera uncontrollably. The splices between scenes were nervous and did not flow. The scenes of murder were nothing special - incredibly, and ridiculously wrong. Barely a gore, as the title suggests. This film lasts approximately 1 hour 20 minutes and the scenes of murder take about 1 minute. TOTAL of the entire movie - if that happens. What a miserable junk this movie was. Andy Milligan is probably one of the worst directors to ransack humanity with his talentless staging and camera work. Usually, I can go through very bad horror movies and laugh at them later. BLOODTHIRSTY BUTCHERS, however, I can not. I'm just angry for losing an hour and a half of my life watching this (which I would not do to get it back). Take my suggestion, and do not see this movie unless you plan to fall asleep. TERRIBLE.
