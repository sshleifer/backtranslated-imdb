Bone Eater is located in a small desert town in Alabama, where real estate developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is funding the construction of a huge resort. Late in the night, three of his employees, Riley (Timothy Starks), Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) and Miller (Paul Rae) dig foundations in the desert when they discover what looks like a tomahawk ax. Unfortunately for them, a former Native American demon called the Bone Eater arrives and kills them. Local sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) soon lets Krantz breathe by the throat as the construction of his resort stops, sheriff Evans must also face the bone-eating demon, as he kills all those he You know, I consider myself a pretty big fan of the horror and science fiction genre, I certainly do not think my opinion is worth more than anyone (unlike many others here, on the IMDb ...), but please believe me when I say that Bone Eater is the worst creature movie I've ever seen on the Sci-Fi channel and it's bumping into a damn competition. As a horror and sci-fi fan, there are two names that, when involved in a movie, make me shudder in the hope of seeing how bad it will go, these names are those of Jesus "I have no talent", Franco who had nothing to do with Bone Eater & Jim Wynorski who led the absolute disaster that is Bone Eater. In fact, Bone Eater is so bad that Wynorski hid under the pseudonym Bob Robertson, when a director as bad as Wynorski hides under a pseudonym, you know that the film must be bad. Where do I even start? Bone Eater is simply the worst movie I've seen this year and it's so bad that it's wrong, the story is horrible, the script is sloppy (at one point, Sheriff Evans told Kia to meet him at the hospital, but when they would meet later, he surprised acts and said "what are you doing here?", at one point, sheriff Evans triumphantly asserts that we are in the twentieth century and that the elders Amerindian demons are nonsense although we are actually in the twenty-first century A woman tells in flashback the story of three men who wake up the bone eater and he kills them, but since he killed them all three , how did anyone else know it to be transmitted in the legend?) a little embarrassing. The characters are horrible shots, the sheriff of the small town that saves the day, his daughter gets involved, which adds a personal motivation. As for the Amerindians, there is an old sage, a young man with a hot head who hates the "white man" and a young woman. which is the voice of reason between the two who have names like Storm Cloud & Black Hawk. The film is as boring as nothing, nothing happens, the story is horrible, it is full of holes in plot and flaws in all logic, the sets are terrible, there is no horror or gore No suspense or mystery and Bone Eater is just the kind of movie that makes you lose the urge to live. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater has some of the worst CGI computer effects I have ever seen, the moving bone-eating creature that looks like it's just a selection of bones together like magic on a motorcycle that crosses a big gap between a hideous CGI truck collapsing at the edge of a cliff and turning into a truck thrown aside by the bone eater. Whenever the bone eater needs to accelerate, he causes the formation of a big horse from sand, dust and rides! In principle, it's a pretty cool idea, but it's awful and the scenes even have cowboy music! There's a useless scene in the end when sheriff Evans cuts his arm (why?) And bleeds, but other than that, there's not a single drop of blood in the thing, every time the bone eater kills someone in which he usually disappears a cloud of dust, boring. The hilarious climatic confrontation between Sheriff Evans and the bone eater is to be believed, Sheriff Evans becomes a native on horseback with tribal war paintings on his face while the bone eater also rides on his dust horse and they have a sort of Contest game that is just too bad to describe correctly. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 700,000, Bone Eater is filmed in a very bland, forgettable and unadorned way, there is no sense of style here. The majority of the film takes place in the light of the sun and if you watch it on TV, the landscape of the desert is quite beautiful on occasion. There are several "known" veteran actors who really quibble here, Boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in the movie "Creature Feature" Snakehead Terror (2004), much better than this one. he is paid while the former Star Trek man, Walter Koenig, must be really desperate to agree to appear in this film. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater is a really awful 'creature device', there is not much to say about it. other than to get away from it. The worst film ever on the Sci-Fi channel and it says something, does not it?
