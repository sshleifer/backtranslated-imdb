A better film could have been made to describe the tragedy of Bosnia. Some parts are very effective and the film gives a good idea of ​​the suffering of people, especially children, but overall, it looks less like a movie than a documentary. Woody Harrelson is very good but the rest of the cast performed well without being extra ordinary. Should be monitored to get a rough idea of ​​what the war has done to Bosnian children. If we expect a great and captivating film, Welcome ...... will be a disappointment.
