DeCoteau must be one of the worst "directors" of all genres, and it has nothing to do with his films that usually contain heroism and force guys into matching underpants. Remember that anyone wearing tight black underwear is satanic and evil and wants to suck your blood / soul ... such deep symbolism here). I just sat through The Sisterhood to give him his frills, I try to watch all the horror movies I can and this one had Barbara (FROM BEYOND, RE-ANIMATOR) Crampton (I had already been sucked into the world of DeCoteau Thanks to Linnea Quigley, Adrienne Barbeau and several other actresses I like). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about The Sisterhood ... As the other reviewer has said, the supposed plot involves lesbian vampires on a college campus. . But never a parade of hot girls ("actresses" if you wish) that runs wearing bras, panties and bikinis has been so boring. The film has no plot, no gore, no nudity and the dialogue is ridiculous and seems to have been invented as and when. Parts are idle and repeated several times to increase the duration. About ten minutes of it are composed of characters walking around the campus (oh, excitement!) And more like a resort than any college I've been to. And the acting is the absolute worst. The only thing these girls do well is to lean forward and bend down to show their bodies. The actors were so devoid of talent that I would be shocked to see one of them being given an unchanged one-day role on Passions. Ditto for guys. Yeah, DeCoteau has locked up more guys in hot underwear in this one too ... guys that should be in a K-Mart brochure instead of trying to act. Do these people have to audition or simply show up in Dave's office and undress? I think the answer is obvious. <br /> <br /> I am ready to give any film a chance if 1.) it is intelligently written, well directed, original and played with skill (or hell, even ambitious and stylish). Or 2.) It is packed with gore, nudity, trashiness and / or it's unintentionally hilarious. David DeCoteau's films do not provide ANY of this and they do it with better than usual production values ​​for live movies. Such a waste! So what's the point, especially with the advent of hard-core and soft-core variety porn, easily accessible to anyone with a computer? I just can not answer that question. <br /> <br /> DeCoteau is a gay horror director and could use his resources to make the genre unique. Instead, it produces a stultifying training without an ounce of talent or intelligence. Ironically, when you think about it, his films are anything but BUT pro-gay. They actually make homosexuality seem out of order, secret and sinister. The gay characters in his movies always try to corrupt, seduce and / or kill the innocent and sexually confused. There is no shading here to make things interesting. The protagonists are naive and rarely prove that they are strong, assertive or confident in their identity. I would understand this plot if Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps or Dr. Laura started making horror movies live, but a homosexual filmmaker proves that he has barely thought about these beef cheese treats.
