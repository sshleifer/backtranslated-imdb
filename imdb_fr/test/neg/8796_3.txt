A single mother, her son and daughter, and their hippie boyfriend camp in the woods. A muscular maniac wielding his yellow ski mask appears. He begins to terrorize and sexually rape the family before he is murdered with a machete. "Wet Wilderness" is loaded with lousy hardcore sex, forced incest and blatant racism. It's as politically incorrect as real XXX rough. The score is stolen from Hitchcock's horror classic "Psycho" and "Jaws". The repetitive nature of the sex scenes squeaks the movie after so much, so the short duration is a blessing. The scenes of violence are quite unpleasant. For example, the hippie girl is stabbed with a machete. his groin and we can see blood on his crotch. 3 out of 10 and it's generous.
