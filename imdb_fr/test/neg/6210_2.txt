Honestly, I have to admit that I'm going to see some stupid movies based on the hype they've generated or are generating right now. This silent feature film by Salman Khan & Govinda is one of those silly movies. Okay, we've all seen "Hitch" perform Will Smith as a doctor on appointments trying to help strange people find the truth. So why would we need to see Salman Khan replay this? That's the $ 64,000 question. In case you're wondering, Govinda plays the job looking for the love of her life (an inaccessible socialite) played by Katrina Kaif. <br /> <br /> Lara Dutta is on hand to sing Eva Mendes from Sallu and the real life love Kaif plays pretty much her character like all the roles you've seen so far, without stretching any actors required . And for almost three and a half hours, we are tortured by the parody of other Bollywood movies and characters, or better still, by the poor performances of previous blockbusters. Rajpal Yadav co-stars. F
