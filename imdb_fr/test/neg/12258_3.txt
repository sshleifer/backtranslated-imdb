It seems to be two movies in one. In the first, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. She wants to help Marjorie Woodworth's romantic life. OK: I had never heard of her either. But she and Pitts are in both parts of this preparation. <br /> <br /> Before we know it, Pitts is no longer Miss {Polly. She is Emmie. I had to rewind to see if I had fallen asleep somewhere. I did not have. She is no longer in a small town but is heading to the honeymoon destination of the title. <br /> <br /> The movie has cute moments. The first part is better, with roles for what appears to be every third-rate actress working in Hollywood at the time. <br /> <br /> And what about Mrs. Woolworth? She looks a bit like Betty Hutton. She looks a little like Marie Wilson. She is pretty, certainly. But she's not an actress. <br /> <br /> Pitts has often been used in very small roles. Here she has the most important role. She's always fun, although this film made me wonder if a little bit of her is not going very far. (As a comedian, when she was a tragic actress in Von Stroheim, the silence flows - "The Wedding March" and greed "are the two I saw - she was brilliant.)
