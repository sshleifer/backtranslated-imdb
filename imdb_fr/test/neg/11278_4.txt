For this film, based on a television show and a serious finale. I thought it was a bad way to end a serious one. 'M * A * S * H ​​Goodbye, goodbye, and Amen' was pretty good, but not this one. If you do not really like the show (like me), skip this movie. <br /> <br /> I was a loyal fan of the Even Stevens series, but the plot was too complicated, and Dave Coulier, man, that guy did not do anything good ... well, never. They should not have used Tim Meadows, he's an excellent actor, but he was too good for the screenplay. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pure cheese. I would give him a 4.5 / 10
