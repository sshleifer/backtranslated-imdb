First of all, the genre of this film is not a comedy, it's more of a drama. <br /> <br /> I had little expectations of the film, and they have not been addressed yet. As some critics point out, there is good music in the movie. But if you want to listen to good music, I suggest to spend some time in front of a recording in concert with Bon Jovi or MÃ¶tley Crue, it will be more quality time. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you want to watch a GOOD movie in this rock genre, I recommend "Almost Famous".
