Although I do not recommend this film, I do not recommend reading this review without first seeing it. Although I did not reveal the end, nor most of the twists, this film would be better seen without any previous information. It is difficult to pin down the main problem of the film Donnie Darko, because there are many to deal with. Richard Kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have gathered enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner rants, pure justifications and a harmless and banal philosophy to inspire twenty dramas featuring teenagers; then crush them in a single two-hour package with a touch of science fiction. The result is deeply painful - for all the wrong reasons. The film tries to guide the audience on winding paths without any symbolic meaning or meaning, to make it understand the one-dimensional characters and especially to hope that it will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unconfirmed ends, concealing it a varnish of CGI effects and neo-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man engaged in therapy, misunderstood by his friends, hostile and dissatisfied with his life in the suburbs. We are supposed to feel that he is smarter than his classmates, although this is sometimes a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of his friends proposes an absurd theory about the Smurfs and Donnie answers with a theory, his friend complains that Donnie behaves "in an intelligent way." Donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of his friend - just more angry. The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his manager's description of his standardized test results as "intimidating"; but given the director's inclination to simply categorize human elements (as the FEAR-LOVE sequence shows), it is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescription drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. In fact, the whole issue of drugs is underestimated and one of the director's first chances of buying back the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all this is the product of his imagination, is relegated to the background, making the film a 100% fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the "science" behind the "fiction" is very fragile. Explanations about time travel are weak and look best like isolated, uninformed hikes. We have the idea that the author of the film once read a book on time travel or a few chapters, without knowing exactly how it worked, but he was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to include it in the film. The scientific part, therefore, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than on the actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing a trip back in time declares that if he continued to talk about the subject he would be returned, no further explanation is necessary). Donnie's relationship with a visitor of the future leads him to commit several evil acts. The justification of these actions is a delicate matter. He's damaging his school, but it's okay because his school does not treat him like a person. His punishment for a scary defender of self-esteem (a bit similar to the character of Tom Cruise in Magnolia) causes the public humiliation of the man. But should the public believe that Donnie is a sort of vengeful angel fighting against ignorance and debauchery? He himself seems to ignore the effects of these acts until after. Apart from these defects, the film is riddled with flat and uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story is set in 1988, just before the Bush / Dukakis elections, and the director tackles this point during the film. However, the focus is exactly that: Donnie's father, gruff blue-collar workers, votes for Bush, while his free and rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. Nothing even remotely resembles a political declaration here; simply a statement of the obvious. The first ones are not necessary to make a good film, but the last ones must be left aside. Similarly, Donnie's sincere speech about not being able to group all human emotions into the bland categories of "fear and" love "does not require the public to make big leaps in understanding Everyone knows that there are more than two Mr. Kelly pays tribute to several symbols of the pop culture of the 80s in his film: ET, Stephen King, The Smurfs, Back to the Future At the heart of this film, it looks like the director pays homage to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, heroes and personal adversaries, assertions and disillusions, roughly assembled by inexperienced hands. "Whole songs are played as a video clip using actions of the characters, apparently because the director likes the songs The characters who have little or no connection to the plot (including the tyrannical archetype, the fat girl and the idiot teacher on the right) re WHERE MEMBER unnecessary attention, because the director really wanted to integrate. in a way. Donnie Darko wonders if Mr. Kelly still has enough ideas in mind to make another movie or wasted all his creativity in a useless, cluttered and sinuous effort. <br /> <br /> My note: 1/10.
