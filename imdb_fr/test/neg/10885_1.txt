The only good thing about this movie is that I now have a movie on the worst list of all time. Rest Stop being on the end of the spectrum where I can compare all the terrible movies. Really, this movie is the worst plot, the least realized, throughout the movie, all I wanted was to cut my hair and kick the writer and all those who made possible the ass of this movie. I am a deployed soldier and I spend my precious time watching movies like this one. These people should feel terrible, they had to look at it before it appeared, and they had to be too crazy to laze, after noticing that it was fearing. I am so surprised that our great country lets them do another. Honestly, this is the first time I comment a film, I had to let the world know, not to waste their time. Remove this movie from the face of this planet. That makes us human beings lingering.
