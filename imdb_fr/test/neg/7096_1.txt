When I saw this movie, I think I was a freshman in high school and I still want to load Master P for about an hour and 20 minutes, which he took in my life so that I never come back. <br /> <br /> The guy who has already posted is absolutely right. Master P is a budding gangster. Like all the other rappers in this country, he sold rap CDs to impressionable young white kids. Everyone knows that the crowd is not a black thing and blacks are not allowed to be part of it. As unfair as it may be, rappers can not handle. This movie describes Master P as a gangster named Nino? The script is terrible with the acting game to match. Completely unbelievable. While searching, I found a link or something that said he intended to make another movie called "The Black Sopranos" !!!! <br /> <br /> Please inform us and stick to Nickalodeon. You are not a white gangster, not even a good actor, Master P, please stick to your music for those who listen to it these days ...
