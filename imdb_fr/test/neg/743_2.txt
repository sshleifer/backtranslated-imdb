What a terrible adaptation. The worst was the music. Muzak saxophone and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800s ?????? The only character that does not bother me to sleep is Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and I love Jane Austen's films. I did not even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I do not quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss in the end while throughout the film, they had no chemistry or indication that they care about each other. Isabella and her brother were well exaggerated; It was no secret to me immediately, she and her brother were the "bad guys" and some of the excitement of Jane Austen's movies is the discovery that the one you think is good is not. It's probably on my list of the ten worst films I've seen.
