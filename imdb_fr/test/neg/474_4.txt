I appreciate B movies. I think Bruce Campbell is a very observable actor. I love how he delivers his lines. 'Evil Dead 2 and' Army of Darkness' were great movies. I liked 'Running Time'. However, I do not know if I will watch this movie again ... and I bought it. Now, having said that, I bet that commentary tracks and special features are worth watching! This movie has too many holes for me to enjoy, even as a cheap movie. First of all, Ted Raimi was annoying, he was just annoying. Nothing in his misinterpreted / poorly written character has been better done a thousand times before. The staging was unfortunately mediocre and the choice of some shots ... yuck. I do not expect Woody Allen or James Cameron to be here, but Campbell did not deliver the goods. <br /> <br /> I did not buy this, thinking it would be an Oscar-winning Annie Hall movie, but I'm still "I'm disappointed." would have been happy with 'Mallrats' or 'The Rhino Brothers' I have a lot less At the end of the film, no scene appeared to me, no dialogue has resonated in me Even 'Hostel' had a line classic for the pete sake! I do not recommend this movie.
