this show is just horrible. I loved watching Drake and Josh, which was great, and before that, Amanda's show, so funny, but it's just AWFUL. in my opinion, watching it looked like watching these movies --- Seltzberg, painful and ruthless. it's about 3 idiots @ $$ kids doing a shitty web show (as he steals the hole) while their belated brother makes sculptures (he has no life). the casting is shit, Megan Drake and Josh is Carly (AHHHHHH!) A naughty baby! Sam and a kid they took out of the street play fred. Everything I saw (ugg) consisted of random "jokes" including the brother making a clay movie, he also played an arcade game called PAC-rat (genius), Sam and Carly being delayed in their online show, and Fred to be a dork. the only episode a saw (I can not remember the title) where Fred had a bad luck in not planning an email. I find videos on youtube more fun than this junk. and why the hell do they get youtube jack @ $$ fred, force AVGN to cancel the show with his little mouth. Skip this show.
