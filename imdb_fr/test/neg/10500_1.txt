I do not normally give a "1" to movies Although I am a critic WITHOUT HEART, I try to find everything that makes the film worth it (that is to say, it is watchable) . The main thing I'm looking for is a consistent plot. If there is only that, I can look at it! Let me start by saying that it does not even deserve to be called a film, but rather a primary school project ... that went terribly wrong! And I saw all the special sci-fi movies that were made. <br /> <br /> Several times, I read professional reviews that said shit like "It played like a movie made for TV ... (etc, etc)" and I did not stop to say "Oh, come on, I wish they thought of a REAL criticism." Well it's worse ... much worse! It's really the worst "thing" I've seen since the end of a film (if I considered it a movie, it would be my new worst movie ever), and I've seen all the films directed by Uwe Boll! This film makes Uwe Boll look like Francis Ford Coppola! :) I would rather watch Jaws the Revenge all day than see her again ... even 5 minutes later ... there was a good scene and it was the END! -P. OK enough to criticize Ron Hall's work, now for serious criticism. <br /> <br /> The script is badly written, the dialogue is delivered in wood, the effects are finer than those of a Power The Rangers parade and do not even launch me on the transitions of zoom-in to the screen (wow). Someone actually looked at this thing, edited it and then said "ok release it"? I would have preferred to burn that release it! In conclusion, all I can say is "God be praised, DVD and VHS players have a stop and eject function!" My advice ... do not rent it, if you do, you will be happy to stop and eject too! :)
