I was expecting a lot more from this movie. The preview looked interesting so I decided to check it out. The bottom line is that "The adventures of Sebastian Cole" had only one decent thing: Adrian Grenier. <br /> <br /> I really like Grenier and I found his performance very enjoyable. The character is well designed, but everything else drifts throughout the duration of the film. Clark Gregg is really good, but I do not think his character has been explained too well. I mean, there is not much to explain; he wants to become a woman. Yet, something was missing. <br /> <br /> The obvious low budget of the movie was nice to see. I appreciated the fact that the film was shot on a screenplay (a bad script) and some actors. It was a good change. <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​the film was actually acceptable, but it has become disappointing to see many scenes that have nothing to do with them. As I said, the screenplay looked promising and I must admit that the destination of director Tod Williams interested me, but it was actually a very slow film with little dialogue. <br /> <br /> "Sebastian" started to look good towards the end, but once again, he fell back into a hole. The acting was generally good, the writing needed work, but the film's budget helped it in the long run. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to someone who would like to watch a quiet movie movie with a strong main character, but other than that, I would stay away. Personally, I would not look at it twice.
