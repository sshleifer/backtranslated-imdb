There are series and films I've seen and I've read IMDb.com critics with whom I disagree and I'm happy to accept there was a discrepancy opinion. <br /> <br /> Reading positively the critics of this filth simply make me think of a grim plot involving employees of the television network having orders to browse the Internet, publishing unconvincing reviews for programs they are themselves responsible. <br /> <br /> How else to explain a criticism of opinion that this show is "sure to become a phenomenon" a full year after it became clear that it will be nothing of the sort? <br /> <br /> I will not lose the words describing this mess, but just say if you like, the wives who emasculate their husbands, the husbands who emasculate their sons, the children who are disrespectful to their parents and who have absolutely no behavior or subtext to legitimize characters that are basically only one-spit automatons who spit, then watch this sh ow. <br /> <br /> However, I have some Seinfeld DVDs to go through. <br /> <br /> Futurama - Canceled. TItus - Canceled. Arrested Development - Canceled. The war at home - renewed. <br /> <br /> No justice.
