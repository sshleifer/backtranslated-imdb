With Al Jolson at the peak of his popularity and the Warner Brothers Jazz Singer having been the most profitable film of 1927, it was inevitable that the other studios would produce some vehicles for their own Jolson characters. But while the jazz singer was a sensation as the first chatter, Idole Matin√©e does not have the sung voice of his star (the now obscure Johnnie Walker) and must be content with his visual antics. <br /> <br /> The Idol of the Morning was one of Frank Capra's first missions. Capra's first two feature films for Harry Langdon reveal an excessively bright style, which made Langdon's already mediocre stick almost unassailable. A few pictures later, Capra has learned to relax a bit, with some fairly regular and decent camera work. However, he still does not show any ability to shoot in physical comedy. The longest comic routine - the performance on stage - seems to have some good gags, but it is divided into several different camera angles and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances. Theoretically, a good part of the jokes are in the headings, but there are too many and none of them is particularly funny. <br /> <br /> Of course, Capra would end up becoming a beautiful dramatic and romantic film. director, and you can see it begin to grow in this regard. He cuts the line, getting closer to Walker and Bessie love in the scene where she poses for the first time the eyes on him in his rising Don Wilson, carefully establishing the silent link that unites them. Then there are some beautiful and tender frames of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade, which is very reminiscent of the love scenes of Capra's production in the early 30s. <br /> <br /> Johnnie Walker, Columbia's answer to Al Jolson, is not an exceptional talent. His comic timing is good but nothing distinguishes him. Bessie Love, on the other hand, is a very good actress with a very expressive face. Congratulations to her for being involved in the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys. There is also a good role for Lionel Belmore, this round and happy actor who seems to make his appearance in almost everything at the end of the 20s and the beginning of the 30s. <br /> <br /> The Morning Idol is the one of those images that gained more than his share of attention thanks to his director who then directed a handful of masterpieces. In itself, it is a very uninteresting piece and, like most of Capra's work before his meeting with Robert Riskin, a disappointment.
