It was obviously the worst movie of all time ... ketchup was the main role in this film and would be the only nominee for a prize. I could have made a better horror movie in my garden in less than two hours with a handheld camera using dummies filled with grass as actors, at least the acting would have been better! Do not waste your time and money with this one ... it's extremely cheesy and horrible !!
