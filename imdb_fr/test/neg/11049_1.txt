This comment is intended primarily to warn people who might be attracted by this title by its high (temporary) ranking, which I find frankly confusing. The reasons why I did not like this title are: <br /> <br /> 1. The director must have had doubts about the possibility of making a Jackie-Chan type film or a dark tragedy Oedipal. As a result, the film is between two stools, because the tragic and comic elements collide and cancel each other rather than forming a harmonious whole. <br /> <br /> 2. The motivations and behaviors of the characters are incoherent and unconvincing. Psychological truth and logic are sorely lacking. <br /> <br /> 3. Absurd casting. I do not blame the actors, because it is difficult to create a convincing character by acting alone, if there is little logic in the scenario. However, why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the two main actors, whose age in the film can not differ by more than 3-4? <br /> <br /> 4. For me, the film was a mediocre entertainment, mainly because of point 2. If you do not find a character with whom you could sympathize, it is difficult to follow the story with interest . When you finally understand the reason for what happened to the main protagonist, it makes no sense. <br /> <br /> 5. In addition to being entertaining, some movies are also stimulating. After watching this film, I began to wonder if the idea that the director was trying to provoke was not that the incestuous relationships could be perfectly healthy and delightful. I can not put any other construction on the end. <br /> <br /> 6. The film is in a state of utterly useless violence. Violence in a movie (and elsewhere) is a good thing if it serves an important and laudable purpose. The goals may be different and I do not want to get into this big topic. Let me say that I do not oppose violence in such films as "Saving Private Ryan", "The Passion of Christ" or "The Pulp Fiction". In "Oldboy" the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic (or sound). Why? I do not know. Personally, I have no satisfaction at looking at teeth extracted with a hammer or hearing a man cut his tongue with scissors, then see him choke with his own blood, etc. etc. <br /> 7. The movie reminds me a bit of the Japanese porn manga in its fixation on incest and panties of Asian girls, urinating and others. It seems that a minority really appreciates this kind of thing. If you are one of these, this movie may seem nice to you. <br /> <br /> In short, I do not recommend this film, nor as entertainment, nor as "food for thought". Where it's not stupid, it's disgusting. Do not waste your time.
