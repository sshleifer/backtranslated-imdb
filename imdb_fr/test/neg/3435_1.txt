Ten years ago, I really wanted to see this film in the cinema. But I missed it, then I forgot it. Oh, I'm glad this movie does not spoil my eyes. At the time, I had seen it yesterday. And seriously, this film must be one of the 10 worst films ever made. And I'm talking about films that have attracted too much attention, like those wonderful TV trailers, and too much money spent on actors and filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and the acting is even worse, should I say more? <br /> <br /> Please, Hollywood, NO MORE ARNOLD !!
