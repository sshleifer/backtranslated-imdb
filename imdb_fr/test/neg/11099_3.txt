The film is apparently based on a popular French horror novel, by Arthur Bernède, dating back to 1927. I had never heard of it before, but Belphegor was a popular topic before for movies and miniseries. The first film was released in 1927, at the same time as the novel. Arthur Bernède was part of a group of writers who simultaneously wrote and produced movies and novels. The character of Belphégor is one of his most famous creations. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time there was Sophie Marceau, a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. She is now back to movies like this one. Nothing wrong with playing in French quality films, since it is his country of origin but this film is only ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The problem is mainly that the film relies on its special effects, to make it good and scary. . Well, horror and special effects have never really been a good combination, with a few exceptions here and there. It's not as if the special effects were bad in this one. Especially for a European film, it's just good, but it's simply misplaced, because the film gave the impression that it could easily have dispensed with its effect. That would have made the movie a better and scary movie, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> The film is neither tense nor attractive to watch, also because the film seems to have difficulty choosing the right approach. Sometimes, the film chooses a light and a little less serious approach, while others clearly try to be a good scary horror movie. This is mainly the reason why the movie does not work at any level. You can say that the movie is even a bit boring. Moreover, everything gets worse more and more towards the end. After a while, you stop worrying about this movie and its story and you start to wish that you decided to look at something else instead. <br /> <br /> The editing seems totally unacceptable. He uses cuts too fast, without a lot of style, while the editing was obviously intended to give the film a good modern style. Moreover, the chronology is sometimes simply disturbed, as if some sequences had been edited in the wrong order. <br /> <br /> The music score is also very boring and sometimes does not even seem to match the film, as if everything had been scored before the filming ended. I can not believe that composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar-nominated composer. The score is almost as boring as the sound effects of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with many characters, which you can not interest you. It also seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau will fall for a man like Frédéric Diefenthal. The film also features Julie Christie, which is nice but does not add much to the movie. <br /> <br /> A horrible eve. <br /> <br /> 3/10
