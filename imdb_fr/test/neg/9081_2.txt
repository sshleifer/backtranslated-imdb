Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS? An edition presents Charles Bronson (Robbie Coltrane) interviewed about his new movie GLC: <br /> <br /> "This is a man, an ordinary man whose wife and family are wiped out by goosebumps and I have to chase them and kill them sadistically and graphically "<br /> <br />" And after GLC, what will he do next for Bronson? "<br /> > "We are taking a new angle, my family is not being wiped out, but I am looking after goose bumps" <br /> <br /> This accurately describes THE BAD THAT MEN DO. It's a crime thriller Bronson whose motivation does not stem from a blood war, but whose credibility is put to the test. <br /> <br /> Bronson is a retired hit-man who never abandons his retirement for anything until someone shows him a videotape featuring interviews of the victims of "The Doctor", not the legendary time traveler, but an infamous expert on torture. It never really explains why the Doctor is so infamous, no police state with a myriad of sadists and why the Doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accents. <br /> <br /> As you can guess, is a lazy writing film and incidents happen because the screenwriter needs something to happen to advance the plot, as unlikely as any of the villains is invited to a trio so that he can be killed or that things are revealed, as the Doctor's sister being a T & A lesbian can be included <br /> <br /> In many ways, it's like one of those nasty Chuck Norris vehicles coming out in At the same time, but most disappointing is that the director is also the same man who made ICE COLD IN ALEX and THE GUNS OF NAVERONE are two highly regarded war dramas, often aired on Sunday afternoons. Believe me, this movie will not be shown until the turning point
