This movie was terrible. I thought it would go but it got worse. From the starting scenes, he seems to be heading for another predictable and safe rom-com, but as soon as he gets home, he disintegrates. None of the characters has depth and the only person who was almost credible was Tom, although the way he became so easily distracted bores me just after a moment. The dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film almost completely non-existent. In an insulting comedy attempt, the screenwriter / director introduces a character or event in virtually every scene, none of which is realistic, making it very difficult to keep track of what is happening. The plot is hardly an excuse for a movie: a guy loves a girl, the house is sitting at the father's house to get to know a girl, destroy a house, get a girl. A complete loss of time.
