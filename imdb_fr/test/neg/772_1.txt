Sideshow is a good example of a fundamentally interesting idea that went really bad. As for horror movies, and especially with the massive influx of teen movies, a movie based on a group of teenagers attending a mysterious freak show is something you could enjoy a lot with. <br /> <br /> However, the writer has decided to make a very simple, very boring and very simple story about five teenagers who are part of the show when the enraged Father Graves turns them into monsters using a pathetic machine that turns them into animals. <br /> <br /> The five teenagers are eliminated one by one until only the last guy remains. His "punishment" is not being able to join his friends and thus to "stay alone". What a pile of garbage! <br /> <br /> The "actors" are really poor, this movie has no comedy (and it could have been so funny!), no gore (and it could have been so gore!), not action and no horror (and there could have been so many things at once!) <br /> <br /> The director has failed in his duty to even try to make it a little interesting to watch . His experience in soft-core obviously prevented any creativity he might have had, as all shots are identical, with very little modification and little movement. The overall quality is mediocre. <br /> <br /> In movies, nudity does not usually reign, but believe me, the only highlight of this film was a pair of breasts.
