Am I the only one who thinks the entire US Forensic Science and Scenes Of Crime community must hate this huge slap in the face. A rookie police officer goes to a crime scene for the first time and her response is so slow that she has time to send the kid who found the body at the local store to buy a disposable camera. By the time he comes back (still no policeman, SOCO or any other help for the pretty Jolie - it's New York, is not it?), It started raining and she gets to work by photographing the evidence , after getting up in front of an Amtrak to stop him from disturbing the scene. <br /> <br /> I want to know the name of this camera, because the photos were so incredibly detailed that no zoom was made that distorted the images !! The horror continues: - not in the film itself (I am afraid very ordinary), but in the character of Lincoln Rhyme played by Mr. Washington. This man is a forensic science examiner with many years of experience. Instead of highly skilled but invisible local examiners, he assigns the work to an untrained police officer, a rookie police officer, who looks for clues and moves them before photographing them, thereby contaminating each element and making the profiling of DNA nearly impossible. Now it was a brilliant idea, huh? I know that we should be able to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, but those who say that this film is intelligent must have completely cleared their ability to think for this film to be credible. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 4/10 for the superb role of Denzel Washington and for the lips of Miss Jolie, which are the only elements that require my disbelief to be suspended!
