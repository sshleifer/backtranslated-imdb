It's one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. The acting game was so bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a pretty good actor, but in this film, he sounded as if he was reading his text on a piece of paper. Especially his voiceover was extremely wooden. Beau van Erven Dorens was utterly overwhelmed as fraternal brother Fraser, although it probably had more to do with the crap dialogue. 'Ik ook van jou' is the adaptation of a book and it seems that the directors of the film have forgotten that the dialogue between films follows rules different from those of the literary dialogue. It sounded like a way to book. <br /> <br /> Some of the situations were very poorly visualized. Example: somewhere at the beginning of the film, there is a scene where a canoe is speeding up. This bit is too incredible to be true. You see a river that is obviously quite shallow, with many rocks just below the surface (hence the rapid). We hear suspense music to warn us that there is danger. A canoe with girls goes in this shallow fast. Our hero then plunges several meters below the surface to save one of the girls. The girl shakes her hand in her arms and utters the words "You saved me ..." Vomit! <br /> <br /> It was so bad that it became funny. It's sad, because it really was not planned. At intermission, I heard a guy behind me say, "God, there is another party!" My feelings exactly. What scares me is that the credits for "Ik ook van jou" were in English. Does this mean it will be broadcast abroad? Just when the Netherlands began to have a good reputation after movies like "Antonia" (the line of Antonia) and "Karakter" (Character) ...
