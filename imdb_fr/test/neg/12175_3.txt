The attraction of this film must be the European artistic style, because there is no substance. There are a lot of things that seem to be going somewhere ... but that never happens. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to propose 10 lines of comments, because this film is a totally empty experience. . There are many beautiful pictures of a graveyard, effects of really lame zombies, flashes of what could be considered surrealistic humor and a nonexistent and existentialist ending. These elements harm each other. Just when you may be enjoying the bad mood, there is nonsense with bouncing heads or zombie sex. To keep from boredom, you cling to the minimal narrative - and it disintegrates into ridiculous illogicality. It's as if someone had taken several half-cooked B movies and threw them into a blender. <br /> <br /> What comes out of it is mainly a movie * about * nonsense - and * not * a good one. Obviously, this will impress this category of art-house lovers who see emptiness as indistinguishable from depth. Everyone should stay away from this damn thing.
