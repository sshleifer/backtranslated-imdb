I'm not so old that I do not remember laughing at Bobcat Goldthwait many times. But some where, during all his years of addiction, he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells. <br /> <br /> From the moment the film opens, you can no longer have sympathy or empathy for the main female role. You will not find anything funny after hearing the first line. Goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade himself to feel better, even if it is his own imaginary characters that he degrades. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen Shakes the Clown, you know how crazy Bobcat was 15 years ago ... this movie is worse. It was not even funny by accident. It's sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. Let Goldthwaits' hands be paralyzed so that he can not write another script. Hit his tongue so he can not dictate another non-funny scene. He is sad and pathetic and must give way to a new talent dying to enter Hollywood.
