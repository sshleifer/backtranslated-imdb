Horrible writing, staging and interpretation! The screenwriter / director portrayed the Southerners, especially the southern law enforcement, ignorant, backward-looking, homophobic and racist (a very popular but ignorant stereotype that the film industry likes to perpetuate ). Actor play (or too active) and writing have appeared as amateurs and on a budget. The plot of the plot is the same old Hollywood story of nasty racist and homophobic rednecks who are finally defeated by the enlightened people of "Newwww Yoke Ceety". <br /> <br /> I was raised in the small town of Louisiana. where this film was shot and looked forward to seeing the film but was immediately disappointed during the first few minutes of the film. The beginning of the film describes a gay bar located in the "swamps" of Louisiana. What a ridiculous concept! There are lots of gays and gay bars in South Louisiana, but no gay bars in the "swamps" or small towns of Louisiana. We are then introduced to the sheriff who uses the expressions "homuh-sex'l" in the worst southern draw and south overdose performances. Then there is the scene where the local police watch porn on duty at the police station. I could talk again and again about horrible theatrical play, outdated stereotypes or ridiculous scenes. <br /> <br /> This director and his team were welcomed in this friendly little town and showed true Southern hospitality. The people of Lake Arthur and the state of Louisiana were to be insulted and degraded only in the final edition. The good people of Lake Arthur were enthusiastic and delighted by the fact that "Hollywood" was in town, without knowing that in the end, they would be described as ignorant, racist and homophobic peasants in a low budget amateur film that went directly to the DVD. My advice: skip this one or watch it at the end of the evening if it is already the rotation of Cinemax.
