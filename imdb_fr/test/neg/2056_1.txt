Once again, I fell into the trap. In my roots, I want a fun and bloody horror movie, even a vampire. Even if it's stupid, as long as I'm having a lot of fun, I'm a happy camper, it does not take much. So I saw the cover of "Bled" on Hollywood Video and I was a little curious to know what it was, it looked pretty interesting, so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall for this? Not only did this film not fulfill the satisfaction I needed for my senseless violence and senseless nudity, but I was bored too much. This movie has kahoonies to say it's a vampire movie and it really is not! I'm so close to going back to the store and begging for money because it's one of the few times I've actually turned off the movie. <br /> <br /> An artist meets a vampire, I think, do not know, I'm still trying to figure out what he was but his name was Reinfield, so I guess he may be a guy cockroach eater who likes to scare people? I think, I do not know. Anyway, he thinks the artist has a certain flair for darkness, so he gives her a drug to enter an alternative fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive? I think, I do not know. So his friends are excited and decide to try the drug too, I think, I do not know. So, having decided to try the drug, things get strange, the fantasies are real, I think, I do not know, and the vampire now benefits from the will of girls with big breasts, dressed in clothes scandalously dressed. I think, I do not know. But some girls really end up being vampires? I think I do not know. <br /> <br /> Sorry for all the "I do not know", this is maybe one of the worst reviews I'm going to write, but it's because this movie was awful, boring and confusing . I love to see these actors who, as you well know, are servers looking for this "big break". Not too clever, they fall into the clich√© of the horror genre, sometimes it works and sometimes it does not work, in this case, they really should have read the script. Because the film, the look, the feel, the acting, everything in this movie was just bad, I really recommend you to skip the movie if you see it in your video store. It might have been an interesting movie with its concept of another dimension, but why did they choose this director to show his "creativity" if he even had? It was a bad movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
