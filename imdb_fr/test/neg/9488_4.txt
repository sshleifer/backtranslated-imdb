One of the most popular / popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A woman in a red shirt falls for Khan (instead of falling dead for a change) and then betrays Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty was a non-existent trait on the ship. One wonders what kind of psychology is testing this so-called brilliant Starfleet who tests people when hiring. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in "Wink Of An Eye", when a man in a red shirt takes the enemy side just because he falls in love! Same as SS. (However, in this episode, betrayal plays a minor role in the plot.) This is very ridiculous, as Kirk's crew once again looks like a band of idiots with a sweet and easy-to-impress head, who - once they fall in love with the enemy - are able to do almost anything. The fact that McGivers returned to Kirk's side in no way improves the illogicality. Lord McGiveth and Lord McTaketh ... <br /> <br /> Why is Khan left behind an ordinary door when they know he has superior strength? This is one of many ST plots that undermine Kirk's intelligence. Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoy's throat? If Khan is of such superior intelligence, we would expect him to be smarter with the way he behaves. And what does a Sikh play with a Latin accent? Montalban should have received a voice coach. I was almost expecting to hear "plaaain! in the background at any time. Why on earth would Kirk (or any ship captain) use the ship's unlimited library with respect to the deeper technical details of the Enterprise? Is the Starfleet an institution composed only of idiots? <br /> <br /> SS is an idyllic episode and very caricatural, so it's no wonder the Trekkies love it. It does not contain many elements of science fiction, which Trekkies hates the most. He also thinks that the ST franchise has chosen to revive this dull character for the second film, which made the ravishing Trekkies so ravishing, so disappointed by the first movie that - you guessed it - had too much science fiction for the average trekkie brain.
