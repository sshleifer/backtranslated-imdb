A wasted effort. In appearance, this is a typical disaster movie: we are involved in the lives of a few people who are caught in the Big Event. However, the script is so horrible and there are so many explanations about the background of the characters in the dialogue that we feel like being treated like morons. Even Sesame Street did not explain Mr. Snuffleupagus' origins or Mr. Hooper's death: we can get by. Someone thought that entering Enron in the script would give him money to talk about the power companies. The acting is usually bland, except for the older ones (Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy), and after the first hour, I do not care who the storms have won. <br /> <br /> But maybe there are special effects to watch out for. Unfortunately no. Even on a 20-year-old TV, I could see that a tractor and a trailer were computer-generated - badly. Maybe there are budget limits for me to forgive. The images of an airplane trying to land seemed very real, but I thought I had seen it before. This site confirms it: it was a previous movie, Nowhere to Land. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only good points are those of another movie, and when you see the best compressed action sequences in a second promo format of the network, that makes category 6 look good. My advice: count on your network to make good clips of 30 seconds, to watch them and to save you two nights.
