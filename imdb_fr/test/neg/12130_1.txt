This film was pure genius. John Waters is awesome. It's hilarious and I'm not fed up even after seeing it about 20 times since I bought it a few months ago. The acting is great, although Ricki Lake could have been better. And Johnny Depp is beautiful. He is such a handsome man and a very talented actor. And seeing most of Johnny's movies is probably my favorite. I give him 9.5 / 10. Praise him today!
