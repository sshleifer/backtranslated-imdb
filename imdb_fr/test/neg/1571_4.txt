The film was disappointing. I saw her on Broadway with Bernadette Peters and she was outstanding. Perhaps as she approaches the end of her musical career, her state of despair leads her to play a role that she displays, reinvents, and triumphs as her own. Bette's vocals are still belted, always flat and lacking to show her acting abilities. To be entertaining, this performance was dying to strengthen the main role and cast, so that others are memorable in the absence of Bette. Another criticism: she smiles directly at the camera every time she sings! I know it's musical theater, but please leave some social grace - Middler can not play as Liza or Streisand could do in a retrospective tour - out of character and out of context.
