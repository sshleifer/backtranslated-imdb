No Holds Barred is a film that should not be taken seriously. It sucks hardcore like a serious movie. Think of it more as you should. Plan 9 from outer space. They are one in the same thing in that they are both so bad that they are funny. The funny moments in No Holds Barred are usually those that are not supposed to be. When Rip (interpreted by Hulk Hogan as the only one able to play them) takes the limousine driver in front after his first meeting with Brell (Kurt Fuller), the hilarity ensues and it's part of the movie that all the world should see. This is perhaps the funniest scene, I swear. <br /> <br /> Anyway, how someone thought this movie would bring money, I'll never know and that person should probably be forced to submit. I hope they have at least been fired. This film wins 1 in 5 on my scale and this one is just for the unintentionally funny parts.
