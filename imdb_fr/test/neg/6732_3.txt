Can they be worse than that? Probably. But after all, Steven Seagal must do what he does. Good type of; this time, instead of mortally wounding the wicked, he is simply hurting them. Seagal, which has the reputation of being a bad agent, is engaged to deliver a special parcel from France to America. But it's not an easy task with so many people trying to intercept and corrupt the mission. The fights are not enough biting and big bangs are huge and that's it. Anna-Louis Plowman seems to be the only cast member not to appear in wood. Jeffery Pierce, Max Ryan and Harry Van Gorkum are also part of the cast. Do not blame Seagal for this clunker.
