Now, before telling you the summary, this is a non-spoiler review. Bone Eater seems to be the worst movie of the year. I do not know how these movies even went on DVD. If I saw that in the theaters, I would be extremely upset. Bone Eater is talking about those people who dig up an old cemetery and find bones. He is the "bone eater" and the more he eats bone, the more he gains power. <br /> <br /> First of all, I thought that the DVD illustrations looked scary and it sounded scary. When I rented it and watched the DVD label, it looked scary. But when I played it, I could agree on one point: the title "Bone Eater" is better than the movie itself. Tell me what is stupid? A bone eater who attacks by throwing a bone has eaten you and you are gone? Do not worry, it's not a spoiler that you see happening in the first 5 minutes. Or is it more stupid that 'Bone Eater' has a horse? You know what I think is the most stupid? The whole movie. <br /> <br /> The CGI is awful. Yes, I thought the idea of ​​"Bone Eater" was scary, but once you see the real thing, you think it's some kind of action movie or just a cruel and mean joke. The movie seemed longer than Titanic and it was half an hour. Once the film has its moments of suspense, it stops. I admit that the acting was not the best but that it was decent and that the violence was not exaggerated, but all the rest is fragrant. <br /> <br /> Overall, Bone Eeater is a movie you can jump. If you like interesting movies with big creatures, excellent CGI and suspense, 'Bone Eater' is a movie to ignore. If you like bad movies, regardless of their appearance, "Bone Eater" will satisfy you.
