First: a warning. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this DVD movie from the Universal 'Hitchcock Collection' series. The source print seems to be in a flawless state, but the image is a little soft, suggesting that it could be a second-generation copy taken directly from the video. The framing is much too tight, so all the compositions are terrible. Even the title of the film is truncated. Other critics of IMDb, I understand that there is a much better version available. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Smith are just a footnote regarding Hitchcock's career. <br /> <br /> In his long interviews with Francois Truffaut in the sixties, Hitchcock gave a complete overview of all his work, but all he could say about this image is that he had presented it as a favor to Carole Lombard and that he did not understand the characters, so he had photographed the screenplay of Norman Krasna. . <br /> <br /> In truth, there is nothing else to say. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy to be shot out of the same mold as It Happened One Night, His Girl Friday and Philapdelphia Story. Carole Lombard is a typically ferocious wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid, blurs with her husband under the most fragile pretext and spends most of the photo being "adorably" unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery does quite well as the husband puts it, but it's hard not to lose patience with him. Well before the end of the film, the audience says, "Drop the silly cow, it's not worth it." <br /> <br /> Gene Raymond plays the best friend with whom she relied. He is supposed to be a Southerner, a courteous "old family", although this is not obvious from his accent and it only really appears in the drunken scene (which he also plays very well). He is an honorable man, generous and courteous. He is, of course, intimidated and condescending by Robert Montgomery. He is often part of the joke - although he is not as badly treated as the similar character of Ralph Bellamy in His Girl Friday. This movie seems to have been made by people who knew only dumpling comedies by reputation, without having actually seen one. For example, a good ball comedy has a strong central idea with a number of ongoing comics that mingle and overlap continuously. Here, all the elements of the comedy are simply strained, like pearls on a necklace. It's a comedy with figures. <br /> <br /> It's the same with management. Generally, these comedies evolve at an increasingly fast pace, which eventually becomes almost a hysteria. Hitchcock does not understand that. His direction is somewhat lethargic and the painting becomes a majestic succession of scenes that all seem slightly overwritten (but undernourished) and a bit too long. He has never been a very good director of actors, so he left the actors to fend for themselves. They accept. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock had a good sense of humor, which he used frequently in his thrillers, but he had no idea of ​​comedy as a genre. His last problem, Trouble with Harry, was also a failure, for reasons similar to those in this movie, but at least he was involved in this picture. Here he is just getting things done. <br /> <br /> Everyone involved in this film were good professionals, so it's not particularly bad. It just feels a little drifting, too familiar, too long and finally rather flat. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Smith are one for Carole Lombard fans and Hitchcock completers only.
