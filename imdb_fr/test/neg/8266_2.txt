Documentary definition: a work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social or historical issues in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual newsreels or interviews accompanied by narration . The key word here is informative. I love, they could be giants, and I barely learned anything about them. <br /> <br /> The interviews with all the celebrities were almost worthless. I do not care what Sarah Vowel thinks of anyone and Syd Straw was downright irritating. And do people listen to TMBG lyrics as if they were supposed to be funny / interesting? It was neither. I think that was the problem: the film spends time discussing the love of TMBG for coffee. So what?? Millions of people love coffee. Was the presentation of the material funny? No! There were hints that the two men are married, but this was never discussed. And what about the solo material they did? What motivated them to do it? These types of questions are not addressed or resolved. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on with the negatives again and again. I found the Dial-a-Song segment very interesting. If you want to know more about They Might Be Giants, buy some CDs and listen. Seriously. This film is a gigantic disappointment. I can not believe that so many people gave him a 10. Incredible.
