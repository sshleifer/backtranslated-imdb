I have not seen many episodes of "Family Guy" and it's a safe bet that I will not see much in the future. Some people say that comparing this show to "The Simpsons" is unfair. I absolutely think that this show would not exist if "The Simpsons" did not come first and I absolutely think he wants so much to be "The Simpsons". I do not understand what's so funny about this show. In the episodes I watched, I understood where they wanted to make me laugh, I understand that someone thinks that a joke has just been told but that this joke is not funny. I find the whole show lazy: the title, the "jokes", the lack of inspiration is total. <br /> <br /> The best television shows (with or without a cartoon) are created as follows: a script is written, it goes through several rewrites, things that do not work are deleted, inspiration is inspired , good things are added, there are more rewrites and then they are filmed. <br /> <br /> The episode "Family Guy" must be created like this: a script is written and filmed.
