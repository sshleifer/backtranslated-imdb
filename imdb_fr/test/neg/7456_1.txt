I ... I do not know where to start. Dragon Hunt could be the worst film in the history of cinema. Even Anus Magilicutty was better than that, because it was intentionally bad. Showgirls? No, he was kitsch and technically a good movie. But Dragon Hunt takes the cake and eats it, then vomits it and feeds it to a homeless man. It's as ridiculous as that. <br /> <br /> The action, if you can even call it that, is tough. It does not have the charm of an improvised acting game, so it must be written in a script, but it is recited with an almost mischievous tone and poor quality. Several lines have been broadcast in order to show the actors (or mainly those who are on the screen) either to regret their connection to this film, or to think of a particularly humorous joke Saturday Night Live, they had already view before going in front. the camera. I could write three more paragraphs about the quality of the game in this movie, but you and I do not want to hear it. <br /> <br /> Makeup and special effects (which, with most movies, is the only good thing) was ridiculously bad. The antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous that I can not remember, has a Mohawk glued to the top of his head. Yes, stuck to his head. And you can see that it's stuck too, if you look at where he meets his punched skull, you can see a strip of plastic, not very different from the ones on the false eyelashes. Fortunately, it's pretty much the only example of no-nos makeup in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is also a terrible development of the characters, to put it lightly. Women, who are strangely manipulated by supposedly benevolent and ferocious brothers (and I mean, they are really jostled), are not only ugly, but ... panting ... they do not know what they are doing! In a scene, they light their apparent lovers, join the uglier even more ugly, then sniff coke. Apparently, they managed to get their hands on some very good cocaine, because they started to shake and laugh even before everything went up to their nostrils. Great girls! In addition, they wear really horrible clothes, clothes that belong only to the late 80s and early 90s. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film, this wastage of film, should I say , is also a waste of time. Looking at it will hurt you and will require the suspension not only of your convictions, but also of your entire brain. If you want to let off steam with your friends and have a good laugh, see if you can get this movie (you will probably have to download it), otherwise, do not even think about it. I hope I have been helpful.
