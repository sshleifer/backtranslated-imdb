Stay away from this movie at all costs. I was led to watch this film in a bet to see which of us knew the "worst film of all time". Needless to say, he won hands down. It is long and long, and has no purpose or plot of what I can muster. A film about a killer kid raised from a fetus who grew up outside the womb simply does not fit into your VCR. If you are extremely bored and have no life, watch this movie. But if you prefer to keep your sanity, stay away.
