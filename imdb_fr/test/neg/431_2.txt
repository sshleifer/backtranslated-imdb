This is a title in search of a movie. This is an argument that seems profitable for some studio executives and that the rest is doomed. When this film was shot, there were two more things that CGI did not do well at all: people and fur. The furry people were therefore not meant to look great when rendered by computer. This is the only example I can think of where the effects of a well-funded suite have taken a giant step back, well after those of the original movie. For the record, designing werewolves does not help a little. The filmmakers apparently did not seem to be able to choose between a quadruped and a biped, trying to do both and finding themselves with a creature that seemed just as awkward in both cases. The transformations are abnormally absurd and the final result with a relatively high forehead and short snout looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But let's go back to the dirty part. It is a film that exists PURELY to cash his ancestor. I'm not a fan of the original Landis movie, but good boy, does that look good in light of this? If you thought that Landis's humor had been forced, try some of the atrocious attempts that are going on here. The bubble gum scene, the corpse's humor, the dog who ... you know, you just have to look at yourself. Thomas Everett Scott is on holiday in Europe with friends and decides to take a break in the role of "American villain" and bungee jumping from the Eiffel Tower in the middle of the night. This leads him to save a young woman (Delpy - Julie it's not worth becoming a star in America, ask Rutger Hauer) to go to death. It turns out to belong to a cult of werewolves who are plotting to ... I'm not sure it's something bad. stereotypes, gaping intrigues, a confused end. Anyway, the studio did not want the title to deceive millions of fans of "American Werewolf in London" by giving them their money. For the most part, happy to say they were fake.
