I really wanted to love this movie, however after a few fun minutes, I almost did not smile. I agree that there was no chemistry between the two main characters and that the other characters were clich√©s. The scenario totally ruined the talents of Bud Tingwell and Kim Gyngell. <br /> <br /> It must be said however that there was a lot of laughter around me and even some applause at the end. Maybe I just could not understand enough. I'm just glad I bought cheap tickets.
