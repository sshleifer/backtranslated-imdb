As Paul Kersey lacked parents to take revenge, the third installment of the "Death Wish" saga revolves around his return to New York to visit an old friend of war. It only happens to discover that Brooklyn has completely changed to become a gang of poor, and that young thugs have killed his friend and continually terrorize all the other tenants of a dilapidated apartment building.

The last twenty minutes constitute in particular a complete "orgy" of gunfire, explosions and executions carried out by means of improvised artisanal measures. Yi-Haaa! Martin Balsam ("Psycho", "12 Angry Men") is the tired neighbor who keeps machine guns in his cupboard, Ed Lauter ("Family Plot", "The Longest Yard").
