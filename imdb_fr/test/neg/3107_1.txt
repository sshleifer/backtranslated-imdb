Do not rent this movie. I ended up buying the "previewed" tape for $ 4.00. It was close to the price of a rental, so thought, I might as well buy it. I throw it at the end of this exam. Lowe's star movie is a musical video with a few lines of dialogue, slow shots, and a poor editing. I thought I was seeing a stupid action movie, that's what I wanted to see, I did not even understand it. This film is an exercise using slow shots, without scenario, in close-up, in a terrible montage and in an undeveloped plot. I can not believe that this really ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters. At the end of the film, we still do not really know who they are. Believe the hype, stay away.
