I received this film as a birthday present because all my friends know that I am a big fan of low budget horror movies. Kaufman Studios have always produced the cheereux and bloody films delivered. I loved watching their movies at home on rainy nights with my family ... until I saw Bugged ... WHAT HAPPENED? <br /> <br /> This film started with a very good concept on insect mutation and even added a smooth comedy, but overall, the writing is bad and it's the number one mistake . Ronald K. Armstrong should first learn to become a better writer before becoming a filmmaker. After reading the credits, we discover that he has given himself the most important role in the film!?! two words Mr. Director "Acting Lessons" OK? Mr. Armstrong joins the ranks of other screenwriters / directors who are launching their own movies and this is the number two mistake. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this film is the artistic work of the camera and the musical score (let's listen to it for the team!). The actors of other actors who, at the beginning of this production, seemed a bit cold, really warmed towards the middle and the end of this production. Everyone gathered and helped to remove this film. Ronald Armstrong may lack the talent to become a director or a decent actor, but I will say this: he seems to know how to organize people to get them to meet and withdraw his productions. <br /> <This film, I must say, can be an inspiration to any young filmmaker who dreams of making his own film, because if Mr. Armstrong were able to do that, everyone could do it too. If you have the chance to see this movie, watch it to inspire you to do "better" in the future. Hollywood needs bigger and better horror movies to prevent this kind of coming back from his grave.
