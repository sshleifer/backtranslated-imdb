The Net is a movie that I never saw when it was released, I remember giving it the bad reviews and since then it may have noticed an excerpt here and there when it was aired at the television. Fourteen years after its original release, I'm a little stunned to see how much time passes. Being in my mid-twenties, my childhood felt old. I felt that I probably should exercise before my body starts to accumulate fat in all the wrong places. Reduce fat and sugar. Too much coffee and cigarettes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was the best part of this cinematic experience for me. I would say that the first 30 minutes of this movie really occupied me with the retro paradise. Look at those big cans they call computers. Look, they are chatting in the chat rooms! I remember these tank tops! They look ... stupid. And hey, she even stars Sandra Bullock. First billed! Would you like to watch this. <br /> <br /> As a film, The Net is just an imaginary thriller, simple and totally routine among the Hitchockians. Nothing archaic about it, they made them at the time as much as they do now. Bullock plays the role of a solitary IT informant whose job is to repair software for people who do not have "this computer stuff". In fact, she comes across sensitive information and, after her vacation trip, she is almost killed by a sexy layman who turns out to be a murderer (played by Jeremy Northam, and she should have been wary of the fact are in a movie American and the guy smokes and has a British accent!), she is "destroying her identity". Her house is empty, for sale, and after verification, it turns out that she now has a new identity. A convicted prostitute and an impostor, no less. <br /> <br /> Now, you could say that this is unlikely. How could they do this to him? Even in 1995, it's impossible! That's right, but in 1995, many people did not even know what the Internet was. I can see how it's a plot you could have accepted at the time. What is even more disastrous are the inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology. The film obviously owes a lot to the Hitchcock movies (one of those thrillers that offer a night-time carousel), but Hitchcock has always made sure that his films are plausible. The characters did not act like confused maniacs when they tried to prove their innocence, and the plot did not conveniently provide for a structure where an inevitable obstacle would lead to the other. The characters also tried a little before giving in to all the chase. Does the character of Bullock really have no friends whatsoever? Could no former high school teacher confirm his identity? Or as ... his closest type of pizza? Oh yes, she orders pizzas on the Internet. It does not matter. You understand the movie pretty quickly. There seems to be hope in an ex boyfriend. Do you really think that? You should always count on at least ONE surprise. Internet does not offer any offer. <br /> <br /> The Internet poses a lot of risks, it seems, to predict this movie. But, if the film was shot today, imagine the problems that villains should suffer to guarantee the destruction of their identity. Not only do they have to do all those boring things literally, but she would still have her Facebook subscription, with at least a hundred friends and tags with images, not to mention the fact that she might be on YouTube or Linked -In. her video blog with about 150 hits daily, or webcams from her house and videos recorded from her on mobile phones, webcams, other people's web downloads ... her subscription to IMDb?
