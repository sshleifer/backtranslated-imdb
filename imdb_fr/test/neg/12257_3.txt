A true mix of really strange and surreal visual ideas, which no doubt seemed extremely puzzling on the printed page; which attracted Robert Redford to the project, you may never know. Sidney J. Furie leads this dazzling journey of a selfish motorcyclist rider taking a juvenile milquetoast under his wing; the kid looks up at this anti-hero and finally starts to mock his amorality. Disjointed and repulsive - although, for some, seeing Redford undressing, about to undress or undressed may be enough to warrant attention. Lauren Hutton undresses too, but all the sexy flashes are just provocations for the devotees; there is simply no history. Perhaps Furie was making an esoteric comment on the fluffy rollers and their flock around 1970. If that is true, this pre-Generation Blank approach will backfire, because the film was not a success. * 1/2 of ****
