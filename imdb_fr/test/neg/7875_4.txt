I saw this in my local supermarket and I knew Debra was there. So I decided to buy it (without the support of this sexy woman!). The plot and the role in this movie were terrible (with the exception of Debra Wilson, and I'm not saying that, because I love her, she was seriously the only actor or actress to have an emotion in their their game and their voice!) What I did not understand at the beginning, is why the woman was not content to get in her car instead of running at random like that. It was so stupid. And it's LA (PERSON saw her being kidnapped in a public residential street - NO ONE ... yes, that's realistic!) Also in the park, when Charlie stole the woman's cell phone (for a reason stupid), they were resolutely committed. by finding him (and at some point) when they met him, they had him under the threat of a mobile phone! In fact, I doubt that the LAPD is doing everything possible for a stupid cell phone! The lady could have gone to one of these phone booths and have her replaced! The children's abilities as actors were also nil (I think they were reading a memory card or someone was whispering behind the camera) because they would be asked questions, they would look around and then answer. in a dubious voice (ie Miss Daddy? ") Also, how could there be all these snipers in the trees and on the roofs of the building to be unseen ?! see this being played at 3 am in the United States. <br /> <br /> Debra Wilson fanatics will appreciate her roles and she is the only actor to have real actress skills (Debra, darling - stop to make these cheap movies, directly to the movies ... maybe that will change with the next Whitepaddy movie.) She puts on some jokes (like when one of her superiors comes up and asks who she is speak, she screams at her computer and says, "Good God, Charlie!") I gave him a 4/10 ... a 4 only because of Debra's good interpretation skills.
