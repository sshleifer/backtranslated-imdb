When I watched this film for the first time, in the 80s, I loved it. I was totally fascinated by music, dance ... everything. However, I recently watched it all again on DVD, and I was completely struck by the extreme stupidity of the script - the way it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a lot of bullshit - and how The dance was horrible. I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have penetrated this repertoire of ballet ... Everything was pretty pathetic. The character developments also lacked depth. I think it was really a product of the 80s: the film does not hold today!
