Chaplin was an excellent silent comedian, but many silent-era stars fell when the audience heard their voices in early debates. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice just does not match his silent characters who made him rich and famous. His career never recovered when the sound came to film. Contrary to most of the reviews I've read, Chaplin's lifestyle and politics have not helped his average viewer to expect to be entertained by Chaplin the comedian and not to spend their money in cash for look at Chaplin's political commentary. <br /> <br /> Despite the rewards and title of Knight Chaplin, I would offend his "contributions" to humanity. The Great Dictator was created even though Stalin's brutal dictatorship was organizing television trials and the two dictators signed the agreement providing for the invasion of Poland by the two dictators. The Second World War began in an attempt to save Poland. The Nazis were defeated in 6 years, but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country. This happened during the period when this film was shot and the Hollywood investigations conducted by the federal government. If Chaplin had included Joe Stalin in this satire, in addition to the Italian dictator, he might have been less criticized by politicians about his policy. Soviet mistreatment of Jews and dissidents goes beyond the Nazis in terms of time and numbers. <br /> <br /> Judged simply as a movie, many gags were too current to be understood by the younger ones, who would not know who Goebbels, Goring or Mussolini were. A classic work of art must stand the test of time. Classic Greek tragedy, the Mona Lisa and the 9th of Beethoven still enjoy centuries after their creation, because they are timeless. Films that rely on current political commentary or popular social opinion currently do not generally survive longer than the generation in which they are made. But those dealing with issues common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from me. <br /> <br /> Chaplin, as a writer, director and lead actor must be held accountable for what I deem to be. a dated and tedious film. <br /> <br /> Chaplin's defenders apologized for leaving the country that made him rich and famous. If Chaplin found the United States so offensive, why did not he return to his homeland? Britain fought the Nazis with blood and money. What has been Switzerland's contribution to the fight against European dictators? Switzerland is like a country club that chooses and chooses its members according to their race and class, and does not care about those who can not join the club.
