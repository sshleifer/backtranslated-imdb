The COC has had its moments. I enjoyed the action sequences, but I despised the storyline and the plot. I hate this movie so much, I'm just going to write about the stupidest part. First of all, the plot would never happen. Second, the sadness of the Chinese president was unjustified. It would never happen. Finally, the dialogue. It is understandable to use non-Chinese actors to play Chinese roles, but writing for them a dialogue that is TOTALLY OFF is silly! For those of you who understand the Chinese in the film, you know what I mean.
