It was only when I saw Sidney Pollack on the picture that I had never connected to this film. It's his worst film possible. Absolute dreck. The dialogue is wooden and amazing, the plot is amazing. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas is wasted in this movie. Nothing in his character even makes you want to believe in this story. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford is like on Valium. There is no life in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm accusing Sidney Pollack of the failure of this film. The script is awful and he is too smart not to see it. So, it feels a certain profit, whether it's a studio bond or something else, but it's just BLOODY ROTTEN!
