Let me say this about Edward D. Wood Jr. He wanted a lot more people in his work. If we all had Ed Wood's optimism and hope, the world would probably be a much better place. Knowing the story of Ed Wood and having repeatedly seen the most wonderful biopic "Ed Wood" (1994), I admire his audacity and his efforts for the work he loved; I always admire his attitude of never-say-die. He loved the realization that I would like more people in modern Hollywood to have. <br /> <br /> But that does not make his movies more fun to watch. And "Glen or Glenda", his first and most confessional, is probably his worst film. <br /> <br /> "Glen or Glenda" is a cult movie that jeopardizes a transvestite named Glen (played by director / writer Ed Wood himself) who, despite his love for his fianc√©e Barbara ( Dolores Fuller), can not overcome his desire for cross-dressing, in which he dresses for women's clothes and a wig and thus becomes ... Glenda! The story of Glen / Glenda is told by a doctor and he himself is discussed and watched by a mysterious character called "The Scientist", played by the famous horror star Bela Lugosi. Oh, and there is also a sub-story about a character from Alan / Anne who becomes a transsexual based on the story of Christine Jorgenson, on which this movie was originally titled "I Changed My Sex!" Was it before? <br /> <br /> Have I already dropped your jaw? Although I want to warn you that if you have never seen it, I will never lie about a movie and there is not a word of lies in the summary of the plot I just gave you . Everything is true. It's a film about transvestites and transsexuals, a subject that does not sound very appealing at the beginning and is not done very attractively. I'm sure that with a good script and a good director (there was none), "Glen or Glenda", despite the topic, could have been a very moving image. It's a confessional film from Wood, because he was a transvestite in real life and on screen. But again, that does not make this movie a good movie ... or even a watchable film. "Glen or Glenda" is the messy clutter of a film that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema. It does not make more sense than her notoriously stupid scene where Bela Lugosi shouts "Pull the rope!" on inexplicable images of ruined bison. The majority of the film is told in a monotonous voice, reminding me of very bad short informative films that I saw before. It's as if one of these very bad shorts has become a seventy-minute feature film and twice as boring. We sit there for centuries waiting for the plot that never comes. There is no real attempt to generate energy, the camera being locked in a position for many minutes and long periods of exhaustion, where nothing happens. The only moments that are worthwhile are those of Bela Lugosi, who manages to light up these dark trenches. I suppose Lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the movie, but personally, I do not care who or what he's supposed to be. I'll tell you what he was: a talented actor who ended up doing garbage. But he and Wood were very good friends and enjoyed working together. So it's good for him. <br /> <br /> I will always admire Edward D. Wood Jr. for his passion for cinema, but never as long as I live admires his films. A film critic has already described Ed Wood's films as "innocent fun," but I think that's debatable. Innocent? Yes. Fun? No sir. And if "Citizen Kane" is Mount Everest of the cinematographic world, then "Glen or Glenda" is probably the Mariana pit.
