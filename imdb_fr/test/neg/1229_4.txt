It's a poor caricature of "Lonesome Dove" - ​​and Larry McMurtry. <br /> <br /> I love your books, with "Lonesome Dove" among the top three. I admired your way of seeing you, through your characters, with such unfailing honesty, balanced by never taking it too seriously. I'm so spoiled. <br /> <br /> Why did you come to this? <br /> <br /> "Comanche Moon" is not up to your expectations. I see you are credited for writing the screen, but it's so different from you, I prefer to think it's written by someone else. <br /> <br /> The dialogue makes me claustrophobic, wanting someone to break a naturally stated sentence. The part about the "genius" was painful. McCrae was unrecognizable - mainly because of the insane words that came out of his mouth. <br /> <br /> Well, I miss Call too. <br /> <br /> The main missing factors are Gus and Call and the men they are: their factual courage; the underlying vein composed of ethics and honesty; their lack of self-illusion. Hard men leading a hard life with some undeniable grace. <br /> <br /> Some criticism must be attached to the laborious leadership here and everywhere. The entire cast needed dialectal AND dialogue coaching. <br /> <br /> As I try to imagine Robert Duvall as McCrae, speaking the same way, it's better - but not much. He tries to sound cowardly, sneaky-smiling, but not half-witty ... <br /> <br /> How can he be so different from "Lonesome Dove"? Can the writer have forgotten his characters? You fooled some people, Mr. McMurtry - but not this one.
