This movie (even calling it a movie is an exaggeration) is ridiculously horrible. Normally a big fan of Eric Roberts in the movies of the list "B", this tragedy of a movie makes me doubt his real weight in the list B! And Charlie, please come back to the hope of an awakening by Diagnosis Assassin rather than that ..... you can not blame the nameless candy for the eyes (members of the beauty contest) of participate in this weak movie, but YOU are a former TV star! Shoot together. Do not even throw me on Stuart Pankin. In the name of all that is good, Stuart, you should have seen that it was not necessarily a real movie! Bryan Michael Stoller illustrates the absolute genius only by the fact that he was able to fool anyone by investing in this picture (money or time). <br /> <br /> In reality, it was not a parodic or parodic film although he tries 2nd year. Most of the time, it's a poor writing and a bad action game, a camera work and editing, and ... all very poor. I watched it because I had read an article in a magazine about the involvement of the MJ agent and that my interest had been brought because of the trial in which he was involved. I wonder now if the only reason for showing it up and down in the movie is that, as in the trial, he appeared wearing pajama pants and barely lucid (wait a second, is he never really considered lucid? ... I digress). And the agent MJ? Is this the best they could find to give a name to his character? Sheez. What amazing originality! Or maybe it was supposed to be funny? At first, integrating Marriott into the movie was a good idea, but it was excessive and boring after all. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the pain of watching ...... do not say I did not do it. t warn you.
