Hello, today, I watched this movie because of its average rating in IMDb (5,6). I thought it was worth the look. In addition, the comments here were pretty good, but after starting to watch this movie, I quickly realized that this film was not close to a 5.6! It's just boring. You can describe the movie with a few words and it's also the standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes. I do not know why people still love these movies or why they vote them better than a 1-3 in IMDb. Some examples <br /> <br /> A crowd of people arriving from somewhere or going / going anywhere. They somehow meet strange people on their way, but maybe they're just nice, so get out with them. Then, a very important scene for each horror film "Oh, my cellphone does not work, oh, mine too ... is it strange but we do not need it so enjoy our ride ... "uhhhhhh our strange person is a strange psychopath better we all sit screaming for a moment until he starts cutting us pieces or killing some of us. After a while, the group of victims receives a weapon or a chance to flee an order. They never think of running away or even killing the psychopath if they have the chance to talk about what to do until the psychopath recovers his weapon with the handle. standard tricks that they got in these movies and that run as usual ... scream ... even more to kill ... oh in the end it gets really exciting sometimes the villain sometimes wins part of the victim can escape wow good movies. ... OK, if I've never seen a film like that, I'd say it's a movie that can be watched, but if anyone ever saw a film like that, it would be just boring time loss, because almost everything in the movie you know before you even watch it because it turns every time like a classic film of horror film. .... mmm maybe there is a windows program? Horrormoviemaker 2.0? You can just shoot a few tuning knobs and get the new kind of Shuttle movie, Saw45674, Jeepers Creepers.
