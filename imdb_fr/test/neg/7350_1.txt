Free Willzyx (the most stupid name / title of all time) is the worst episode of ALL TV shows I watch, which include X-Files, Alias, The 3 Laws and Orders, All CSI, Family Guy, Simpsons, Chappelle's Show, Colbert Report and more. South Park has long been my favorite among humorous series, due to its shocking and obscene content and its disturbing black comedy. Free Willzyk has NO content mentioned above. It was so docile, so unpleasant that it could have been an episode of Sesame Street. Kyle goes to Sea World where some of the workers make a joke, making him think that a whale is talking to him. He confides in the whale, he did it. Hello? It's South Park! the same show that brought you "canceled", "Chickenlover", "It Hits The Fan", "Death Camp Of Tolerance", and so much more! No SpongeBob SquarePants! Ugh. In fact, I watched the entire episode, that is 30 minutes of my life, I will never come back. Anyway, this episode disgusted me a lot and I could not believe the shocking decline in the quality of Matt & Trey's work.
