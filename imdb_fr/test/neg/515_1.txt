It's really a terrible movie on the part of regulars. Intrigue, scenario, acting, effects, direction - I could go on. In other words, it's poor. However, it has a certain appeal. Many totally out of context sex scenes appear, it's fun to look for Batman references. Umm - that's it. Poor really, do not worry.
