My original comment on this particular title has been removed by an IMDb user or staff only because I really do not like this film to the point of having to write sincerely what I felt after seeing this bad excuse for a movie. Where is my freedom of speech? <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film was made by students because they were so lame and amateurish. Of course, even they have to leave somewhere? The scenario was an incoherent mess, just like the acting game. With low budget and class B actors, what can you expect? There are some CGI in places, so poor, it looks like it's done with an old PC. Some may say it's a kind of "Alien Clone", but this time it's Dracula (wearing a vintage costume) that sucks the others, one to a. The sets are unconvincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place in a large spacecraft. <br /> <br /> It would be fun to know what the stars (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dien, Coolio and Udo Kier) thought of the film after its release ... Coolio must be the worst rapper turned actor! <br /> <br /> It was a waste of time and money, I do not know why I even bothered to rent this movie. Honestly, I hate this movie. Dracula 3000 shares, with Uwe Boll's House of the Dead, the dubious honor of being the worst film of all time. (Well, I've seen even worse than those two) <br /> <br /> Avoid! Any other film will do better.
