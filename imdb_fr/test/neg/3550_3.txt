It starts really interesting - the story develops around the main character, who runs a "cleaning company", specializing in the cleaning of crime scenes. As a former police officer, he encounters a strange situation when a job suddenly disappears. In addition, he discovers a link with an investigation into police corruption. His "feeling of Columbo" is justified, the more he sinks into the bottom of the story. Good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendes) play in a suspenseful story with some twists - but only up to 25 minutes. (so far 7 out of 10 stars). SPOILER :::: Suddenly the film loses its appeal and in the end there is a totally useless shootout, involving the 14-year-old girl, a betrayal of friendship and an unjustified justice of character development not to have Cutler give up his inquiry for the sake of friendship? or have the girl discover facts? or ... many possible finishes much better are imaginable ... a really ruined ending!
