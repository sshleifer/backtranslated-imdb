The screenwriter-director Emilio Estevez shows here a flagrant lack of talent with this supposed and irreparable comedy. The scenario is completely hopeless, not to mention the fact that it is new and poorly worked. Comedy just does not work. When Estevez does not use bad sex jokes, he borrows worn gags and remakes them very badly. You might think Estevez's relationship with his brother Charlie Sheen would be cool ... but ... it's not. <br /> <br /> The entire cast is uninspired and hopeless, never able to make people laugh, and barely smirk their audience. Do yourself a favor and leave it on the video shelf. <br /> <br /> Thursday, June 25, 1992 - Video
