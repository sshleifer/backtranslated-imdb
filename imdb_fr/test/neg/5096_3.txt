With an interesting premise (in the conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples, sometimes the lines of battle were not so clear), it should have been a good movie. But the story is sabotaged by the primordial passion of the director for his own intelligence combined with a very poor scenario. <br /> <br /> Yes, the natural scenery is beautiful and, yes, the film is authentic in its historical context of the 19th century. . But the filmmaker continues to gild the lily again and again, adding layer after layer an exaggerated musical accompaniment, not to mention a totally useless voice to the soundtrack, which eventually overwhelms the viewer and, drawing attention to them yourself, remove yourself from the story. <br /> <br /> For me, it was clear that the director, with his microscopic close-ups and the endless repetition of the musical motif of "Danny Boy" (of all things!) was trying to make a New Zealand version of an epic film by Sergio Leone, of the order of Once Upon A Time In The West. But considering the seriousness of the story (most of Leone's westerns were ironic), not to say that it was not in 1968, he managed to make a parody of it. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
