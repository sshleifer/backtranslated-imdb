The veteran actors in this film know how to act and have already proved it, but the director, who also wrote and produced this parody, is incompetent in many ways. OKAY. It's a small budget, but I know film students who have lower budgets and lesser known actors who can do a lot, a lot better. For example, given that some people involved should know more, some of the shooting facilities were totally out of place and never existed at that time. The waterfall work was awkward - the story bland and hokey. If someone gives you a copy, use it as a coaster. By the way, I like westerns and I have known many stuntmen. I even went to high school with one of the actors, so I was looking for it to be good.
