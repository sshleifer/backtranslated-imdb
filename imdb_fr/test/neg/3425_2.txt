An interesting concept that has turned into carnage ... <br /> <br /> My first article by Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper), when I was interested for the first time, it was at the time an interesting concept ... <br /> <br /> Shakespere + Australian Film + Gothic Frame + Melbourne Gangland <br /> <br /> A very strange mix that has turned into a disastrous piece of Australian cinema that gives bad reputation in my country ... <br /> <br /> Pros: Interesting concept <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Waste of a good cast Consummate and stupid consumption Wrinkled angle of view Little variety of d 'Locations Using a Shakespeare Diologue <br /> <br /> Overall: Shakespere's worst movie attempt in Australia: stick to Baz Lurhman ... or Romper Stomper (WARNING: this movie is dangerous )
