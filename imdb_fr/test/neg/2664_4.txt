James Cagney plays Richard Gargan (nicknamed "Patsy"!), A former gangster who now oversees vexed boys as the new head of a state-run reform school. Tepid genre entry in which Cagney is the whole show; he dominates the picture, but only because there is not much interesting. Jimmy gives exactly what is expected of his character hard, which can be satisfying if you want a quick fix. The direction (by Archie Mayo, though Michael Curtiz helped him) is simple, without being particularly captivating, although the narrative slips into the second half, bringing the film to a disordered conclusion to mix. Reborn in 1938 under the name of "Crime School" and again in 1939 under the name of "Hell's Kitchen". ** from ****
