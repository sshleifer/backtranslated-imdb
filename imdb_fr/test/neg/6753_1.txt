This so-called movie is horrible! Actors can not act. There is no conspiracy. I think they have to start from scratch and film again. I hope they can correct the defects of actor in this film. I would like to see the trailer after the shoot. Maybe there is hope for that. I do not want to hurt feelings, but I think high school students can do a better job. The wardrobe could have been a lot better. Sorry, but it just did not work. I normally enjoy the trailers on this site, but ... I do not find it entertaining. I hope they accept the critics because I think they will get a lot more from the others in this film.
