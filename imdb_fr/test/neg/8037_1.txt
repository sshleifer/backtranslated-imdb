I will repeat - what a stupid scenario. <br /> <br /> Is there anything new on the inside? I do not know who wrote this. But I think this guy has watched all the Hollywood movies, the kids, the family movies ever made ... all the scenes and diluges you can see everywhere. Why are you doing this movie? children as adults? they like gold gold wagons ... and are they positive? they are lucky ... and emotions of course ... without it being possible. o young actors - wow :-). I like when the camera focuses on their beautiful faces? what a shit ... there are 90% better kids movies than this one! It's not a creative or funny film. It's just nothing. <br /> <br /> D.
