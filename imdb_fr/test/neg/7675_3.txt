"Oh, you, pilots, you are such men." "They do not call it the cockpit for nothing, darling." Such a dialogue is just one of the many reasons why The Concorde ?? Airport '79 (or, if you saw it in the UK, where it was dragged as quickly as possible, Airport '80: The Concorde) was the last and by far the least of the series. The film of the disaster was in a desperate situation in the late 70's, with The Swarm having offered a lot of involuntary hilarity and the Beyond Poseidon adventure, When Time Ran Out and City on Fire simply offering plenty of boredom and desperation to find a new version of the genre. is too obvious here. This time, it's a plot, as Susan Blakely's presenter discovers that her billionaire boyfriend, Robert Wagner, is selling weapons to terrorists and North Vietnamese. Naturally, she decides to tell him everything rather than make the story public, but he repels it by explaining: "I am a very rich man. I have everything I could wish for in life. Why compromise him by doing something? so incredibly stupid? "In case she does not buy this line instead of, for example, hiring a hitman to kill her on the ground, he decides to do things smartly by planning to destroy the Concorde while she surrenders. to Moscow via Paris. "I did a lot of things I'm ashamed of, but I'm not a murderer," he insists on how to reprogram a guided missile to destroy the plane. , nothing stupidly stupid there, and when that fails, it sends a jet fighter after, and when that fails, do not even think of looking for something that looks like Logic: This is a real barrel stuff that even the studio has abandoned and that was sold as a comedy in the US after the critics laugh it off the screen. all the appearance of frozen entertainment at big budget, this friendly effort on a small screen (the only one not to be shot in widescreen format 2.35: 1) fails even to give a good appearance to the Concorde. quite a feat. TV veteran David Lowell Rich likely got the job as a director because he was fast, cheap and had already made the TV movie SST: The disaster in the sky, where the supersonic plane of Peter Graves s was found unable to land because of sabotage and the Senegalese flu (which was not intentionally at least, a comedy despite the presence of a young Billy Crystal in the cast) and seemed to be the natural choice for what looks like a $ 14 million TV movie that escaped one way or another in theaters when no one was watching it. <br /> Casting like a bad episode of Hollywood Squares, stars are very rare this time around, and most of the vaguely familiar faces seem to have been gathered from rehab clinics and sitcoms. Alain Delon explains to the Hollywood career that one last shot as a pilot, "Happy Fish" (do not ask it), George Kennedy, leaves the executive suite to occupy the co-pilot's seat, hoping to remind people the other films, while The rest of the set includes a veteran couple from The Towering Inferno (Wagner and Blakely), a soft porn star (Sylvia Kristel, trying to be respectable), a regular of Ingmar Bergman ( Bibi Andersson ?? and she plays the hooker!), David Warner's browser to the regime that has nightmares about the banana, the voice of the devil (Mercedes McCambridge), Charo and his Seeing Eye Chihuahua (" Dohn cheats me, I'm wrong "), Martha Raye and her weak bladder, Jimmie Walker playing sax in his seat and smoking weed in the john (in the few moments he's not busy with Martha Raye), Cicely Tyson embracing her credibility as a mandatory mother with a seriously ill child and a heart frozen in the trunk, owner of the airline Eddie Albert and trophy wife Sybil Danning occupying the best place in the house, Ed Begley Jr in goggles and the Russian Olympic team and their lovely coach Val Avery and his deaf daughter (ahhhh!) during a goodwill tour to the United States (who knew about the boycott?). ). Just to add a touch of The Simpsons to the proceedings, Harry Shearer publishes an article in the same tones that he will later use for Smithers. <br /> <br /> Highlight? Despite the impromptu wedding ceremony during a forced landing, George Kennedy hijacks a missile in search of heat by opening the window, raising his arm (almost twice as fast as the sound!) And in shooting a flare? while the plane is upside down! And then Alain Delon turns off the engines so that there is no "source of heat" for the missiles. ?? Yes, someone has actually been paid for writing this, and someone who has been awarded an Oscar and Munich screenwriter and The Insider Eric Roth (hey, everyone has to start somewhere), although in his Defense is the producer Jennings Lang field. Anyway, what do you expect from a movie that honors stuntmen and ends with a photo of Concorde flying at sunset? Surprisingly, in one of those moments when defeat is not admitted, the studios were used to it, Universal shot about 20 minutes of film about two years later to be included in the TV programs of the network (not included on the DVD). Unfortunately, his box office failure led to the fifth entry in the series, the laugh-riot that would have been Airport 1984: UFO, never taking off. Even more tragically, it is the Concorde used in this movie that crashed in France 21 years later. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and if you wonder what Charo says in Chihuahua in Spanish without subtitles when it's not allowed on board, it's "What do you think? When the revolution comes, I promise you that you will fly as you please, I promise, what a shame, my love, what do they think they are? ")
