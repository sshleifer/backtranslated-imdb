I love these awful films about the 80s summer camp. The best part of "Party Camp" is the fact that it literally has no plot. It simply drops a small batch of "characters" in one location and sometimes things happen. The clich√©s here are unlimited (SPOILERS): the nerds against the jocks, the secret camera in the girls' locker room, the hikers arriving on a nudist colony, the competition in the end, the administrators of the camp secretly excited, and the embarrassing sexual relations insinuations litter everything. The only missing snapshot is the presence of Corey Feldman. This movie will make you laugh, but never intentionally. I repeat, NEVER. One last note, get ready to break your head by looking at the nonsense that is the "dramatic" scene where Jerry Riviera and D.A. share a beer late at night, letting go. The dialogue literally makes no sense and the acting belongs to a high school scene. It's a classic.
