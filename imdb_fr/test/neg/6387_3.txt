South of Hell Mountain is one of the first films produced by the schlockmeisters of Cannon Film. Co-directed by William Sachs, who will later broadcast favorites such as The Incredible Melting Man and Galaxina, the film tells the sad story of a trio of gold thieves who stumble upon a cabin occupied by two women who hide is not worth not worth discovering. The actors (most of whom have never shot another movie) are trying badly but are stuck with the screenplay, which usually makes no sense. Asylum scenes are edited with little effect and are punctuated with ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. In the end, it's a lot of discussion and few others.
