OK, I've already seen Hershall Gordon Lewis movies, but this one really takes the cake, it's really gore and disgusting, not to mention the disgusting way the way the strippers are done, I'm talking wrong to act that makes the 9th plan of the space looks like hamlet, the only thing that saves is the late great late Henny Youngman, owner of the strip club, yeah, take my wife ... , You're welcome. The stripteasers are really sexy for 1972, I think they took over this same plot in Roger Corman's movie; Devastated to kill in 1987.I liked HGLewis's first 100 maniac movie, which was a mini masterpiece, but bad acting, no prizes here, but know it's a movie splashed who paved the way for Friday the 13th, and saw.in the course of a troubling scene, a half-naked stripper has the butt spanked with a meat tenderizer.ugh! morbid stuff here.HG Lewis knocks again. 2 out of 10
