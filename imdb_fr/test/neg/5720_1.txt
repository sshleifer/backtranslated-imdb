I remember the trailer of this infamous Conan spin-off. I saw the movie years later and burst out laughing. Involuntarily! Poor briggite Nielson. His career has never been a chance thanks to Cobra and Red Sonja. The plot of the film is as follows: Sonja (Brigitte Nielson) comes from a tribe of warrior women who were killed by an evil queen, Gedren (Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the orb that the warriors were protecting and uses it to destroy every city she passes through. Sonja goes in search of Queen Gedren and later discovers that Gedren has killed her parents. In her quest, she reluctantly joins Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.), and his foolish servant, Falkon (Paul L. Smith). Together, they go in search of Queen Gedren and the Orb. The acting is mediocre and the action scenes are soso. I mean, Briggite Neilson looks so moved. For someone who has lost all of his family and comrades, Sonja does not look scared at all. Arnold plays his usual stoic role and Ernie Reyes Jr .... what annoying snotty nose snotty he was in this movie! The weak servant Falkon had more personality than those guys. The action scenes are the only redeeming moments of the film, even if they sometimes fall flat. The scene where they fight the mechanical marine creature made me laugh until my ribs were painful. Dialogue is a joke too. It's as if the screenwriter thought that nobody would take the film seriously, so he gave everyone stupid sentences. I can only recommend this movie if you like your epic movies extra campy. Someone else does not bother.
