The American channel AZN TV bought the rights to this film and the network showed it under the title THE PICKPOCKET. <br /> <br /> The film describes a long series of annoying wanderings of a confused and uninteresting guy. This main character, Xiao Wu, does not just walk aimlessly. Unfortunately, viewers unfortunately will soon realize that Xiao Wu has an unparalleled ability to search and remains dormant near the most heinous noises that exist in China. Buckets of empty cans hit with a stick - he is there. All the old dying Chinese engines - he's here. A crying baby? Yes, you guessed it, it is there! According to THE PICKPOCKET, China is the most irritating place on planet Earth. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the sound of THE PICKPOCKET is photography. The camera shakes, shakes and shakes again. Finally, the camera remains motionless, then falls to the actor's lap and stays there until a member of the team makes the mistake and starts shaking the camera again. Most shaky films are framed in distant, long, long, and long shots. On the rare occasions when the camera gets a little closer, nothing impressive happens to put the viewer in touch with what is happening. <br /> <br /> The photograph is dark, fuzzy and often fuzzy. The use of color is - well, there is no sign of intelligence controlling the use of color. Most shots are held 20 times too long. Few movies are so painful to watch. This film is painful to watch and painful to hear. And then it just ends. <br /> <br /> Fans of John Woo might enjoy hearing part of the soundtrack of DIE XUE SHUANG XIONG (THE KILLER), the main character dragging for several minutes in front of a video store. Anyway, be warned - THE PICKPOCKET will steal you the good time.
