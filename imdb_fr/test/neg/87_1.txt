I can not believe the high ratings this movie has given to this movie on this site. The writing is incredibly bad with people arriving at the right time and revealing exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape. (Do not hate when this happens?). And the acting is so, very bad, that the whole landscape that we chew can make you a gleam in the eyes. <br /> <br /> A nut holds her hostage, the kids are out of the open screen, so she moans instead of shouting, she's had the courage to break windows to scream at those same kids. <br /> <br /> She is finally free and alone at home. Her chance to get help, so what does she do? Walk around the house and go to bed. She is in the basement, locked up. So what is she doing? Take a nap. Come on! Most of the film is the madness that goes away and finds her sitting dozing when he wakes her up. Four times! What? If the author is too bored to write a real plot, why should we be careful? I think the key here is that it was originally a play for the radio. So they chose the heroine who sat there rather than pretending to be a writer and write an action. <br /> <br /> And the end of the movie It's horrible. <br /> <br /> The film is completely implausible, horribly written and almost comically played. Watch out for this movie at all costs!
