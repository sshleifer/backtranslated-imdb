After having problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moved to an isolated farm in North Dakota to start anew, but their idyllic farming endeavors were disrupted when their teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her brother Ben aged 3 years are starting to see. and being attacked by supernatural beings who do not allow them to live in peace. <br /> <br /> The Messengers start decently, though it eventually becomes a generic horror movie that is much more humorous than frightening. After reading the premise, I thought it could have been a decent movie since it looked scary and had potential. Unfortunately, the film did not live up to its possibilities, although I should have expected since the trailer was awful. The scenario was probably the worst. It was full of stupid sequences and bland dialogues. The characters were not developed at all and most of them acted like idiots, so it was difficult to feel sympathy for them. <br /> <br /> The directors did a horrible job creating a suspense. They relied mainly on cheap alerts, such as loud noises and random jumps. The music was really exaggerated and it simply allowed the viewer to telegraph the next "scary" moment. I did not like the fact that they used just about one place for the whole movie. The house was the centerpiece of the story and that's where most of the shooting took place, so it became a little boring to see the same area after a while. In addition, I did not like the close-ups of the actors. During a conversation, the camera shook continuously from one character to another within five seconds and it became really annoying. The directors have created a decent atmosphere and some points allow them to make their film elegant. However, as we have come a long way in terms of style and effects, it is not so difficult to make your film enjoyable, especially if you are working on a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was atrocious and If this movie was released in December, I'm sure he would have received several nominations at the Razzies. Kristen Stewart has shown talent in Panic Room, but you could not say that she has talent in watching her play in The Messengers. She could play fear and that's all. The rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was horrible when it came to everything. It looked like she was reading her lines and had some of the worst facial expressions I've ever seen. Dylan McDermott was just very wooden and he showed almost no emotion. John Corbett gave the best performance and he had some good scenes. The twins who played Ben were also decent and managed to play a lot of adult actors. Overall, this lame horror movie is not worth watching because of its blandness and slowness in making movies. Note 4/10
