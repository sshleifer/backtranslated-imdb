I do not know what today's moviegoers expect, but after 68 years watching movies. (Well maybe I did not watch a lot of movies in the first 9 to 10 years, so do those 58 years of cinema). to entertain, not to be bored with tears, assaulted by silly blasphemies (words) and scenes of violence that are presented only for the purpose of showing splashes of blood and mutilations of parts of the body. Surveillance is one of those films that were made by people WITHOUT imagination, little or no talent, a total inability to associate scenes and an unreasonable trait to let a scene perpetuate, long after the end of the goal. Let anyone think that it's a movie worthy of interest, when nothing is more than Hollywood rubbish overtakes me. As a veteran, I have seen violence, blood and blood in many forms, and films like "We were soldiers" are about as violent as a film can be, but they have a reductive value. The surveillance must have been imagined by narcotics, without writing capacity, without training of director, without experience in film editing and without any contact with reality. Just a stupid movie of two serial killers pretending to be FBI agents, preparing a scenario to kill stupid policemen, Gules, etc. A waste of great value that only an idiot could like ...
