I had a bad series of movies. This is a clinker on a plot of arson and a psychopath. Tom Skerrit, whom I really appreciate, was very young here. He is a passionate builder, but he has a partner whose for-profit purpose is to over-insure and burn. An agent, who is drowned, his daughter and her dark boyfriend enter the mix. James Mason plays the insurance investigator. Any idiot, warned a little, would know that something is rotten in the Australian nation. Yet, they buzz their way. The most interesting thing to me was that the huge hotel that was going to be built never got past the stadiums. Small budget, I guess. The plot could have been interesting. Maybe they should have hired an editor (did it?). Half the time, you do not know where the characters are, but I guarantee you that a payment of five million dollars would probably have made a close monitoring of the structure mandatory. It does not work Although there is a lot of fire.
