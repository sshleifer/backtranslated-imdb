The film is ideal for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. Only 1 piranha. Beautiful landscape. The only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end when Caribe drowns is a must-see accessory in Hollywood. There is no defined scenario. This goes from the Venezuelan landscape to the easy rider's scam to diamond mining and the ruthless hunter who goes crazy for whatever reason that gets him to the end. A very small budget movie that could have been shot anywhere with Venezuela releases. William Smith is a very talented actor who has made very good films. Like all actors, they must all have at least one bad movie. Do not waste the $ 5 on the DVD.
