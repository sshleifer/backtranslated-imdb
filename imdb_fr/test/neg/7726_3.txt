I was on a mission to watch Uwe Boll's films to see if they were really as bad as all that. The first one I saw, BloodRayne, was not a total loss. I liked it more than most people, and in fact I rated 4 out of 10. The next movie was the first House of the Dead movie. Now it was horribly bad. I could stand to watch ten minutes and move a little, and that was it. I could see where this was going and I did not need to see it to give a rating of 1 in 10. <br /> <br /> But I also had access to the suite (which However, it is not is not Uwe Boll, but, mysteriously, written by the same people who wrote the first so incompetently), and as he got a higher score at IMDb than the original, I thought I could give him a chance. And I managed to watch everything. It started with fun references and cool words (like how the president got his orders from the vice president!), And in terms of action, he's better than the first in light years. Here we have nice muchachas like Emmanuelle Vaugier, a very hot woman, whose freshness is at the rendezvous with Carrie-Anne Moss, Claudia Black and Evangeline Lilly. Dude, I hope a Matrix-style movie will join her someday. And the always delectable, super-aerobic Victoria Pratt. I love sports women. And there was also Nadine Velazquez (Catalina in "My Name Is Earl"), who performed very well. <br /> <br /> The story was not long and the action was not great either, and the end was a disappointment because they failed their mission. Well, at least both forces have survived. I guess it's also a small victory. <br /> <br /> A good cast, but a very bad movie. The actors make it visible, but there is no real content. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
