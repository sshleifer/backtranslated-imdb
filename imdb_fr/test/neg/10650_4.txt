Rarely seen a film which deviates as much from the original premise and which remains always (more or less) acceptable. Bloodline is a pretty short getaway (which is a good thing in this case) that focuses on the mysterious Hellraiser box. Who wanted this to be done and how did it cast a spell on the whole lineage of the man who finally created it? We met 3 generations of the Merchant family (all played by Bruce Ramsey); one in the 18th century in Paris, one of our days and the last in a future galaxy far, far away ?? Opinions on this scenario may differ a lot - either you think it's very silly and far-fetched, or original and daring. The original atmosphere and staging of Clive Barker has completely disappeared, but the surrounding morbid remains and several sequences remain very frightening and disturbing. Hellraiser: Bloodline contains a lot of exquisite slaughter and the charismatic presence of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) is always an additional horror value. Pinhead ?? accompanied by a pet puppy this time ?? always knows how to kill, too bad that he talks too much and that his vicious speeches quickly become boring. The best aspects of this production are the newly introduced "cenobites" and the occult Parisian portrait. The weak scenario, the lack of typical macabre humor and the lack of references to Barker's initial masterpiece are formidable obstacles. <br /> <br /> Although it is not very memorable, Bloodline is the latest movie of Hellraiser. After this sequel, the series has completely deteriorated. So far, 2 other suites have been released (2 others are being processed) and none of these deserves to be seen. Hellraiser: Bloodline was suffering from many production difficulties and the director finally preferred to be credited with Alan Smithee, which means he does not want to be remembered as a director. Who could blame him?
