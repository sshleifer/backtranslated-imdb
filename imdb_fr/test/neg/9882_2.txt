The only reason I did not delete this movie after 20 min is because we've already lost 20 minutes ... <br /> <br /> the only one and I repeat the ONLY effect they used is a strange kapoera (from India?) jumping on a wall of half a meter / trash, I mean, the effects do not make a movie, but ... damn it .... my friend and I were hoping that the whole movie produces a real effect (a huge wolf?! something!?>!?!) but noooooooooooooooooo ... all we have is a jump! on a 0.5 meter wall + they used the pharmacy ..... and they found guns ?! in the pharmacy ?! I mean what the heck? oh I forgot, there was another effect - contact spears as green eyes! every 10 minutes, we shouted "the only thing that can save the film from shame, it's a giant wolf that kills them all !!!, except for the terrible scenario that you do not know who you'd like to die in first, in fact, pray (and I mean PRAY!) that the "good ?!" dies, hopefully at the beginning. <br /> <br /> do yourself a favor and send letters to erase the film of all the archives of the world.
