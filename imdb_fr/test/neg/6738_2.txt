It must be Steven Segal's worst film I've ever seen (even worse than the eco-piffle like Deadly Ground Down Under Fire). I'm going to start with the positives ..., he has an elegant direction for a digital TV movie and beautiful scenery ... that's it! The story is not really going anywhere, it's just a panoply of well-prepared pieces, just for Seagal to kill the bad guys (the count of the dead can easily match Tarantino to his bloodiest point!). The plot is unnecessarily complicated and confusing, you forget who are the good and the bad. The acting game (I use the term vaguely) is mediocre at best. I can take the usual Seagal ONE expression and the wooden RPG, but the others, especially the British, were terrible. <br /> <br /> What does the package contain? Why the bad guys after? Is Seagal setting up? <br /> <br /> WHO DOES SO ***! <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie at my local Blockbuster (once I paid), the assistant mocked me and said it was the worst film in the shop that I could have chosen! (I wanted to hit him until my arm became numb) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have not seen Half Past Dead or Out yet. dead and I do not dare to go back for more humiliation in my store, but they can not be worse than this turkey <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is supposed to be young and trendy - That's me gave the impression of staying Swedish for half a dozen asprins. <br /> <br /> All in all this, Seagal is at its worst! The guy who has won about 100 pounds and looks good, is a guy who does not know when to stop, he should withdraw gracefully NOW! and try yourself behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something like that. <br /> <br /> My rating 2/10 (1 point for the landscape)
