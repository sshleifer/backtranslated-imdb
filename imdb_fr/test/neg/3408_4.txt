Solange is not a great Italian thriller. Get ready for the spoiler - the main suspect, the teacher, did not do it. But is it really a spoiler? No, because you know he could not be the murderer from the start. he and a student witnessed the first murder. So, there is absolutely no suspense as to whether the professor is the killer or not. There is a long and tedious construction until the final explanation of the mystery. The solution is interesting, but it comes from nowhere. The rest of the film (and it's not a short film) is just not exciting enough to hold your interest. Even in the tradition of "false accused man", this fails because the police never seriously accuses the professor and the murderer is never in pursuit. Dull, dull, dull.
