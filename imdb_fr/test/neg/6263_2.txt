The massacre of cheerleaders was supposed to be the fourth installment of the Slumber Party massacre series; if that's what they did (what he considers an actress among the first returns in a small role), they failed miserably and made, by far, the worst episode of "quadrilogy". Cheerleader Massacre seamlessly combines a bad action, a horrible plot, a stupid killer, boring and boring deaths, boring landscapes and hideous camera work to make it one of the worst movies ever made. Have I already mentioned how bad it was? Do not misunderstand me: this lame and delayed excuse for a horror movie has nothing to envy to Napoleon Dynamite, but it is undeniably a horrible movie. Massacre of the slumber party. Stay away by all means! This movie is a trash!
