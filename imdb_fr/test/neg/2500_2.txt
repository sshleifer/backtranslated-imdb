It's strange, as the film features X-rated sex scenes and violent murders, it's never as shocking as it should be. <br /> <br /> A group of scientists goes to a Caribbean island to investigate an incident radioactivity. Upon arrival, a mutated islander tackles the happy business of killing men and his way with women. It does not seem to always work that way. <br /> <br /> Sly acts include lesbian encounters, a three-way conversation with prostitutes, heterosexual couples and the rape of a dead body. Even though everything is completely explicit, he never manages to shock or move as he should. As soon as sex becomes completely pornographic, he simply loses his advantage; the suspension of disbelief is broken and we realize that we are just watching people have sex. <br /> <br /> There is blood and blood in the murders, but since it's an Amato movie, it's really tamed. For a much more complete experience, look at the similar "Erotic Nights of the Living Dead". <br /> <br /> 2/10
