42/100. Often called "Tarzan with clothes", but it's not at all in the same league as his much superior series, Tarzan. Basically, the Jungle Jim series became a Tarzan replacement for Johnny Weismuller, after he began to become too deformed for a loincloth. In Jungle Jim, he is fully clothed. It can in no way be compared to the Tarzan series, nor in terms of acting, scenarios or the quality of production. It's pretty hokey. This one is the first, the best of the series, and that does not say much. Too many archive footage is used, and it's so obvious. The score is excessive, the plot is lame and the production is so mediocre that it is difficult to watch at times.
