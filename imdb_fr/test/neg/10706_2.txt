They used images of a real splice protest with a woman who spoke of a society without men to give the impression that these people were enthusiastic about the "genocide" of men. The funny thing is that you can see a man applauding his own death in the background. <br /> <br /> OK, the plot. A lady says there should be a society without men and the crowd in front of her (which contains men) thinks it's a great idea. So, all men are killed or something. So, there are no more. <br /> <br /> Then, this blond scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so that he can not be violent. The male grows very fast and quickly becomes an adult man. Shortly after, he takes the 'Volkswagen beetle' of the blonde and goes to the city where he was discovered. Now, one would think that the only man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy ever, The police pursue him. <br /> <br /> I have not looked at others, but it's probably they have to run against the clock and some people, otherwise something serious will probably happen. One way or another, the man finds himself in a stadium with other men who want him to lead the rebellion. Those brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some kind of plan that explained how they would get rid of a planet full of women, but I did not look. And you should not do it either. <br /> <br /> If you're late and you're surfing on chains and it's not happening, do not look. Look at something other than that. You'll find these ads for Bowflex or those with women in swimsuits asking you to "pick up the phone to meet women like these" in your area will be more satisfying entertainment. <br /> <br /> (Oh yes, there's this fun thing when they come in with their cars, I do not know what they did, it looks like they've been driving very slowly and cautiously, but they then tried to speed up the movie to make up for it, but it looks really weird.) <br /> <br /> The blonde girl was pretty cute and I feel generous, so ... 2/10.
