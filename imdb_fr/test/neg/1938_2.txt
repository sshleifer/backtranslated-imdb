I did not watch every episode of Jackass. It was slightly fun if nothing else happened. But after watching Jackass # 2, I liked Bam and Dunn. They had a good attitude in the idiot of the film, so I thought I would tune in Viva la Bam. Boy was I was wrong. Seriously, you can pair a group of 2 students in class, provide them with the same budget and I bet they could create something more creative on the screen. I mean, C'Mon MTV !! At 23, where most people are listening, you give us that garbage. <br /> <br /> Everything seems so constrained. You do not know the characters because there is no attitude at all. You can not appreciate Bam or Dunn, or anyone else. If there would be just a tiny amount of thought. All we will not forget from the next shot. <br /> <br /> They finally succeed in creating a good shot and you like what happens. You sit waiting for their reaction, then an idiot closes the scene with two lame sentences and a bang. Was it the end for this blow or what, please? If I had been there, I would panic and laugh. Do crazy things and get my adrenaline up but these guys ... I just programmed stupid reactions. <br /> <br /> Yes, they get some laughs from the public with rude or cheap jokes, or gigantic jokes that, in my opinion, are such a waste of money. <br /> <br /> Many normal humans who have not been taken under the Jackass wing could in the blink of an eye write a much more funny script. Or impress with the work of the video camera. Even spontaneous cool guys, without script, would do a better job. MTV could, on a whim, bring more calming content to the screen. You just have to send the author of this stupid show. <br /> <br /> Some scenes actually require a little courage and therefore two stars.
