A largely forgotten story in which the mercenary Kerman and his employer Agren go to the jungle in search of the missing sister of Agren. <br /> <br /> Despite its links with the cannibal film family, this film is more than an extreme version of Ren√© Cardona's "Guyana - Crime of the Century". Lenzi's goal is clearly to exploit Jonestown's (then) slaughter of a zealous, loyal fanatic with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) Leading his motley crew into a forgotten forgetfulness inflicted. Kerman and Agren try to stop the rot, but after several failed coups, they end up escaping into the "Green Hell", then hit the locals and their notorious appetites. <br /> <br /> One of the many excessive blood festivals that emerged in the late seventies and early eighties, where every new recruit seemed to be embarking on a bidding competition with his predecessor, trying to design the most bloody and graphic display ever presented to movies. . This lower slice uses all the patterns and gimmicks of others, but with much less success. <br /> <br /> Was it the so-called "indigenous Amazonians" that looked like Bollywood releases (this film was shot locally in Sri Lanka), or the scenes of "beheading" and "castration", inept, who seriously undermined the authenticity that was apparent in "Cannibal Holocaust"? You can decide. Without spoiling the conclusion, it seemed that Lenzi was putting more emphasis on his climax of shock and fear than on the basic requirement for a consistent end, where all the difficulties are solved. Very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> As for others, where the scale of graphic representations of violence against human beings is limited (fortunately), filmmakers spared no effort to inflict the worst cruelty possible to unfortunate animals. continuation of the most sadistic shocks. Unfortunately, the only thing shocking about this movie is that it deserves mention among others, which makes the subject more convincing. <br /> <br /> If there are any usable features, Kerman is an affable but a bit one-dimensional man, and his multitude of slightly dressed co-stars (Agren, Lai and Senatore) provide a visual respite in the wake of the ruthless killings.
