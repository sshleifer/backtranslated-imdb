Plants in an ancient Mayan pyramidal structure killing all who approach it. Yes, it's weird, because travelers do not realize it before everything goes crazy. And in a film like this, I only wanted it to become absurd and that fanfares assail fanfares, brandishing machetes. <br /> <br /> other newly created German friends who know the place. When they got there, the Mayas started yelling at them and hid in the structure. And at that moment, the plants decide to suppress them, mimicking cell phone noises, humans and ancient Mayan deaths. <br /> <br /> Nothing really scared the film and was not even entertaining. Even the weird end could not save that shit. I was always looking for something really good, but nothing. Never mind. "F"
