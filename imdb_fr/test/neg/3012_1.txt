This show is pathetic. I can not even begin to imagine how a person whose IQ is greater than a tin can containing broken pea soup with an outdated expiry date can voluntarily go through this trash for half an hour . It's one of those rare shows so horrible in every respect that you can honestly say you're less intelligent just looking at it. I conducted a study and found that the average person loses 10 IQ points every fifteen seconds during which they watch this show. Popcultured (19,863,221 IQ lost points per second) is in second place behind another abortion from Comedy Network and pretty much tied with Girls Will Be Girls. The keys of personalities owe each of us an apology. Whenever I watch this parody of a show, I feel sad for society. How is he allowed to continue?
