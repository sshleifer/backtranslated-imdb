Except for Frankie Muniz who talks too quickly to understand (flashbacks in the middle?), This film still can not be scary. The idea with the "Countess" and the story that surrounded her to be part of the story was amusing, but the plot, as well as many secondary intrigues, are not related. Summary of the plot: The killing of ghosts attracts victims through video games. Mixing splashes of blood and special effects to create another bombing would be a horror movie. Ghost buddies look way too much like the ghost of "The Ring Two". The constant and dramatic actor change in everyone's emotions is incredible. Save your money.
