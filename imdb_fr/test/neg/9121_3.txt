I loved the first "American Graffiti" with all my heart and soul, which I considered the best movie about rock'n'roll and the best teen movie I have ever seen. The first film spawned the career of George Lucas, who later directed the epic "Star Wars" before making the fights two decades later, while making Richard Dreyfuss a star in Jaws and Three other types of films. <Br /> <br /> In one way or another, without these two elements, the magic went out. <br /> <br /> "More American Graffiti" shows the audience what happened to other characters later in the sixties when Steve (Ron Howard) and Laurie (Cindy Williams) protest against the Vietnam War while their Friend Terry "The Toad" Fields (Charles Martin Smith) is himself at war and is trying to get out. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is still the California drag drag racer where he never left his house. The other actors in the film, from Candy Clark's Debbie (Terry's girlfriend) to the gang members of the pharaoh, as well as Harrison Ford and others do not do much. The original film showed teenagers roaming the streets without bloodshed with the early music of Buddy Holly's rock n 'roll, The Fleetwoods, Chuck Berry, Domino Fats, Bill Haley and comets, Buddy Knox and more who reported the virus nostalgia in classical music. The soundtrack to "More American Graffiti" is a mix of rock, soul, country, hippie music and everything else that suited the late sixties to manifest, drugs, sacrifices and more. <br /> <br /> After watching "More American Graffiti", he seemed to want to show the audience what had happened after the epilogue of the four main characters of the first movie (except the character of Dreyfuss) where it was not necessary. This film was not necessary either, because I was happy to see that neither Lucas nor Dreyfuss went to bigger and better projects.
