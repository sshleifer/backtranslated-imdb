End of Days, starts pretty well, Arnie plays a cop (a character very similar to Riggs in Lethal Weapon) and the story looks like some kind of serial killer action thriller that will be a good entertainment. <br /> <Unfortunately, this does not work as expected, Arnie is as good as we expected, but Gabriel Byrne, I expect him to choose his roles more carefully. cast as the devil; This is probably the weakest representation of the Dark Lord to this day. <br /> <br /> This film is a little too stupid for me and the final sequence, in addition to being very weak, is visually one of the worst I know. As we have seen in recent years, CGI has been better than that since the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Simply not good enough. 4/10 (watch for it if you have some too, but do not wait too long because it will not deliver)
