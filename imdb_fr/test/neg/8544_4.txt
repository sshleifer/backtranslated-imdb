An expedition group composed of incessant and obnoxious idiots walking through the dangerous African jungle in search of a fortune in diamonds and a missing young woman named Diana (Katja Biernet, gorgeous brunette), wearing only a loincloth lean much of his body curved and warm) who is revered as a goddess by a primitive mortal tribe called the Mabutos. The director / screenwriter, Jess Franco, has absolutely not been able to give style or vigor to the debates, thus leaving the slow step that is allowed him to slip into an often slow sequence and to stage the scenes infrequent action with a singular lack of talent and panache. Lousy dubbing, the excessive amount of granular "National Geographic" animated images, groovy, jazzy parlor score, awful gaming, gossip, storyless narration, warm sex scenes and static photographs do not help not things. Fortunately, there are plenty of good free nudities on sight to ease the boredom to a reasonable extent: besides the delicious Biernert, Aline Mess as a fierce and naughty high priestess Noba and Mari Carmen Nieto as an unfaithful and treacherous Lita are also very easy to live eyes. The beautiful landscape of the jungle is also very nice. But overall, this image is barely visible and therefore instantly negligible.
