First of all, this movie is not nearly finished; I guess it's really someone who has taken the trouble to steal all the other pages of the script. <br /> <br /> The film contains strange time travel without notice, incoherent dialogues, misplaced details Beyond, the music is not very bad, except for lost tracks, and apart from the makes the volume rise and fall between the different tracks. The cutting room did a descent job, and that says a lot. Stray sound effects spoil the tension though. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry does what he does best, he just looks worried and sometimes spits punches from hell. <br /> <br /> I seriously rated this movie as the worst of 2007, and I saw some bad ones. Do not spend money on this one, it's not so bad that it's a laugh, it's worse. Ratings greater than 1 star should generate a blacklist on IMDb because it's a fucking lie.
