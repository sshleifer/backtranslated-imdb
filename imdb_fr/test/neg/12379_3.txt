This largely forgotten 50s monster movie contains really horrible special effects - the "claw" in question is a giant puppet that would make Jim Henson want to kill himself. I just saw the movie last Thursday and I can not even tell you who was there. It's a bad sign. I was told that when the audience featured in the film premiere had laughed at the screen ... and that it was in the '50s, when the standards of special effects were much lower. Basically, I should have left the theater as soon as the words "produced by Sam Katzman" appeared on the screen if I knew what was good for me, but I sat in front of "Harum Scarum" too, so I suppose I deserve it.
