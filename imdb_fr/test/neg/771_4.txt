Someone called it a "horror film", and I think that's fine. That's the concept at least. A group of teenagers, each with their own vice, draw the attention of a twisted barker. He decides to teach teenagers a lesson by integrating them into the show. A good idea, but that could have been better executed. The fate of some teenagers is also manifested to you, while other characters might have been more fleshed out. In addition, the end was a serious disappointment. No resolution or big twist or anything. <br /> <br /> But as a low budget horror movie, it's a lot of fun to watch. If you like Cheese Spookfests, you should laugh at this one. I think one of his faults is that ... it's taken too seriously. It's a stupid film, and if he had been a little more self-conscious, I think it would have been better. But at least there are enough carnival and makeup themes for B-movie monsters to allow you to watch.
