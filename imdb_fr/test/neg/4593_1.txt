"Speck" was apparently destined to be a biopic linked to serial killer Richard Speck. However, there are not many killings in this movie, and none of this is explicitly shown. Perhaps the most disturbing scene in the whole movie is when Speck crushes one of the eight unfortunate nurses into his own bathtub. Yet even this is simply implied and not shown, with the exception of some unconvincing thrusts of Mr. Speck's leg. The most fun part of this movie is probably the voiceover, which should reflect the extremely boring nature of this movie. Every aspect of this movie is horrible. Unless you like boredom, do not worry. This film only lasts 72 minutes, but it feels like an eternity.
