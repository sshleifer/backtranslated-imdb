What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of what talent there was. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez was completely lost and mostly unused. Jon Lovitz was very kindly amusing but useless. Harry Dean Stanton - why bother? And was it just me or can Kari Wuhrer can barely act in this one. <br /> <br /> The story was rather non-existent and really disjointed. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that took place. Do you like the surf "guys" giving up their lives every time they've been threatened in the last half? And if you've never seen them surf once! The setting up of certain scenes took a lot of time, with not enough fallout to make us cum. Nothing in this "movie" seemed really true or authentic. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say is that some (very few) sets were filmed and some scenes were slightly interesting. Do not see it when there are so many better, useless movies.
