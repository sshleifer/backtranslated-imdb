With my two stars, I will probably go to the head of the IMDb channel, I hate her "for this seemingly extremely popular television series. <br /> <br /> Not only because of the enthusiastic comments on this site decided to buy a DVD edition of the series because I generally find that British humor suits me perfectly.I left in the middle of the second part - and according to other comments, the most "amusing" passages were already finished. <br /> <br /> I know now, according to another comment, that I really miss the sense of humor, but then I had to laugh like crazy while watching (and looking at new) Fawlty Towers, to which Black Books is so weakly thematically related Why the different reactions It could be a pure generation thing, and yet the differences can be emphasized. <br /> <br /> Fawlty Towers and Black Books are established in companies intended to financially support their owners. The two companies do not succeed but seem ?? by a miracle ?? to survive. Fawlty Towers is fun because protagonists face situations they can not cope with. The fun lies in the fact that they make a serious effort to succeed and laughing is also sad for them. Black Books has no situations, it's just there and the owner spends his time feeling sorry for himself. If a situation threatens to occur, it is quickly eliminated. It is remarkable how fast and how often a subject is abandoned and the protagonists turn to something completely different to produce an extra joke. Tell jokes ?? and not very good - seems to be all that Black Books is about. Why a bookstore? A hardware store would have done the job just as well. <br /> <br /> No, stop, wait. It is a bookstore because under the veneer of rudeness, vulgarity and arrogance, the protagonists are supposed to be delicate and CULTURED. They are not low altitude gorillas, but semi-intellectual losers. Hey, they are like you and me. The way the series makes this statement is the only way to explain its success. The actions of the protagonist are not surprising, it is the peculiarity of its economically unrealistic living conditions that many viewers may envy. The protagonists who convey a sense of belonging and camaraderie seem to be a hallmark of the era in which the First World lived. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Tittybangbang, a brand new British TV comedy show. . I thought it was funny. It's often pretty bland or xenophobic ?? but always with a purpose and hit the target in his social criticism. Humor is mainly created by situations or characters with a purpose. The low ratings in IMDb might indicate that this brand of humor does not correspond to reality, but I am happy that she is still alive and hopes she will continue to do so.
