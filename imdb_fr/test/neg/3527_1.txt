"Nuts in May" is perhaps one of the worst films I have ever seen. If Ed Wood was still alive, that would be the kind of movie he would do. To think that this film is bad would be the least we can say of the century. But how is it really? Well, here are two levels of bad I pass; "It's so bad it's good" or "It's so bad it's GOD AWFUL". This film falls in this last section. Its unintentional humor does not make up for the slow, hard-to-understand, boring majority of the movie. <br /> <br /> EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Two middle-aged Anglos take a trip to the countryside to R & R and camping, they met Ray (who will soon be Jim) (I will explain later), who has his tent next to our main couple. Throughout the film, the two protagonists go on the beach, in a rock quarry and in other exciting places. Between these adventures, they constantly talk about the environment, vegetarianism, collecting fossils, the duty of the citizen and the appropriate diet, all that I want to see in a comedy. They bore those who will listen to them. The dialogue is not only bad, but the pace of some scenes is so slow that I sometimes felt calm. The scenes would last forever and as they begin to develop and something is about to happen, the scene ends. Halfway through the film, I said to myself: "Nothing will happen in this story, it's really a film about nothing". <br /> <br /> The characters are annoying and constantly repeat things. At one point, I felt that the director was making a cruel joke to his audience. The scene I am referring to is the "Sing Along" scene. Our two boring Britons are listening to us music. In fact, it was the same 4 lines, again and again, again and again. The idea was to get Ray to sing with them, but Ray knew, just like us, that they were the worst known composers of man. This scene was more than painful, the fifth time the song was played, I began to question the existence of a merciful God. <br /> <br /> Words can not describe the atrocity of this movie. The first thing that strikes is the indecipherable British accents that most actors have. Remember the thick Scottish accents in Trainspotting? <br /> <br /> Towards the end, our entangled, incoherent couple argue with Ray's friends who do not respect the rules of the campsite. Our hero gets so furious that a climatic battle ensues between our hero and the hell leader. To settle their dispute, the two men fight each other. It's true a stick fight! Now this is where unintentional humor begins. I laughed so much at the ineptitude of all this that I thought, "It can make up for the other 80 minutes." After this historic battle, our hero runs behind bushes to mourn his eyes and the other man calls Ray calling him Jim for some unknown reason. <br /> <br /> A batting fight, a crying nature that loves 40 years and a 3/4 character name change in the movie, Ed Wood would be proud. <br /> <br /> Even so, I was still forced to endure the last 10 minutes, which end with a long catch of a pig. Why? who the hell knows. At one point, we see a pig graze and at another time, the credits begin to appear on the screen. One of the worst ends for one of the worst movies of all time.
