What is that!? It was my first reaction to this movie (in fact, my first reaction contained more swear words). It's not Star Wars! Star Wars is a space battle, this movie has none. Star Wars is the force, this movie only has a delayed witch with a magic ring. Star Wars is a battle of lightsabers, this movie has no battle worthy of mention. Star Wars is humor, this movie is not. Star Wars is a galaxy far, far away, this movie has HORSES in it !!! In addition to all this, how did Lucas get the crazy idea of ​​letting a five year old baby play the lead role? Big, big disappointment. Do you like Star Wars? Do not look at that! 1 of 10
