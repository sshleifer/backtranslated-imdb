I understand the goal of the director to tell stories that are not stories, but the way he tried to show the time passing (the pair of joggers, who first appear jogging together, that jog with a stroller ( sic! only man ...) and connect the "adventures" of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black on another cliff, then seeing the boat with his former employer and saying " Oh, a boat! ") Were awful and at the same time, I liked the way he described the middle-high class, even excessively, I think it's an ugly movie, if you want to watch it , do it as a student in a film school, trying to see the technical aspects.
