I was 10 years old at Wrestlemania VI in Toronto, and the event I saw at the time was quite different from what I saw on the DVD of the Wrestlemania Collection I just watched. I do not understand why the WWW does not have rights to some of the old music, since most of these songs were created by the WWF. releasing seasonal sets. It's pretty stupid to complain, but for me, hearing Demolition on its musical theme of a Wrestlemania in person was a memory I never forgot, and that did not exist on this DVD. What is the point of owning the rights to this huge library of videos if they have to edit it so drastically to use it?
