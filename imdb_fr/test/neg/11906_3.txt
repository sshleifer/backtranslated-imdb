There is a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre transformed into clutter clichés by filmmakers who had no idea of ​​the purpose of the story or simply mocked. All the defining features of your average family film are younger siblings, a grumpy teenager who does not want to move, unpleasant parents who can not see the appearance, and of course a romantic subplot. The film has very little in common with Wilde's original story, which was largely written to make fun of the gothic melodramatic news that was raging at the time. If Wilde saw this version, he would probably risk - and of course, write a parody. One can only hope that the children who watched this bland and mass-produced film finally discovered the spirit and sparkle of the original version.
