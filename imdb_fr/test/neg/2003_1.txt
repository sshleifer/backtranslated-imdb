It is quite rare that a movie is so useless, that thanks to IMDb, I authorized the use of negative partitions. In fact, I'm thinking about this movie and I really can not think of a film that was so unhelpful. Play: you're kidding. Direction: No A conspiracy: No. This film has nothing to envy a serious movie. This is often the case with movies like this, but most movies of this nature can be viewed as comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic and pathetic the characters and situations are and how much time you make. This film is so empty that it can not even fit that. I have to give this a -1 / 10, three points lower than any other movie I have ever rated. I really think that the staff involved in this film should pay me for the 83 minutes spent watching it. I do not really have the words to describe how bad it is. Nobody should ever look at this for any reason.
