Book of Revelations starts very well. Daniel, an Egyptian dancer, is kidnapped, abused and sexually violated by three masked women. <br /> <br /> Then nothing really happens. There is a hint of rediscovery, but the film gives no explanation or real end. Daniel's reactions after the abuses are very basic. He stops dancing, sleeps with all the women around and ends up establishing a relationship with a very simple and very ordinary woman. <br /> <br /> I saw a good part of the art films of the house but something is missing. br /> <br /> The main tracks are good; but some characters do not seem to be completely defined.
