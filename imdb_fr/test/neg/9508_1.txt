<br /> <br /> The room has been heavily modified and the order of the scenes has been completely mixed. The acting is awful (especially Helena Bonham Carter) and the cinematography is mediocre. <br /> <br /> The result is a slow, confusing and boring film that will instantly bring Shakespeare's newcomers out of Shakespeare! <br /> <If you can not see a play, see at least the Olivier version (1948) instead of this drivel!
