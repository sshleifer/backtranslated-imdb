Not just why? But "what were they thinking?" <br /> <br /> It's a kind of reward for Gus Van Sant, because it's one of those weird movies <br /> <br /> that should never have been (re) shot. This is a Hitchcock film, image by image, but without the magic, the tension and the realization of a great film <br /> <br />. Rent the original instead, save yourself.
