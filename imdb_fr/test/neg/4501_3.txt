"Destroy All Planets" eventually settles down to "destroy all Tokyo" by the end of the film, as a space monster resembling a giant squid falls into the reptilian furnace known as Gamera. In fact, Gamera saves the Earth from the start, eliminating the Varian Space Ship # 1 even before the first set of movie credits. The scene switches to a Japanese Scout camp where we meet two young heroes, Jim and Masao, who take part in the exploits of Gamera after being kidnapped by extraterrestrials and boarded their ship in an electrified bubble shield. <br /> <It's quite surprising to see the boys convince a scientist to let them use a newly invented submarine that may be defective. Previously, Masao's genius had asked the unit to work in the opposite direction of commands, but Dr. Dobie had not thought of checking that. At least, this prepared the boys to interfere with the extraterrestrial spaceship's commands by playing switcheroo with a group of triangular blocks. <br /> <br /> When the boss of Viras, extraterrestrial, says: "Activate the Videotron", hang on your seat for a new treatment images of previous films of Gamera where he fights with Barugon and Gyaos. These take a little time on the screen, but do not match the fast forward button if you want to continue. For a long time, Viras was addressing an invisible team, and when they finally appeared, they were Orientals able to fly - imagine that! <br /> <br /> Seeing how these films were designed for a young audience, it's amazing how some scenes are horrible. Gamera drinking blood comes to mind, and what about the pair of decapitated space team members. When squid tentacles started to emerge from the headless bodies, I created a link with the 'Alien' movies; Making the individual units merge to form the giant Viras was a neat device. <br /> <br /> I guess the attraction for young kids might be to identify with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster, move around freely on an alien spacecraft, and get what they want with the help of extraterrestrial telepathic technology. Seeing that the film was probably shot by adults, it could have been a simple case of making wishes.
