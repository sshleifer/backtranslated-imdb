Horrible, waste of time. There is no camp or garbage value in this one. I have seen better amateur films made by children aged 10 to 12 in movie clubs. <br /> <br /> How can you ruin a movie about vampires and lesbians? <br /> <br /> It's not a film to bring together a few vampire / sadomasochism lovers in the same room and film them. <br /> <br /> Can not find anything positive in the film. There was no conspiracy, no real actors, no real special effects, no humor. Some overweight Goths who are touching can not be called sex scenes. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Well, the graveyard was nice but you had to shoot a vampire movie in the dark. <br /> <br /> The goal was probably good: to make a trashy movie in Ed Wood's mind. The problem is that you can not do a bad film intentionally. It takes talent and effort to make a "real" movie. Ed Wood may have run out of money, but he has certainly made some effort. These guys lacked everything. Ed Wood was a genius compared to these guys.
