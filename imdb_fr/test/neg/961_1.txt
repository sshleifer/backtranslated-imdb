Great story and major actors (Quaid and Ryan), but the film suffers from bad staging, bad script and bad script. The main actors do their part, but can not save the film at all. Hitchcock style thriller / mystery / thriller.Ryan looked so young and so cool in this one though.A decent look for Ryan's big fans .....
