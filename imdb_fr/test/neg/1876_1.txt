It may be for those who participated in summer camps, but it is certainly not an entertaining camp. I went there before, but it did not make me scream with joy. It hurt my head. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is that Bill Murray had hair in the 70s. Yes, and he did not care too much. But for him to run a lot, he should be given a woman in pursuit. <br /> <br /> It's not that some stunts can not be funny. For example, the joke with one of the counselors who always wakes up elsewhere because of the movement of his bed. Instead, it's that jokes and stunts have been misconfigured and executed. It just was not funny. <br /> <br /> It's painful for someone who loves comedy. Others are stuck for life. I wish it was more like Leonard Part 6, but it does not come close. "F"
