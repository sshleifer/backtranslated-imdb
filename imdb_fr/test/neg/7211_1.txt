"Direct-to-video" is a phrase that never looks promising to the consumer, unless it's a direct sequel to the video of something that has gone straight to the video. Despite this, the studios have insisted over the years to publish many movie suites directly on cult hits. I do not think it's even worth mentioning that these are some of the worst tracks of all time, including THE HITCHER II, STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 and CRUEL INTENTIONS 3. It's normal that Scott Ziehl flew ROAD HOUSE 2 as he was also the man responsible for the ruin of the series of Cruel Intentions. Just like his entry into the Cruel Intentions trilogy, Ziehl takes elements that made the first ROAD HOUSE a great movie, and reorganizes them without success. This is not a sequel, it's a complete remake. Different lines of the original are repeated, the plot points cut and pasted, and the scenes are replicated almost from the first. The only thing that could not be reproduced was the incredible fighting scenes, which made ROAD HOUSE what it was. Here we have awkwardly run sequences of battles, which are either too short, too long, and seemingly planned and shot in an hour. Compare that with the battle scenes of his predecessor who seem to have taken months and months to prepare. Ziehl is able to lead the action as he did well with the 2001 remake of EARTH VS. THE SPIDER, but none of the talents shown here manifest themselves in this mess. This is not entirely his fault, because the scenario is very very badly written and awkward. I do not care if something goes directly on video, a good script is always necessary. Someone should keep this in mind while constantly brewing these low budget movies directly on DVD. Pass completely. 1/10
