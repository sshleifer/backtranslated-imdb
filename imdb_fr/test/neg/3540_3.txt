I was really disappointed by this film for which I had a lot of hope. It seems to have been rushed to take advantage of the success of the dumpling comedies at the time (including the "Libeled Lady" of MGM, which featured two identical stars) and the successes of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Three years after the beginning of their relationship, they were always attractive to watch and filled the fire in their scenes together, but a weak scenario and a premature premise wipe out any chance of an excellent follow-up of "Libeled Lady" of the year. previous and two "Thin Man" movies they had done before that. "Double Wedding" tells the story of a clothing factory, Myrna Loy, who intends to dominate the life of her sister (Florence Rice), her future brother-in-law (John Beal), and her own domestic workers (including Sidney Toler and Mary Gordon). When the independent penchant William Powell enters his life, after distracting Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control, Loy meets his match. It seems so far, is not it? Yeah, an interesting premise is missing, it's sad to say, because Loy's character is so one-dimensional that it's hard to like it, let alone seeing Powell fall in love with her, which we know, will arrive soon. This is another attempt to replace a career-minded woman with a new vision of the life she has lived, which Hollywood has often done during her golden years. When Loy says she does not have time to run her business and have a man in her life, it's a groan. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, besides Powell, Jessie Ralph's free spirit is on board. An older, rich, salty woman who helped Loy start her business, has an acquaintance with Powell and can immediately see through Loy's cool claims that she is loath to do so. Rice and Beal are a boring couple, and the fact that Powell stands between them is nonsense. Then, a former wife of Powell introduces herself, which is really not necessary at the end of the story, and the scene of the last wedding (where a crowd of people try to enter the little caravan of Powell) is a weak attempt to bring a joke. (It's funny, though, that Powell keeps getting hit by items Loy wanted to get Edgar Kennedy hit with, These laughs are welcome, because there are so few others.) Powell and Loy would make better in two later comedies, "I Love You Again" and "Love Crazy", which are sophisticated, witty and fun. This film tries to be the three, but ends up being sophisticated.
