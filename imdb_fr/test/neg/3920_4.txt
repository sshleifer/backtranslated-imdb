Cheap, misinterpreted and run without imagination, Flight to Mars is always entertaining despite all that it has against it. A flight to Mars is planned with five people (three older men, Cameron Mitchell as a journalist, and a scientific woman / an obvious interest in love) "maneuvering" the ship. The spaceship arrives there and discovers that very human Martians live there and Technological advances could make the Earth blush. But everything is not rosy in the underground cities of the Martians (here represented some caves and some pieces). The Martians are an endangered planet and one faction wants the Earthmen repair the ship to remove it at the last moment and then mobilize for an attack on Earth and another faction wants to talk about peace and see if it can not persuade the Earth to give them a living space. The special effects here are pretty weak, even for the science fiction standards of the 50's. Complete with slow rocket, pastel / neon extraterrestrial outfit where women wear shorts that would make a lot of blush (except men of course), and a little less offered. Cameron Mitchell is the journalist and is affable for anything else. ite Chapman is gorgeous in very short shorts but adds little range. The rest of the cast is filled with veterans of science fiction, such as Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum, who are doing useful work. It's not a Golden Age sci-fi movie, but it's very easy to watch and watch very quickly.
