I found an old VHS version of this movie at my parents' house so I decided to give it a shot. From the beginning, I did not expect much from this film and I'm happy because overall, the film was not good. <br /> <br /> The acting was very poor, even for a film by Nicolas Cage. A scene with a radio controller is so pitiful that I found it hilarious that this scene is not cut off. The first 30 minutes of the movie had almost no plot developed and I did not know what was happening. <br /> <br /> The story itself could be decent, but the director was just bad or trying too hard to put his own unique touch on the style of the film. I managed to watch everything but I will probably never see this movie again.
