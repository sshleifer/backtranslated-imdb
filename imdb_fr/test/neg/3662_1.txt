This film seemed to have been shot with a videophone, it had very little conspiracy and useless nudity. The film never really got in place or made much sense and for a movie like this, of course, there were useless shots. The director obviously tried to make the film subjective and different, but he never gave enough information about what was really happening, even in the end, I had a mixture of anger and confusion. Confusion due to lack of intrigue and anger because I wanted to recover my two dollars of blockbuster and an hour and a half of my life. They should have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this movie.
