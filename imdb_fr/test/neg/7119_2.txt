My best guess is that this work will be released on DVD sometime before Christmas. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible. The timeline jumps everywhere. It would not be so bad if it left a bit of suspense for the end. It was quite predictable. The sluts choose the pariah, the pariahs want to know why they hate her so much, the sluts die of a terrible death, a pariah girl goes home and looks crazy. The excluded girl has brought evil spirits with her, makes the neighbors crazy and kills herself. Scary child understands what is happening. Oh, and the younger sister is not good enough for Mom, a sick mother who sends a younger daughter to bring the golden child back home. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there have been good times here and there. First, the character of Sarah Michelle Geller dies in the first minutes. Certainly more. I did not see that one coming. I did not expect the woman to pour bacon fat on her husband's head either. If the film had kept this kind of thrills, I would have loved it. The beginning was so promising. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because I enjoyed the first one. It made me jump, I did not expect much of what happened, and even though I questioned some of the movies, it was still a fun watch. I did not look at any insights for this sequel, because I wanted to be surprised. I was, but in the wrong direction.
