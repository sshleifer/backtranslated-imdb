It's officially the terrible, boring, silly and ridiculous movie ever created. The film talks about a crazy kid and his friends, and they land a 747. His dreams are very tacky and make no sense, and are very badly done. Each special effect seems to have been created without any modern technology and could have been created by the child who plays the "main role" in the film. If you watch this movie, you will certainly be stupider. I advise you never to watch this film, and if you want it, good luck and do not miss the brain cells that you have killed. My comment does not even fully understand the terrible creation of hell that has been made. The person who wrote the comment before me did not watch the same movie that I watched terribly and wish I had never watched it. Peace.
