I really could not get into this movie. The plot is that an old woman has tortured someone for so long that it is deformed. She dies and is left in the basement to starve. It takes months and a family settles. The girl is blind because of an accident caused by the father. Anyway, this guy in the basement who, for all rights, should be dead for a long time, is still there. He's eating a cat and is now superhuman. He now wants to eat people and have sex. And when a prostitute dies, the father is blamed. I do not always like movies where someone else is blamed for the murders because you always have here the typical lines "I did not do it", "I could never do such a thing", blah blah blah. And family history could be a movie story for life.
