Awesome. Another foreign film that thinks it's Fellini. On top of that, we need to have more propaganda on the killing of people with disabilities. <br /> <br /> I see no reason why we should be inundated with these barely disguised euthanasia advertisements. <br /> <br /> I found nothing redeeming about this movie. What can be redeemed in a man who does not have the courage to continue despite adversity? It does not take courage to commit suicide. It's the action of a coward. Sharing this "wish" with his wife simply inflicts the same illness as him. If it had been a film about a man's courage to continue despite his problems, as in Jill Kinmont's story, it would have made an excellent film. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in Seeing Courage, watch the movies about Jill Kinmont, the former skier who was disabled after a bad ski accident.
