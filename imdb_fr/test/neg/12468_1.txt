Eghads, what a bad movie. Tart is perhaps the worst film I've seen all year, and I've met dozens of people. There is nothing redemptive about this basket, from the characterization to the direction of the plot. Even the brilliant Dominique Swain could not save this movie. None of the characters is, to say the least, friendly, with the possible exception of Eloise (beautifully described by Lacey Chabert, the only positive point of this lamentable failure). <br /> <br /> ******* Possible Spoilers ******** <br /> <br /> Tart's main problem is that he keeps walking without anything say. He stumbles about the drunkard instead of leading us on the path of history. He also introduces many potentially enticing details (the hypochondriac brother, the mother's property being constantly taken over, the anti-Semitic comrade, the murderer's father of the other comrade) without exploring any of them. And just when I finally thought there might be some sort of resolution for the characters, the movie would collapse to a violent end unexpectedly. with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated. This is an obvious first film from a screenwriter / director who really needs to spend more time with more established filmmakers before returning his work to an unsuspecting audience. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 1 out of 10, and I'm usually very generous, even with bad movies.
