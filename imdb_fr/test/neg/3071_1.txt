who reads these comments may think we can have a good movie on hand. I am Portuguese and I am ashamed that this film has become a blockbuster in Portugal. He can not really call this cinema. The staging and staging are basic (even Ron Howard does better!); the script is bad and pretentious (a really bad Tarantino); the cast is covered with TV stars, models, and reality TV stars who do nothing about acting. When you put in a movie, these ingredients will of course be seen by fans of this type of TV shows. I am also surprised that the people who comment here in IMDb say that this film is a masterpiece. I thought this site was for people who really like movies and understand some of them. All films designed to become blockbusters in Portgal always use the same ingredients and are always horrible. if you think this movie is reasonable, please do not tell your love movies and movies.
