I write this while watching the DVD. I grabbed the laptop and went to IMDb during the first song. I did not know anything about the movie except that a friend said the show was supposed to be good. He also has a good Netflix rating, so I'm here. <br /> <br /> Maybe it worked on the stage. But I must say that seeing choir boys dance and sing completely naked seems ridiculous. And the lip sync on a prerecorded score adds to the strangeness. <br /> <br /> Most songs and routines deal with aspects of male nudity. This is my idea of ​​nothing, sorry. The score, to this day, is a generic music of show tune. Nothing memorable, nor particularly melodic. Everything is at the service of words. Which, I must say, seems to have been written by a committee. Each song is essentially a prolonged joke. If the jokes lasted ten seconds, they could work. These jokes of several minutes do not do it. <br /> <br /> I watch the film by chapters, a few minutes before understanding the essential. A little in the hope that one of them will be different or entertaining enough to prevent me from moving on to the next scene. No. <br /> <br /> Okay. I'm done. So here's what I think. If you have experience or long-standing knowledge of musical theater, avoid this: it's simply not quality. If, however, you are a young gay of about twenty and you have never seen or heard a musical, you may be entertained. Or maybe it would hold your interest if you have never seen a lot of attractive naked men. <br /> <br /> I have.
