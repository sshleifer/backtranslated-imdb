From time to time, a movie occurs purely by accident, which makes you doubt your sanity. We just finished the study of the novel "Northanger Abbey" at school and decided to refresh our memories with this piece of nonsense without any fun with the adaptation of the BBC. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that it makes you want to kill you. The film is NOTHING to look like the book, for example, the subtly perverted characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe looks like a leprechaun under acid while Isabella plays the role of bitch. Catherine, the main character, is the most depressing and irritating actress in the world (she looks like a coffee addict, her eyes are like basketballs) while Mr. Tilney looks like a porn actor at the time. retirement. The plot will completely derail at certain times of the film, I do not know what the devil thought the director when, for no reason, a black kid of 7 years that we had never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and begins to waggle in front of her. Yes, it's true, freewheeling. This fantasy is sometimes interrupted by the "fantasies" of the Catherines in which an ogre transports it around a cathedral. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey is essentially a visual euthanasia, so if you want to murder your boss or something like that, the BBC have basically discovered a new way to kill someone. Northanger is a barely ridiculously bad movie. Do not look at it unless you are in a padded cell.
