At the time of the release of this film, in 1996, director Mark Lester had been making small, tight-edged action B movies for over 20 years. He was responsible for the big "Truck Stop Women" of the 70s and several other small jewels. unfortunately, he is also responsible for this failure. It's a shame to see the talented - and still smoking - Theresa Russell once again lost, but she remains the best actor in this picture. Eric Roberts arrives for a while, does his thing with Eric Roberts, then leaves, which is not totally inappropriate on a picture with Eric Roberts. Frank Stallone is really not bad, which should give you an idea of ​​how pathetic this picture is. As has been mentioned by other critics, the action scenes - that's why a picture like this was taken first - are almost completely illogical and unrealistic, in addition to being something not very inept. Apart from some "vintage" clothes and some old cars, there is no sensation for the 1930s, the time in which this film takes place. A scenario composed of numbers, with logical errors and minimal historical precision - this is not a documentary, of course, but the filmmakers could have at least TRIED for a bit of authenticity - and performances going from level B at the elementary school relegates this little quick hit instead of 4am Sunday on HBO, which is exactly what I saw.
