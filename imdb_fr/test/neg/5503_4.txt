The initial opinion I had planned for this film was perhaps a little too hard; I'll start with the good: Sleepy Hollow is a beer-pizza and pizza movie or a quite acceptable pajama party, the kind you look at with a good band when the mood is light and nobody really focuses on the film. The visuals are beautiful, and it's partly fun. But the horror, my friends, is not. I made the mistake of looking at him expecting something that shivered with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I will suggest a list of alternative recommendations. (This is a serious offer, by the way, real horror fans deserve better.) Now, my complaints, with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother to shoot a film "based" on a classic story remain faithful the sense, feel, tone or theme of the original? Listen carefully between the lines of a poorly written dialogue and you will hear Washington Irving's slow rotation roll into his grave. I'll even accept the little Big-City detective, but ... Ricci drawing protective hexes around the bed? Come now. Not only is there nothing similar, even vaguely, in "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," but it's historic BUNK. I do not care about the neo-pagan ax that you have to grind, but in the 18th century, "witchcraft" meant selling your soul to the devil in exchange for evil powers; This mellifluous approach of the goddess of white witches venerating "without fear" to witchcraft dates back historically to about as far as the British invasion. (If you do not believe me, parties interested in the true pagan practices of the old school are referred to James Frazer's "The Golden Bough.") This creates an element as discordant in the context of the film as the film itself The hollow legend is broken. So we end up with a totally different story. If that was Burton's idea, I would have liked him to warn us in advance. In addition, I would like it to offer a better story than the one that is rather pedestrian. And he might as well have dropped Irving's claims. And, in any case, the film is not scary. Not once. Not at all. The deformed tree was getting closer, but was more than counterbalanced by the laughable effect of the farce comedy of Hesse. And finally, yes, I too wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God clearly never wanted her to be blonde.
