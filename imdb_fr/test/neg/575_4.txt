First of all, Blythe Danner does not look very young to play Capshaw's daughter (and in fact, she is not - only ten years apart). <br /> <br /> these magical supernatural novels, type Moonstruck, but it exceeds the limits. Very, very weak in terms of action, scenario and staging. <br /> <br /> The only one who really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this film visible - without being really credible herself, as she is considered a heterosexual hound. But endearing anyway. In fact, DeGeneres and the skin photos of the young man that Capshaw loves make this event watchable. But no one can really say if Capshaw is really in love with the young man or not; neither the script nor its interpretation brings it together for us and we are left wondering how it really feels.
