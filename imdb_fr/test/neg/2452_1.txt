When I think of TV movies, I always think about this movie, I've seen it a few times on Sky Movies, it was terrible. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I saw this movie, was watching, and found it here: -S. <br /> <br /> A microbiologist (Linda Flemming) goes on vacation with her son (William Flemming) to this resort with Paul Johnson (taxi driver / bar owner?) and Kathy Johnson. <br /> <br /> It's a little romantic, William starts to fall for Kathy and Paul falls in love with Linda. <br /> <br /> A guy faints in a street, he has a mark on his arm, Joseph (Joseph was a diver on the high seas, who during a dive, saw a light, or something of the kind, and who has become religious), he says take care of this person, there is a gap in my memory, then there is a major outbreak of the virus, I think Linda offers help, to find a cure , Kathy is infected (William notices a mark on Kathy's arm), along with the virus, also makes Joseph. <br /> <br /> Paul says a few lines to Joseph, then Joseph stumbles, the next time you see Joseph, he's healed, how, this information is used to cure the infected, and then there's a party at the beach, the end.
