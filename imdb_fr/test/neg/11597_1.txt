A group of ecologists goes to an island to discover a secret laboratory experimenting on animals. When they arrive, they discover they are late. Apparently, the government had a scientist test his experience on a komodo and, yes, you guessed it, a cobra that made them grow. I'm not sure this movie really deserves or deserves to be explained because it's almost identical to Curse of the Komodo, which is also nil. The computer effects are still colorful and the komodo roars like a dinosaur that really pissed me off. Like Boa vs. Python, this movie is not worth watching and is as fun to watch as it is to nail a table. To avoid!
