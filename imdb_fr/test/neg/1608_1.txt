It's so bad that I can not tear myself away. I keep asking myself, "Why?" "Why?" with each scene. <br /> <br /> There is no continuity, but again if you want to make a very openly homosexual movie with a fetishistic attitude toward Big, Big Boys, Big Planes, then you do not worry about things like plot or character. I am confused and very concerned that the CAG is so similar to Richard Pryor. It seems wrong to put a similar Pryor in such a terrible movie. But I can not tear myself away. This film is the first movie I have ever seen. That's how incredibly bad and weird it is. This motivated me to join this site. I counted 50 main characters. Maybe if I was stoned, I could follow that, but as it stands now, I feel like I'm in a sort of endless bad dream, where we're still in 1988 and where we were the biggest cocktry on earth.
