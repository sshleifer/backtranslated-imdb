This is the worst pretense exercise of the middle class to have not yet hit on our TV screens. Unfortunately, I did not see it when it was first introduced, but I paid for the joy of watching six hours of dreadfully awful - and I'm still waiting for the laughter to come. I love Tasmin Greig, who is a big fan of Black Books and Green Wing, so I know she can do the best of it. However, she played this role as well as she was able to account for the lack of decent comedy material. Broadcasters should not forget that the Trade Descriptions Act may well be invoked if you continue to portray as a comedy a pseudo-psychological romanticism at best, and at worst a drama that behaves like an original comedy to hide the makes it not a fish or a bird.
