Peter Crawford discovers a comet colliding with the moon. But when the government does not believe it (stupidity # 1). He builds a shelter in the basement and draws lots to see who will go. More is ready to kill to save humanity (makes stupid # 2). With millions of dollars in technology, how can a civilian see what NASA could not do? Moreover, the end justifies the moral means of this story is simply FALSE !!! This film is improbable and totally incredible. What was going through the minds of these people, why on earth do piles of shit like this have the green light? Sometimes I wonder who is forced to make a film in this city.
