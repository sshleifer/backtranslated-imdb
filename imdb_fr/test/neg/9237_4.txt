For one has nothing to do with the first absolutely fantastic movie. And of course, we Americans have to do it all over again in English, because the subtitles are SOOOOO Hard is not it? From what I could see in the new trailers of Jessica Alba, a pregnant and adorable woman (it is certain that all the fantasies of teens spoil for sure!), It looks EXACTLY the same but the budget is probably doubled. I thought the original was one of the best horror / suspense / mystery movies I've seen in all languages ​​for a very long time. I would recommend looking at this one and jumping this one together, there's no reason to look at it because there's no reason it's even called "The Eye 2" except to capitalize on the excellence that was the first film. Do yourself a favor watching "The Eye" with increased volume and get ready for a likely jump. I watched it with headphones and was pleasantly surprised by the excellence of the Pang brothers. If "The Eye" remake behaves well, which I hope to do well in the interests of Pang Brothers film career, but at the same time, it seems a pity that people do not see / can not see the original , because very often / Almost always, the remake is not as good as the original. Look at this one if you want to be a bit of a boring movie, but the original does not compare with this sequel in the movie name.
