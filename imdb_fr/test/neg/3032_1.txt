I almost miss the words to describe how awful this project of Irish vanity (funded by Canadian taxpayers - federal and Albertan) is. <br /> <br /> The sudden appearance of a beautiful Canadian woman (Kathy Ranheim) who Real Life was a star athlete in Alberta, for no other reason to ensure Canadian content. The credits also indicate that some pubs in Calgary have been helpful. <br /> <br /> Everything here is poorly filmed and at least third-hand (the most obvious flights are poorly digested trains, Lock Stock, Snatch and Dog Reservoir). . Avoid like the plague unless you think about one of those camping nights "so bad it's almost funny" in front of your TV.
