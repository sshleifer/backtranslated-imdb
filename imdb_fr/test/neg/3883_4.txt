I saw this with great expectations. Come on, it's Akshay Kumar, Govinda and Paresh Rawal, who are all amazing at their comedy, I was really hoping for a riot of laughter. Unfortunately, that's not what I had at all ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud. There were times when I laughed at one or two things, but nothing made me really laugh. In short, it was an attempt at cruel comedy and, in a way, a bit of an aspirant to Hera Pheri. <br /> <br /> I think the role of Paresh Rawal was the most powerful. It was not the most important role, but it certainly stood out more than Govinda or Akshay. Their performances were ok I suppose. Nothing special, just mediocre. Although Govinda stole the show at Akshay in more than one scene. Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta also make appearances in this film. Both were pretty bad. Lara's role did not make me move or make me laugh, and Tanushree Dutta's character just pissed me off! Music seems to be the only good thing about Bhagam Bhag. My favorite song is "Tere Bin", followed by "Afreen", which I really enjoyed. "Signal" and the title song "Bhagam Bhag" are also worth seeing. <br /> <br /> You will like it or you will not like it. And judging by poor comedy and lack of direction, I do not think you'll do it.
