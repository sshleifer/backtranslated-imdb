In my opinion on this film, the complete video part of this movie was a real basket !!! However, the soundtrack used contained the music of a big heavy metal rock band, I recognized the music as a band called Firstryke and the album was "Just a Nightmare" and it was very well written! ! and I'm curious to see what the rest of you, moviegoers, think about it, if you remember, I would appreciate the return, I collect old movies and sound tracks from obscure movies. It's a hobby that takes a lot of time but is very rewarding. I saw the music of this band selling in Germany on the net for about fifty dollars per album. Not bad Hugh?
