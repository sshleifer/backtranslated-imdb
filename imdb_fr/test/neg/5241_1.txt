<br /> <br /> I saw this film at a festival here in Munich with a huge crowd of real fantasy fans. Toward the middle of the film, some of the audience was sleeping and the other was paddling. Boring dialogues, poorly choreographed battles, a terribly stupid story, and even worse special effects. Well, at least the actors do not have much to do other than looking worried or (if they are women) showing their breasts in the right light. Even GÃ¶tz Otto, who was part of the audience, later admitted that he could understand the disappointment of viewers. Be warned, dear friends, the cheapest fantasy film of all time ........
