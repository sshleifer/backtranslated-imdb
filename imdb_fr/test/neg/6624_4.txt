People do not seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. The same people who see a movie with Carrot Top on the cover, surf in an office and continue to watch the film with serious expectations. Carrot Top is it funny? Of course not. Was this film special? Of course not. It was a silly movie and everyone assumed so simply based on what they know about Mr. Top. Movies like this, or Kazaam, or Killer Klowns from Outer Space and virtually every Pauly Shore film have never been taken seriously and should not be considered the worst films ever made. . You watch them hoping for a hilarious stupid movie or you're six and think sincerely that Carrot Top is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Please, if you know that Carrot Top is late, you want to watch a movie. Serious movie and worth writing a serious review .... do not look at that. Choosing this film is like blaming a 5-year-old child who does not know the alphabet.
