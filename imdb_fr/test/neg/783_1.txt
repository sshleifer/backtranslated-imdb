It's really sad that it comes from the same spirit as Donnie Darko, probably one of the best movies of this kind. Where do I even start? I think one of the most irritating aspects of the film is that we are supposed to criticize humanity, yet we do not see any humanity in the film. No more than 5 minutes of the film are devoted to the death of another human being. These are horrible one-dimensional cardboard cutouts of human beings. Unfortunately, this is how they play with what can only be described as dreadful actor. Is this really how Kelly sees humanity? Judging by the reaction of viewers, this is a horrible synthesis of humanity. Why do not the characters in the film ask the questions of all the spectators? This is not an indictment of humanity. Kelly charges the straw men who do not look like real humans in this situation. <br /> <br /> For those who say that this film is a wonderful and thought-provoking film, what are you comparing it to? Armageddon? I even saw someone compare that to Kurosawa's works. How badly do you have to be deprived of thinking that this would promote a good existential discussion? For the sake of all that is good in the movie! Even Indecent Proposal is ten times more than the Indictment of Humanity. We see people really anxious about greed and the human condition. Yes, even Indecent Proposition confuses this film with shame for a philosophical discussion and yet it gets 5.3 vs. 6.0 for this insane movie. <br /> <br /> Rarely, I saw a more pretentious, pontificating and self-growing film falling flat on his face. This has the depth of a high school movie project, and a poor one at that. Really, that's about the level of discussion promoted by this movie. If you want to see a GOOD psychological director, go to Das Experiment. If The Box had lived up to that one goal, I would have been ready to forgive the atrocious actor, the holes in the gaping plot and the pure absurd story. Unfortunately, this can not even be done. <br /> <br /> The real impeachment of humanity is that there are people who think that this film is a deeply introspective look at the human condition. It's not Sartre! It's not even Sartre's Cliff Notes version! This is a hastily written text on Sartre, hastily designed and based on Internet discussions. If Sartre was alive, he would sue Kelly for defamation.
