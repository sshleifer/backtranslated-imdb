This film is hilarious, what better than watching two creatures face each other? Giant cgi versions of these beasts fighting! However, I need one of the guns used in the movie. Because apparently, they use tricks. Count the number of shots they use before having to ... oh, that's right, they never have to reload. Regardless of counting shots ... it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> The sound effects used in the film for Komodo vary from tiger to elephant. Oh, and did I forget to mention that apparently these GIANT Komodo dragons are apparently stealthy? Because even when the actors look in the direction from which the beast comes, they are surprised when it appears. <br /> <br /> Every time someone dies, you can warn them of coming because they all expect it, they put their arms in the air and cross them to save you ... it does not work never. <br /> <br /> The ultimate jewel is that the brain of these writers is only a gland full of knowledge. With "facts" such as these two creatures being amphibious with comments such as "defenseless animals", they are simply full of fun facts.
