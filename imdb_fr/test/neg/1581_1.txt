Wings Hauser and his son, Cole Hauser, join forces to make a film about neo-Nazi thugs who target a gay man and terrorize a city. Wings plays the hero and his real son is the bad guy. A low-budget movie, which does not have a lot of cool features, and for some reason no one has seen it! Maybe because it's a pretty laughable and ridiculous film, and the studio understands it! Maybe Wings Hauser himself prevented the distribution of 'Skins' after seeing it himself! Maybe people just did not want to comment on such a bad movie! Never mind! I usually like Wings and Cole as actors, but it was a movie they both should have skipped. Wings directed, wrote and was the main actor in 'Skins'! An extremely bad and stupid movie! 1/2 on *****!
