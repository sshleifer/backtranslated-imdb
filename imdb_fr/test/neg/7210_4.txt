This suite named ROADHOUSE, nominally single, a DEA agent (John Schaech) who comes to the rescue of his uncle (Will Patton) when it is severely beaten by a gang of local drug, led by this Indian wood actor Jake Busey. The band wants to take the helm of the poor guy for bad reasons. We miss Patrick Swayze a lot here. Schaech is an indifferent and unconvincing actor as a lawyer kick in the ass. The fights here are intermittent and not as powerful or vicious as those at ROADHOUSE. The final is also weak. Some beautiful women keep things afloat for a while. There is a terrible fight between a type type Daisy Duke which proves to be handy with his fists and weapons, and a naughty boy Busey who is skilled with sharp instruments. At first, there is also a badly dressed girl who is a colleague Schaech agent, but unfortunately, she never reappears in the film. Pity. She made a short dance tour for Schaech which caught my attention. If nothing else, ROADHOUSE 2 starts with a strip club scene that gets close to what a real strip club looks like, a rare circumstance in any movie. The rest is nap time.
