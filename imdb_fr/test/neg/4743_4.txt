When I saw Alien vs. Predator a few years ago, I must say as stupid as a sequel, it was still a little nice. Now there is unfortunately a shortage of good movies in the theater lately, so my boyfriend and I decided to go ahead and see what AVPR consisted of: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem. So we saw it a few nights ago and I must say that this horror sequel was not exciting. This took a completely different turn from the first AVP movie, it's not a bad idea to take Alien and Predator and put them in suburban chic, but from the idea of ​​the first one that explains their reasons for existence, that's was just a mean and predictable horror sequel. Not to mention a story that continues to introduce new characters to every scene where I did not know who to keep in mind to know who was the main character and why, so I could not really follow the script. <br /> <br /> From what I understood, of course, the Predator and Alien are in space and have to face the typical problems of sit-com neighbors, they just light up and they decide why not? Go ahead and take it out on some earthlings. Then they collapse and Alien seizes the utopia of the suburbs. But teens, including a troubled couple who looks like Ken and Barbie, a marine woman and her daughter, among others, will make sure to boost the space, ie if the predator can not do it first. Because he's excited at Alien, I guess for having started the party without him, lol, I'm kidding, actually because he killed some of his friends. <br /> <br /> AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - The Requiem is not the worst film of all standards, it's still pretty cool with lots of visual effects and combat sequences between Alien and Predator are so cool to watch. As in the first sequel of Alien vs. Predator, casting is what ruins the film and seems fair if they are not well developed. I know it's awful, but the original Alien and Predator movies had characters you loved and wanted. to win. But it was an almost decent sequel that, in my opinion, is worth being fun, especially for the sake of Ken and Barbie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
