I waited a long time to see this movie. The IFC finally executed it one night. I thought it would be something like Barbet Schroeder's "Barfly". False. This film does not recreate this underground world filled with character bars, empty, smoky and full of characters that you associate with his stories. He also fails to capture Bukowski's attitude that Mickey Rourke did so well in the aforementioned film. This intelligent natural attitude. Fans of Charles Bukowski will enjoy seeing scenes from his books on screen, but those who do not know his books might have a false impression of his works. This film looks like another "Film of the Week" about a drunk man and his relationships. If you want to get a better idea of ​​Charles Bukowski's world watch, "Barfly".
