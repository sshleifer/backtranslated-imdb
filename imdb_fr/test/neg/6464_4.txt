Not so long ago, I bought a cheap VHS tape called "Just Rambling Along," supposedly Laurel and Hardy. Knowing a bit about their production and not recognizing this title, I took the agonizing decision to separate myself from a dollar and buy it. In playing it, I identified the film as HOP TO IT. Of course, Mr. Laurel was nowhere in the distribution, which made the packaging of this product misleading. Worse, the quality is terrible. Looks like he was fooled by an 8mm film source. There was a fairly appropriate musical score. In fact, the band is really worth it if you just want to get an idea of ​​what the movie looks like. In my opinion, it is a decent short film but not exceptional. IMDb should add JUST RAMBLING ALONG as an alternate title for this film, which was also the name of a 1918 movie, Stan Laurel!
