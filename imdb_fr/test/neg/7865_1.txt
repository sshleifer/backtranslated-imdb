* The ELITE sniper team that has been inserted about 24 hours earlier instead of infiltrating and making themselves invisible has decided to hide behind a large rock in one of the first scenes. * When the hero "runs" to save his wife, he jogs. * When inside a building and aiming at a target only 20 or 30 meters away, the hero USES HIS SCOPE. In addition to the fact that most non-elite soldiers would perform that hip shot and continue to hit, there would also be the fact that the viewfinder probably could not focus so tightly. * There is a satellite that can look horizontally in buildings. <br /> <br /> The list is endless ... and the movie is the biggest pile of shit I've ever put in my DVD player.
