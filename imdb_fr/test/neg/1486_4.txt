There was a good build up of suspense all the way through. The cinematography was surprisingly good considering this minimal budget. We are witnessing occasional periods of good acting, however, this is quickly deflated by some pretty lame lines. Of course, there would be no real intellectual conversation sitting on trees while a crocodile pursues you. The silence would have been golden here. There could have been a game of suspense bigger than to say weakly: "I sat in the closet for fear of my brother ..." Something tells me that there is a slight difference to be beaten by his brother only to be eaten by a powerful fang. You decide. Throughout the film, I can not find a link or, in this respect, sympathy for the characters, perhaps because they have not developed throughout the film, the character that he is. There are some occasional good fears when the crocodile sneaks on the characters, again eclipsed by some dubious scenes. In one case, we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water, but later we sit next to a decapitated corpse without limbs and only worry about the broken finger. A real roller coaster of a movie about logic.
