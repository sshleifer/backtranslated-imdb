The next "criticism" is that of the wrong side of the tracks, which means two things: you will only hear praises from me and do not be fooled by my note. I could also tell you that this review does not contain any spoilers, but technically ... it's a lie. <br /> <br /> Well, ... See the comment. I'm just going for a walk. It's been a long time since I had so much fun with such a bad movie. And if you can not appreciate this piece of drivel, then you simply do not have a sense of humor. First of all, this movie had to be taken seriously, it's the main aspect of the fun. The story? The son of a doctor is terminally ill. Papa-Doctor decides that a transplant is the only way to save his son. So, like a real crazy doctor, he decides that the heart of a gorilla will do the trick. Of course, the heart of the gorilla is "far too powerful for a human being", so that sonny-boy is transformed into this horrible monkey-man who is released immediately and starts a frenzy of murder and rape (because it's just what a horny animal would do, is not it?) The composition of our monkey man is hilarious. There is simply no other way to say it: the guy's face looks like shit! I am talking here of human excrement, of the brown type! Pretty! The gore of this film is also wonderful: besides the real images of an open-heart operation, we also have effects of blood and blood that are unbelievably false (but bad enough): decapitation, stupor of the eyes, torn throat , scalping someone's skull, ... It's hilarious, and indeed, it's pretty incomprehensible that NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES is on the notorious list of UK Video-Nasties, because all the unpleasant things described in this movie are just too ridiculous taken seriously. Oh, and by the way, there is only one bloody monkey. So, needless to say, LA HORRIPILANTE BESTIA HUMANA is a much more precise title for this terrifying and convincing tale of science that went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> When you do not try to shock with acts of bloody violence or staged badly organized representations of female nudity, this film manages to be very entertaining with ingredients such as senseless dialogues , cheap cardboard games, scenes of stupidity and acting incredibly badly. Just a few random examples, maybe? About Set Designs: It is clear that set designers have used the same walls, doors, windows (etc.) over and over again to build different interior designs (eg, one side of the hospital room - the side window - Where the girl of unconscious struggle is lying, looks suspiciously like the window of the basement laboratory from which Ape-Man escapes, the designers of the sets have also taken one of the side windows of the laboratory, has made a little larger and fairer place it in the conference room of the hospital; All the walls of a building are the same gray; ...). Then there is the park setting. Clearly shot in a studio, you can see (repeatedly) that the grass is loose. Whenever there are quarrels / fights / rapes going on, the grass moves and mixes, and you can see the gray concrete from the shop floor underneath. <br /> <br /> Just a few random lines coming out of the actors' mouths: <br /> <br /> - In the conference room where all the doctors discuss the disappearance of Unconscious Wrestling Girl (a disappearance that would mean of course bad publicity for the hospital), Daddy-Doctor cleverly pronounces "We are in a difficult situation". <br /> <br /> - During this same debate, a colleague doctor made a clever comment: "A sleepwalker! Sleepwalker gets up", thus providing a strong excuse for the disappearance of the girl from the unconscious struggle . <br /> <br /> - After our detective investigator, through the astonishing process of his own logical deduction, concludes and tells his superior that the murderer must be a half-man / half-beast, his superior responds that it is absurd, adding the line "It is more likely that, lately, more and more, you are watching on television many of these images of terror" ... Really one of the best replicas of the film. <br /> <br /> Other sources of laughter: <br /> <br /> - The two scenes were those of the daddy and his assistant like Igor kidnapping the gorilla of the zoo and the unconscious Wrestling Girl of the hospital - these well-thought-out acts of abduction look like taking candies to a baby. <br /> <br /> - The dad-doctor speaks a lot to God, does not he? <br /> <br /> - Sonny-boy calls daddy-the-doctor "daddy" on more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> - An old lady screaming "Aaargh !!! A dead man! A dead man! A dead man !! A DEAD MAN !!!". <br /> <br /> - The plot stops periodically to get lost in the scenes of women struggling, to then continue and do nothing with this concept. Of course, Daddy-Doctor replaces Sonny- The boy's gorilla heart a second time with the daughter of the unconscious struggle, but do you think something spectacular will happen after that? Like growing Ape-Turd-Man breasts, trying to rape men this time, our greatest living beauty of wrestling (Norma Lazareno) does not even enter a culinary wrestling contest with Ape-Turd-Man towards end of the movie ... But Ape-Turd-Man starts to show some maternal love towards the end ... almost (and I say "almost") in true KING-KONG (ie the top of a building and people on the ground who are pointing and screaming). <br /> <br /> Okay, I think that's enough now. I put more than my two cents here Vomitron Rational Note for this hilarious hunk of dreck: 2/10. Note from Vomitron On the wrong side of the track: 8/10 Go see this movie, people. It's really worth it!
