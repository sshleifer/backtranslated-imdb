This show is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, of course that's wrong. But it's painful to watch. Personally, I know that the more creative cinema-influenced minds could "make it look real". The young man at the head could not be more unconvincing. He reads everything he says. Are we really supposed to believe that he knows what he's talking about? There is a plethora of ways for Blair-Witch to come forward. The fear does not come from what seems "cool" and computer generated. It also does not generate proverbial lines such as "What was it, did you hear that?" In addition, there are real convincing mediums that are not content with "wanting to be on screen". Another DUH factor is ... how do these producers think we will actually buy this paranormal activity that will magically happen in both possibly 3 days (if we're lucky) they film. I do not think so. A 2 + week on a site would be more convincing. It's as disarming as they think, including the "radar checks of NASA" and computers that show sophisticated technologies really scare us. AND IE: The exorcisms should not be staged like the movie "The Exorcist". When are they going to do it right? Possession of the devil or other evil spirits influences people differently. They do not just growl and lower their voices like Linda Blair or do not fall like Courtney Love on excessive drug use. As indicated, better concentrations of "psychic ability" would help this show a lot. We want to see and hear ALL that supposedly blinks in front of them. Not cut to another story bs. On a Final Note - Shooting stars do not interest you when you show false UFO images in advance. May I emphasize again that the young black haired man who animates this show is absolutely horrible. Avoid this show. For fear: look at the old episodes of Unsolved Mystery ... not the new ones (recess has gone so badly). But it's for a different blog.
