Being a completely moped movie buff with a home to furnish, I am a big fan of IKEA. My whole home is almost packed with cheap particle board stuff. And you know how all of IKEA's stylish home items carry these fun names - a library called "Holika" and a bathroom mirror called "Grundtal" - well, that just adds to all the charm of the euro. <br /> <br /> Like these interestingly named (but horribly translated) items on shelves at IKEA, I'd like to provide some translation to some of the criticisms I've read about the "Kraftverk 3714" manufacturing Swedish. <br /> <br /> Original Comment: "For a low-budget movie, it's pretty cool, it would be great to see what these guys could do with a Hollywood budget!" <br /> <br />: The film is shabby, the light is pedestrian, the cinematography is uninteresting, the sound recording is hollow. <br /> <br /> Original Comment: "David Lynchesque is a science fiction drama set in a strange forest town characters!" <br /> <br /> Translation: These "actors" act for free, the story is circular and tiring, the ideas underlying the film are desperately trying to be existential but are simply mundane, and the sets (especially interiors) <br /> <br /> Original comment: "The editing is well done, and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that convincing CGI effects do not necessarily have to come out of a Hollywood studio." Translation: When you have a cinematography summary, mask the imperfections by scanning them on a Mac and mixing them vigorously for three minutes. Ingenious! <br /> <br /> I've tried my luck on this DVD because I'm a supporter of independent films, especially those who are trying to tackle the often expensive and awesome genre of science fiction. I mean, some of the best sci-fi movies of all time have been made with little or no budget, spfx and specious actors. Take, for example, Peter Fonda's film "Idaho Transfer", which respects the environment and warns of respect for the environment! A classic. <br /> <br /> But "Kraftverk 3714" does not fall into the category of "science fiction carefully prepared, discreet and dependent on ideas." He focuses tirelessly on characters who do not do a lot and do not say interesting things. He goes around in circles. It's way too long (it's from a big fan of Tarkovsky). Worse still, his concept of "aliens changing reality" is the forage of Twilight Zone dating from 40 years ago. It's just not a good film - and I really wanted it, damn it! <br /> <br /> However, as a fan of IKEA, I made a heartbreaking observation. First of all, all those who shop at IKEA know how their delicate shopping carts work, with the four wheels being multidirectional. The carts can rotate 360 ​​degrees and it takes some familiarity to handle them like a pro, as any passionate IKEA shopper knows. Well, I'll be cursed, but one of the main actresses of "Kraftverk 3714" goes to a dark grocery store in the middle of nowhere and what is she pushing? A multidirectional shopping cart! So, this is not an invention of IKEA after all, but another wonderful invention (let's call it a "Tacklebee" for hell) from the country of hei-doo!
