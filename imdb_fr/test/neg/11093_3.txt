With all the potential of a good film in its beautiful scenery, distribution and cinematography, the dull scenario, the slow pace and the wood performances of this film produced only a major disappointment. With decent direction, editing and music, it could have been a good movie, maybe a dark version of Blake Edward's "10", instead of a disgusting version of Ron Howard's "Splash".
