Oh man, this movie was very bad. Bad look, horrible story ... the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's supposed to be a comedy and anything but anything tells me that this movie was supposed to be the real deal. The film certainly does not start as a comedy, but rather as an adventurous movie with fun elements. Above all, you can say that they were serious about it by their acting, it was serious and not comical, with the exception of a few superb sequences of course. It seemed to me that at first they had tried to make an adventurous and serious sci-fi film, maybe even a franchise, but they quickly understood how serious it all was and just decided to insert a Another comic sequence, deliberately exaggerated, make the film look more like a comedy and avoid it turning into catastrophic total disorder. <br /> <br /> The film is a strange attempt to mix adventurous pirate pirates movies with a serious sci-fi action. The film was obviously inspired by the "Star Wars" movies and its success. The film is not too ashamed to copy entire sequences and even the way the story goes, the sets, characters and robots have similarities. They tried to hide that by putting in place obvious sequences, but I'm not cracking. So, the film is not even original, despite its original concept. You can say that this film is a "Spaceballs" of a poor, without even being a parody. <br /> <br /> The film is bad, with special effects of video games (even literally in some sequences), ugly costumes (coat of mail and swords in space?). The sound is sometimes even laughable. Looks like they shot some soundless sequences, and then forgot to add all the required sounds later, in post-production. the mix is ​​also really bad. They tried to hide it by sometimes reducing the sound and adapting Bruce Broughton's score. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the movie is so busy trying to make the movie humorous that it's totally forgetting to tell the story. The story of the film seems extremely chaotic and poorly written, with a main plot almost totally untapped. It does not help to make sure the movie really flows. Many things are not explained and some are even abandoned after a while. The film begins as a "pirate" movie, which constantly searches and steals water, because it is rare and there is only one planet in the entire galaxy that stays with water on it (yeah, that's it!). However, this plot is quickly abandoned, especially in the central part of the film, in which the film seems to become totally different, with different motivations. It's like a weird and bad sequence, a stupid sequence after another, without really making a click. He also keeps the characters too superficial and uninteresting to deal with. <br /> <br /> Sad to see that actors like John Carradine, Anjelica Huston and a still young and unknown Ron Perlman were attached to this disastrous movie. <BR/> <br /> OK, I admit that I liked some of the moments, especially the end when they went through the time-warp, it was original and fun, but really, all that was enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not even like the film so campy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
