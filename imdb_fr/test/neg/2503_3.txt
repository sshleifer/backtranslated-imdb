Sensational. I felt I had to shower after looking at this one, but there may be other reasons I'll leave to your imagination. I felt used and mistreated after renting, I mean watching this movie. Hairy chest, thick mustaches and well, all hairy describes this porn movie / horror, but hey, it was in 1981, we can not call it "porn" in the 70s and 80s without hair. <br /> <br /> Like a horror movie, it bites. But as a piece of exploitation / porn from the rich Italian cinematic history, it definitely has a place in my library. The copy I have is in Italian with English subtitles. I wish English was badly nicknamed, I think it would have added to the ladder factor that already existed. "Shannon" is the only white man who folds in the movie. It's a hairy machismo with a mustache and hairy chest that really tries to give a performance every time it "pounding". It was at the end of a time when porn producers were really trying to create something artistic. Nothing like sweeping the camera from a tropical background to a hairy man having sex "doggy style" with a woman. I can not help but laugh. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that I pray that my future wife and children will never find.
