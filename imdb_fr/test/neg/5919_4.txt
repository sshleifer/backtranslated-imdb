I'm a film collector with Mrs. Weaver, so I only bought her because of her presence. I find it really strange that his early career is filled with so many terrible movies. She started with incredible promises in Alien, but then had a series of bombs. These bombs include this movie, Deal of the Century, A Woman or Two, and Half Moon Street. She also appeared in The Year Of Living Dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than remarkable. Between Alien and her sequel in 1986, Aliens, the only film she shot that was worth is Ghostbusters. Before the release of Aliens, I'm sure everyone thought this woman was about to go out. Fortunately, she was not. <br /> <br /> Back to the witness, the movie is boring. It does not create suspense. William Hurt seems to be a cardboard box and the atmosphere is dry. Sigourney is decent, but nothing is worth remembering. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you must, but do not wait for a decent movie. Watch better movies with these two stars like Accidental Tourist and Working Girl.
