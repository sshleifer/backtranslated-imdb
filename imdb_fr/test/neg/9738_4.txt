Maybe it's just me, but this movie was more like a sequel or a follow-up than a separate project. Why? When it was filmed (a few years after the war), most viewers probably understood why Rommel was so famous, why his death was so important to Allied, why he was Hitler's favorite general, but now, 50 years later late, this is not the case. More obvious now. <br /> <br /> "Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel" is a war movie worthy of the name, but it's just not an explanation of how Rommel got his nickname, what was The Allies considered him their best general. Why were their soldiers so frightened by Afrika Korps? That's what's missing in this film - we see his fame, his character, his way of dealing with the soldiers and his enemies, but also we see that Hitler complained about his exploits in Africa, calling him coward, etc. . So we miss the big picture - it's "The Story of Rommel", but unfortunately the "Desert Fox" part is missing.
