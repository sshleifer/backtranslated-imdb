Watching this movie, just ask: what were they thinking? There are so many bad parts of this film that you might feel that it's intentionally poor, like some kind of joke. <br /> <br /> I think the worst thing in the movie is the realization. There are so many misuses of camera angles and other cinematographic elements in this movie that are ridiculously bad. The most fun example would be at the beginning when guests received their invitations by email. The same camera angle is used for each shot (which lasts two seconds per piece) and the same computer screen with the same desktop / window / program etc. appear. It even looks like the thing is turned on the same scenery each time. The entire sequence was also completely silent, with no music or sound effects. Overall, it was a bad way to convey the idea that an email was being sent around the city. <br /> <br /> If you listen carefully, you may notice that the music sounds very similar to other movie soundtracks. This is not a surprise: most of the songs, including the one that opens the movie, are actually minor changes to other movie scores (see if you can guess which ones). In addition, I noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra. It sounds like sound written and played through a low end midi keyboard. If you're familiar with LucasArts SCUM adventure games, the timbre of each instrument sounds like something from the IMUSE engine. <br /> <br /> Everything else in the movie is really bad. The acting is terrible. The script is derived (Ferris Beuller?). In the movie, there is no funny joke, unless you see the movie as a big joke, played in front of a paying audience. Do not rent that. Do not even watch it when it's rebroadcast on Comedy Central. Forget it, it's terrible.
