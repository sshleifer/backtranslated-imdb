Because I would never have seen this movie to the end. Although there are some funny moments in this movie, but not much, I could not understand more than about 15% (the fancy English couple on the 3rd floor included) of what people were saying. Three short stories, none with a real point, with just some of the most miserable and lifeless people I could have imagined and a rude charge of language. I did not find it funny, I did not find it amusing, it does not make sense. 4/10
