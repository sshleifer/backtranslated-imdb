Looking at the first moments, you realize that it will be a travesty - and it's certainly * a parody, but I'm not sure what (a fairy tale? An opera? A Hollywood c-movie? like that), and I can assure you that it's not worth watching. It is simply a useless film (see a good parody, it's all but useless), with pretentious and superficial speeches of extremely summary characters. It's like a commedia dell'arte. Or better, it's like a failed commedia dell'arte. And the score ... sung intentionally incompetent (something that Greenaway will use much more effectively), it's * painful * to listen (unless you wear ear plugs at the cutting edge of technology, haha) . Opt for quality films (How, for example, Tsar Peter the Great Groom of his moor, A. Mitta, 1976) and avoid this mistake.
