I'm a fan of Jim Henson and his characters from the very beginning. The most seductive thing about them was the love, innocence and camaraderie shown. Kermit was a model of deep thinking and problem solving. A spiritual character, yet sweet and believable. All the other characters were slightly eccentric, but it showed how different types of beings could coexist in a caring way, respecting the differences of each other. <br /> <br /> The following films have somehow kept the same atmosphere. Yet this "It's a very happy Christmas movie with the Muppets" would have turned Jim Henson in his grave. These characters have been completely rewritten to become horny, mean, selfish and nerdy. <br /> <br /> The cast goes on to describe God as a careless head of society, with a medium drag. Angels are corporate employees without spirit and not spiritual, and the film was so bad that I had to stop watching. I bought it for my grandnephew, but luckily I saw a glimpse of everything I give to a child. <br /> <br /> This film deserved the rubbish basket and has no content or socially redemptive charm. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame on the people who rewrote the characters and moved away from Jim Henson's original, heart-centered and socially aware version. It does a disservice to a man with a big heart who is no longer there to defend his creations.
