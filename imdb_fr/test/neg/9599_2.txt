All right, let me start by saying that I like the original RS for the 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to propose. The computer did not tell you every step of your mission, you can walk around and explore. <br /> <br /> This is the first thing wrong with RL. Everything you do is subject to a schedule and controlled by other people. I mean, as a leader, should not you tell people how to handle each mission? <br /> <br /> And as for the missions, why do they mix the original trilogy with completely invented shit? It does not matter. <br /> <br /> I was waiting so much for this game when I heard that they were going to allow you to fly through the asteroid field of Empire Strikes Back. I think all the movie fans wanted to do it. So, they give it to you. This is the most stupid level of the game. You start by flying across the asteroid field with links chasing you, and your goal is to go deeper into the field while pulling the links. You must kill them all to move forward. Hey, remember how many Han were killed when he was on the ground? None, they all had poor piloting skills compared to him. I just wanted to be able to dodge the asteroids as they came to me, but I have to use my automatic aiming guns to kill the neckties behind me. <br /> <br /> It was the biggest disappointment, you have no control. on your flight, everything is slow. All but the A-Wing, probably the fastest and most maneuverable ship in the fleet. But, oh yes, did not Han say the Falcon was? Anyway ... <br /> <br /> You finally arrive at the battle of Endor. Here is the ultimate level, you must destroy the death star, the first instinct of everyone is to choose the hawk and to be the leader. But, of course, you get there and have to do stupid strategies previously chosen, such as finding (not to say deciphering the difference between) bombers to attack. This is impossible in the hawk, when you have spotted a group, the frigate is destroyed. The only way to pass this part is to choose the A-Wing. After that, you have to attack the stellar destroyers and it's a stupid chore. This game gives the impression that you are the only one to defend the alliance of the rebels. <br /> <br /> After having overcome with frustration this "funny" fight, you reach the death star. And here, you might think 'yay! I manage to destroy the Death Star, "and again, as in the asteroid field, you have to do a tedious thing while just passing tunnels of impending fate. Your mission is to protect the ship in front of you, remember the return of the Jedi? It's so stupid, because if you choose the hawk, you'll die because you're not handy enough, but if you choose the X-wing, you must continue to lock and unlock your S-foils. So it's a choice to kill the bad guys, or to try to catch up with Lando, who apparently does not know how to maneuver. So die in the process. <br /> <br /> Bonus levels are not even worth targeting because each level becomes more and more frustrating. That's how I feel when I saw the three new movies, upset and needing to kill something. Fortunately for me, Smash Bros Melee exists. <br /> <br /> I hope that with the Wii, they get something much better and that the original trilogy levels reach their full capacity. I will sell this game at the first opportunity.
