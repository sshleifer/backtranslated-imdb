I just do not know how this stupid movie, shit, junk, garbage and bum is blockbuster. It was so boring with a very very weak story (or not) and was not even funny. The film was only 135 minutes of a paragraph in the story of Prem (Salman Khan), a guru of love who helps the unhappy and romantic Bhaskar (Govinda) find the girl he wants. I'm not saying that I did not like the movie because it was not funny or anything, I will accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story. The only two reasons I can say it's a great hit are: <br /> <br /> 1. Salman Khan and Govinda are on the screen together, but the first time together was to Salaam e Ishq, which was a failure, so it can not be. But it was really a good movie. <br /> <br /> 2. The name of Salman Khan is Prem and all the films bearing this name have been a success, including Maine Pyar Kiya. So, it's just lucky. <br /> <br /> I heard it was a remake of Hitch, I did not see it and I'm glad I did not see it. The music is OK, the only good songs are Do you want to have a partner? You're my love & Soni From Nakhre, but what's the point in a very bad movie, too, if you have someone like Katrina Kaif dancing with two left feet? She is completely nil. She does not know either acting, language (her voice is always doubled for her), dancing and still can not impress. I do not like her at all, she was even disappointing in Koffee with Karan. Overall Partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress Katrina Kaif. It's better for her to get out of Bollywood and never come back.
