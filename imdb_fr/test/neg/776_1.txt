I am Mike Sedlak. I co-wrote the score for this movie. And proud of that. <br /> <br /> And I love all the comments. Some did not go far enough. <br /> <br /> The film was screened in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was packed with family and friends. We all applauded. <br /> <br /> Five days later, it was taken from all the screens in the Bay Area. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in hearing some details scene by scene, could make the movie even more enjoyable, thanks for letting me know. <br /> <br /> We could start with the clich√© where Gideon Blake throws the toilet piston to distract one of the naughty minions guarding the radio transmitter on the house Bud bridge. <br /> <br /> Or how Gideon broadcast the bomb in its original version. <br /> <br /> Did not help. He's always bombing. <br /> <br /> Bring him.
