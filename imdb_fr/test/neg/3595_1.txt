Now, I know that a lot of black humor makes fun of typical black things like gold teeth. But that does not mean they are always funny. Do not be a threat is an example of this. The urban film certainly lends itself to satire. The problem is that Wayans and the wives not only try to satirize the typical "ghetto" culture, but also depreciate valid statements made in such urban films as Boyz 'n' the Hood or Menace II Society. Personally, I think that the directors of this film should move away from the intestinal movements of their white masters. On top of that, the film itself is terrible. It's absolutely not funny. The jokes are racist. Instead of satirizing the genre of urban film, the filmmakers show their views on black "ignorant" cities (ghettos). Now, there are some other jokes in this movie, but I think that's the main rate. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is shit and the filmmakers should use their talents to make a constructive comedy / satire film. They have examples in Men With Black Hats (which was made before this movie) and Friday.
