A cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island. To bring it back to civilization, it slips into the cargo hold of a large luxury cruise liner with a fun and distressing result. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the one thing I really did not like in this movie .... The monster really looked like a guy wearing a rubber suit. The CGI scenes looked like a different movie. OK, it touches me now all the pleasant moments of this film B. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do was John Rhys-Davies (his daughter the shadow of the second a little closer). John was intermittently funny and sweet and no matter what the writers made him say, he said it well. Good job, considering what he had to work with. The Cyptozoologist was above and fun to watch too he had amusing words. The marines were all OK and are doing good fodder for the monster, along with some team members and guests. This movie contains some pretty fun lines, as well as a pretty funny plot featuring a thief. <br /> <br /> The special effects are generally low and I swear they reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the film. I really liked the gore of the man without legs. Really since this movie was not scary at all, I feel a little more gore would have improved the ability to watch from this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all if you like monsters B, this one is worth the detour.
