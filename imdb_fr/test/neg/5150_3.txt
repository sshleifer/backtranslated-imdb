This film started at first, worthy of the name - but it was supposed: with a domineering mother, a rival witch and a hesitant beauty queen constantly coming in second place. There were some blunders and some unlikely intrigues (She comes second in EVERY single competition? ALL?)? Unfortunately, the film suffers horribly from the need to become a TV movie. Rather than finishing at the end of the film, a funny twist in which the killer is revealed (plausibly), the film continues another twenty minutes, just to do justice to justice. Of course, now that the killer is revealed, she suddenly undergoes a complete personality change - her character is completely rewritten because writers no longer need to keep her identity secret. The cheese is completely flowing what otherwise could have been a pretty fun movie.
