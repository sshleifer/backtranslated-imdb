I saw that this movie was going out and I was impatient to see it. I must say that I was very disappointed. It would have been better as a mini-series. The whole show seemed in a hurry. They did not explain things very clearly. In the end, they showed John Paul II alive and well and the next scene he was dead. Never any explanation on what happened. (We all know what happened in real life) I think ABC dropped the ball on something that could have been great. In all, I think this film was vague. It looked like a drunk monkey jumping from point to point in John Paul II's life and never explaining how or why things had happened. For example, when his older brother left, it was never explained that his brother was a doctor and that's why he left the house. Moreover, when his father dies, all we see is his father lying on the ground and that's it. I was very disappointed with the whole movie.
