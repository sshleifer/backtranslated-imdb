1 hour and 40 minutes of conversation - boring conversation, and more conversation and more. It is difficult for me to understand how an actress such as Anne Parillaud, who shone superbly in Femme Fatale, would register for such shit! Unbelievable. If you need a drink, this movie could help you, even if I would prefer good classical music. Unfortunately, I just discovered that I have to write 10 lines for my comment to appear - it's almost as incredible! brief and succinct comments in one or two sentences, expressing the point of view of a film, are not enough. Definitely, people. I made myself understood and do not waste your time with more useless words - like this movie does. Wolfgang
