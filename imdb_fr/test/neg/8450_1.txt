As the poster above, I hurt myself in the title thinking that I was becoming the other Piranha ... This movie is all that the above poster has said and worse ... <br /> <br /> Poor camera, unhealthy acting and just horrible story ... <br /> <br /> There were very few things here that are even worth watching ... The way this movie has been published to me exceeds. <br /> <br /> Make sure the movie you buy is the one you want ... not this one. <br /> <br /> The film I bought is called "Piranha" and not "Piranha, Piranha!" which is what it really is ... It's the only way for them to sell this film. <br /> <br /> Peace Out.
