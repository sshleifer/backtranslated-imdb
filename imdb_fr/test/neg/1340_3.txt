I went to this film with some trepidation; the original is a masterpiece of writing and acting and unfortunately, my fears have been realized. It's a work without humor and I sat at the theater waiting for the spirit and humor to begin. I'm still waiting, it seems. Updating the scenario in the present tense just did not work, and changing the characters was a parody - why did they introduce Bette Midler when she disappeared as quickly as she arrived; the corresponding character in the 1939 original was an integral part of the plot. The women of the cinema laughed a few times but nothing moved me to be funny, except for a replica of Meg Ryan who told her mother about her situation and told her that "this is not like a movie from the 1930s ". see the 1930s version. She was too touching and feely, "my sisters stay together" and really need some biting wit and clever dialogue of the original piece. I always watch the original film and pick up a line that I had never before. There is no sense of closure of this new version, and although the 1939 film is politically incorrect by today's standards, each thread was tied and at the end of the film it was so strong. This remake should be labeled with a warning for all viewers - if you know the original, do not worry: I felt cheated by losing a part of my life in a movie theater watching this piece of immemorial fluff. Bring the red of the jungle !!
