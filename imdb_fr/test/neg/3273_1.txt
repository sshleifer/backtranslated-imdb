It's really the worst movie I've ever seen. For a while, I used to watch shabby movies, including "Battlefield Earth", "Delta Force Commando" and "Starship". All of these films are cinematographic gems compared to Ironheart. <br /> <br /> It is not useless to summarize this piece of scrap metal; I think it is more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the film, which is: I get furiously furious and I want to extract the tape from the VCR and burn it after (about) 80 minutes of reading. <br /> I rate this movie at 0, but IMDb does not rate a movie under 1. I give it a 0 knowing very well that any movie having a score over 0 is worth infinitely (indefinitely) many times better than this one - It's really how bad it is.
