It's really disappointing that people can easily make movies with cheap digital video cameras nowadays. Usually, I would appreciate this possibility, but if you see movies like this, it's a shame. and it's also a big shame if people like HP Lovecraft get mistreated. I rented this "movie" because of the "hp .lovecraft" drop on it. and I am a big fan of many of his adaptations, mainly those of brian yuzna and stuart gordon. this film has nothing to offer! a cheap landscape on a beach and in an old wine cellar. effect digi-cam "red light" on all the film. no actors, just stupid and low-end models who have no idea what they do, as stiff as wood. and must therefore be the director. It is obvious that he tried to create an atmosphere. but since all these things are so laughable, it just does not work. and no bloody effects, just a little blood in a river (you drink = you become a demon) and a fall here and there. oh yes, the story: Thousands of years ago, "old people" colonized the world and took humans as slaves. then humanity became independent, so the "elders" tried to destroy them. and now there are survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. The only way to save humanity is to find the NECRONOMICON, that's where we find LOVECRAFT. then these soldiers fight against undead and demons on their beach and in their wine cellar. incredible - everything! but since it is nicknamed (German title: "Jenseits Army") and you can find it in most commercial video stores, it seems like you can make money with things like that. I find this fact impressive.
