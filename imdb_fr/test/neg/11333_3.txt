I can not understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put such a pattern on celluloid. This film has already been shot on at least two occasions that were better than this one ("Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - 1941 and "Heaven Can Wait" - 1978). The only saving factor for figure skating fans could have been a good skating by a professional skater group, but that just does not happen. The best way to skate is to see Tara Lipinski's character take a ride on the ice for a moment. Others, like Nancy Kerrigan and Elvis Stojko, are hidden in the background and do not practice any figure skating. There is not much real emotion shown, and there is not really any reason to give this film obviously for Made in TV. My advice: rent the original.
