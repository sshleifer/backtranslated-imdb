We waited in line to see The Good Girl, an excellent movie starring Jennifer Aniston, when a lady imagined this cheap, simulated twenty-dollar movie, MANNA FROM HEAVEN. "Come see this movie!" she says. "You will love!" <br /> <br /> She then introduced us to the director of the film. Now, that should have been our first clue. I mean, in how many cinematographic situations do you have the director of the film that stands out in the lobby asking people to see it? "Is it a Christian movie?" I asked, not really caring one way or another. I love Jesus. No shame on that. "No!" she said defensively. What a load of shit. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad. Pity. And this is not only because of the obvious Christian agenda, but because of the appalling dialogue, a game of acts alternating wood and overexagration, and the obvious absence of editor-in-chief. The film is much too long. If it had been an hour and a half, I might not have needed to go to the suicide prevention center after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, I'm lying. You see, after an hour of this waste, we crept into SWIMFAN. At least, with SWIMFAN, we know it's crap before going to see the movie. We know how to prepare. And SWIMFAN has hot people half naked. The only half-naked thing in this movie is the desperation of the stars involved whose obvious lack of script is anything but hidden. And the actress who pleaded the nun? It's called a personality. Get one. <br /> <br /> People who were shamelessly asking to sell tickets in the lobby told me that if I loved MY GREAT GREEK MARRIAGE, then I would love * (their accent, not mine ) MANNA DE HEAVEN. Right. More like, "If you like GLITTER, you'll love MANNA FROM HEAVEN." And Mariah could even surpass all the clowns in this movie. If it's not an insult, then I do not know what it is. <br /> <br /> I did a good job. Go see independent movies, but do not see the bad ones. It's definitely one of the bad ones. MANNA FROM HEAVEN needs divine intervention.
