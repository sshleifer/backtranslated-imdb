Synopsis Correction: The end does not show Ben cruising online for guys. He is looking for Arabic language courses at Presido Military Acadamy in San Francisco. Perhaps joining the war in Iraq as a translator (FYI), many dishonorable resignations of "Of asking did not say were translators (they are now an important insufficient supply") Ben also spoke in Russian. This film is a good time capsule of life in Manhatten, but a little non-reality here. Especially a good laugh at Lame's social skills and the sad performance of "Grown up" twenty and a half years not developing beyond the university party mode. Also, a brief changing scene study at Manhatten. (In a way, she always stays close to the edge of the same scene) <br /> <br /> Look at the movies "Englishman in New York" and "The New Twenty", both good for nostalgia. think that the movie "twenty" shows how much the blur between homosexual and heterosexual has evolved. <br /> <br /> These two films are from GAY Time Travel For Sure !!!!
