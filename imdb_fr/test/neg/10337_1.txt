I have to look at this shit all the way through to see if there is any redeemable quality that would justify including it in my clients' video libraries. Do not look at it, not even a minute, unless someone has a gun in his head. Like me, you will have moaned and moaned at least 500 times, and you will pray that one of the one-dimensional characters, all played by very bad actors, will turn around and kill you. <br /> <br /> Even if you're the biggest Sandra Bullock fan in the world, it's not even worth watching the two or three short scenes in which she appears. <br /> <br /> I want to hit the sordid marketing butts that put Sandra's huge picture on the face of this DVD box and threw them in jail for agitating me or something like that. I would really like to have the chance to read a review of this movie before buying it. <br /> <br /> Call me, I'll pay you $ 10 to immediately remove this film from my inventory it stinks the whole place! (I'm kidding - do not call please)
