Put the film down and back slowly. The actors play a piece of high school, the plot is trampled on and the values ​​of the production are slightly higher than those of the community theater. The blunders are so numerous that it becomes a laugh. Rooms are exchanged, movement is dead, dogs are used for wolves, men shoot blank with .45 caliber guns are able to walk and drive snowmobiles, button blouses and buttons without human contact ... this is a movie baaaaaaaaadddddddd. I almost lost consciousness when I saw the average rating. There is no accounting for the taste. BTW, there is no nudity.
