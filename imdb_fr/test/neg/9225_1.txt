If there is nothing worse than this movie, I do not want to see it. I remember so many amazing things: a nun came out of a coffin to make a raft for a blond little boy; the little blond boy worshiped himself as a god; many archive footage of Peru as an ideal vacation spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori should dispel any idea that Peru is a holiday paradise. All this is so horrible that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster is an aesthetic treat in comparison. This film should be bombed, strafed and bombed again.
