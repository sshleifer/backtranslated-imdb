Forgive me, but this work by director Peter Hall is horrible. If you can not contact us with the plot, why not kill someone's cat or dog? This surely reaches the public. This viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie. And, believe me, I saw it coming before it opened the package. How predictable can you get. Take a cute animal and then kill it in a horrible way. I have never been a fan of De Mornay and this performance tells me why. Overexploited and somewhat stagnant in his interpretation, I found it rather stupid and definitely boring. I liked Banderas, but I felt bad about playing against De Mornay. He did a lot better in other films, including "Philadelphia", where he had some honesty in his dialogues. In this chestnut, he did his best to keep his character real. But the writers Green & Rush have managed to prevent this with their banal intrigue and their insipid dialogue. Please, do not be subject to this kind of entertainment. Some of us are not fooled by cheesy intrigues, clubbed animals and generally long dialogues. Seeing her get away, it made me furious.
