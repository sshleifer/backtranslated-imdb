I am appalled that so many people have given positive reviews for this "film". This film has no redeeming factor. The music is not good, the acting is pathetic, I can not understand how someone could enjoy this film, not to mention singing his "praises". The idea is horrible, some scenes related to the plot (as the romance continues even if the romantic male interest is a SHRUNKEN HEAD) are so bad that I wanted to hurt myself by watching them. The fact that there is a scene in which a shrunken head flies under a girl's shirt so that he can "feel" her up AND she loves it is reason enough for all the people associated with this film to perish. The link to West Side Story can only be mocking, because referring to such a good movie in such a horrible movie is just reason enough to destroy all the copies of this film. In summary, this movie is horrible in every way. And if I had what it took, everyone who wants it should go straight to hell ...
