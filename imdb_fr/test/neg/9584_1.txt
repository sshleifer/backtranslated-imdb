This is a shabby movie, a pretender to a kind of movies at the end surprise. And a genre that has been done so much better before. The parcel runs the road, with a predictable end. (Yawn) The characters are inconceivable, and some are so implausible that they are almost unassailable. Matt Dillon, a fine and intense actor, is totally misunderstood, stiff and mannered. The others are forgettable. Much of the dialogue is sophomoric, again, a pretender trying to be spiritual. I would not hire the screenwriter to write my grocery list. Yes, it's so terrible, going from misogynous to just rude, as well as beyond frat-house gross. With so much talent, I'm really surprised that this movie was done. This shows the total lack of imagination of office suits ...
