And one of them are bad movies. The title, it turns out, refers to a killer of the human race, not fish. This is not the "Piranha" led by Dante de '78 (who had the fish) and is also known as "Piranha, Piranha". A trio of photographers, 2 men and a woman, rub shoulders with a local hunter / trapper named Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they do not know the curriculum vitae of William Smith, who plays Caribe; otherwise, they would have known immediately that he was the villain of the play. Smith may have also refused to film the end or cut before the end of the shoot (see end of commentary). <br /> <br /> As mentioned elsewhere, this photo is very busy - long shots of local wildlife (birds) - and the centerpiece, a motorcycle race that lasts too long. The reason I get a second star is of course William Smith, who really can not save that mud, but who proves once again why he was the guy to go to 30 to 35 years ago if you really needed a bad villain; at its best, Smith could be really terrifying. This is the guy who likes to kill, maybe sadistically, and you get that sense of the evil smile that he usually displays when a mood hits him. Physically, it is very imposing and you know that the other 3 characters are doomed to fail in the first half-hour. This is what Smith has brought to most of his roles. it seems hopeless for the other characters against this monster looking like a man. Unfortunately, the film continues to blur the tracks to the end, as if a minute of film was lost - a confusing and incomplete climax.
