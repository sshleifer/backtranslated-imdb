The characters are annoying, immature and flaky ... Madison being the most annoying of all. OOH ... a cold point! Such a threat! Any ghost in this house would have fled in self defense! To summarize, this film is boring. Seeing a chair flying across a room can be scary, but it's about as intriguing as it gets. I watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again, I was tempted to take a baseball bat on television rather than look at this garbage again. If you want a good horror movie or even a fair comedy, that's not it! The only good part of it was "the cockroach scene" and at the end of the movie you ended up feeling sorry for the doldrums!
