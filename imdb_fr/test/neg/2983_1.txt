It was without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen, and yet, once I started, it was like a real car wreck on the side of the road - you can not stop you just have to watch. My eyes !!! The game was horrible, the production was awful, the shooting was horrible, horrible, horrible. I was happy that the priest was chopped, would have liked to do it myself because of his bad role. I mean suck-ful act at the tenth power. I would have applauded if Chris had just eliminated them before blaming himself. And what was it WITH this wig panicking hell on the head ?! I sincerely hope that no one will be paid. I mean, if we were to be paid here, they should be paid to never try another movie project, everyone involved, never, never again. I'm embarrassed to say that this was a huge garbage can. I had to keep watching until the end. Do not look at it, it's about an hour and a half of your life that you will never see again and then you will have to spend time registering on this website so you can write a comment like the one I'm doing now. do like a catharsis in order to survive the aftershocks of seeing this movie (and I use the term "movie" loosely here).
