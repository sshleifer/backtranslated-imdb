Aaran is one of the movies where we find the holes in Indian cinema. Here is a good example to show how great writers, directors and actors succumb to producers. Here is one of the most wonderful actors, Mohanlal, who plays in a film about a real story in Kashmir. The seriousness of the film is filled by scenes and comic songs under standard. There is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who is actually the son of the producer of the film. Therefore, he does not cut his hair although his officer asks him. This kid does not know what's going on and he's the "hero" of the movie. God Help Indian Cinema with such producers. <br /> <br /> This film is a pathetic representation of what is happening in Kashmir. A sensible viewer can intuitively understand the constraints of such great writers, actors and directors who want to share their real experiences. But what is unfortunate is that a film about the highest ranks of the Indian militia proves to be a pathetic representation that only thinks that the film is stupid. <br /> <br /> We should oust such producers in the film industry and pave the way for good cinema.
