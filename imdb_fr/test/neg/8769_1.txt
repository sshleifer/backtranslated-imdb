As a fervent amateur of Christian cinema and someone who wants to keep a close eye on improvements in the field of Christian film production, I was excited to see this film. I was ready to see something that would make a new mark in quality movies. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The starting scene is excellent, although a slight scam of Leon - The Professional at the corner, it has an excellent cinematography at the beginning ... everything then about downhill. <br /> <br /> I was hardly able to attend this one, I was tempted several times just to close it. <br /> <br /> The acting game, although probably sincere, incredibly awful. But again, the scenario was at the heart of the problem. The dialogue was worse than anything I've ever seen, and even my amateur script "The Awakening" (soon an independent movie) looked like a Hitchcock thriller next to that. (Which does not say much.) The good side of this movie is that it was filmed with the brand new high-definition 900 Sony cameras shot in 24p. This movie and Star Wars: The Attack of the Clones were the first films to use these new technology cameras that year. Unfortunately, the camera's performance seemed to be spoiled by poor lighting, low angles, and tricky handling. <br /> <br /> The only good feeling I have felt watching this movie is the quality of my independent beginner film looking next. ; ) 4/10
