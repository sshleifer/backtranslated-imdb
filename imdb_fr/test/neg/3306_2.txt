Warning: this may contain spoiler !! <br /> <br /> First of all, I watch a lot of movies for life and I realize it's just that .... Movies for life. Some are excellent (really), some good and some bad. Unfortunately, this film enters the latter category. It actually started with potential ... A divorced single mother who works hard (leaving work at 2 am) interrupts a guy on her way home after work and just says he does not take it very well. . Criminal harassment begins immediately with the suspension of phone calls and spreads to her home by destroying her. So she goes to her mother's house for the night and the next morning, her mother's car explodes. This seems to be just a problem for our heroine who deals with it by shopping underwear and jewelry !!! So the police put his wife and son in a local motel to keep them safe and what does mom do? She goes to work leaving the kid alone at night in a strange motel room and told him to order a PIZZA! I could not believe it! So it's really stupid! And the end just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical. Too bad because it seemed to have possibilities.
