To quote Clark Griswold (on the original Christmas holidays): "WORSE, how could things get worse, look around, Ellen, we're on the threshold of hell." Few Chevy Chase knew he was describing the "sequel" to one of his best movies. Christmas Vacation II sets a new high (or maybe it should be low) in bad movies. My wife bought this DVD thinking it would be a sequel to the original, but we were very disappointed. This film is LAME. It does not look like the original, it's an absolute mess of film and an embarrassment for the good actors who had the bad luck to be part of it. He must have set a record on IMDb for the worst critics. I really think we have a good chance of winning a class action to recover the money that we, the consumers, wasted on this film.
