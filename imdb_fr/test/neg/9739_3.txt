Most of you have really hated this movie ... you were right. A small minority of you really liked the movie ... can not say you're wrong. For me, this movie was too stupid. I've seen a lot of idiotic and silly comedies but this one surpasses them all. As I watched, I could not help but rub my eyes, not believing what I was seeing and trying to decide whether to laugh or cry, when * REALLY STUPID * things were happening on the screen and that people were leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> According to the main characters, the journey in time is accomplished. Enter any museum and you will travel in the past. Also, if you're looking for an after-death experience, just go to the nearest planetarium, you'll meet Lord - sorry, Loydd, and you'll receive important orders ... All of the above does not really make sense , is not it? Come on, watch the movie (I almost never regret the movies I watch), you probably will not like it, but you'll be intrigued by the writer's ability to produce the ultimate STUPID script ... <br /> < I give it a 3 out of 10, not good, far from the worst ...
