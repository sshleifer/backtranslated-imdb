Yeah, maybe it's not for adults, and some adults may find it stupid, but if you do not think about it, it's not really that bad. <br /> <br /> The story has Alvin and his gang traveling the world, looking for gems for a bad person and mishaps they come into contact with. <br /> <br /> The animation is good, the story is cute and the songs are forgettable, but it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 6 out of 10 or *** on 4 stars.
