Fear and desire are of interest mainly to Kubrick's obsessed people, who can probe this pretentious trap for signs of his future greatness. Kubrick was right to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video. He found it embarrassing and amateurish and he was correct in his assessment. This is a weak and tedious film - at 68 minutes, it always seems longer than "Barry Lyndon"! - It is nevertheless of historical interest and has real exciting moments. This is a difficult film to find (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), but that might change if the Kubrick estate sells and is broadcast on video. Recommended only to Kubrick fans.
