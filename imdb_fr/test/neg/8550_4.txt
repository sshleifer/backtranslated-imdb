You Belong To Me was the last team of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a silkscreen team. It was a film lent to Fonda at Columbia Pictures. Fonda signed a contract with 20th Century Fox to become Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath. But after that, it was usually his loan films that were good while he was in a poor situation at the Fox. <br /> <br /> But the rule has been broken. Although the character he embodies has a superficial resemblance to Charles Pike of The Lady Eve, this movie is not as funny. In fact, feminists would probably be shocked. <br /> <br /> In fact, Barbara Stanwyck did not like that at all. She enjoyed working with Henry Fonda, but found the film ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Fonda is another millionaire playboy, whom we would now call a trust fund baby who does not really do much in his life. He's kind of like an adorable headboard that meets Stanwyck on a ski slope and literally cracks for her. It turns out she is a doctor and they have a very hot yard and get married. <br /> <br /> But it turns out Fonda has a jealous tendency, especially when it involves Roger Clark, another Stanwyck millionaire patient. And he does not understand his professional obligations. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck, like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, was and is a feminist icon. When she tells Fonda that he should enter the world of work and live with a salary and see if he can do it, Fonda leaves to find a job as a salesman in a department store. She is so proud of him that she will actually give up her medical practice and live with him with her salesman salary. <br /> <br /> Today, NOW would be poking the film. Stanwyck did not have much confidence in her performance, probably because she did not believe it. I certainly could not. <br /> <br /> I think that even at the time, the public did not believe it either. But both stars and the rest of the cast did their best, but this one was a Thanksgiving special.
