Deep Sea 3D is a breathtaking overview of the underwater world. Only a few have had the opportunity to see him closely. <br /> <br /> Since the opening sequence, a wave rushing to the audience engulfing us momentarily in the ocean, the filmmakers are using the full IMAX format. A field of jellyfish seems to occupy all the theater, a shark pushes us, predators leap behind the rocks and devour their prey. It is a feast for the eyes beautifully captured under the sea. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, our ears are not treated in the same way. The film is told by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet. Both sounds are so ridiculous that they spoil the pleasure of visuals. Depp seems slightly bored while Winslet sounds like she's reading a bedtime story to the village idiot. I was shocked that an actress of her status could have presented her performance so badly. The script is pretty dumb and contains very little depth. The soundtrack is full of strange and unrealistic sound effects that I suppose are supposed to be fun but actually distract from the material that should have been allowed to speak for itself. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman has provided an excellent score that gives a lot of impact on the ups and downs of underwater life, when it is allowed to play without the silly sounds of bubbles or escapades. crawfish that spices. <br /> <br /> The film is a technical marvel, but with its childish storyline, its annoying narration and misplaced sound effects, it can not be taken seriously.
