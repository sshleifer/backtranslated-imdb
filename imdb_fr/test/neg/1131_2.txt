It will really be a blue Christmas if you submit your family to this. I loved the original movie, and this one was not worthy of being his sequel. In reality, for all intents and purposes, this is not his sequel. Only one character of the original distribution is returned. Certainly, this character is the hilarious cousin Eddie, but it's just not hilarious to be the protagonist of a movie. His kennel is that of the zany parent who performs zany antics - alongside Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was needed in this film for it to be a success, and he certainly was not there. As far as I'm concerned, a movie is not a movie "Holiday" unless the good old Clark Griswold is at the helm.
