When I was 8 years old and was going through the Marx Brothers phase, my dad read in the TV guide that they were showing Marx Brothers' movie, "The Big Store" late Friday night, and asked the video recorder of the to record for me. When I woke up on Saturday - probably because of a printing error in the TV guide - my father and I discovered that "The History of Humanity" had been recorded instead. <br /> <br /> "Le Grand Magasin" was arguably one of the funniest films of all Marx Brothers films, it is still one of the best cinematographic works of the century compared to at "The Story of Mankind". I can almost justify the mistake of TV Guide in that the Marx brothers - Groucho, Chico and Harpo - appear in both films. Although in "The History of Humanity", they are divided into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho plays Peter Midnight, Chico plays a guy who talks to Christopher Columbus and Harpo plays Isaac Newton ????? Harpo's scene lasts about half a minute. Chico has only two or three lines; Groucho's scene is at least funny, but horribly insensitive to race, by today's standards. The rest of the film does not deserve to be mentioned. They released some of the best actors of the day and had them recite garbage. What a desappointment. <br /> <br /> TV Guide, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for an apology. <br /> <br /> For the record: "The Big Store" has a marvelous physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on skate, and some Virginia O'Brien songs. I could not wait to see him.
