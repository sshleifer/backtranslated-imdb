Last night, I had the opportunity to see a preview of Prozac Nation. Because I love everything Christina Ricci does, I was very excited at first, but as the movie progressed, I began to wonder where he was going. Based on a true story, it's just Christina Ricci's character and her fight against depression, drugs, friends and family, as you can probably see from the title. In my opinion, this movie was too fast and too dramatic. I would say that there is a dramatic moment every five minutes and that the film went through his life extremely fast, which did not leave us any contact with the character of Christina Ricci. Christina Ricci's performance has been fantastic as always, but Jessica Lange has distinguished herself throughout the film and I think the success of this film will be entirely due to her and to Christina Ricci. I would give 4 out of 10 and I would recommend renting this one or reading Elizabeth Wurtzel's books: they are good and are worth a visit.
