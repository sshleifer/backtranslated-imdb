That's all I can really say about this movie. It's DBZ ... like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, that ... does not fit in the timeline of the show at all, although it's supposed to be just before the TV show begins. The action is pretty cool in general. The plot has a pretty nice background, with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all. Rather good in general, there ... The problem is ... there are a lot of really weird things. I mean, really weird stuff. As in The World's Strongest, there's a really very strange song in this one that could only have been created in a drug-induced fog ... which is disturbing is that Gohan, while singing , is almost drugged. Creepy. The bad guys are strange and rather funny ... more than the usual type of DBZ - it looks more like a Dragon Ball movie than a Dragon Ball Z movie. In general, it's pretty fun, but ... just ... strange.
