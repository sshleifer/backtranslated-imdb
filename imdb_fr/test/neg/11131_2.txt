This movie was just not very funny. There is not much to say, except that it was quite embarrassing for Laurence Fishburne and David Hyde Pierce, both of whom deserve a lot better than that. Also, I do not understand why, after this film completely and completely bombarded, WB insisted on making it a television show.
