This film has the distinction of being the worst movie I have ever seen and the only movie I ever gave to a 1 in 10 on imdb. I was fooled into praising him because of H.R. Giger's cover on the box. This cover art is the only thing that is the least bit wrong in this steaming pile of ... <br /> <br /> These were fraternal boys fighting "monsters" in a strange post apocalyptic world but not most interesting. the cities are in ruins / chaos, but apparently, the suburbs are still a safe and wonderful place for young men who wish to inculcate other men in fraternal organizations. The most insignificant performances of boring characters, special effects, terrifying scenery, unoriginal decorations and generally extremely poor quality in all aspects of production make this lemon the absolute loser of my list. <br /> <br /> FINAL NOTE: 1/10 I wish I could give him a zero. <br /> <br /> Noob Aalox
