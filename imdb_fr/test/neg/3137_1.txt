Critics are a strange kind of people. Some of them are ordinary people like you and me. Some are not. When a critic says that Subconscius Cruelty is beautiful, I wonder where they grew up? What's so good about shooting a field, clouds or a tree with an old camera if you can not do it with style and capture the mood of the surroundings. Karim Hussain for sure can not. I have seen kids make better movies than Karim in Subconscius Cruelty. But that's not the worst. The worst is the whole recording, I refuse to call it a movie, it's a bad excuse for nudity and extreme torture, rapes of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, piss, cannibalism, murder of kids and so much more. I like gore / splatter and I like horror. It's neither one nor the other. It's shit and if my comments make one person forget the cruelty of Subconscius, it's worth it. Always remember that your life will not last forever, do not waste two hours of precious time on the cruelty of Subconscius. You have been warned.
