Was it supposed to be a comedy? The black cape and the skeleton mask are hilarious. There is like the plot zero. The film begins with an archaeologist and his assistant. They make a small mention of their cursed search site. And then, here ... ..... in drops Male Halloween Costume, wearing a shiny black cape, with a skeleton mask, holding an ax. So he kills those two people. Then we cut the woods with a bad imitation of Predator, only the commandos are tracked by the Man in the Halloween Costume who now rides! More commandos appear, but these people are supposed to be disguised as a group of hikers. Yes, the production probably lacked commando costumes. Can you say, small budget? Anyway, they fall on an old Indian alone sitting in the woods. He's so funny. And he starts chatting about something, but you really do not know what he's mumbling about, so they're reminding Indians who are being killed. None of this really makes sense. And then we go back to our commandos where more of them are killed. And it's really essentially the plot. It's so ridiculously bad that you can not really look away because you want to see how far it goes. You can do the same movie with a camcorder, a Halloween costume and a band of your friends with fake guns. Do not see this thing if you want a horror movie. If you want a comedy, maybe? Or skip it and get something like the real Predator.
