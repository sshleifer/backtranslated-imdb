It usually sounds better in my head (so forgive me for losing myself), I'm not the biggest fan of Tarantino (and I'm going to * try * not to lower myself to call it a "hack". .. which is quite difficult) I do not like to make fun of or criticize a movie before I see it. So, with cautious hesitation, I went to the movies today to watch "Inglorious Basterds". <br /> <br /> From now on, calling it a "scam scam" would be unfair here. Tarantino is happy enough to take the title of Enzo Castellari's Dirty Dozen (less than spectacular) clone, but no conspiracy points (which he takes from all other kinds of films) "Inglorious" opens with an officer Nazi and his long interrogation against a farmer who hides Jews in his basement. It is such an anti-climax, in that the dialogue is obsolete and the exit is indicated at one kilometer. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her run away (but more of her later) Our audience (obviously, easily satisfied) is invited to introduce Lieutenant Aldo Raine (ha-ha, that name sounds almost like B-movie the king ALDO RAY .... ha ha ha Quentin ... continue these "tributes") and this character is played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was pretty much the only good thing in which he ever had played) and, with his mouth open, Mr. Jolie treats us like a Nazi killer on the trail, trailing south. Meanwhile, Mr. Tarantino forgets that large adults could be present and therefore assumes that teenagers will not have heard of the "Dirty Dozen"? <br /> <br /> The Raines "platoon" consists of (John Cassavettes looking) bloodthirsty Jewish soldiers, all seeking to get the big return on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino, in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, pointing to his long-time best friend (and homage-sycophant compatriot), Eli Roth (as a baseball bat brandishing 'Bear Jew') . The other man is Hugo Stiglitz. (And I'll bet that more than half of QT fans have never heard this name before this movie) Keep up the good work Tarantino, you've managed about 6 or 7 "tributes" so far (in the first 15 minutes ) keep adding them, and this could be detrimental to the plot (or the lack of?) <br /> <br /> Anyway, cutting short to a long (and extremely boring and very long ) history, Raine and his men (Inglorious Basterds') and the only survivor of the first chapter, they both have a plot to kill Hitler during the projection of a Nazi propaganda film, in a French cinema (owned by mentioned survivor, now grown up) <br /> <br /> More boring (and useless) conversations ensue, as Pitt moves away in front of an attentive audience. And any real suspense leading to the assassination of the deadliest tyrant of all time is sidelined by the director's insistence on placing a 1980s David Bowie song in a World War II film. <br /> My problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the recurring problem I have with most Tarantino products ..... it rarely knows when to start or stop. I do not need "tribute" after "tribute" to understand the * joke * (anyway). I knew Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the whole movie) of Ennio Morricone's haunting REVOLVER score. I go to the cinema to see the stars ... If all you can do is Barad Pitt, I suppose you (Mr. Tarantino) are the main attraction here? I do not want the audience to direct the film. I pay to see YOUR vision, your ideas, your creativity .... NOT how you can patchwork (over and over again) endless scenes of endless movies. It's about time that the fan-boys (on IMDb) use a "hard love" on your "idol" (God knows if you do not ... the studios should?) <br /> <br /> Tired The old fight with the faithful Tarantino is "good, if you can do better ... do it", let me tell you, if I was a 46-year-old director, with the shooter (unhappy) QT has ..... We want to offer you much more than a muddled rehandling of World War II's best films than this tripe. The directors he tries to emulate make movies so bad by accident or because of budget constraints. It's a cop, many times, to hear his fans campaign for his lack of imagination as "art". I'm sure he's capable of better (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, again ... and not to mention 2 1/2 hours of my life ...) maybe he does not 'is not?
