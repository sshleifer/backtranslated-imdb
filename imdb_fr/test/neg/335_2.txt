I made great efforts to get this movie after reading the reviews on this site. I really do not have time to write reviews, but I felt it was my duty as a horror sci-fi enthusiast. This is only the second criticism I wrote. The other was for Dracula 3000. Now, get right to the point. This film was nil. Clear and simple. I was wondering if I was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those "nice" comments. I saw movies with bad effects, bad acting, bad sound, name it and I saw it. But it's really bad. I do not care how much it costs or not, movies like this and Dracula 3000 should be banned and the entire cast and film crew arrested and imprisoned for life murder. By the way, did I mention that this movie was nil? I mean really sucked. The plot was non-existent and the acting was weak. It seems that the writer has seen Pitch Black and gets upset at not having thought of such a plot. So he decided to create his own torn version. But instead, the suction factor took over and possessed it. DO NOT WATCH THIS. You will have more fun if you remove your pants and sit on hot coals.
