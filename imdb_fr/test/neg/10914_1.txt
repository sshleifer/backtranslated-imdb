<br /> <br /> Man, I can not believe this movie. I looked at it entirely (believe me, that's what I did!) And the best part was the traillers at first (and I hate the traillers !!!!). <br /> <br /> No conspiracy, no acting, no nothing. I was watching the movie and I thought, "When will it start?" It never started. How can people spend their time and money doing such shit? <br /> <br /> The plot: a dog is stung by a bat and catches rabies - Okay, so far, no problem, nothing special but OK. Now the rest of the movie will be - the dog will chase people !!! that's all, nothing else !!! Add to that some of the worst acts / actors I've ever seen, completely unrealistic scenes (and others really silly, as if the child was gasping and the mother gave him a big hug to see if he was better), and a very lame end, that's it, you have here CRAP ... ops! .... CUJO. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and do something more worthy, like banging your head against the wall or playing chess with yourself. <br /> <br /> ZERO out of 10. <br /> <br /> Gabriel.
