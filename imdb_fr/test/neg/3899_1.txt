I know that Jesse Franco is responsible for a wide variety of films, and I especially prefer his horror films, as ugly as they sometimes are. I suppose it was morbid curiosity that led me to that, and I was not even curious enough to finish it. Maybe things have improved towards the end, but unless you like lesbian sex scenes (there are many), you might want to move on. So what can you say exactly about a movie featuring a woman peeing in a bowl on the kitchen counter (getting up)? Never worry about what is used for later, you probably do not want to know. If this sounds intriguing to you then this is your problem, but again, you may like this movie. Myself, I'm not prudish, I've seen a lot of disgusting movies of my day but at least they've been well done, and that's not the case. Sometimes, too much is too much. Bleah.
