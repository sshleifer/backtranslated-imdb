This very finely realized film commits the unforgivable (which is ironic given the theme of the film). Nobody in this movie knows what they will do. Worse than that, three quarters of the film, no one has any idea what they will do, because everything until this "moment" is a different film. <br /> <br /> As a fan at the forefront of Dutcher's first two films, easily competing for the 2 best Mormon films to date (competing with Saints and Soldiers and, now, New York Doll - seen at of a projection), Dutcher had made me want to see his film for a very long time. I was there. I wanted to believe, to believe that I would see the next big Mormon movie, a movie that would hold Numero Uno's place for a very long time. But no. Three-quarters of the film took the left-most bend and dragged me into something I never wanted to do. He takes the mountain. All the moral problems, yes, both, with little time or the emotional ability to approach them adequately, but rather invite them both with a nod to Jesus as if it restores everything, instantly. (It is true that Jesus is saving, do not accuse me of not believing that, it is not Dutcher's problem.) <br /> <br /> Was the film shot well? Effectively. Do the actors act? They played their pants. Was the music appropriate? Everything except what was above the closing credits. Everything in this film was superb, except for the story, which was so absent and false, that everything else does not matter. (I learned "dank" of New York Doll, very decent show, by the way). The third act of the film was neither desirable nor pleasant nor sincere. I know Dutcher would go out of his way to make it happen, but at that moment I was so excited that nothing, nothing could bring me back. The incredible ridiculous dozens of details in the last minutes did not help. Anyone who has been on mission knows what I am talking about, especially anyone who "Spoiler Alert" is aware of the events surrounding someone being fired early for moral and / or psychological reasons. It is as if a parallel universe has suddenly arisen, where normal rules or behaviors no longer apply. <br /> <br /> There are a million positive things in this movie, but they have been created and embellished to be trampled and thrown into a knee crisis of "ooh, this is really going to get them" elitism. Therefore, unforgivable. I only hope that when Dutcher finishes his next film ("Falling", apparently), he will remember that film critics can only buy very few tickets and that it is the fans who pay the bill. That's why the first army of God was so successful. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's shocked and stunned approach proves that, with regard to the great problems, he is above his head, having neither the spiritual nor the creative maturity nor the sense of the necessary business. to take them. I pray ?? Please! He learns his lesson and that in a few years he will look back with regret and will rejoice to have pulled his head from where the light does not shine and successfully takes on these and other questions and changes the world forever because of that.
