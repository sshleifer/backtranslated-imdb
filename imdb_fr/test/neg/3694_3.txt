I really like sci-fi movies from the '50s. I like very good ones (like The Day the Earth Stops, When Worlds Collide, Invasion of Body Snatchers, and More) and sometimes the very bad ones because they can be really fun and great to watch with friends (like plane 9 of outer space). However, when a sci-fi movie is bad but not enough to be fun, you really have to avoid it. This movie is just such a movie. The posters make it appear as a kind of sexy beast that attacks humanity, while the real plot is much less interesting. A woman is married to a womanizer. She is contaminated and begins to grow to a huge size and decides to hunt down this worm and kick it in the tail and that's about it. In addition, many special effects are really nauseating - especially the huge paper mache hand that enters the room to catch the mean husband.
