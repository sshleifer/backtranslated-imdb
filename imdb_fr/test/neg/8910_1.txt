Really? Is it necessary? How can anyone make such a movie? Repugnant!!! Seteven Seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. Waterfalls all the time, cars persecuted with an annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the end. Completely absurd with the presence of the little girl. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood !!! At first, a fortuneteller responds to something that no one has asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and can see the future. They must be laughing. Steven Segal faints after a persecution of the car and I know he can not act. It was terrible. Nothing can save this movie. <br /> <br /> I lost 90 minutes of my life! See you
