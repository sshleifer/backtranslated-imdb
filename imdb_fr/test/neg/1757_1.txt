Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renne Zelwigger. They are all horrible. Especially the star, Jude Law. <br /> <br /> It is directed by the same guy who made the English patient and is based on the best-selling novel of a man who risks everything to regain his love, but unlike the marvelous English pateint, this film is nil. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> The worst dialogue of all time. "But we only knew each other for a while" "But it was a thousand moments, like diamonds in a bag" <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> "In some cultures, you come I must tell you that I marry you 3 times and that you are married "lovey-dovey-" I marry you, I marry you, I marry you, I marry you ... "<br /> <br /> I shame I sat through all this. <br /> <br /> all the movie was horrible, horrible ... Ughh, no words, I'm sick. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (This one is for very strong ball sounds, the sound team did a good job)
