When I looked at the back of the cover of this film, it seemed to me that my friends and I could expect 82 memorable minutes. And it was definitely memorable. Puckoon was the kind of movie where you always wonder how it was possible. How it was possible that it was released on DVD at all. Of all the movies available at the video rental store that night ... we might have picked the worst. And yes, they had Tomb Raider. Absolutely nothing in this film even amused me slightly. Who had the idea that it would be amusing for the narrator to change the story with suggestions from the main character? Of all the stupid things with which you can totally ruin a movie, it's now my favorite. The character Foggerty, the idiot of the village, played by Nickolas Grace, is the most boring character since the beginning of the realization of color films. If there's one movie you should not see this year, please let it be, Puckoon, because I do not think it can be worse. I still wonder if this could have been the worst way I spent my money, and believe me, I made very bad purchases over the years.
