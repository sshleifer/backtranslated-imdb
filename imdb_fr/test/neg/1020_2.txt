He is the only reason to see this movie. He gives a very good performance - much better than what shit deserves. He is very handsome and very talented - he deserves better than that. It is also depressing to see Malcolm McDowell in this situation. This is another talented actor who deserves better but, like Esai, he gives a very good performance. So, if you are a fan of one or the other, you may want to watch. Otherwise, stay away. Another complaint - could we have had more scenes of Esai shirtless?
