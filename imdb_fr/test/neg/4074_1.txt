This film was embarrassing because of its clich√©s, mediocre play and generally low production values. It starts badly with the long-haired 3-star general calling the hero, Masters, "major" as he visibly wears the lieutenant colonel's silver oak leaves. But what was most painful was the crew of soldiers on Neptune Atoll. How can one be disconnected from any kind of reality? They were all experts in flying a 747 and the scenes of soldiers digging the ditch were more than comical. <br /> <br /> WARNING: THIS FILM IS DANGEROUS FOR YOUR INTELLECTUAL HEALTH! LOOK AT YOUR OWN PERIL!
