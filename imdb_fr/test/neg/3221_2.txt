One of my friends decided to rent this thing, luckily it was not my money ... It wasted my time. A story that could have been interesting is completely ruined by an incredibly bad acting act and a horrible editing / director. Perhaps it would become a classic because of the weird over-action :) (character Gary Busey for example) bad reasons obviously) where the film itself failed miserably. In short: a waste of time and money <br /> <br /> 2/10
