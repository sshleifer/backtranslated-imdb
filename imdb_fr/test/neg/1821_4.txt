Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson perform well with southern and New Orleans accents in this detective film. It's worth being seen for their scenes - and Rickman's scene with Hal Holbrook. It seems that these three actors entertain us, no matter the film. The plot for the film shows the potential, but looking at the film, it feels like it was not shot as well as it could have been. The fact that it is cluttered by an irrelevant secondary plot and especially uninteresting kidnappers really confuses things. The film is worth seeing, if only for entertaining performances by Rickman, Thompson and Holbrook.
