During the shooting, did Vanessa Redgrave take mogadon? It was as if she was reading a cab. I saw more life in a wooden spoon. Or maybe it was all part of the character? whatever it was, it was very very annoying, I always wanted to shake the screen to squeeze it. I read the book a long time ago and I did not like much about it except that the descent into the madness of Septimus was very well done - but I do not think Rupert Graves showed it very well Well, his acting was on the surface. The connection between his life and Clarissa's life is not very good either, but I suppose the attempt is to show the sacrifices made by the soldiers to allow people like Clarissa to continue living indifferently. The film is very pungent and shows no real unity. I hated.
