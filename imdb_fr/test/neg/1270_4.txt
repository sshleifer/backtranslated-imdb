Spiderman was one of the first comics to initiate a genre change: although it's a super-hero comic book, it's the first series to add real psychological depth to the main character, a complex moral problem, characters and also brought to light social and political issues. in other words: Spiderman was the majority of the comics. This television series lacks all these components. It's just a simple good buy / nasty TV show that suffers from obvious budget constraints that make the action scene moderately exciting. The Spiderman nylon canvas is about as convincing as the cardboard flip flop in Star Trek. Nicholas Hammond is way too old for the role at that time. I think he was in his thirties while Spider, the man was really teenager at the time. For some unfathomable reason, the editors also changed their names and removed important characters from the comic strip, which again caused the tension between the characters to disappear.
