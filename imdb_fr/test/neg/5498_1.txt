Adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by Hollywood for his friendly and user-friendly shooting techniques, Tim Burton tipped the scales too far in favor of the formula with his new surprise of a movie legend, Sleepy Hollow. Following the quest of the Ichabod crane ?? played by Johnny Depp, delivering the only brilliant point of this monotonous film ?? At the heart of the mystery surrounding the seemingly random and macabre murders of a city perpetrated by a legendless horseman, the story unfolds as if it deliberately tries to be predictably disgusting. Conceived as a story for children, the introduction of a common character is accompanied by exciting hunting scenes, designed to arouse the interest, which, with undeveloped characters fleeing to save their lives, produce about as much fright and thrills than The nightmare before Christmas. <br /> Shuffle a bunch of endless old trees to create an ambiance and great interest for a wide-eyed blonde (Christina Reechi) and Burton himself has a film that takes the ancestral legend of Sleepy Hollow and managed to do it like a Disney movie without the charm or captivation. Dialog was agitated and ridiculous, his severed heads were legion, and there were enough intriguing monologues to embarrass James Bond. Even with the support of Emmanuel Lubezki, Hollywood's hottest director of photography today, Depp's wonderful acting experience and the amazing recognition of Burton's name, Sleepy Hollow has nothing to lose in mind. .
