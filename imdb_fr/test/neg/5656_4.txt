First of all ... I must say that playing is not very good. Miranda Cosgrove is the main character, but she's not really a good actress. Spencer, his brother is a much better actor. Spencer is easily my favorite character because he is probably the only one who knows how to play. Carly, meanwhile, tries to play her heart but ... sorry, it's not good. Sam does not even get credit, I mean come on ... ICARLY ... rather selfish, huh? Freddy is not bad, I have no comment. I must add that Carly and her puppet Sam change their attitude every time they shoot a webcast, they shout all their lines. It's a bit of a bad influence, because Carly has a webcast and if the kids copy it, could be giving her own information and it's not very safe. <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing is that it contains a FEW fun parts of the series that makes it entertaining. At least this show is not boring, it has beautiful intrigues, strong enough. This will appeal to many children as they do not look for faults. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a bad show but it's not boring.
