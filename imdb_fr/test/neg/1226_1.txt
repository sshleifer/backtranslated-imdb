I was really looking forward to seeing the rest of Lonesome Dove, but it was a total waste. The cinematography was terrible. Shooting too tight. I watched the Grand Canyon almost through a fixed telescope. The assembly was cut, cut, cut. Not even smooth. More like a bad student publisher. I do not know if McMurtry played the screen but the dialogue was terrible. Really the portrait of Val Holiday by Doc Kil in Wyatt Earp, but what the hell was he doing with this character in Comanche Moon ??? I have no idea. It would have even been said that it had been shot on a sound stage using the old decorations Bonanza. How can the director of the original Lonesome Dove go so bad? Where was his head .............. I can not say more for the actors' game either. It's a shame to have spoiled such a beautiful western, but it's more like they rushed to put it in the box. I read other reviews and see that others have felt the same way. Not even curious to watch the next nights as it would be a waste of time like the first night. <br /> <br /> (2nd message) .............. .... OK, since nothing else was on TV, I have to be honest and admit that I watched the last 2 nights of Comanche Moon. And I will be honest to tell you that I did not arrive at the end of one of the last 2 episodes because I fell asleep! I can only admit that I was observing the two main characters very closely and that I could identify some of Steve Zahn's mannerisms while describing the character with whom Duval had done such an excellent job. So, I have to give credit to Zahn for that. As for the representation of Karl Urban ... a simple dead meat. I can only say again that I was very disappointed only because I was very interested in the original LD ​​and, like others, I defended my feelings for a real big western.
