This film includes 2 well-known actors that I already liked to watch. The actions are great and every action is felt in the heart. But that makes me think that these two were thrown into a lecture / theater class at the college for the first time and that they were ordered to act dominantly and restrictively in a room without allowing him to leave and that the woman is really innocent and treats her was awesome enough to make the audience cry, crying for her release. <br /> <br /> The only positive point is the abilities of action, the plot has the same trick as Hitler's influence and I started to hate the protagonist this. But all of this could have been done in 15 minutes in my opinion, so hanging it for more than an hour was just a punishment for everyone watching it. <br /> <br />
