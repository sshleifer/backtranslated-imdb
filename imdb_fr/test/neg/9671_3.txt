Disney type animations with moments of graphic violence and sex references worthy of Disney. Ugly comedy alongside moralistic clich√©s. Noah like Abraham, Lot like his bad boyfriend. Laughable special effects. Overdone acting with bad timing. Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed before the flood? Strange twists and many secondary intrigues that the Bible does not mention. God as a dubious father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding that the world must be saved from disaster. <br /> <br /> B-movie director Wannabee, John Irvin, adds a new failure to his worthless list of bad film directors who seriously lack intrigue and direction.
