I was very disappointed with this series. There was a lot of cool graphics and that's about it. The level of detail he entered was minimal, and I always feel that the audience was patronized - there was a lot of what seemed to me to be "It's extremely cool but we're not going explain this in more detail "because you will not get it anyway. We will just show you pretty pictures to entertain you. "The host would drop interesting words such as" sparticles "and" super-symmetry "without trying to explain what it was, we had to search for it on Wikipedia. <br /> <br /> In addition, I know the superstrings quite well (for a layman) and I found that their explanations were complicated and could have been so much better.They could have chosen a lot of better examples to explain the concepts, but on the contrary, the examples they have been confused and have further obscured the subject. <br /> <br /> In addition, I've had enough of the rehearsal.They could easily have condensed the series into a single episode if they had eliminated any They must have shown the clips of the Quantum Café about 8 times, the host kept saying the same things over and over and over again, I do not remember how many times he said, "The universe is made of tiny vibrating strings. " as if they were trying to make us accept that "superstring is the best thing since sliced ​​bread". <br /> <br /> Finally, the show ended with an unpleasant feeling of "competition" between Fermilab and CERN, clearly biased towards Fermilab. This is supposed to be an educational program on quantum physics, not that the US is better than Europe or vice versa! I also thought it was part of the condescending approach - "Spectators must see a conflict to stay interested." Please. Give me a little more credit than that. <br /> <br /> Overall, 2 inches down :-(
