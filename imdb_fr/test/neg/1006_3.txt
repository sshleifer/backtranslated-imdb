I would put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Cobra and Stallone's Commando. The box I would sell for $ 2 at a garage sale with all the videos inside. The story tells about the main character coming back from the success of the previous movies to spoil everything with this jumble of garbage. Why did the producers want to destroy the reputation of the last 2 movies with this cheap junk? The story is so lame that it must have been a scandalous sequel. I talked about Cobra earlier because he has the same mood, that a man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. This film and Cobra were both determined to show the hero his weapons at the hip and the enemy falling in large numbers. The police spend hours on the shooting range so why were they shot by gang members who were aimlessly firing on their hips? This movie was so bad that I thought for a minute of Death Wish 4.
