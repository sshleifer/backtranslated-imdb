The actors and the team of this cheap horror boiler are more interesting than anything that happens throughout the movie; we have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and writer-director Curt Siodmak, director of photography Charles Van Enger, managing editor Francis D. Lyon and the production assistant Herman Cohen there. Payton, infamous, turns the heads of almost all the males with whom she comes into contact deep in the African jungle, where she lives in her husband Cavanaugh's plantation: Dr. Conway secretly wants her while the foreman's approach to the burning head is, literally, more secure. On the other hand, Chaney is (quite surprisingly) the authoritative and knowledgeable character, and knowing Strode, is an aboriginal police official. The plot is very simple but, frankly, it does not make much sense: after a particularly hectic dinner with a storm, Burr and Cavanaugh (art imitating life - more on that later) are unleashed in the garden for their affection for Payton and, ideally for Burr, a big snake crawls right next to Cavanaugh! Testifying to the event behind the bushes, Payton's enigmatic maid (an Aboriginal witch, no less), for some inexplicable reason, casts a curse on Burr (who in the meantime married Payton) who periodically turns her into Gorilla ... from the day of her marriage (when her hand turns briefly in shaggy)! As a result, Burr takes the risk of getting lost in the jungle several days in a row ?? even if the creature monkey itself is barely interviewed throughout the film. It must be said, however, that the version I watched lasted only 56 minutes when the "official" time is elsewhere indicated as being 66, 70 or 76 !! Therefore, the film feels logically disconcerted and disjointed, if ever it is pleasant to live on, as it culminates in the subjective pursuit by Payton's gorilla in the jungle, the latter being pursued by Chaton and Conway, two gun-lovers at fire. To return for a moment to the tragic main actress of the film: after a promising debut in films alongside Hollywood legends such as James Cagney and Gary Cooper? in, respectively, KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE and DALLAS (1950) ?? her career quickly dipped into category B territory (and less) with her own "off-screen" puffs: her most notorious offense was the cause of a fight in a high-profile bar between her husband Suave, Franchot Tone and brutal former lover Tom Neal who ended up in a coma and Payton finally gave up soon after! But that was not all: the nymphomaniac Payton also boasted that Woody Strode was part of his conquests (a controversial issue at the time); the ephemeral Tone, who caught Payton's unfaithfulness in front of the camera, spread the overwhelming photographic evidence around Hollywood and practically served to end her starlet existence? his latest appearance in the film, MURDER IS MY BEAT (1955) by Edgar G. Ulmer, is in my stack of Unwatched Movies. The last 12 years of his tumultuous life have been spent on Skid Row in the midst of alcohol, drugs, prostitution, beatings, arrests and even stabbings. before dying in 1967 in his parents' house at the age of 39!
