The Twilight Zone has achieved some mythology about it - a bit like Star Trek. This is because there are many lovers in the series who think that each episode has been a winner. They are the ones who assign a score of 10 to each individual and can not objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, some time ago, I reviewed all the original episodes of Star Trek (the good and the bad) because the ratings and reviews were overall too positive. Now it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Now I was very surprised to see the critics for this bland episode who described him as "among the best" and gave him a score of 10 If so, then why is all those I know who have seen this episode hate him as much as me? It's possible that my family, friends, and I are all crazy, but it's also possible that this is another case of rabid fans who swell furiously the note of an average or below-average episode. <br /> <br /> The episode itself stars William Windom. and others as various archetypes - a soldier, a dancer, and so on. They are all stuck in a cylindrical room with no way out and only at the end, you realize the "shocking truth" - which is not at all shocking and is in fact mostly lame. No, this is a badly written and uninviting episode. Yes, there were a lot of episodes of the series that deserved a 10, but a few as deserving as this one because of a shallow scenario and unattractive resolution.
