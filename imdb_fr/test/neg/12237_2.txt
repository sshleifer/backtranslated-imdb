Sometimes things just do not have to be done. And, although the scenery looked good enough, it only makes the audience mouth-yelling in horror. But the problem is that it's not another Saw movie. It's such a shame that you want to receive a punishment from Jason Voorhees. <br /> <br /> I lost track of the number of sports movies and parodies he incorporated into the film. And usually, he failed in his attempts. Admittedly, telling his team that they had to fail on all the topics to be real players was a little funny at first, but it was tiring to watch. That and the joke about "Radio" and "IPod". <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not stand watching this movie anymore. Even Trantasia is worth more than that. "RE-"
