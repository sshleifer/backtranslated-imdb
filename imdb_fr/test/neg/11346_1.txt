It's so bad that I do not know where to start. <br /> <br /> The main role is a good starting point. It is a supreme character of Mary Sue who has little in common with the original book, which was (a little) more credible. No, this one is invincible, infallible, indomitable and tasteless, even beyond the exaggerated standards that this era of "chicks with the sword" is creating. She is a top-model in her twenties, skinny as a rich partner, already a leader in her academic field, a master of kung-fu, a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to naturally prevail over any official like FBI agents. She is God. <br /> <br /> To balance her, she is supposed to be socially awkward (because of her typically tough upbringing that turned her into a "Spock"), which gives us moments of happiness where she gets herself Demand is "Star Wars," or "American Idol," but when it's really important, she can easily turn out to be a superior negotiator and diplomat because she's so superior, you know. To top it off, she is played by a wooden actress. <br /> <br /> The most talented Boreanaz serves as a token of self-defense for this build, acting as comic-relief and home "Watson". In fact, all there is in it is a parody pop of better works such as Sherlock Holmes, CSI and X-Files, from which it tries to imitate the sexual tension between the main protagonists. It is cheaper, however, because it comes with all the subtlety of a nudge in the ribs, but a million million poor factory girls will probably join, hence the crazy note that this turkey gets . <br /> <br /> In fact, the lowest common denominator goes a long way to this sad puppy, resulting in attractive details about the sex of the legion of sidekicks that aim to make it look bold and fashionable while the general tone of the show carries a neo-conservative evidence of things. <br /> <br /> At the level of history, there is not much to feast on, because crimes (which always start with macabre remains) are solved using a non-existent technology , while the "ladles" are adorable. but so fake (women less than guys) continues on various theories, all futile because the main character has everything from the beginning, and once he is established, she goes out and hits the guy, typically a hard hombre, with a kick here and a slap there. The end.
