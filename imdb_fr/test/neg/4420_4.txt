The width and height of the scale of this film overwhelm me. About a week ago, I posted a commentary on the silent epic of 1926, MACISTE IN HELL, in which he was described as "amazing." Then I met the Pollonia Bros. BLOOD RED PLANET. Wow ... <br /> <br /> It all depends on how much thinking is behind it. The group Pollonia Bros. and his colleague John McBride thought so big that the reveries of Arthur C. Clark & ​​Stanley Kubrick 2001: A SPACE ODESSEY are lucky to be published thirty-two years earlier. In fact, Kubrick had the easy task with model makers, a budget, real actors and a major studio support for his little "Star Trek" scam, and all that Arthur C. Clarke had to do was write the damn thing. Why is it so difficult to build a typewriter? The Pollonia brothers, on the other hand, had to think radically, outside the box, and quickly. They recruited half a dozen of their friends and colleagues - including a sexy girl - bought a bunch of colorful bulbs, raided the old dumps of office supplies for every hands-free keyboard, monitor and headset that they found, got the same status of black turtlenecks, made with every cupcake mold in the county, learned enough textures and 3D textures to animate a few spaceships flyovers, spent a few hours writing to a scenario, performing what is easily the most frightening space monster puppet since this horrible little monster, Jabba, the hut that accompanied it, was fried by R2D2, literally spent days working with a VHS camera and an Amiga to shoot and edit their film, and won first prize. It's the best D.I.Y. that I have never seen, and in proportion to the number of talents and resources available to filmmakers, even the dwarves, even LOGANS RUN or BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA (the original series) as a cold look on our future, up to to a newspaper presenter wearing a mis-matched and ill-fitting second-hand suit. As a species, we are doomed. <br /> <br /> Seriously for a minute, this is a considerable progress compared to more recent epics such as THE DINOSAUR CHRONICALS or PREYALIEN: ALIEN PREDATORS, which is fun since its creation one of these chefs -d'œuvre. Somewhere in the lines, the Pollonia have started to take control: this film is executed with a conviction that suggests that you can really breathe in the air by wearing a dust mask and two bottles of motorcyclists disposable bikers. And the scene where the foreign beast consumes a miniaturized crew member immediately made me think of the place where I had already seen this before: GODZILLA VS. THE SEA MONSTER, where the giant crab-monster unleashes two canoes and eats them in front of a camera. It made me cry when I was a child. <br /> <br /> It made me cry in adulthood because here I was wasting my time trying to be a kind of critic or writer or writer / critic and those guys come to Have fun making a real sci-fi epic with lots of colorful lights, a sexy girl and a talking slide projector named KAL. One of the flight crew members even wears his black baseball cap in the back and glows with his goat like that Metallica clown. Is it supposed to be a joke? No, it's an epic statement about humanity, from one humanity to another, that deserves to be seen by anyone who has the ability to take anything too seriously. Look for it on a 2-disc box called GALAXY OF TERROR in your favorite retailer's DVD cutter bins, which is probably the one to which it belongs, but how many of us can say, "Yeah, they have a few sets of our movies for sale at Best Buy. "<br /> <br /> 4/10: Anyone who lacks humor may want to try SILENT RUNNING or maybe TRON. But one day, an extraterrestrial civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept a transmission of this film and decide that we should not be disturbed. Good job guys !!
