I guess "Scarecrow Gone Wild" is a dull slasher movie. Yes, there is a good point, but it is the return of another film. The acts is so terrible nor the plot. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a legend that a scarecrow lives on the cornfield. When an initiation becomes a joke and causes the life of a boy in danger, the scarecrow comes alive and triggers a murderous frenzy. Sounds familiar to you, does not it? It's derived from Scream, Friday 13th, from Jeepeer Creepers, Corn Kids, you name it! <br /> <br /> 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is so much below the average film. Have a scary moment. Even the final scene is laughable! Unfortunately, we could still enjoy it as our time killer. But I prefer you to look at something else instead. Unless you are a big fan of bad and nerdy movies, of course. <br /> <br /> 4/10
