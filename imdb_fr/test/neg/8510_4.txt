No doubt about it, Rampling is beautiful - a classic beauty, here very young. She manages to appear both sophisticated and poignant. His two male foils work well too. But seen in 2003, the cop is all <br /> <br /> American who tries to be artistic and not to be Hollywood while she turns beautiful pictures of France Riviera-and-three-pretty-young -gens-in-their-cute-old-ca r. I enjoyed the view (the actors and nature) but the film is boring and pretentious while trying to be the opposite.
