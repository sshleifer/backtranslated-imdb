I'll never understand why, when a studio like Universal buys a musical, it shoots it down to show it on screen. My first thought when seeing Ava Gardner and Robert Walker was to show that I would see something from MGM that would produce the best of musicals at that time. I was wrong and disappointed with my boy. <br /> <br /> One Touch Of Venus, starring Mary Martin, Kenny Baker and John Boles on Broadway, presented 567 performances during the 1943-1945 season, as did Gardner, Walker and Tom Conway. play the roles that Martin, Baker and Boles played on stage. The musical Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash with the book by Nash and S.J. Perelman was a return vehicle for Mary Martin who regained her Queen status on Broadway after a disappointing Hollywood adventure. <br /> <br /> Look at the names that participated in this show. Given who was responsible for the book, I expected to see a sparkling spirit in this production. Instead, I had a rather pedestrian scenario, it was as if all the mind had been emptied. Eve Arden plays her usual Friday role with Tom Conway, but it's still too much for Eve. <br /> <br /> The story is about the department store hairdresser, Robert Walker, who kisses a very precious statue of Venus that comes to life in the person of Ava Gardner. Of course, when the statue disappears, Conway screams for justice and is wary of Walker, the last person to be with the statue. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Walker, who deals with Gardner and what will happen to both of them. For reasons I do not understand, Ava was of course dubbed by Eileen Wilson and Walker only sings a few lines. The song is worn by Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan playing Walker's friends and colleagues. Of course, on Broadway, the songs were performed by singers Mary Martin and Kenny Baker. One would think that Haymes would play at least the role of Walker. It was inconvenient to say the least. <br /> <br /> Only three songs survived the score: Do not look now, but my heart shows, it's him and the incomparable Speak Low. The silky baritone of Haymes turns out to be the best thing about Speak Low, which was sung by Martin and Baker on Broadway. For some reason, the words of one of the greatest men of poetry of the last century, Ogden Nash, were written by Ann Ronnell. I suspect that the infamous code was at work here. <br /> <br /> In the Ava Gardner biography of Lee Server, he mentions a brief adventure between Roberta Walker and Ava Walker when she had a fight with her current man, Howard Duff. . When Duff and Gardner got together, Walker took it badly and did not talk to Gardner off camera at all. I'm sure the fact that they do not both do their best job does not help either. <br /> <br /> Let's hope it, a repertoire company will do One Touch Of Venus and you'll have the chance to see it Weill, Nash and Perelman have written it.
