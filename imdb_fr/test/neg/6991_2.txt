I really liked this movie. Of course, the acting was flat, there was no conspiracy, and the villain was the most lamentable I've ever seen. Michael Bernardo as Dante is really worth laughing at, with an incredibly funny slogan and an evil laugh. But it's worth seeing, just for the worst explosion you'll ever see outside the Power Ranger TV series. You will know it when you see it. Honestly, this movie must have the budget of a low grade porn. I almost stopped watching after an hour, but I recommend looking through it all; at the very least, there is a lot of eye candy for everybody's pleasure. Recommended for viewers with a high tolerance to poor movies.
