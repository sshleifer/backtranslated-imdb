The worst Wrestlemania of all time. <br /> <br /> This did not have to do and many affronts. It happened in Las Vegas and the WWE made sure that its employees dress like Egyptian gods! They even changed the name of Howard Finkels to Finkus Maximus, which probably does not mean anything. The sight of seeing Jim Ross in this awful dress still gives me nightmares to this day and I'm 21, so you can imagine when I was 7 years old! Bobby Heenan was funny though. <br /> <br /> The games included The Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales in a mediocre match, The Headshrinkers vs. The Steiner Brothers in a useless match, Doink vs. Crush in a humorous and boring match starring Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backlund. Hulk Hogan teamed up with Brutus Beefcake to fight Money Inc. You can clearly see that Hogan had a black eye. In the story, Ted DiBiase and the IRS beat Hogan while he was playing poker or something like that in the casinos, which is a mediocre scenario, but in reality, Macho Man Randy Savage hit Hogan because Savage thinks he's like The Hulk) not the wrestler but the character of the movie. <br /> <br /> The main event was the clash between Bret 'Hitman' Hart and Yokozuna in a very boring game. Mr. Fuji threw salt on Hart's face and Yoko won, but not until Hogan fell and crushed Yoko in 21 seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall rating - E
