Enough talent and sincerity were needed to make this film and I wish it was better realized. Everyone is clearly doing their best to stay true to an intriguing premise, but it's too deep a vision, too complex an attempt to unravel the mental illusion to survive a transition to the screen. It's an attempt to grasp the dimensionality of gossamer motifs on celluloid - the result is confusing and slow. I give him a 10 for the effort, but a 5 in general.
