this movie made me watch Paul W.S. Anderson's AvP1 and enjoy! I will not even dream of comparing Requiem to one of the movies in the Alien or Predator series, it's a horror horror game HORRIBLE HORRIBLE TEENAGE IN A SMALL AMERICAN CITY. At least he had loads of crafts carved into film sets, he had bags of candy never seen in any of the original films - but was ruined by unconvincing characters / actor. <br /> <br /> Requiem takes trouble acting at the lowest level imaginable, and that is missing in all other departments equally ... it's a sacrilege to include extraterrestrial combinations and predators in this kind of waste.
