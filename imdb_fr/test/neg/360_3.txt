This is the story of a manic cop who, for whatever reason, loves him for a young college stallion and his pals. After having reported it to his supervisor, who in turn suspends him while waiting for a psychiatric evaluation, he finds an opportunity to torture them by psychology when, on a bet, the children pirate the security of a department store and open the door. door. Only they are locked up in the shop, with the crazy. Murder and chaos are ongoing, and children are running around trying to survive until the morning when they may be able to escape. <br /> <br /> "A dangerous game" would probably have been a successful psycho-cat thriller with a cat and a mouse if it were placed in a different place. The idea of ​​psychotic cops tracking a gang of innocent teenagers in a department store simply did not work. Especially when he is face to face with his grouchy prey quite often and yet, does not do anything serious often enough. There was no real confrontation, which would be enough for this kind of story, and might have worked better if, for example, teenagers were unleashed in the neighborhood and left to fend for themselves against this crazy (especially if it took a few minutes). days while he makes them more and more paranoid ... even if it is granted, even that is cliché). <br /> <br /> What a pity, too, that it could not have been a better thriller, considering the funky cast of a young Australian characters. Even a light adventure despite the madness of the villain dotted in the image could have even made a more satisfying image. Instead, the film started in new condition, and it certainly had a lot of action sequences, but it ended up being ridiculous.
