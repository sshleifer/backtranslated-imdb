The rivalry between brothers leads to the main story. Navy Commander Chuck Prescott (Marshall Thompson) developed the Y12 aircraft to see how far man can go back into the atmosphere. His brother, Lt. Dan Prescott (Bill Edwards), appears to be the best test pilot in the area and is chosen to ride in the Y12. Dan of course has a problem with order taking and is also a bold and confident advocate. <br /> <br /> On Dan's second flight, he flies over the 300-mile comfort zone and his plane crosses a meteor dust storm. Back on earth, Dan becomes a monster that looks like 200 pounds of bad asphalt. He also has a strong thirst for blood, whether from breeders or human beings. <br /> <br /> Short duration of one hour and seventeen minutes; black and white with an almost stoic game ... typical of low-budget science fiction. <br /> <br /> The cast is completed by Marla Landi, Robert Ayers and Carl Jaffe. Interesting fact: about two months after the release of this film; the Russians put the real first man in space.
