Maybe it's unfair not to like a movie for what it is not, rather than what it is, but I approached this idea hoping that eventually a filmmaker would make a film about homosexual men and women living in rural areas. Instead, the main focus is on scandalous bigotry (big news!) Of the inhabitants (and those of the outlying areas) and the really horrible torture / murder of a young gay man. <br /> <br /> So much time spent on stupid people screaming about AIDS, sin, hell and perverts. So much time devoted to the macabre preacher and to the preaching of the Bible about gays getting what they deserved. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more people who frequented the "gay bar of the small town", not those who opposed it. Moreover, the murdered young man is not even from this city. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole serves as a warning rather than a celebration and is very suspicious.
