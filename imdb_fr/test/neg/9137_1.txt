The director Godfrey Reggio must be a charming and persuasive man so that this terribly sloppy project was born. Reggio's message, so powerful and resonant in his two previous Qatsi films, is desperately confused. Athletes, equations, oceans, keyboards, heads, etc., mingle without purpose. The parade of banal imagery is mainly composed of generic Getty Images and other material, and the digital manipulations with heavy hands are in the worst way imaginable. Someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, executive producer?) Would surely have pointed out that applying a solarization filter to almost all images was a very bad idea? The raw looping, overlaying, and distorting of images is reminiscent of a first-year Photoshop class. And to make matters worse, the computer animation sequences are more naive than the 1980's pie charts on Wall Street. This is not to say that only an improved aesthetic would have saved this film, but some meager efforts in this direction could have made it tolerable as a visual feed for accompanying music. I feel obliged to point out that Philip Glass's score will certainly satisfy his fans. Not a radical departure, but rather a refinement of what Glass does best with beautiful contributions to Yo Yo Ma's violin. If you decide to watch this film, be sure to focus on the brief opening sequence. Even if you may already be 89 minutes later than Detroit's Michigan Central Railroad Station, once majestic but abandoned, you'll remember this 20th-century decadence image as the critical moment when you should have headed for the EXIT panel / press the STOP button etc. You have been warned.
