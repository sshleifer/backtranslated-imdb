Despite having a very pretty main woman (Rosita Arenas, one of my boys who has a crush), the acting and the staging are examples of what NOT to do to make a movie . <br /> <br /> Located in southern Mexico, Popoca, the Aztec Mummy (the real Aztecs, by the way, did not make mummies) was woken up by the main characters and begins to stir up trouble in the suburbs of Mexico, during the first film (The Aztec Mummy). In this second part, the man and the woman leaders want to find the mummy and place it in its last place of rest (a chimney would have been my first choice ...) <br /> <br /> In this one appears the bat, a stereotype of criminal master without genius criminal genius that creates a "human robot" (an idiot in a robot SUIT) to control Popoca and (get that) conquer the world. The last match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious, some of the worst choreography ever seen. The funny thing is that this movie was shot and released by a serious Mexican film studio! <br /> <br /> The acting is as awful as hearing the film in Spanish as in English (they called the sur-actor!). You should watch this movie through MST: 3000. The comments are even more funny.
