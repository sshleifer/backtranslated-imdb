I'm still trying to understand what the target of this film was: 1) If we had to show how stupid, disorganized, unprofessional and arrogant the police are (I could certainly add a few adjectives here, but I think my point is clear) . 2) If you have to show how a crooked crook who does not know what he wants of himself can create chaos. 3) Indicate whether a persistent detective will solve a case simply by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again until the criminal responds? 4) Or was it just to show that 90 minutes of film could always be called FILM ?? <br /> <br /> It was one of those movies that, in a way, did not disappoint me. From the first 10 minutes, I somehow understood that this film would not be nominated for the award for the best film, and surprisingly enough ?? it was consistent all the time. It was stupid enough that it was worth waiting to see how far it would go and end stupidly ?? and I was not disappointed either. <br /> <br /> Was it a waste of time? YES. Which raises your question ?? Why did I look all the way? Well, I was trying to fall asleep, and I thought it was a great candidate for that, but unfortunately, I had too much coffee before that ??
