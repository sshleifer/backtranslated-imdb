My Age: 13 <br /> <br /> James Cole, played by Steven Seagal, is sent to help detective Jim Campbell, played by Keenen Ivory Wayans, solve a series of murders in which victims are crucified. Since Cole arrived, he noticed that the killings had changed a bit and he thinks there is a different killer. It becomes personal when his ex-wife is murdered and Campbell finds his fingerprints on the body. Campbell investigates the mysterious Cole and discovers a very dark past. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal. I like action movies, but it's the worst actor I've ever seen. This movie is not very fun to watch, incredibly stupid, and obviously, Steven Seagal's performance is absolutely horrible. Keenen Ivory Wayans is not so bad, though. The only thing that redeems this film is the good occasional action scene, although most come for incredibly stupid reasons. The plot in this movie is absolute gibberish. I did not care at all. The past of Seagal's "glitter man" was stupid, all the mafia fights and restaurant fights were almost unreasonable. Drop this movie. <br /> <br /> Australian Ranking: MA 15+: High Level Violence <br /> <br /> Rating: 35 out of 100 (quite generous)
