In no way watch this movie. This is terrible for several reasons: <br /> <br /> No plot No structure No direction No action to talk about No visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In one word - not. <BR /> <br /> The best thing about the box and the fact that it finally ends. Who would have thought that 85 minutes could be so long. <br /> <br /> Again: Never look at this movie. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> No plot, no structure, no direction, no direction, no visual style, no tension, no tension, <br /> <br /> In a nutshell - not. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this is the box and the fact that it finally ends. Who would have thought that 85 minutes could be so long?
