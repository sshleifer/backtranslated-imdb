How can you make a movie. A good question that House of the Dead 2 can answer. I could not believe it was possible to get something worse than the first House of the Dead, but surprisingly, the director was successful. The only feeling you get from the movie is that it's bad, just bad. What do you do with excessive negative effects and a stupid story? It's that kind of movie that gives Z-Movies a bad name in general. Why could not they learn the lesson of the first House of the Dead movie? Anyway, I guess you'll understand by now that you should not see this movie. It's only a waste of time. Look at "Bad Taste" or "Dawn of the Dead" if you want to see good zombies.
