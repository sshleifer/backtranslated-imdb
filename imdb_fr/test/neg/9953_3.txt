For reasons I can not understand, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) is starting to inject wolf blood into his pet lover, Petro (Glenn Strange). The result ?? Petro is turned into a hideous (as hideous as someone with a bad wig and sharp teeth can be) killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to take revenge on scientists who make fun of his ideas and make fun of his ideas (and why would not they, Dr. Cameron's madman is more than a fruitcake) . Mad Monster is a dull and poorly made thriller of Poverty Row. There is really only one positive point I can find to write in The Mad Monster. George Zucco can be fun to watch as he embodies the mad scientist like everyone else. His doctor Cameron is a crazy goer. He has no qualms about killing. he has whole conversations with people who are not there; and, as with most mad scientists, he kidding in "the realm of God" (in fact, I'm not sure anyone accuses him of that, but that's okay). But beyond Zucco, there is nothing here to recommend. Everything else, from monster effects to secondary distribution to music, is completely old. There are far better examples of horror from the 1940s in Poverty Row than The Mad Monster.
