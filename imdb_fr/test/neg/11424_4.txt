Like many of us tonight, I braved the cold winter and long lines to see what I had planned to be one of this year's best movies. However, after the credits, I sorely missed a lot of things. But to be fair, there were redeemable qualities (though very little). Let's start with what worked. First, Lycans: on the point in every way ?? from their terrifying physique to their pure ferocity. The action: sublimely visceral ?? when that happened. Nighy / Victor and Sheen / Lucian: Perfect. Now, what does not have (and there are many). It was less a film than a collage of sequences (and do not expect to see support characters from other films except Raze and Tannis). It was profoundly lacking a well written script and everything that had a real substance to bring together these pieces of film. The story seemed to start in the middle? at the point where Lucian had decided to rebel. Therefore, there was no context; no tension; no feeling of betrayal ?? the devices needed to run everything else. Moreover, this ended where the climax should have started (which was to be after the quarrel simmered a little). Oh, it was too short. Purist is also offended by some of the freedoms he has taken with regard to some of the facts previously revealed in the first two films - but judge for yourself. In the end, this film has long lingered on what should have been brief "background" scenes (eg, various board scenes) and, as a result, we never really learned to worry about main actors ... neither of the film (ouch). -RE
