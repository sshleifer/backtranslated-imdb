"Son, you must stop the experiments I started !!" Too bad nobody says it too, that green has lit this project! One of my friends literally dragged me into this movie for a night at midnight while we were in high school. Now, a midnight movie in high school on a Friday night, you do not expect much, but come on !! And seeing it again years later, I remain faithful to my initial opinion. Great special effects but then what! Probably one of the worst films ever made. Unless you like blood and guts and you see Hollywood vets (Steiger & Hunter) make fun of themselves for money. Yuck !!!
