This film has some of the worst production and editing values ​​I have ever seen. There are several examples of actors who stop trying to remember their lines, actors walking in front of talking actors and a point where the film jumps about seven images. Not to mention the heroine who gets shot in the chest, yet she begins to limp! Oh, and what about the secret passage that is well lit and out in the open. Awful. <br /> <br /> The plot is non-existent, it is a primitive nuclear bomb, the end of the Earth and a kind of war of the cavemen. Ator releases a hang glider at some point in the most stupid moment of the movie. The dialogue is stupid, containing jewels such as "It's all and nothing." and "I can feel it here." <br /> <br /> The film is a mess, a confusing and tasteless mess. Ator is a bland hero, sword fights are absurd and the plot moves slowly. Overall, it's a movie to avoid.
