The villain Sebastian Cabot is trying to drive farmers out of salt from the land to get oil rights. When Sterling Haden's pop will be killed, how will Haden end the "Terror in a Texas City" armed only with a harpoon? <br /> <br /> First of all, it's not a B-Western. There are no cowboys singing, no daredevil stunts, no interesting action sequences. It's just an independent film - you know, those who use unimportant actors to say "important things" and cover the general weakness of modest budgets with interesting camera angles. <br /> <br /> Second, this film, to avoid the trade-offs (well expected) that would result in the elimination of Trumbo's important statements about justice in America and the rather unhealthy relationship between the head of the henchman and his daughter, a very small budget. The main problem is that the acting is really bad. Sterling Haden is decent enough in tough roles, but he is the last guy you want to play in a sensitive Swedish sailor gone looking for his fortune in the West. Sebastian Cabot tries to make a Sydney Greenstreet as a (very) bloated plutocrat. This is not a bad idea, but Cabot does not have the actor chops for that. The guy who plays the rented gun with the missing arm and soul (Johnny Crale) plays the best role in the movie. He does not do anything with it. <br /> <br /> Third, the script is not quite that. Trumbo finds something to say about the immigrant is not going to be shaken by the sheriff in a corrupt city, and the people, faced with real oppression, tend to back down. It's a pretty stale movie message from 1958 - "High Noon, Bad Day at Black Rock, Devil's Door" - are all Westerners who are dealing with the evils of Western society with an eye on the woes of America's years 50. Trumbo, in 1959, certainly had every reason to agree with these feelings, but he does not do anything new or interesting with them. <br /> <br /> So, given all the disadvantages, why was this film a 4? Mainly because there are interesting quirks throughout the film. (The relationship between Crale and her daughter is fascinating.) And Trumbo, though a mediocre writer pursuing his political postings, is very good at creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. Just when we're ready to get away from the boredom of the Indy movie, there will be an exchange of dialogue or a simple quirk that lets you realize that the guy writing the script was not just a hack. <br /> <br /> If you do not do it like Trumbo or westerns, give it to Miss. If not, try it. You could love him more than me.
