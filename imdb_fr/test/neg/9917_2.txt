I was at home and returning channels when I came across what might look like an interesting movie. I like movies like Destruction and I decided to watch it. I do not know why but I ended up watching every 2 hours. We saw this type of movie. I do not know how many times. <br /> <br /> In 1998-2000, there were a dozen films dealing with the worldwide destruction of one kind or another. The best on my list is Deep Impact, which was more believable than this one. Here are my problems with this movie: 1) Cheap special effects, like something out of the old computer. 2) no basic information or explanation of weather conditions. If you want to make a movie about the weather, be at least decent to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) How is it that only 2 or 3 people know that the storm is converging on Chicago ... more experts in the field? 4) Where are some interesting characters? I do not really care about anyone except perhaps the pregnant woman. I felt that there was no character development. 5) no thought-provoking moment whatever the theme ever so well and factually incorrect. And this is only the first part of the film. I bet the conclusion will show us some scenes of destruction and a search and rescue operation, as has been done many times before. And judging by the special effects of the first part of the film, I can only imagine what we should expect. Of course, in the end, the main characters will survive and life will continue ... what an originality
