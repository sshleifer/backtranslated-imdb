Such a film BS. It's just a stupid anti-Russian propaganda, with a completely BS plot, completely unrelated to the book. <br /> <br /> It seems that the production team has received more money from the movie's sponsors than it will ever get from selling the film. The film's plot includes references to recent events in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe, but exposes them in a way that has nothing to do with reality. It looks like the film is a brainwashing instrument that portrays Russia as a place populated by evil people who always dream of killing someone. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are hundreds of stupid mistakes, like using the map of the USSR instead of Russia when broadcasting information, show a crowd under the Ukrainian flag and comment on the fact that these are Russian elections, etc. <br /> <br /> There are also many bizarre episodes (a character passing through Red Square in Moscow and a second in downtown Sophia, Bulgaria).
