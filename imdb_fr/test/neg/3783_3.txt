I give him a figure of three instead of the lower number he deserves because of his story. A feature film directed by high school students! It's also visible, but it's part of the charm and the appeal. Check out some of the things George Lucas did at UCLA; it's better. Maybe because it's a group effort. <br /> <br /> A monster made of toxic waste and too much waste - these kids were way ahead of their time! - begins to ravage the city of Milpitas during a dance in high school. The monster destroyed at random, leaving waste and traces of bad smells. <br /> <br /> The film brings together local TV and radio personalities, the mayor of Milpitas, the principal of Samuel Ayer High School and many high school students, not to mention the mayor's daughter as ingenue. <br /> <br /> Dumb? Yeah! Fun? Yeah! Great writing on the screen? Come on, these are untrained high school students! Copy this commentary for actors, cinematography, staging, etc. <br /> <br /> Milpitas is right next to San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley; Perhaps one of the graphic geniuses will update the video. Now, there is a challenge.
