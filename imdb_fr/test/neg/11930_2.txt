In the animated series: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel completely detached from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, spiritual, caustic, confident, sarcastic, mortal, indomitable, ambiguous. Aeon's original had layers on deep layers. She almost never let her personal emotions show through. The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and provoked thought. You could never say what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist, while Trevor was a radical idealist. As a result, they could never have the appearance of a stable relationship. <br /> <br /> In the movie: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux works for Monicans and his political and personal motives are very clear. She was pretty, loving, vulnerable, easily tamed, emotional and very predictable. The Eon in the film had a layer of depth at most. The plot was obvious and artificial. Everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. There has been virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least as far as personal philosophies are concerned. The only conflict between them was that they were from different sides. <br /> <br /> The film was a horrible disappointment for me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of ​​one of my favorite animated characters of all time, drew all the depth and personality and filled it with Hollywood clichés. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not give a "1" to this film is because the visuals were incredible. It was great to see some of the familiar animated scenes as a fly in the eye done with CGI.
