I became a big Carpenters fan and did not really like this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was too focused on her anorexia and did not show her true personality. I did not really like the portrait of Cynthia Gibb; especially knowing that she had decided that Karen's anorexia was a suicide, which was clearly not the case. Although his family did not like hugs or kisses, I found the movie describing Agnes (their mother) as terrible. <br /> <br /> I found some heartbreaking scenes, like the one where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to deform and make it heavier; I thought the metaphor (so to speak) was rather effective. When the family plays pool and discusses his divorce, it breaks down and Richard is shocked to comfort him and feel his fragile body very moving (which is probably the wrong word). <br /> <br /> I think they needed to bring out their more sparkling and quirky side - their true personality. Even as the center of the film, there was really no way to understand what would lead to anorexia (though no one really knew), and almost made it sound unfounded. The movie was poorer singer with anorexia than the story of Karen Carpenter, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I would assume they changed the name / profession of her husband and all because they could not get her permission actually, include it (there were bad terms there -but) all this aspect was incorrect with the changes. On this note, I do not remember the film revealing his longing for family and children, who has dominated his life and explains his love relationship and his quick marriage with her husband. <br /> <br /> Overall This is a movie for low budget television, which is simply not very high quality and can be disappointing if you are a hardcore fan who hopes to see beyond Karen's disease. I think that such a legend deserves / deserves a better film in tribute to an incredible person and an incredible voice.
