After the end of his Romantic Romantic career in the late 1960s, Rock Hudson played in many different projects, including television shows and smaller films. However, I believe that "Embryo" is his only turn as a mad scientist, and that's probably a good thing. I guess he needed this job. <br /> <br /> During a dark and stormy night, the brilliant Dr. Paul Holliston (Hudson) strikes and hurts a Doberman that he brings back to his laboratory (which looks a bit like a dank Midwestern). He then managed to raise the puppy to be born outside the belly of his mother. So he naturally decides to do the same thing with a human being. He raises Victoria (the beautiful Barbara Carrera) of a fetus in the same way. Victoria is growing at an astonishing rate and is quickly becoming a beautiful young woman. <br /> <br /> As expected, things are going very badly. After a beginner, Holliston's sister-in-law, Martha (Diane Ladd), begins to wonder where the young woman comes from and Victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence. The final sequence is a long car chase straight out of "Smokey and the Bandit", after which Victoria - who has aged shockingly in minutes - is assaulted by a frantic Holliston, who tries in vain to destroy his deformed creation. . with his unborn child. All this is accompanied by squealing tires, roaring engines, a car fire and many sirens. The soft end of a group of paramedics working frantically on Victoria while Holliston writhes with regret is more painful than terrifying. <br /> <br /> Although this film was shot in 1976, it is very dated. The only difference between this film and the many crazy scientists of the 1940s is that Hudson plays the lead rather than Boris Karloff. The devices are quite cheap and obsolete for today's audience, as the Hudson tape recorder is about the size of a refrigerator. Much of the action takes place in a poorly lit laboratory. Hudson waits through his sordid role, giving the impression that he is really a dilapidated movie star, while Ladd and Carrera are much more believable. Surprisingly, Roddy McDowall appears briefly as a chess player. <br /> <br /> The transfer of Video Passport is very poor, giving the impression that it was made from a poor quality VHS copy using home equipment. If you're nostalgic for 1976, look at it once to tell you that you did it. Otherwise, watch a football match or soap opera instead.
