Uzumaki, which translates as "spirals", made its debut in this new wave of Asian horror movies after successes such as Ringu, Ju-On and The Eye (two of them with remakes .. well more like Dark Water and Tale of Two Sisters), does not reach the supernatural and phantasmagorical thriller element so characteristic of other films, it remains only the strange strangeness and not in the manner of Tim Burton or David Lynch, but in an irrelevant and boring way. <br /> <br /> It starts with a girl, another kid who has a crush on her, his best friend and his father who is obsessed with Uzumakis! Everything that happens is about Uzumakis, people are dying and you see Uzumakis. So, all right, I'll be fine with it, I'm a little amused by the spirals myself, the characters do not seem to be going anywhere, but I'm going to keep playing. We discover that the city is cursed by Uzumakis, people start shouting at Uzumakis and the fact is that Uzumakis are everywhere, the film is a disaster, it does not know where to go, except to show you the power of Uzumakis !!!! !!!!! There are cool concepts like when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees Uzumakis on her fingerprints, but there is another scene where she hears her husband (from the grave!) to say that she also Uzumakis to the ear they handled this scene was just laughable, not even fun fun, there are also some cool visuals, like the collection that the father of Uzumakis and the girl with Uzumakis hair .. yep, Uzumakis hair, its outside However, it looks like it was removed from a Fruit Snack advertisement. If you eat a Uzumakis fruit snack, its taste is so incredible that your hair turns into Uzumakis. Now, if it was not serious enough, suddenly, from nowhere there are snail men .. or ManSnails ?? no matter ?? and you know why? right? Because in their shells they have Uuuuzuuuumaaakiiiis ??. It only left us enough time for a disgusting anti-climatic end and at that moment, I was tired of friggin 'uzumakis .. uzumaki here uzumaki out there, of course, look around you, how many 'Uzumakis can you find ?? If you want to see a movie about spirals, check out PI (3.1416). You will find quite cool concepts between uzumaki and the meaning of life. Dark City also has a somewhat spiral appearance. <Br /> <br /> This film could have worked as a music video, it has already attracted a cult audience and that's why I was forced to see it, but after that, I'm not sure I know why people think it's great I was really disappointed.
