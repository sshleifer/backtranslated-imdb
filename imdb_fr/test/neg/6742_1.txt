This film is so bad that there are no words to describe it. If I had the camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half, it would be much more entertaining than that. The plot is so dull and unimaginative that it's not even worth mentioning. The best part of the film took place when the credits took place and I had fun laughing knowing that the name of the main actor was James Bond III. Trust me and stay away from this pile of garbage!
