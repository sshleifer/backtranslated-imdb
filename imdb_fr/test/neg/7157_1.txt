Contains spoilers! They are the lost scammers of Judas, they say that Judas was a great friend of Jesus ... And now, that? This is clearly an attempt to destroy a religion, and should be illegal. They have no proof, this could be clearly a configuration. How can we know and trust these people? And if they carved the grave and "said it"? And in the end, they seal the grave forever, so that no one can go there to investigate? How much do they think we are, really? Are we supposed to believe that they are trusted? Who really found a tomb of Jesus? And how can you stab all Christians like this? I think this documentary should NEVER be made by a non-religious man. This can ONLY be done by a Christian and I mean DIRECTION AND SCRIPT. It should be illegal for Jews to shoot a documentary about Christianity, especially if the documentary makes accusations that Jesus is not a "resurrected Son of God" (nothing stands in the way of this, they could be Buddhist or atheists, all but Catholics). <BR/> <br /> For me, it's a total hoax, a pure documentary scam. They sealed the grave to prevent people from thinking about verification. This documentary is a total failure, how much do they think the Christian people are stupid? And what about the lost pages of Judas ... it was a total rip-off too, they seriously said at the end, something like: "We know some people who could make fake scrolls like this, and nobody would not know it was a fake "... Oh my god, they just said it .." Dude, we could have done that "... This kind of documentary should be illegal, it's a shot of knife on all Christians and Catholics, they should be behind bars !!! I am not a fanatic, I am an ex-Jew, now atheist, but I have values ​​and I will always respect the religion of others. The moment Israel ordered that the grave be sealed forever was PRECIOUS !! PRECIOUS!!
