I did not read John Grisham's "A Time to Kill" and that might have helped to better understand the film. But maybe not. I hear it's Grisham's most faithful adaptation to date, and if it's true, I understand why so many publishers refused the novel when Grisham introduced it as his first work. <br /> <br /> "A Time to Kill" is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. It is a thriller that will please the crowd, but also a film devoted to the exploration of certain social and moral issues. Let's face it, these two types of movies do not go together in Hollywood, which is why "Dead Man Walking" had to be created independently. <br /> <br /> The story features a young lawyer, Jake (Matthew McConaughy) to defend a black man named Carl (Samuel L. Jackson) from the murder of two hillbillies who raped his young daughter. The day before the rapists' trial, Carl hid in a closet of the courthouse and when the rapists were brought into the building, he charged and shot the two men. To help with the defense, Jack accepts the help of a former law student (Sandra Bullock), who proves that his role in this film was totally useless, and presents it in the film solely for marketing purposes. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, one of the rapist's brothers (Kiefer Sutherland) was angry that a black man had killed his brother and decided to take revenge. All of this leads to a court shootout, kidnapping, brutal beating and racial riot. I admit that all this caught my attention throughout the film, in addition to scenes in the courtroom. What I objected to later was the treatment of ethical issues by the film and its use of formulas in the plot. <br /> <br /> The main question the film constantly asks is whether a black man receives a fair trial from a white jury. Of course, they can, but that does not mean that the man must be acquitted for the trial to be fair. This film, however, does not seem to think so. In addition, there are several gaping holes in the plot used for convenience. For example, there is an unknown character called Mickey Mouse, a member of the Klan, who, for unknown reasons, helps defense team members escape the serious dangers to other members of the Klan. After Bullock has been kidnapped by Sutherland and company and left for dead in the desert, this stranger comes to save her - and we NEVER discover who he is and why he helps the people he should terrorize. <Br/> <br /> And speaking of the reign of terror of Sutherland's character, it is astonishing to see how much the police and the character of Bullock refrain from retaining it throughout the film. There is a scene where Sutherland becomes a sniper of a building in front of the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake as he goes out, shooting at one of the guards. Now, you'd think there are dozens of policemen around, it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. No chance. From what we could see, no one seemed to care that a sniper was still on the run. Even after Bullock was saved by Mickey Mouse, she never, never, ever mentioned who was her kidnapper, or even questioned. Why was it? Simple. The character of Sutherland was needed throughout the film to add a continuous suspense, even if, logically, he should have been absent from the photo. <br /> <br /> In addition to Bullock, there is another ungrateful character. He is Jake's assistant played by Oliver Platt. There seems to be a reason for his character to be in the movie - to provide a number of duplicates to the public. In my opinion, the dubbers show a major weakness in the "serious" films when they are used. This shows that filmmakers are not sure that history and dialogue are enough to grab the attention of the public. Use them to make the audience laugh and reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> But enough of the many minor problems of the film. What about the movie's message here? It is clear that Carl is indeed guilty of murder. We saw how he planned to murder the men who had raped his daughter for hours. The lawyers argue that it's temporary insanity, etc. who had him killed. In desperation, Jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his final argument. After describing everything that happened, he adds on a last line ... "The girl is white". We then see the members of the jury with tears in their eyes. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, a girl shouts "He's free! He's free!" Wait a minute! Do jurors base their verdicts on their emotions or facts? Above all, why were there no scenes showing the deliberations of the jury and what he really thought after his emotions faded. I'll tell you why. They could not show the deliberation, because NO JURY could acquit a man of such a crime, no matter how much the final arguments of the defense touched their hearts. What is the message? Is the murder of someone justified if it is a form of revenge for a crime that has been committed to him? <br /> <br /> This film should have had the courage to say that the murder is not good in this situation, because in reality, there would be no acquittal. But since dollars were at stake, filmmakers were more concerned with sparing the public than presenting a responsible message. If people begin to kill for revenge, the authors of this film should be held responsible. What a socially irresponsible movie!
