What a disaster! Normally, when criticizing a historical film, it is always amusing to point out inaccuracies that creep in, usually added by screenwriters to create more "dramatic" situations. However, "Imperium: Nerone" is an animal quite crazy. In this film, you strive to find all that is confirmed by the historical archives in the midst of the farrago of foolishness and fiction presented as the life of the wicked emperor-artist of Rome. <br /> <br /> And that's a shame, because Nero is one of Rome's most fascinating emperors. His life has been filled with enough tumultuous events and interesting people to make a great movie. Producers of this mess have chosen another path, which leads only to a puzzle for any informed viewer. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. Nero is portrayed as a boy from 6 to 8 years old when Caligula has his father killed for treason, exiles his mother Agrippina and sends her to be raised by slaves in the country. "Ten years later", the story begins just before the murder of Caligula. The Facts: Nero was born about six months after the beginning of his four-year reign for Caligula. He is only three years old when he is murdered. Nero's father died of natural causes; Agrippina was briefly exiled for misconduct and not for treason; and Nero was not raised among slaves, but had the typical education of a young member of the imperial family. <br /> <br /> 2. According to the authors, Nero is now about 16 when his great-uncle Claudius becomes emperor (in fact, he was about 4 years old); Agrippina prepares for the fall of Empress Messalina and marries Claudius, who adopts Nero. Then he sets out to conquer Great Britain and is poisoned by Agrippina soon after his victorious return. Nero is declared emperor, although he may still be only 18 or 19 years old. Fact: Claudius conquered Britain in 43 AD, two years after the beginning of his reign. He lived until 54 AD Nero should have been 31 years old according to any normal chronology, but he actually succeeded on the throne at 16 years of age. <br /> <br /> History tells us that the "good five years" followed, "where Nero ruled wisely and well under the tutelage of the Seneca philosopher and the praetorian commander Burrus." This is shown - somehow - except that representing the Roman Senate as an opposition to Nero's good measures is false.The opposition of the senators to Nero only began when he began to show signs of insanity and began to kill senators for real or imaginary betrayal. <br /> <br /> 3. Nero's mother, Agrippina, is the dominant type, who murdered her uncle-husband to make her son an emperor.After a while, Nero gets tired of In the film, he sends his henchman Tigellinus to stab her to death, quite true, but the reality was so much better, Agrippina was a survivor and was not easy. tried three times to poison him but as an old Poisonous herself was very wise and failed. Then he tried to crush him to death by collapsing the ceiling of his bedroom, but that also failed. Then he sent her on a boat built deliberately to collapse and sink; as she descended, she jumped into the sea and swam to the shore. Finally, he had her stabbed to death. Now, show all that would have definitely improved this movie! <br /> <br /> Other mistakes abound: Nero's love, Act, was not a slave boy friend of youth, she never repudiated it and there is nothing to indicate that she became a Christian. Nero did not commit suicide by cutting his wrists while sitting at the edge of a lake. Etc. etc. etc. The sources of Nero's life are mainly the Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, both of whom belonged to the senatorial class and who were hostile to his memory. But the evidence indicates that he remained very popular with ordinary people, unlike one of the final scenes where he is covered with vegetables by the crowd as he leaves the city to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> WHY writers and producers take an inherently interesting story with a lot of good things for any movie, and make that piece of shit? Oh, and did I mention how crazy the sets and costumes were? Lol. <br /> <br /> A star, because there is no way to rank it lower.
