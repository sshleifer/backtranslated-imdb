This film is sad. According to my fellow IMDb users (* SPOILER *), RAPTOR uses Carnotaur movie archive footage. Well, since I have not seen the Carnotaur movies, I can not say it. But, I notice a pretty bad editing and an acting game even worse. This movie is a big pile of smokers. It makes absolutely no sense. Here is what is called a plot: a mad scientist recreates raptors. Raptors kill people. Sheriff investigates. * SPOILER * (Although I do not know what I'm spoiling) Sheriff understands the mad doctor's plans. The army guys are sent out and the raptors start killing the guys in the army. Raptors. Yes indeed. I could make a clay figure that looks more real. FX is the cheapest ever used in a movie. There is a lot of gore. Gore cheap. It does not even look real. I will agree with another person who has rated this film that the only thing this film has for purpose is the fact that it ends. There is about two seconds of originality in this movie. And that only comes when the sheriff talks to a tax agent on the phone about his electricity bill or something like that. This idea has been used in about 100,000 other films with 100,000 different names. Overall, I'm going to give RAPTOR 1/5 just because it's over.
