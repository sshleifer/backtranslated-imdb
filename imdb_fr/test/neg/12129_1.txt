John Waters owes me 2 hours of my life. I saw a preview of this way in preview in 1990 and I still suffer. Not before or since I saw such a filmic waste throwing up on the screen. I can not say anything positive about this movie. Play - awful; conspiracy - ridiculous; music - atrocious. After the movie, my friends and I claimed our money from the theater manager. He explained that since it was a free projection, he could not give us anything back, no matter how much we suffered. Did Johnny Depp's career survive the sinking of a movie?
