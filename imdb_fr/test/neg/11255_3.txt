It's a tedious film. The real bad guys are the awkward adaptation (it's embarrassing to say that the source document is a novel) and the witless scenario. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of credit, given the tight budget because of the austerity of the war, the look of the movie is not bad at all. And the performances are generally correct, with the exception of Phyllis Calvert, who is great - a miracle given the potential for seduction, a chasm in which she definitely does not fall. Ms. Calvert, with much less to do, is as accomplished as Olivia de Havilland in Gone With The Wind. <br /> <br /> The absolutely unbearable aspect of The Man in Gray is the terribly conceived representation of a black boy serving. It does not matter if he's supposed to be a nice character. Badly played by a white boy with a black face, it is impossible to get around this example of condescending racism. <br /> <br /> Grim.
