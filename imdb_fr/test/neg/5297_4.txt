Despite John Travolta's statements in interviews that this was his favorite role in his career, "Be Cool" is a disappointing sequel to "Get Shorty", a witty and intelligent 1995. <br /> Travolta delivers a pretty good performance in this slightly entertaining film, but eventually, the film falls flat because of an underdeveloped plot, unimaginable characters, and a surprising lack of chemistry between the main actors Travolta and Uma Thurman . Although there is some laughter, this example of a funny dialogue (which has appeared frequently in movie trailers) says a lot about everything: Thurman: Do you dance? Travolta: Hi, I'm from Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> The film suggests that everyone in the entertainment industry is a gangster or aspires to become one, which is comparable to organized crime. In "Get Shorty", the idea of ​​a gangster "becoming legitimate" when entering the movies was a clever idea of ​​fish out of the water, but in "Be Cool", it seems like the biz has become completely of through since. <Br/> <br /> The film presents an interesting cast and the highlight of the evening is a "monolgue" presented by The Rock, whose character is an actor in the making and a fool, in which he reproduces a scene between " Gabrielle Union and Kirsten Dunst ". Bring it on. "Vince Vaughan's character thinks he's black and he's often seen dressed as a pimp - it was pretty funny in the first scene that presents him and gets tired and embarrassing almost immediately afterwards. /> <br /> Overall, "Be Cool" It may be worthy of being praised by John Travolta's hard workers (of whom I am one), but you may want to keep your finger close of the fast-forward button to cross it without feeling like you've lost too much time. "Get Shorty" fans may want to avoid this, because the rest of the story is devoid of most of the things that have made This one a winner I note this film a 4/10 certainly severe.
