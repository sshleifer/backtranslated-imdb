Shortly after the release of this film, Salman Khan was sentenced to a 6-year prison term (read further to find out why I mention it). <br /> <br /> And I breathed a sigh of relief. that he was imprisoned for something that, because he was famous but that I was happy, did not want to say anymore about Salman Khan's films or his fictional films, nor about his overly excited comedy (read Overacting) . <br /> <br /> This film made no sense whatsoever. <br /> <br /> The scene where the child of one of the family members makes a voice activated rocket. Depending on the scenario of the film, he would sue anyone. But in the end, he finds only Salman Khan Bare Chested. Well, that's what happened. <br /> <br /> The Rocked is activated in another stupid way and you must have an IQ of 0.001 to believe it. Then he chases Salman Khan, who was on his scooter. The pursuit continues unless he's finished with all the stunts he could show to a stupid audience. (In my opinion, all those who gave this film from the age of 5, unless they are paid to do so.) <br /> <br /> Another breathtaking scene, incredible, was at the end when all the arrangements regarding the wedding were made and Salman Khan with Govinda in Disguise just stalled the wedding by another of those highly undesirable songs. Later, when everything is done and ready, a simple confession of Govinda and Katrina Kaif to Katrina's father and bingo. Everything is fine and Govinda marries Kartina .... <br /> <br /> It made me wonder if convincing was so easy, why did not they do it and they tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money. <br /> <br /> This film should be avoided and do not even think it has a scene to watch. The plot is far too disconnected with characters emerging from nowhere and eventually disappearing ... for the former choota don ... What a mess of characters. <br /> <br /> After this movie, I made the commitment not to watch Salman Khan Movies for the rest of my life unless it wins an Oskar ... (hahahah ... what wants to say that I would never look)
