I just got back from "AGS". After seeing it, I am convinced that no matter what his in-depth research on the film, Stone NEVER has ever watched an NFL game of his life. Great cinematography? Leave me alone. The game montages were almost impossible to see and 90% of the other shots of the movie were close-ups. Was there nothing in this film that was not mentioned in "North Dallas Forty"? <br /> <br /> Star player aging ... to check. Young hot shot .... check. Analgesics ... check. Owner who does not "understand" ... check. Crazy behavior off the field .... check <br /> <br /> In addition, this is the playoffs in Dallas (December or January) in an outdoor stadium. Yet people are sitting in camisoles and shorts! And what was it with these lights? Did they play in a Japanese kabuki theater or stadium? <br /> <br /> And the strategy presented in the game was laughable. He is fourth and 1 inside the "Sharks". "30. Dallas leads 35-31. LAUNCH THE FIELD OF FRIGGING OBJECTIVE Not only would that have made football sense, but you would have a final sequence as well. better where they could have scored and had to pass for the two-point conversion, Hell, tie the match with the extra point and Stone could have spent another three extra hours in overtime. <br /> <br /> The lame set of players old time were supposed to be a tribute to the game? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> And the script ... yuck more clich√©s than you can shake a stick .. oops, there is another one. <br /> <br /> "Slapshot" was better than this movie by far. <br /> <br /> 1/10. <br /> <br /> There avoid that at all costs. <br /> <br />
