VIVA LA BAM This episode of "Jackass" focuses on the adventures (obviously scripted) of Bam Margera and his friends (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc.). This show, although it has its share of crude comedy and delusional acrobatics, focuses mainly on the torture of his parents by Bam. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say, Bam, but ... you're not as cool as you think. This spectacle triggered by the ego is not only painful (yes, I loved Jackass), but also narcissistic beyond belief. The intro too stylized ends with a cold explanation of Bam that he will do "everything he wants". How about doing something that is really funny? I liked "Jackass" for what it was worth. The shoot was horrible - any fool could have done a better show with a camcorder in their parents' garage - but at least the show is moving at a brisk pace and never felt boring between the crazy, dangerous stunts or just disgusting that their buddies have performed. <br /> <br /> This is not the case with "Viva la Bam". We follow our hero as he pranks his friends and tortures his loved ones, but it never looks like a scripted and lame comedy. Waterfalls and pranks are slightly amusing, but presented in a boring and boring way to the point where you can barely smile. <br /> <br /> "Viva la Bam" is a poor fallout that does not do much good but feed the already too big ego of Margera. I do not recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone.
