I'm sure I've seen FUTURE KILL for the same reason most people do: HR Giger's great poster. And like everyone else, I was disappointed that the film could not live up to the poster (Giger said the director Moore had begged him to do it). When I saw this for the first time, at the age of 14, I thought it was the worst film ever made. I would still think if I had not seen some movies on MST3K since then. <br /> <br /> The plot features a group of annoying college kids going to the "city of mutants" to kidnap a gang leader their fraternity. That's when they meet Splatter (Ed Neal), a mutant / cyborg / psychopath who kills the gang leader and blames the frats as an excuse to hunt them down and seize power. The rest of the film consists mainly of prosecution. A handful of fraternities are trying to get out of the mutant city (which, I think, is supposed to be LA, even though it was made in Texas). There are pseudo-political tricks about the fraternity boys' society being a nuclear weapon and the mutant society being anti-nuclear. We are talking about how Splatter has become a phenomenon due to radiation. Most people develop cancer by irradiation, but splashing only pushes spikes and slaughters girls. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. At one point, our heroes save a mutant girl from two pro-nuclear policemen, and she shows them "how the other half lives". The other half, it turns out, are all punk kids dancing around a bad 80s pop band. So, our little epic is both stupid and dated. That's really all there is to it. Comrades frolicking in ruined buildings while guys who look like bikers try to kill them ... Oh, and that's the future. <br /> <br /> I do not think you have any doubt as to why Ron W. Moore has never done another film. This thing is a real stinker. If you like Giger, buy his books (they have the poster without the horrors of the movie), or just watch ALIEN again. FUTURE KILL is a waste of time nobody needs. <br /> <br /> If this description gives a good rendering to the image, there is another crappy movie that does the same thing, but bigger and better: AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK. It's shit, but it eliminates FUTURE KILL from the screen.
