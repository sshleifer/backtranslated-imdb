Look no further, this is the worst movie of all time. There may be others that are related, but there are not any worse. There can not be any. <br /> <br /> I found this film on a $ 3.25 laserdisc of clearance, and I thought that no film with these actors could be worth that price. It turns out that it's worth it three times - at a minimum, they should have paid me to watch it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure the girl on the cover photo does not fit the girl in Au cin√©ma, they replaced someone else, a younger and more cute man, for make it more attractive.

I finally cracked because I had to do my part to push as far as possible the user's rating on this stinker. <br /> <br /> The guidelines ask you to "focus on the content and the context".
