You now know the story of "Sweeney Todd", probably thanks to Tim Burton's recent movie. However, you probably do not know this story from Andy Milligan, the notorious tobacco merchant who gave Al Adamson and Ted V. Mikels a run for their money. <br /> <br /> finally arrive. During my years watching horror and exploitation from the '60s to the' 80s, I am finally watching a film by Andy Milligan. You see, from 1964 to 1990, Andy gave us many movies of exploitation and horror, none of which were good, and barely observable. "Bloodthirsty butchers" is no exception. <br /> <br /> There is a dialogue and, well, there is a dialogue, and that's one of the things you'll find here: a lot, a lot of discussions. The film sometimes reaches the levels of "Manos the hands of fate", while you wait tirelessly for something to happen. Although I like the effects of inexpensive gore, violence is too rare and, despite its reputation, the "breast" scene is not so shocking. <br /> <br /> I like the cheap and shady exploitation as much as the next fan of trashy cinema, but "Bloodthirsty Butchers" is the kind of problem that MST3K would rip without mercy. Unfortunately, Milligan died of AIDS in 1991, and if there was a film of its kind, it was the delirious "The Ghastly Ones". It's not a "horrible", it's just bad.
