Please do not waste your time and money with this turkey book. <br /> <br /> It is a melodramatic love story overflowing in the context of New France (aka Quebec City in the 18th century). Or is it a historical epic of New France with an epic novel? I do not know and at this point, I do not care. <br /> <br /> There is a rich story to tell about the intrepid French adventurers, rogues and other characters who colonized Canada and parts of the United States. It's not that. The characters are total shots, the story is overflowing, breathless and devoid of any charm, and very quickly all that the viewer wants to do is to have the devil of the theater, to have his head checked and get your hands on it. anger against the hype. <br /> <br /> This film was the biggest disappointment of my year in terms of cinema, especially since since, as a historian and Canadian French or of French origin (or other) I am a) convinced that the story of my people in this country has not yet been told as well as possible about a film b) is interested in this subject c) a movie buff who thinks that the cinema could nowadays make wonders with this grandiose and tragic story. <br /> <br /> As I said, do not waste your time with this frustrating piece of toad.
