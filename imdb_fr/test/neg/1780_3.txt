Some giant scorpions are on a submarine and kill everyone. Two months later, Marines and scientists in charge of the Scorpion project go to the submarine to recover their cargo. After finding 200 corpses, the naval commander said to the doctor, "I need to know if there is anything here that could be dangerous for my men." Uh, are you ok? She refuses to tell him what's going on there, citing "the need to know". Yeah, that's pretty good. One of the scientists is apparently a kind of silly scholar - very heavy on the idiot, light on the scientist. His task is to repair the lights. He finds the lights control panel, cuts a wire and gives a banshee scream. Then he does it again. Then he takes a hammer and crushes the control panel, so all the lights in the submarine start working. <br /> <br /> And so on. Apparently, this was made in Sweden; I do not know if Swedes have a really strange sense of humor or if they are just really horrible filmmakers. I am inclined to think that they are terrible filmmakers. If you guessed there is a huge explosion at the end of this case, well, sorry, but it's based on the need to know, so I can not tell you. <br /> <br /> If you have Let me suggest Tail Sting, a fun and fun movie about scorpions on a plane, or Bugs, which is a rather laid-back B movie about scorpions in a tunnel. Watch this film as an absolute last resort. Oh, it's observable, it's hard to extinguish it because of its madness, but that's about all there is to it.
