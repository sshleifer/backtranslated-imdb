Any of the Law & Order groups, CSI (choose your city) and Homicide: the lowest episodes of street life are greater than the strongest episodes of Bones. <br /> <br /> David Boreanaz is stuck in the Angel mode of shit, and Emily Deschanel portrays "Bones" too ... unrealistically. The actors as a whole have terrible scenes together, whether they be acts of violence or horrible lines. <br /> <br /> The murders become predictable after a while because the prefigurations and clues are too obvious. <Br /> <br /> Music is acceptable, even if it is sometimes useless. <br /> <br /> In the end, Bones is hardly the show that I recommend you watch during the week, because it is a true copy of the best shows. with unreal characters and always boring stories. <br /> <br /> Skip this if you can.
