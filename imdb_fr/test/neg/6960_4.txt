A dramatic but overrated thriller, the film attempts to portray the uncontrollable and uncontrollable inner demons of a tormented artist. The problem is that no relationship shown on the screen is credible and the likelihood seems to have been rejected by the window. The main character is so difficult to understand that it is rather impossible to imagine the characters on the screen emotionally invested in him either. The conclusion is also fairly predictable; there are certainly enough clues provided from the start to indicate exactly where the story is headed. Choosing to completely suspend belief in situations or relationships, the film itself is well played (especially by the main actors) and manages to create a pleasant tension throughout the story. As a metaphor, there is food for thought. If the scenario had been stronger, there would certainly be a potential that could be better exploited.
