I just saw the door of paradise. After watching this epic western 3h 40 min that is not a western, I read the book by Steven Bach. After reviewing all the events and the movie itself, I still think this movie is a total waste of time. I believe that when someone tells you to look at this, they are actually trying to bore you to death. If for some reason you can take advantage of this indulgent on a really bad thought, I have to ask why. Although this is not a reason to hate him, he is historically very different. He claims to be about a situation that occurred in Wyoming and is called the Johnson County War. Simply, the cattle barons of the time wanted to kill all the cattle thieves and claimed that they were all immaterial. You find that you just do not care about these people and hope they will all be killed, because at least something would happen. Everyone in the film talks about what's going on and it's never seen. After sitting down so well as this giant waste of time, you wonder how one could make a 4-hour epic in which nothing happens. Oh, and by the way, the Johnson County War was not a war, it never happened. The Johnson County War, in fact, was so named because it almost happened. In fact, 2 people died. I can not warn you enough about this movie. However, if you are like me, the idea of ​​watching a film that has ruined careers and put "United Artists on the Lot" for sale, sounds like an interesting case to study, so especially watch this terrible, narsisist, film without subtext and a lot of photographs (which is sometimes beautiful)
