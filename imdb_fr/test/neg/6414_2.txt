Apparently, a massive head injury is a cure for homicidal tendencies, turning a deadly sociopath into an adorable and whimsical dog catcher. In addition (that of the ladies), it seems that the door of a psychiatric hospital is a neglected hot spot to meet potential partners. These are just two of the 23 absurdities we are supposed to accept for this film to make sense. I love movies and I think, as many Americans think (forgive me if I'm wrong), that Hollywood was the best product. I came here to learn how sadly I was brainwashed and 2) how much more sophisticated European / Asian cinema is compared to its American counterpart. <br /> <br /> I watched this "thriller" psychologically supposedly disturbing. night after watching a Japanese movie called Suicide Club. As the camera faded into the happy little Walter Sparrow family enjoying a good time around a prison visiting table (not to mention the condescending voice over praising the "doing things right" "), I suddenly had an epiphany. I had just watched a film that gave me the impression of having a drink of water when I really wanted a beer. My thirst was satiated, but strictly utilitarian. The premise was moderately interesting, but the story itself, with its innumerable "coincidences" (how do we explain it by finding the book?) We will simply say something like: "... or the book has it- did she find it? "I'm going to buy that), gaping holes (why did wifey take the skeleton?), predictability, and a happy ending, turned out to be one more work for Hollywood. In addition, Jim Carrey's casting was simply wrong. At all times, I felt that he was able to break into a movie of one of his stupid comedies or In Living Color. Jim Carrey as a tattooed police detective who loves bondage and violent sex? You did not buy it for a second. <br /> <br /> Do you want to disturb? Deeply disturbing? Look at the suicide club. The story surrounds the mysterious mass suicide of 54 schoolgirls. The film begins with a group of chubby high school students ruminating on a subway platform. We then observe with horror how they line up, hold hands and happily throw themselves in front of a fast-moving suburban train. Needless to say, a lot of chaos ensues. That's all I'm going to do with the script because I'm encouraging the reader to see the movie. In fact, I'm not sure I can describe the plot even if I wanted it. What begins as a simple mystery quickly turns into a crazy house of grotesque images. Did I understand the movie? No, not at first, like a lot of foreign films that my girlfriend introduced to me. So naturally, I thought it was "bad". But this one persisted in my mind. I went to bed thinking about the movie and woke up the next morning to watch it on IMDb. I read some of the comments from the viewers and was amazed by 1) the ideas others had drawn from the movie and 2) the fact that I had completely missed the purpose of the movie. I realized that I was so used to spooning the "message" of Hollywood, that in the face of a film that actually forced the viewer to participate - to think for himself, I was totally distraught. It's as if I've been conditioned to "check my brain at the door" of the theater. <br /> <br /> Am I saying that Suicide Club is the biggest film ever made? Of course not. It has its flaws, many of which have been skillfully reported by IMDb reviewers. Am I saying that all American films are bad and that all foreign films are good? Once again, of course not. My point is that there is a whole world of filming outside Hollywood - a body of work that engages the viewer; forces them to think and question films that do not resemble telegraphic intrigues, follow a strict linear sequence and, above all, do not insult the intelligence of the one who is watching. I can not wait to expand my mind while exploring this new world of movies that "do not think for me".
