The best thing about this movie for me is that Bryan Dick played Rafe and melted me. Rafe and all its splendor made the film worthy of interest, even if I wanted to get up and scream. I have never seen a warmer man. <br /> <br /> -ahem- But that's not the problem. <br /> <br /> The title? That's what it is. They took the beautiful story written by Annette Curtis Klause and threw it. In all my anal-retentive glory, I'll point out what's missing, what's changed, and what's wrong with the film. <br /> <br /> Sit well and go: <br /> <br /> Apparently, RAFE is the son of ASTRID and GABRIEL, and apparently, ULF is no longer the child of ASTRID as in the book. AND, if I remember the book well, RAFE and ASTRID were LOVERS. <br /> <br /> -ASTRID is apparently BLOND, unlike RED HAIR, in particular, described in the book. I think the book said it looked more like a FOX than a WOLF. And the film also shows that ASPID is VIVIAN's aunt. <br /> <br /> -WHERE AXEL GO? <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN is 19 years old. In the book, she was 16 years old. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN and AIDEN meet at HIGH SCHOOL. They both attend the book. VIVIAN goes to AIDEN because of his poem 'Wolf Change'. But, according to the film, AIDEN beat his father, escaped and now lives in Romania and draws graphic novels. It made me go "What is the F ** K." <br /> <br /> -There is no "Kelly" in the movie. WAS THE KELLY IN THE FILM. KELLY in the book, however, hated VIVIAN. And she went out with AIDEN after they broke up. Vivian is even moved in the book and takes a look in her room. <br /> <br /> -GABRIEL looks strangely like a Colombian narcotics lord in the movie. And he sounds like that too. His game was very good, but his appearance made me unprepared. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN had NO parents in the movie. His father, his mother and two other brothers and sisters died in the film. However, in the book, when she returns home one evening, her mother, ESME, is sitting on the couch after arguing with ASTRID about GABRIEL. And VIVIAN does not have any brothers and sisters. Only his father died in the book. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN accepts VIVAN for what it is. It really has me. He kills RAFE in this scary church, confronts VIVIAN and saves him from the wolves, except that AIDEN pulls her, so they move away to find drugs, and then they try to leave the city together. WTF ?! In the book, AIDEN panics when she turns into a wolf and cries like a girl, throws objects at her, then panics and jumps out the window. Then he tells a story that he tried to break up with her and she threw a chair out the window. That does not seem to accept me. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN wants her to run away with him. In the book, he does not want anything to do with VIVAN after she turns to him. He does not hold his face with love and does not say that she can control it. He's crying like a woman because he's scared of her. <br /> <br /> And the last indignation ... the one that almost gave my three best friends and I heart attacks in our seats: <br /> <br /> - In the film, AIDEN and VIVIAN flee together, and VIVAN killed GABRIEL. As in her pulls it. GABRIEL dies. In the * BOOK *, not only VIVIAN does not kill GABRIEL, but I also believe that they STOP ALL TOGETHER. As, she does not end up with AIDEN, she ends up with GABRIEL. THAT'S WHAT HELL. <br /> <br /> We also noticed small things: the red hair of Ulf he obtained from Astrid was changed to brown in the film and Vivian works in a chocolate factory. <br /> <br /> A horrible shock; I am ashamed. The book was really not hard to follow. If Disney can use an H! School randomly, why would the director not have found a H! School at random? <br /> <br /> * sigh * I was looking forward to this movie, I loved the book, it's sad that he did not follow it. I give him a 2, only because (as the top of this review says) Rafe (played by Bryan Dick) was very sexy, and Agnes Bruckner did a great job. AND, they kept SteppenWolf's poem <br /> <br /> With love, <br /> <br /> Caitlin
