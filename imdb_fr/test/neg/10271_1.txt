Sensational. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I like bad TV movies. Love them. I get involved. The works. I want to get involved I spend time looking at the thing. I watched the Emmys last night on TV. How in the infinite world has the TV movie Empire Falls (excellent name) been awarded? He really had a wonderful talent. Of course. And they tried beautifully. But how can anyone claim that it was an OK scenario (TV for the sake of good)? OK direction? You know, I wish everyone the best. Really. But I thought it was absolutely amazing that Hollywood places this very, very bad movie for many honors. Price? For me, it was kind of a wake up call: Hollywood is such a small island community. Being cynical is not really my thing. But wow. --xptyngi
