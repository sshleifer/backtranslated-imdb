Nothing in this film is remarkable either as such or as such. <br /> <br /> In the end, that's what kills him. Blandness is just not good. I can not say I was expecting better from Will Smith, but I certainly did to Kevin James of "The King of Queens" - but, hey, I'm getting used to saying it a lot these last time. This film tries to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy, but it never hits. In fact, he never hits * anywhere * in the target. The allergy scene is disturbing; the fact that Kevin James can not dance is something that will not surprise anyone, so it's not funny (in a movie like this). This film constantly tries to win your heart, but always with the wrong stratagem at the wrong time. Some parts are fine (but I'm looking for examples in my brain), but I really think this film should be avoided.
