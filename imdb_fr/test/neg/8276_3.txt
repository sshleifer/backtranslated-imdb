The title of this review summarizes how I feel about this film. I can not imagine what a public there would be for this thing, if it is not the hardcore fan of the 80s slasher who simply has to see everything he saw from that time. Otherwise, do not even waste your time on it. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to most movies of this type: something terrible happens to one of the characters in the opening scene, inspiring a bloodthirsty killer to make a murderous rampage. Been there, do that. In fact, none of these slashers of the 80s was known for its originality. I do not see why it would be interesting to play on the film just for that. <br /> <br /> But the film failed is outstanding. and murder sequences. I saw quite frightening slasher films from the 1980s with a budget well below this one. This one just does not manage to create a real suspense The director inserts here pretty camera angles and some semi-professional director's touches, but that does not mean anything if you're not afraid. The gore is pretty docile too, so anyone who looks at these things with the intention of seeing cool makeup effects from the 1980s will be sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film manages to be quiet enough. Honestly, the key ingredient of almost every slasher is the tight pace - you have to get things done quickly and stage the scenes of murder at regular intervals, because, let's face it, we do not look at them for best characterization and stellar plots. But the stimulation, whether because of the script or the editor, is disabled. The murders are spaced at irregular intervals, leaving us with long scenes (no doubt intended to build a "character") that only serve to annoy you and let you pray for the next massacre (which, as I do I said, in general, anyway, is not very well executed.) <br /> <br /> As for the killer, do not expect anything original or even afraid. He (or she?) Wears a tracksuit, a fencing mask and his main weapon is a sword. I bet the writer just fumed to think he invented an original "cool" murder weapon, but the idea is simply unrealistic. Nor is there much emphasis on the "polarized" nature of the film, as if they forgot or did not care to put red herrings in the mix to destabilize us. <br /> <br /> I thought the people behind that were trying to do something decent and respectable, and sometimes it shows that their intentions were probably a little more sincere about to make a quality movie as opposed to countless other slashoff of the time. The attempt fails for the most part. There are however some very good actors (at least for this type of film). There is an attempt at characterization, but nothing ends up having a final meaning, so ... Here, all he manages to do is swallow the plot and give the impression that the murder sequences can not arrive soon enough. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you're really interested in these old slashers of the 80s, certainly, take a look, if only to say that you've seen it. There is one complete in each of us. But do not expect to be blown away or anything. What we have here is a very moderately entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression.
