It must be one of the most annoying and arrogant films I have ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos has reached a new level of pretense. It is clear that there is virtually no conspiracy, although this part of Greek history is essential for making great films. He was just thinking of some supposed symbolic scenes (actually shambolic) and he built a whole movie around them. Death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam, with litanies, processions, etc., which should only be a vehicle for the film, but unfortunately it is the film itself. A totally incoherent result, which can only let you say "huh?" or "oh dear" every two minutes. <br /> <br /> There is no character development, nada, zilch. I usually complain about some movies with two-dimensional characters, but damn it, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. This is irritating for us and degrading for some actors. He even managed to give the impression that one of my favorite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis, looked like wood. <br /> <br /> And go to the heart of the film making Angelopoulos: No, we are not idiots. We do not want chewed food. Please, someone tells this guy that the symbolism must be subtle. Are you underestimating your audience or are you simply incompetent? Personally, I think he tried to make a Greek "Underground". No matter how hard he tries, he can not reach Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Only a saving grace: photography, costumes and music.
