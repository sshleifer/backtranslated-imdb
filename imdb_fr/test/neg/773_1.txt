Stay away from this movie. Far. Phil Fondacaro is the crazy leader of a Freakshow. Each representation is flat and insensitive, except that of Fondacaro. The plot is simple and follows almost every clich√© of horror movies possible. A group of high school students go to a carnival, see a show and put themselves forward. <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray's fans must be forewarned, this is unlike any of his other films. It is lacking in all departments (humor, sex, horror, etc.) other than F.O. Ray movies excell in. <br /> <br /> The version I saw also contained a Making-Of document in which the director made comments such as "We had a limited budget" and "with our limited timeline" which says a lot about how much Charles Band cared about this movie. Go rent "Droid Runner" (Fred Olen Ray) or "The Dead hate the living" (Full Moon) instead. The Full Moon should be ashamed of themselves (and that's saying a lot after seeing "Killer Eye") <br /> <br /> Grade: D-
