The executive producer of the film is none other than this messenger of peace through transcendental meditation, David Lynch, the director's father. I wonder what David's guru, His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, would have thought of this production. Hypocrisy is as disgusting as the movie itself. It's a safe bet that Samuel L. Dieteman, the serial killer from Phoenix and keen on recreational violence, would have liked every minute. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many reproach this film to be cinematographic; at this level it's pretty good. But on a moral level, it's the most discouraging film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER TO COME <br /> <br /> I guess it's the phonicity of the thing that saddens me the most. Morally numbed generations X learn a trade and a little postmodern aesthetic theory in an art school or film school, then get involved in the arts and entertainment sector; and here is the result: a film that slips into human suffering, injustice and carnage, largely assisted by a nine-year-old girl who sees her entire family being brutally murdered by a couple of recreational violence killers who, in the end, ride at sunset. <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS TO COME <br /> <br /> For whom are such films produced? Narurally, sadists will love this - why would not they? But who else? As I noted above, there are very good craft films, but a good craft can be applied to any subject. Why apply it to things like that? In addition, the film provokes a lot of suspense, but it is not because of the gravity and the coarseness of the violence; it's suspicious because it's well run and well played. I'm sure Alfred Hitchcock's ghost could explain that much better than me. <br /> <br /> So what was presented to us here? And especially why? <br /> <br /> Yes, our world can be an ugly, dirty, even devilish place, but should not we disassociate when an "artist" makes a point of rubbing his face? Or even worse, stick that to the faces of these nine-year-olds who somehow end up seeing this on a DVD at home? <br /> <br /> I hope that people will make sure that this film is not seen by their children. Yeah, I know - dream, Bernon ...
