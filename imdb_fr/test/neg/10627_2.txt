Dolph Lundgren, who tries to tell a positive story, leads a group of mercenaries to seize a tropical island that looks a lot like paradise so that the men who hired his team can exploit it for ... droppings 'birds. In fact, they are looking for the nitrogen gas that emerges from the mud of this island. <br /> <br /> There was only one good thing about this film: the place where he was filmed was beautiful. Otherwise, the story drowns, leaving the actors with nothing to work with. Result: a lot of violence, a lot of language, a lot of blood and some shots of topless women. If you want unnecessary violence (sorry, the script can not even make sense of violence, even if it tries to do it), so that's the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Parents: Be warned that this movie is full of violence and blood, leading R's note.
