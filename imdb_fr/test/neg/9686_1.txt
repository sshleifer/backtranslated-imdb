Who wrote the script of this movie, the staff of Disney Studios ?! It's the most inactive adaptation of any story! I wanted to laugh at some scenes and cry others, and it was only because it was pitiful. I'll have to give him the credit, there were some fun scenes, but I could have spent more time with my evening. I rarely stop a movie after only a quarter of the way.
