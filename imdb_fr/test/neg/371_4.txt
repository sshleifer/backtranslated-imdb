As other critics have noted, this film is a cross between stories we've seen before. In particular, it looks like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter inserted into Mad Max. Remove the cigar from Clint and replace it with a cigarette. remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle, and lo and behold, an updated drifter. In this film, the "hero" is still more obviously a "savior" than High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair, a wound on the left side and his entry into the city is preceded by a call to "salvation" of the remaining inhabitants - a pretty transparent reference to a "second coming". I watched the movie on a hot and humid morning. Sleep was impossible and at sunrise at 4:30 am there was nothing else on TV. So, the film served its purpose. Although not very original, with characters with cartoons almost comical, the film is still quite funny ... at least at 4:30 in the morning.
