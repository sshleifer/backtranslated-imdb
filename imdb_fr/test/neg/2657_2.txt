Why are such "romantic" movies that never go anywhere, always start (and probably end) with crappy jazz? It's not smart and it feels like a TV movie. This film was sullen, slow, boring, original, wooden and did I say boring? <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford was probably trying to be mysterious and rude, but he was just a creeping and mumbling policeman who seemed to be entering the congresswoman's house as if all was well, when he was behaving like a pervert - looking at Thomas with a glare, not even bothering to talk. <br /> <br /> And why the hell are they still getting British? actors to put shit accents - they are thrown because they are famous, and everyone knows they are British precisely because they are famous!
