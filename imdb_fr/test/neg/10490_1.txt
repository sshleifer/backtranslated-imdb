This one is not even alive enough to be fun. There is something that rips people off-screen after a spaceship crash (off-screen) while government officials investigate (off-screen) and bad actors display silly lines (on screen), including a guy resembling Jim Carrey with a hangover. The "monster", when it's finally shown, looks like an extra "Robot Monster", but there's not enough monster fu anyway. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's pretty short. Jump it, unless you want to get bored of your skull
