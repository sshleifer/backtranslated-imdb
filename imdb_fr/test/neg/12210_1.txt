As he kills the Saturday morning time, "Looking For Lola" has switched to HBO. I decided to try it even if the description of the film was rather bad. It was even worse than I could imagine. The film was incredibly amazing and there was absolutely no chemistry on the screen between the main actors, which made me shake my head almost every 10 minutes. Between Mike Greenbaum (lead actor) in scenes in which he spends the bill in a fancy restaurant and where Lola (the lead actress) allows him to use his boss's house to trick his parents into believing that he is rich, it was almost as bad as him. "dreaming" of people around him doing the macarena (it was horrible!) and the two actors falling in love. I wanted to continue changing channels, but I was trying to give her every chance to become a cute love story with a few laughs. It never did. In fact, it became so serious that I decided to finish it just to be able to say that I watched one of the worst films ever made in its entirety, instead of being criticized for not "giving it a fair chance ". The last scene where Lola tries a dance party is the highlight of the film. She arrives late after her wedding (even this scene where Mike asks the priest to hurry and just pulls the papers saying that it is consistent with the credibility of this film), then "convinces" somehow the judges give it a look. The two male judges are already put off by his delay. But after watching her look around the stage (ok, she dances well, but not too impressive), everyone joins us, including the families of Lola and Mike, the other dancers present and * cough * even the judges. Bad, horrible, terrible. It was so bad that I had to write a review. Look at your own risk.
