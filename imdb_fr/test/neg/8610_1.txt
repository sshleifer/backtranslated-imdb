Man, man, it was a piece of dog. I read some reviews on this site after seeing the deal in the local video store, and I thought to myself ........ Ah, that seems like a pretty decent movie. .Swords. Thailand.How can you go wrong? Right? No, no, no way to be wrong. Jesus, if only I could put out my eyes without remembering this film, I would be happy. The lead actor had the happiest and happiest voice of all time! It really was not good ... "Amandaaaaaaaa ...", "I have to save my girlfriend ..." My friend and I actually changed the DVD audio track in Portuguese just to not have to hear the voice of the guy. Subtitles and everything ... and that improves the movie. I'm serious, if you find me like that and wondering how that movie was .. STOP WONDERING. I have the answer. The worst vampire movie of all time! No good action, no good blood and only the smallest hubbub of nudity. Just pure sh * t for 90 minutes. Do not rent this, buy it, think about it or watch it at 3am. It does not cut the cake ... at all ... in any way. F * ck this movie and watch All Anal 7: Real Deep Cover. You would have a better time. I am on.
