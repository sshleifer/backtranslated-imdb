I only voted it 2/10, mainly because Hitchcock agreed to lead it. He certainly had a day with predictable intrigues, stupid and childish characters who were desperately trying to be funny. "Scenes at a time when the Hollywood Production Code was in effect." Mazy characters in the movie who love the "soap" characters never do a job for which they are paid.It always irritates me when food is usually never eaten by actors (an exception was in the meal scene in "Tom Jones" (1963), although large quantities of drinks are consumed - the actors must leave their mouths free for the next line! Carole Lombard has certainly adapted the image Hitchcock's "cool blonde" of a heroine, but what has never cost him to run this worthless and worthless scenario, he should have kept to his thrillers. He certainly has not done well these past 69 years I could not wait until it ended, it irritated me gradually endless.
