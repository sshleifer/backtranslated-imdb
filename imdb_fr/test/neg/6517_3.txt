This film tells the story of 7 couples on Hampstead on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. <br /> <br /> It presents 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, breaking a love relationship, homosexual, elderly, escort service. They are not connected to each other outside their geographical location, so it's a disappointment. The film is a collage of conversations, without discernable intrigue. The film goes from one pair to another without any logic. I find this film boring and aimless. The only interesting feature is the beautiful weather throughout the film. It is unfortunate that talent such as Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo are ruined by this film.
