Whenever I think about this movie, I feel physically sick. Reading such a good book and finding out later that there was a film about the movie was a great feeling. Years later, imagine how excited I am to light up the science fiction channel and find it in just 5 minutes! Up go the titles and then uggg. If only a few things had changed, all right. Everything is changed. Many characters are deleted, new garbage is added. The main hero is narrowed and aged about 30, and his girlfriend / wife becomes hilarious his mother! Even the dog is reduced to the abilities of under-lassie. This cinema is really terrible at its worst. I would be happy to remove my own nails with pliers rather than have a horrible look, and I invite anyone who is considering looking at this - please do not do it. If you have a copy, burn it now, and think how much better your life would have been if this celluloid insult had never happened.
