A man kicks a dog in the air. <br /> <br /> A woman drops a cow from her bed. <br /> <br /> A man hits a sidewalk violin. <br /> <br /> A woman sucks the foot of a statue for 15 seconds. <br /> <br /> A man hits a blind man in the belly. <br /> <br /> Jesus rapes a girl. <br /> <br /> That's it. I just saved you an hour of your life. Certainly, there are those to whom this "shocking vanguard of cinematographic expression" could please. But I did not find it different from the childish and disconnected videos I used to shoot with my friends in Grade 9. Except we never had a real cow. <br /> <br /> After hearing endless sermons from art connoisseurs who make fun of the beard and the great importance of this film, I thought it was worth it. Do not be fooled, it's shit. If I still hear someone call Bu単uel "the father of cinematic surrealism", I think I'm going to hit someone. On the contrary, he took a big step back from the surrealist beginnings initiated by his elders Fritz Lang (Metropolis), F.W. Murnau (Faust) and Robert Weine (Caligari) 10 years earlier. That made a joke, as if Bu単uel did not have the confidence to really embrace art without sarcasm, without absurdity. It will take another 40 years for Bu単uel to refine his style into something admirable. Skip the beginning and go straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed by his work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure he would agree. In 1977 Bu単uel himself declared that he would gladly burn all the impressions of his old films. In this case, I would be happy to pour the lighter fluid.
