First, it is NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book, short story, novel, or other publication. On EW's website, and his criticism at the first broadcast of the show, "... he never writes for the public and he never betrays the contempt of his subjects.His first original work for the television, "Stephen King's Golden Years" (CBS, July 16, 9-9pm), is no exception. <br /> <br /> The series was apparently going to be (as others have mentioned ) a series in progress, that's why we never saw the end after the cliffhanger they left us. But it was never quite clear to the viewers who were wondering how all this would end. <br /> <br /> When the series was released on video, she boasted of having the end "never seen before!" "He should have said," the end should never be seen! "<br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> The very end is the only important part that has been modified for the video (although parts of the whole were left out) and that changed the end was what destroyed the story.For example, rather than our two intrepid FBI agents realizing that they were now labeled as villains and to the escape of the wicked Jude Anderson from The Shop (originally aired), Jude is simply heading towards them ... And they shoot him .. Bang, dead, and no real emotion to talk about the Same story on the subject with Harlan and his wife goes pouf.While the original end left us a spectacular cliff-hook, on the video, they just leave the car with poppy tail. <br /> <br /> *** End Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> It was a sad end for a rather well done mini-series, and the video is absolutely not worthy of purchase, not even rented Sincerely, save your money and time.
