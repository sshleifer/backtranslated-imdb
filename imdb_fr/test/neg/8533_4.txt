This movie contains all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. Few movies can really give me shivers. This one did it. Few horror films scare me. This one did it. That let me guess. I was worried about the story. I cared about the characters. The game was decent. Unfortunately, about halfway through the film, the story does not make much sense. It becomes obvious that everything cool in the plot will self-destruct. That done. What is built in the first half as a concept of horror goes from horror to absurdity. A plausible fear is transformed into a series of improbable reactions of the characters. The story ends with disappointment. Although this movie seems complete, there is a free end that could be configured for a sequel. The movie is not good enough for a sequel. This film is worth seeing in the theater, but do not expect to be stunned. This is better suited as a movie for rent. This is probably not a movie you would like to own.
