... when we all know it, no one does it like the BBC. <br /> <br /> As an avid fan of this kind of viewers Sunday night, I was eager to see that. How disappointed I was! For the first thirty seconds, I did not think it looked promising and after two minutes I had trouble looking. <br /> <br /> However, my friends and I persevered only to find a bad behavior and a misunderstanding half of the characters. The plot has been pushed to the extreme and the make-up and the garish and very 21st century costumes in a 'bbc robin hood' style. This modern style may have been placed in sharp camera angles and sumptuous cinematography, but unfortunately we do not have it either. The management felt decidedly neglected, both for the choice of actors and for the shooting. <br /> <br /> After 30 minutes, we could not afford to watch it anymore. It's unfair that I judge this because I have looked so little, but I have rarely felt so compelled to warn people not to look at something! However, my friends and I thought the house and umbrellas were pretty, but it's as good as it gets.
