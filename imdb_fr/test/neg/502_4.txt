The movie, Heaven's Gate, was a good sight, though still tedious at over 4 hours. But the film took a big license - as usual in Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson) and "Elle" were actually married. Their main contribution to the Johnson County War was to start with hanging. Well, starting it, I mean it happened at the beginning, not at the end. Here's the real storyline: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because a family property could be given to each family. By depositing individually, they could obtain two properties. They chose the Crazy Woman Creek residential sites to control the waters over lands owned by a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them back several times, which they refused. <br /> <br /> Although he is characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate) and a prostitute herself (and also in the film), no real proof which was true. We know that she bought a lot of sick cattle, brought them back to life, and was later accused by the Cattleman's Association of receiving the cattle in exchange for "obscene acts". She was finally charged with choking. This is entirely true for this part of the "American West" myth, which is an epic series of myths spanning a period of about a hundred years. <br /> <br /> In real life, Jim Averill and she were surprised one day by several members of the Cattleman's Association, supported and quickly hanged. Those who perpetrated injustice have never been brought to justice. and the beginning of the Johnson County War. <br /> <br /> Quite different from the Hollywood version that shows its shot at the end. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I think the main problem of the film was the editor, which could have accelerated the action through a more skillful editing.
