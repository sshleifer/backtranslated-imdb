I can not believe how bad this "movie" is. For starters, the film is about the legend of Big Foot and a group of people having a close encounter with the creature. The premise is interesting and the presence of Lance Henriksen in the distribution (ALIENS) gave "The Untold" a promising perspective. Unfortunately, it's as interesting as possible. It sounds like a direct DVD version ... or at least I guess. It's basically an unproductive affair with probably the worst editing (with a constant "fade-out" between each scene !!!) that I've seen in my life and playing that will definitely make you cringe. Why Lance Henriksen chose this is totally unfathomable. And the film is inspired by almost all genre films, from "Blair Witch Project" and "Predator" to "Alive". This is supposed to be based on real events, but the only truth here is how bad this movie is. Usually, I am not a severe critic and believe me, I tried to appreciate this trash, but I did not finally do it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this DVD. <br /> <br /> I'll try to say it nicely: this film is a PURE garbage can and it made me want to take my weapon and fire on my neighbors ... or ask BLOCKBUSTER to pay me back !!! <br /> <br /> And Lance, shame on you! 1 * out of 10 *
