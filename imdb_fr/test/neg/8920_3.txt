Steven Seagal is a thief specializing in the theft of drug traffickers, who give them to the poor and unfortunate ... ah, Harlan, the Robin Hood. Be that as it may, Harlan wants to go directly to his daughter, Jada (Mari Morrow), so he takes the position of driver of an armored car for a Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe, lost in an underwritten role). Max intends to have the millions for himself and his unscrupulous partners, with the intention of using his charger, Bruno (Robert Miano), to bring him money, but Harlan has other plans. Escape the police, hide the money and let Bruno (who had a loaded pistol pointed at Harlan's head threatening to shoot him if he did not drive) after escaping capture by crushing a huge dump truck tilting, Harlan dies. Harlan is imprisoned, in particular for the murder of police officers due to the damage caused by the pursuit at high speed. Many want to know where the money is. Harlan joins an inmate, Ice (Treach), head of one of the many prison gangs, who plans to find Max and eliminate all members of his corrupt entourage. Soon, DEA agent Rachel Knowles (Sarah Buxton) will participate in this scenario thanks to her boss, Saunders (Nick Mancuso), who says drugs are involved. Harlan's desire to save a children's hospital is about to close and Jada dreams of a mysterious dream about Max. <br /> <br /> Seagal and Treach share the word in gangsta, while Buxton tries to help Harlan, discovering that his boss is perhaps angry with Max. The character of Mancuso is a funny duck, leaving Rachel a lot of room for maneuver despite the threat it represents for his career. Tighe appears for about five minutes, which is a shame. Seagal's Harlan escapes the jail and finds every rich collaborator of Max, inevitably discovering where he is after cracking a few skulls, breaking wrists and breaking bones. Treach speaks in his rapper's speech and Seagal tries to answer him in the same way, providing unintentional laughter. As you might expect, many people get shot at and Seagal does not sweat. It is interesting to see Seagal in prison, among the convicts, help Treach out when a group of "Eses" intends to get him out.
