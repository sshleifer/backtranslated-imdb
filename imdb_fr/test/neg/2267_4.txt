If you really liked GWTW, you will find the story quite disappointing. Those who think this is a romantic and southern story will probably be satisfied with this decent television production (although I think Scarlett's choice is important). But let me say that, given the novel, nothing good could come out. <br /> <br /> I have read GWTW more than 20 times and I can really appreciate the adaptation Ms. Mitchell has made to the film. It took me a while to understand how good the end was: Scarlett knew she was going to get Rhett back, because she was still getting what she was looking for. <br /> <br /> Then Alexandra Ripley came to "fix" that by showing us just how perfect and powerful Scarlett could be and, of course, describing in detail how exactly she gets Rhett. back even when she had an important affair with someone else (nothing could be further from Mrs. Mitchell's mind, I'm sure). <br /> <br /> The story between these two points is in my opinion just long and boring Rising to tight ends, showing costumes and scenarios to give us an obvious and totally useless end. <br /> <br /> If Margaret Mitchell could live again, she would die once more at the moment she would find out what Scarlett became after GWTW. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not fair to compare that to the original, but it's not GWTW's fault. Is not it? Is it good if I do not compare it to the original? May be. Sorry to say I do not really care. <br /> <br /> I would expect a little more compromise to continue the work of someone else, otherwise do not even try.
