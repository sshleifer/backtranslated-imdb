Am I right to think that I went to see the same movie as everyone else ... this movie was terrible. I am a fan of the 3 series of the gentelmen league and I have always respected the originality of the writers, even when the format has changed in series 3. This film was however a blatant half effort, the plot was extremely poor with the characters entering the real world made this movie more like the last action hero. There were about 5 moments in the movie that had a slight laugh, but the rest of the time, I wanted it to end. It would have been better if the DVD had been short by 10 minutes ... it was more an explanation of what they were going to do, and it seemed that some writers disagreed about the fate of the characters and they made a joke about it. Kill him in the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you're a real fan of the league's ability to stay cool, then you'll hate this movie. If you only watch it because there is nothing better on TV, then you will love it. <br /> <br /> someone will help me !!
