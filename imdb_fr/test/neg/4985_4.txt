Jason Lee does well to give this canine film an ephemeral promise, but it is not enough to distinguish it from any other tasteless family comedy. <br /> <br /> This adventure in action with scenes of synthesis sees a police dog shamed (Jason Lee) transformed into a super-dog following an accident in the laboratory of scientist scientist Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). Underdog strives to save the city while trying to keep his identity secret - a challenge since he knows how to talk and fly. <br /> <br /> The strange gag lifts a smile, but Underdog's human acolytes (James Belushi and Alex Neuberger as father and son) are as drab as the predictable scenario. One for children too young to have seen Superman. Or Spider-Man. Or even Shaggy Dog ??
