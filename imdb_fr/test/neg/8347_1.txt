The story of an erupting volcano in downtown LA looks like a fine plot for a disaster movie. This one however, is missed bigtime. The film looks chaotic, it has a difficult scenario to follow or to believe and the acting was very bad. <br /> <br /> I agree with many comments that Lee Jones is only good at directing people. leader in a particular field. In this one, he runs the emergency room. As the head of such an office, it is naturally wise to bring your daughter into dangerous situations. Smart thinking. Ann Heche touches walls and walks in tunnels supposed to be at 678 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah, of course. Aside from the bad acting, these factual errors make the movie almost as stupid as Armageddon. The only good thing about this movie is that there is no Ben Affleck to make things worse. Avoid this movie at all costs.
