All I have to say is a word ... SUCKS !!!! The only reason I gave this 2 is because Josh Hartnett was in and he's cool. I should have beaten Klein's ass ... stupid, stupid and brainless. At the end of this movie, you can not stand Klein anymore and you do not care what happens to Leelee. Hartnett was the only good thing about it.
