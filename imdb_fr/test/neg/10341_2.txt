I attended a screening of this film. This was done with clich√©s and jokes and stagings very funny. I think the other comments were made by people who had to work on the film or be part of the family. I am surprised that this film costs between 3 and 4 million dollars without real stars. Where did the budget go? Obviously, it was not sent to writers for a new writing. Nice idea to bet on the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a major failure. There was little or no spark between the main characters and the incident that dragged him was at best a bit fragile. The direction was uninspired and looked like a student movie. <br /> <br /> I do not even know what it means "Everyone wants Italian". Is this a real saying? I never heard that.
