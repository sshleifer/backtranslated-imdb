Victor Jory never became a major star. He is better known for his later roles than for his leading roles. But he was very handsome and an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> His love scenes with Loretta Young in this romantic thriller are passionate. Their kisses seem very real. And very modern. <br /> <br /> Vivienne Osborne also stands out here. She plays a woman with a reputation. But the character has a good heart. <br /> <br /> The imprint I saw was not clear. But what a joy that rare films like this one appear! And they are, in a kind of observable condition, still intact. It's nothing really special. But if one is willing to browse the movies of his time with such intriguing titles, one is likely to find higher quality movies.
