I do not know where to start. From beginning to end, bad, stinky, like entering a port-to-John one day at 100 degrees. If you force yourself to look like me, keep Vicodin on hand. I will never understand how such hard shots have gone beyond the cutting room without the entire reel being on the ground. The film is a cross between Gumby Rides Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver playing cowboys and Indians without cowboys. I saw a better animation in the original Blob cut. You will get more entertainment by watching Gone with the Wind while suffering from vomiting and excrement. If you play badly and you have hokey, you'll want to rent the big Peewee marquee or watch all episodes of Gilligan's Island one after another. UGH .. I'm going to cut my wrist now.
