I just watched on UbuWeb this first short experimental film directed by William Vance and Orson Welles. Yes, you read Orson Welles! Years before becoming famous for "War of the Worlds" on the radio and for his first feature, Citizen Kane, Welles was 19 years old and had just found his muse. In addition to Vance and Welles, another player was Virginia Nicholson, who would become Orson's first wife. She embodies a woman who sits on something that moves forward thanks to an African-American servant (Paul Edgerton in blackface). Meanwhile, a man (Welles) passes by her (courtesy of the constantly repeating scene). I will not reveal more, except to say how silent images were interesting, because they were constantly jumping. That's not to say it was a good thing, but it was fascinating to even look at the guitar score (by Larry Morotta) added to the 2005 edition that I watched. This is worth a look for lovers of Welles and for all those who have a taste of the avant-garde.
