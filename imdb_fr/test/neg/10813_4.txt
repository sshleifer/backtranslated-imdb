I totally agree. It's "Pitch Black underground" and a well-worn plot. The best scenes I thought were those of divers exploring the caves, passing through impossible underpasses, some of which were beating very hard. The landscape was great. Had they given up the "alien" staple, CGI badboys were completely satisfied, the film would have been much better. All they would have had to do was never show monsters apart, but let everyone wonder, and follow Jack's descent into madness, and it could have been a thriller Hitchcock style first-rate, maybe a reward. The acting is not bad. But these rubber sticks simply reduce it to standard fare.
