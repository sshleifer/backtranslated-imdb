I first thought that this little fantastic tour would be a little entertaining. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> A good cast (Roy Scheider as president) did not help him. The story contained all the worst scenarios that could occur during a terrorist nuclear disaster. And none of this could happen! <br /> <br /> Of course, the kidnapping of the president can only be accomplished with the help of a secret service traitor (like Air Force One), but everything they describe about football and the helplessness of our country if it were to fall into the hands of the enemy is ridiculous in the Nth degree. Seriously, not even the president can totally defeat the control of our missiles. The box is only used to relay the commands. In this situation, our system would have completely deleted the codes and everything would go nowhere. The destruction of Beijing could not happen - there would have been no missile launch because the silo teams would have been advised not to do so (communications include a cable system). There are simply too many safeguards to prevent such a thing from happening. <br /> <br /> Of course, films like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE gave some credence to the concept that we were losing control of THE SYSTEM. But this film goes too far and fails to suspend my conception of the incredible. And that makes the experience a waste of time for the viewer. This film is a failure.
