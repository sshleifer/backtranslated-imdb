I should start by saying that I have something of a love-hate relationship with musicals. Some of them are fantastic, others are downright shit. I was expecting the hair to fall into one of these categories. However, this is not the case, falling in the middle. <br /> <br /> The songs are not brilliant, although the song "Sodomy" makes me smile a lot, and everything is rather dated. But the film did not attract me like others, like Rocky Horror. Although this is a bad example, I hate Rocky Horror for years, then suddenly I understand it and I love it ever since. Maybe the hair will be the same. Although I doubt she will get as much exposure as Rocky Horror because of the language and the content of nudity, I doubt that I will have the chance to grow it. Gettit? Hair ... repel ... oh how you like. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have not had the chance to see the last fifteen minutes because of a technical problem, which was a shame, I liked to see how that s is over, especially after reading some of the reviews posted here. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for casual moviegoers, but a movie for music lovers. I really hope they will not remodel it, though, because I think such a reshuffle would eventually become a shallow, pale PC version of the original. <br /> <br /> Must see for lovers of the genre.
