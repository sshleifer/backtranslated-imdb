This very free reprise of Carmen begins on a high note with a burning and sexually frank dance between the Senegalese prisoner "Karmen" and her prison guard, but the animated opening minutes never catch fire in a coherent film. One minute, Karmen is all sexual predator, the next she dances to protest against her unfair government, then she suddenly becomes a smuggler on the high seas ... Although the film deserves congratulations for having postulated the first "Karmen", a carnival bisexual. The broad lines he paints look like a vignette and are not supported by a narrative coherence such that the film presents itself as a schizophrenic and undisciplined mixture of "Basic-Instinct" and "Bound" which meets an African version of a Bollywood musical.
