This film is a bad film, but to get a nutritional value, I recommend watching it in pairs with Rosemary's Baby. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to learn to see how different filmmakers can shoot different performances of the same movie actors playing the same characters. Watch Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) and the great work she did in the first film against the terrible rendering of this film. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see how the same characters were interpreted by different actors. Which leads me to wonder if anyone involved in the sequel was aware of the first movie and did any of them watch Rosemary's Baby before doing so? <br /> <br /> If your interest in movies is purely superficial, you'd better avoid that one. I have a lot more to say about this movie but I really do not want to go.
