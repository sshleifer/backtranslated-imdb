My god, how bad. Who is this imposter claiming to be Ali G? Avoid that at all costs. He replaces the intelligent multicolored satire and humor of his show with sly humor. <br /> <br /> This was obviously an attempt to make it known in the US before he released his show there on HBO. </ p> <br /> A commentator here argues that we do not judge the film on the merits of the series because of the difference between the mediums. While it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen, Mr. Sacha Baron Cohen could have ensured the intelligent use of his comic book style in a more conventional film scenario. Instead, we have this mess that, in all honesty, has absolutely nothing to do with Ali G, except for packaging. <br /> <br /> Terribly disappointing. Go get the Innit, Aiiii or Bling Bling DVDs for real Ali G.
