I rented this TV movie version of Troilus and Cressida in my library last Thursday and I simply could not believe my eyes. Where should I start? no effort was made to make the play look remotely like the Trojan War, all the actors wore an Elizabethan dress. Moreover, most of the actors were too old and too disappointing - Aeneas (with his white beard) seemed older than Nestor, Troilus was at least 30 years old, Hector looked like a Spanish pirate, Ajax was badly played Anyway, and Thersites was a travesty. <Similarly, the action is mediocre, the duel between Ajax and Hector is short and amateurish, the angle of the camera focuses more on the face of Nestor, so that we can only see what happens to the background and that is frustrating in itself. . The "battle" is also not in the end given its respect. We do not see Troilus and Diomedes fighting, or anyone else, Paris and Menelaus just seem to be fighting in front of Thersites. Even the death of Patroclus has been omitted. All this was a big disappointment, since I immersed myself in 2 and a half hours of drama theater from the BBC to get to this point. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it was not so bad. I thought the incredible Orlando as Thersites and John Shrapnel as Hector were well played, even though they did not look very good. I would say the same about Kenneth Haigh and Achilles, because he did not have the striking face and was sometimes a little dry. SPOILER: The culmination at the end - Hector's death - was perhaps the best part of the film. The dialogue of Achilles is excellent and sums up the attitude of a cold and seasoned murderer. However, the macabre of the scene (when Achille puts his mark on the head of Hector) distinguishes it anyway. Good work. The Troilus warrior, however, was annoying and I think the play would have been better if he had been assassinated by Achilles instead of a peacenik like Hector. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? OK, but it could have been better if he had had a younger cast and costumes that at least looked like the old Greek, not to mention the lack of action. 5/10
