A really fun story with good actors but missing at all. The actors are older but none of them seemed particularly good. They needed better makeup, photographs or something. It's supposed to be a love affair and yet, the movie had more the brutal aspect of a street movie. I liked the casting but I think the performances were rather bland. This is where the weakness of the director shows. Perhaps if Mrs Spielberg had directed Mr Spielberg, the film would have been much better.
