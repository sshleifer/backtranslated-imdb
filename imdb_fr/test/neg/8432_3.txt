An art teacher discovers an old wooden bed made from ginkgo and places it in his apartment, but he has a terrible history and is hunted by an old spirit that maintains its human form by tearing people's hearts. <Br /> <br /> This beautifully designed horror ?? In fact, it's more fantasy / romance than anything else that throws chills and stunning visuals, but the plot was not interesting and the screenplay was devoid of all life. The problem was that I spent most of my time keeping my finger away from the fast forward button. It certainly would have sped up the slow pace of the film, but again, I would not know too much about what was happening, which was relatively difficult to understand or maintain interest right away. The performances were melodramatic or simply boring, probably because these characters are unconvincing, flawed and cause coma. The real story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and confusing, with too much concentration on a fragile romance, laughable when it should not be and overall, it is built in an ordinary way and lacks only energy. or conviction to wear the film. What compensates for the weaknesses of the story are the artistic images, which looked great, but the use of certain images had somewhat stunned me as to what they really meant for the film. What catches your eye are the faded colors, but sometimes the screen itself looks very grainy or snowy. Although, from that, it shows the gross intensity of the production valves, but also adds some beautiful polished effects that go well with the soothing but sometimes unnerving score. The camera work was quite varied (although it did not add much to functionality), but in some more upbeat scenes there were too many close-ups or dark lighting that made it difficult to understand what you were doing. see. Beautiful moments of blood and composure are also on display, but they are neither too big nor distinguishable from most other films. <br /> <br /> A strange film, with bright images that look like something from a painting, but still not particularly attractive. Be careful, it could put you in a deep trance!
