Since the epicenter of the cultural globe, four teenagers of the working class have tried to change the world through music and fashion. It was the last attempt to do it in the last century and they failed. Before the dust dissipated, Malcolm McLaren, SEX Group Manager and owner of the SEX Shop, spent the money earned by the Sex Pistols to create a "dummy document" about his own role in their success. The film is called The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle and contains very few sequences of The Sex Pistols actually playing music and many McLaren sequences actually calling the audience silly audience. <br /> <br /> The nonsense of Cod-Surrealist in which the guitarist Steve Jones is a detective on the tail of McLaren dissolves quickly so that the drummer Paul Cook can fly to Rio and spend time with the "big thief" Ronnie Biggs. Get ready for the spectacle of three unattractive men dancing naked in front of an ugly and ironic version of "Belsen was a Gas" (a song about the murder of Jews for gold in the Bergen concentration camp). Belsen), and another song sung in Ronnie Whin's dull tone that includes the words "God save Myra Hindley, God save Ian Brady" (words that Johnny Rotten would have considered disgusting). The scenes of Sid Vicious are rare and silly. Jump out of bed in a thong with a swastika on the testicles to sing a 50s bad boy biker song. Play in the theme "Punk is a joke" of the movie, in order to turn Sid into James Dean. I am surprised that McLaren does not like Siddy's death either. The redeemed scenes are Sid's in Paris and the infamous My Way performance. The punk rock zeitgeist just there. Make fun of an adoring public before filming them. You do not need an entire movie, just watch this clip on YouTube. <br /> <br /> The sequel to Julien Temple's documentary, far superior (and more enjoyable) in 2001, The Filth and the Fury, gave us a more balanced / honest picture. view of what happened in 1978. But there were also a number of scenes that I would have liked to see in Swindle (Fury being essentially a reissue of the same material). One of them was an animated Sid with Sid's voice; "You'll do betta wat'ch, okay, or I'll open it up" - a still appearing on the cover of the Something Else 7 inch - an excerpt has been shown in Fury, but I do not know. what context that appeared originally. Was it in the original copies, but removed after Sid's death? Was there more? Fury also highlighted the movie Who Killed Bambi, which would have been the fictional film of Hard Day's Night that McLaren originally intended to do. He played the role of Sting (!) As a member of a gay group from New Romantics and seemed really more fun than the scam. <br /> <br /> Sod Swindle, it's a scam. If you must, praise The Filth and The Fury and experience the failure of music as a changing controversy.
