I'm not surprised that this film was successful at the Hamptons Film Festival. It is a shallow film that would please the shallow people. Two actors pretending to be a relationship fighting and looking for a lost dog. The film would be exploring the dynamics of the relationship, but it is far too small to deserve such exploration. This couple has a dimension: they fight, they tease, then they make love and fight again. A brief moment of tenderness reveals no possible reason for these two people to be involved with each other because of their unstable and venomous relationship. Beautifully shot, excellent score, but without merit in the script or characters, this short film is just that.
