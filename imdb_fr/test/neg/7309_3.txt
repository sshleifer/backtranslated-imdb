The figure of the Empress Elisabeth of Austria (1837-1898) is in fact mainly associated with Romy Schneider and the Sissi trilogy of Ernst Marischka (1950s) where beauty, sweetness, sweetness but also history are always present. It was the Sissi, perhaps a myth for some; However, a powerful representation. The spirit of greatness of the Hapsburgs as well as the Bavarian spirit of simplicity and frankness have greatly influenced these films. Simply, they had a soul. However, Jean Daniel Verhaeghe's film, although realized 50 years later, seems to be a misrepresentation of the Empress and her life. It seems to be an attempt to show something different, to reveal a realism as a cure for sweetness; yet it is not a question of adding much, but rather of depriving the whole story of many. Let me analyze it in more detail. <br /> <br /> September 1898, Sissi embarks in the port of Geneva. Accompanied by her maid, she goes to visit Dr. Mayer (Didier Bezace) to whom she will tell the whole story of her life to find herself in this tragic life. The action consists of flashbacks on important moments in Sissi's life. However, these moments are presented in a chaotic manner and, therefore, a person unfamiliar with Austrian history can be totally misled or confused. Sissi's bad marriage with Emperor Franz Josef attracts a lot of attention. The scene of his wedding night is a failure. No one has treated an Empress of this kind (I speak of undressing and payment). Historically, the emphasis on Sissi's misunderstanding is right, however, the arguments that his views differ from those of other courtiers are not the real ones. Where is his desire for peace? Where is his love for his nation? Where is his charity? Sissi seems to be rather very elegant, modern, liberal (from the point of view of the 21st century). She is preoccupied above all with her appearance, which is not the case historically. Sissi had an inner life that is not shown in the film. "Once women wear pants" is a phrase said by her and happens to be in the image of the Sissi presented in the film. Sissi hates the monarchy, critical critic of the film vis-à-vis the Austrian empire. Moreover, she partially accepts the anarchist movements and, to my great surprise, she blames her husband, Emperor Franz Josef, for the death of their son, Rudolph. Where is it mentioned in the story that Sissi was present at Mayerling? Sissi's relationship with Sophie, the mother-in-law, is better shown, but the scene of her death seems barely authentic and the conversation a little cliche. <br /> <br /> Sorry to criticize as much but yet another crucial aspect of the film that I find weak here are performances. Even though Arielle Dombasle has her moments as Sissi, she does not usually fit the role. She is more like a "female fale" than a tragic empress. His makeup is seriously inaccurate as are most of his gestures like that of the Empress. Malik Zidi is a little better than Rudolph and can be considered as one who increases the value of performances in general. However, Stéphane Audran does not do a special job as Sophie: you just do not understand why she hates Sissi. She despised her for Sissi's young age when she was sacred, for her behavior, her lifestyle and her convictions. In part, it appears in the film, but that is certainly not enough. But the biggest mistake is, I think, Julien Hans Capua as Andrassi. Andrassi was a count with pride, honor, patriotism ... Here, he appears as a kind of libertine thinking only to make love with his queen. And the representation is so weak that this performance is very very pale. Tatyana Ivanova and Catherine Schratt are the choice. She perfectly matches the role with her appearance and gestures. But unfortunately, his role does not require much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> A good point of this film consists of costumes and quite authentic places. The port of Geneva is well presented and the moment of the death of Sissi seems to be a good surprise of the film. It does not seem like that. However, the moment is good from the symbolic point of view ... the Empress walks and ignores that it is her last moment. That's what she must have felt about it, that's how a foolish man has destroyed some of the greatness of the world. Sissi spoke in Corfu with her son Rudolph. But these moments are rare. <br /> <br /> In short, it's not a good movie. It distorts a very important historical figure, an important historical moment, it tries to cure the sweetness of the trilogy of Sissi but does not seem to offer anything creative. The charm is gone, the grandeur is gone and the story is ignored! Not really worth looking for! 3/10
