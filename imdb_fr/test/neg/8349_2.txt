As a geology student, this film illustrates Hollywood's ignorance. In the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside the burning house, it is less than a foot from the lava, whose average temperature is 1750 degrees Fahrenheit. We still see this stupidity when "Stan" will save subway 4. His shoes melt on the subway floor while the rest of the team stands a few steps from the lava that flows. And to finish this monstrosity of a film, they propose the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement rails. Earlier in the film, we hear a voice of reporters saying nothing can stop the flow of firefighters tried cars and CEMENT. Common sense dictates that this film is an absurd and rude euphemism for human knowledge.
