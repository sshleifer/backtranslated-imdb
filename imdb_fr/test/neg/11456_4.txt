This film is dated in many ways, it's sensational. You can laugh at it or clench your fists with anger. <br /> <br /> This film deals with many problems of American history, but typical white-male-Christian-American paternalism: the main character is these I-can-do-all-and-you -Do love me-for-this-kind-of-guy. He is so pompous and should not be taken seriously at any time. What a horrible creature! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the film and a character still very crying, but stronger at the end. Too bad she still forgives her arrogant manners after he left her for the second time. It's just sad that the character has not really changed at all. Although she is supposed to portray a strong and independent woman at the end, she worries about the worry her husband is in search of adventure. So 2 points out of 10 from feminists among us (and these are only good intentions ...)! The problem of repression by the Indians is treated fairly well, but there is once again this story of condescending stories. And the fact that all African-American characters are typical stereotypes makes the film even more hypocritical. I was so angry most of the time! So, a point (to try) of the civil rights movement. <br /> <br /> I know, that the film was shot at a different time. I love old movies and I have a lot of patience with some of these obsolete views. But it was disgusting! <br /> <br /> What saves this film are the parts without the main character. Mr. Dix's game is really exaggerated. Maybe that's why her character is so unpleasant ... I liked Ms. Dunne's performance, even though her character sometimes enraged me. <br /> <br /> But I must say that the famous stage of the race has been incredibly finished. And the way the Oklahoma colony was described made the film interesting. It's amazing how civilization was born from the dirt and dust of the 19th century. And I do not understand the problem that some have with this church scene. I thought it was pretty funny and fun. Maybe it was not supposed to be, but I liked it. So 9 points for these scenes and the awesome storytelling of Oklahoma state development. That's about 4 points in total!
