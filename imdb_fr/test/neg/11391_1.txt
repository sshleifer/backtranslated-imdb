This is a horrible remake of the French film Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario I can imagine in which someone (Sinise ?! Bates ?! Butler ?! What were they thinking!?!) Has he agreed to be associated with it is it that MacLaine sees the original, is rightly impressed and engages a friend (with no credits - or talent - in his name) to translate the themes to the American public - which they agreed they were stupid, stupid, stupid. Then she asked other friends to sign up, and they did so as friends - certainly not on the merits of this artificially artificial, pathetically constructed script, anything but the sink. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of French cinema, My Life in Rose is a subtle, thoughtful and inspiring treatment that deals with sensitive cultural issues. I would love it to be more widely available to the English-speaking public - and if that means an American overhaul, then so be it. But puh-leeze! a little respect for the problems and the intelligence of the audience - and a better direction for the actors, who did not seem to decide if they were working for Tennessee Williams or Jerry Lewis!
