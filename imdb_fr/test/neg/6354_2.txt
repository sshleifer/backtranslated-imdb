I will list them so that you can check them one by one: <br /> <br /> - The police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars of money and drugs hanging around without anything, for lack of evidence. Facilities. <br /> <br /> - When you get shot, you always growl in the same way and come back the same way, even if there is never a mark on your body. <br /> <br /> - Police are not able to identify the sound of gunshots and do not think there is suspicion when a phone call from a policewoman under cover when a high-level transaction between drugs and money is cut by this shot. <br /> <br /> - Armed bandits can hit the models at once, but not at 100 with a large, bulky martial artist. <br /> <br /> - If you launch a rocket launcher in a parking lot, the next three Cars in line will explode at 15-second intervals. <br /> <br /> - In addition to the last point, all cheap cars are always parked side by side. <br /> <br /> - The smoke that is caused by the firing of the rocket launcher is much larger th The amount of smoke caused by the explosion of four cars. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games have a considerable head start on everything other gaming companies can produce on five floppy disks. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are way ahead of anything other gaming companies can produce have graphics that look like Windows 3.1 screen savers. <br /> <br /> - Floppies can be read even <br /> <br /> - Half-drunk guys in bars look closely at the news when they are in the pub and have a thorough knowledge of the story American military, Agent Orange and the family trees of senior military officials. However, they can only express their points through seemingly derisory dialogues by people over the age of seven. <br /> <br /> - Although fights seem to be going off almost every hour in a bar, only one staff member pours beer and provides security. Of course, he knows the martial arts. <br /> <br /> - In just a few years, gold-medal Olympians are making the simple transition as leaders of software companies. <br /> <br /> - A woman who works for a computer game company knows everything about how to beat a game she has never played, continually marvels at her competitor's great games and can unveil facts and figures about her rivals - but she did not know they had gone beyond almost every other business. in the field of large corporate mergers. <br /> <br /> - The bad guys are still dying in slow motion. Always. <br /> <br /> - Brides tell their husbands that they are pregnant by shouting about the courage of their man who killed bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Wives perform a large part of the police work of their husbands; that could explain why she's complaining and complaining so much every time he has to go to work.
