I have no idea how accurate Flynn's performance is in this film, but even as a fiction, it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The scenario is omnipresent and leaves. you wonder how he went from one scene to another - you simply do not have the minimum information to keep continuity and understand his current situation, and it is difficult to understand the motivations of Flynn and other characters behind some of their behaviors. <Add to that a series of stupid and implausible situations and you have a film that appears as one of your dreams that seems to make sense while you sleep, but when you wake up and try to remember it. it's strange, disjointed and totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> There are many long and boring music sections of the film that are for me a bad direction or a bad director who tries not to be artistic. <br /> <br /> None of the characters is even friendly and the character Flynn falls on as a liar, thug, thief, thief, murderer, fighter, gigolo and imposter who wants to do everything and walk on who whether it is to advance his dreams, and despite everything, great opportunities seem to miraculously drop his knees. <br /> <br /> This film is neither entertaining nor satisfying, and from all points of view, even historically accurate, so why look at it? To paint the wound, the DVD had one of the worst transfers I've ever seen: it was not even in big screen or Dolby 5.1, it had a horrible telecine and many artifacts of what looked like a reel of film that had accumulated dust and scratches somewhere.
