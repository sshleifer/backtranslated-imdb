Christopher Lambert attracted me to this movie. Such a waste! The plot has more holes than my string vest, the special effects were not very good, it did not take a lot to figure out who the creature's mother was and the creature had more than a small debt to Predator. This anti-climate film could have been much better done. This raises an interesting point, however. When will Hollywood discover the rich vein of European folklore just waiting to be mined?
