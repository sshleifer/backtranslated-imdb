"On a clear day, you can see forever" is nothing more than a New Age update in the story of "Pygmalion" / "My Fair Lady": a teacher tries to turn an ordinary girl in a woman of high society. This time, however, instead of using language skills, the teacher tries to do so by hypnotism and regression in the past life. <br /> <br /> You know that a musical has problems when critics constantly mention sets and costumes before mentioning the plot and the music. The songs are instantly forgettable. (No "Bring me to church on time" here, I'm afraid.) And the plot is not going anywhere. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is no "there" here. The characters walk in the story without ever going from point A to point B. Professor Chabot repeatedly asserts that he will tackle the root of Daisy's troubles, but he never seems to do it. <br /> <br /> All sense. the conflict is avoided. For example, there comes a time when the University of Chabot demands that he stop his reincarnation research or resign from his position. Now there is conflict! Will he give up his career for Daisy? Alas! Nothing comes from this development. One or two scenes later, the university changes its mind and asks Chabot to continue his work. So much for the conflict. <br /> <br /> The talent was certainly gathered for this film: Directed by Vincente Minnelli. Written in part by Alan Jay Lerner. A cast of Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And, oh yes, with Barabara Striesand who was almost at his best at this stage of his career. <br /> <br /> But all this falls flat. Lerner's attempt to reincarnate his greatest success, "My Fair Lady," discussed above, is as doomed as Daisy's attempt to revive the grandeur of his own past. <br /> <br /> If you like musicals, much better choices than that.
