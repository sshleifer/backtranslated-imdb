This film was so bad If someone who plays in the movie reads this, including the director, I hate you! LOL, that blonde woman who was running away screaming through the forest. At least CRY RATHER THAT SCREAM AND KEEP DO DODGY BREATHE HEAVY !! and oh my god, if it's the director who tuned the camera's cameras, then go back to a normal job. Nobody wants to look at the chin of a frightened woman all this time. Damn, do not even think to rent / buy or even have a copy within 100 meters of your house as this can be harmful for those who like good movies ... When I came home, I thought that I rented a film pron by the acting and the style of the camera.
