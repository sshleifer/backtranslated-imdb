you know, I always want to see disturbing or strange films, especially when they are screened at the fantasy film festival in Hamburg, Germany. but unconscious cruelty was probably the worst film I saw this year. Does this comment contain spoilers? <br /> <br /> No, because I just did not understand this movie. but, what can you expect from a film presented to the festival audience "we all know you will not be able to watch this one all the way" ... <br /> <br /> I I love splashed movies and I also like movies with a strong graphic language. but this? there are many bloody scenes in this one, but why? what is the director trying to tell us? Does he say that we have lost all morality and religious feeling? or is he saying that incest will always end in disaster? who knows - I do not know <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that makes you think for a while, look at it. but do not expect to think "wow, I understood the message" - I did not understand it ...
