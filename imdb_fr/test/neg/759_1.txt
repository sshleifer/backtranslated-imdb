This movement is bad at so many levels that I do not even know where to start. OK - the good points - Peebles is gorgeous as a dirty black leather outlaw. Some of the landscape photographs were superb. It is more or less that. Oh, and it was a good idea to have the buffalo head over the bar door at Freemanville, I guess it was a nod to the Buffalo Soldiers. The film starts pretty well, but the characters are so flat, so funny, so "a lot", the bad guys are just above, I choke on trying to describe them more deeply. The Hispanic-Cuban-American War took place from 1895 to 1898 and America was involved only in April-August 1998. I think the film says it took place in 1893 (I could be wrong but I do not want to see him again to check). Much of this film depends on the murder of Jessie's dad by the KKK. Well, the original KKK was created in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871. The Klan was not even present during the filming period of this film. Of course, the naughty boys were busy again in 1915 and we know the rest. BUT for the purpose of the film, it is historically incorrect and it was an important part of the plot. I think I could go crazy going a lot further, so here are some shots and I'm done. I did not know that Boyz2Men and other bands like this one were inspired by street singers from New Orleans in the 1890s. Nor did I know that fetish collars were fashionable for Sioux women in the 1890s ... but I was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing acrylic nails ... We died laughing and I A waste of talent and money, it really did opportunity to show a part of American history that is not very well known. http://www.coax.net/people/lwf/bkcwboy2.htm For more information, it could have been so good but it was just ... bad from 1 to 10, it gives a 1 instead Zero because Mario is beautiful in his hat and there was a horse Appaloosa in the film.
