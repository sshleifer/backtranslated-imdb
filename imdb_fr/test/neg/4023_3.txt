The original story had all the ingredients to make a very striking movie. But in this version she failed miserably, for even Cherie Lunghi was a pale imitation of what she was going to be - so much so that I suspected she must be complicit to the end. Sherlock Holmes has been transformed into a warrior very different from anything Sir Arthur Conn Doyle suggests? In fact, it was Dr. Watson who showed the lack of common sense that it took. The black boots of the Andoman Islands seemed not to be able to get out of a paper bag and what the thief was doing tea to Baker Street for an outcome exceeded anything that the old Scotland Yard could have imagined. So record this TV movie at their black museum please.
