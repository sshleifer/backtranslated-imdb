The title comes from a passage in the Bible (Deut 28:28). Let's just say that the film is horribly out of context - but nevertheless, that's where the title of this scary movie comes from. The other reviews cover the details of the plot, so I will not come back. But the husband, who is a psychiatrist, gives a lecture on "the lower function" where he explains how a person can meet another person and live a "cataclysmic crisis" in his life, where she ceases to be a mistress of her. same and incapable. fair trial. He says that on the podium at the exact moment when he casts his eyes on Leonora Vail in the audience - the woman who will become his mistress. Not very subtle to show that this is going to happen to this poor man. <br /> <br /> I think the principle of the film is implausible and just does not work. Here is a psychiatrist out of the ordinary, and we must believe that this young and beautiful woman falls for him and is between the happiness shared by his wife and himself. What is even more implausible is how the betrayed woman reacts when she learns of infidelity. Not only does she understand, but she INSISTS her husband to take several months of vacation with the wanderer - "so we can all get some relief from this unbearable stress". LEAVE ME ALONE!! I wanted to reach across the screen and strangle not only adultery, but the weak-minded wife. <br /> <br /> The fact that the whole film unfolds like a flashback after having already revealed the end of the movie at the beginning (the fact that the husband had a terrible accident) - this leaves no doubt about the outcome of the sordid affair. I think it was a bad decision because it leaves absolutely no rebound of the plot to wait, because the entire movie is completely predictable. You already know the wife's resignation in the case at the beginning of the film, as she calls the mistress to the bedside of the dying person and expresses no ill-will toward her. <br /> <br /> Not only is the script defective, but Noel The coward is horribly miscast (even if it's her scenario). He and Leonora have absolutely no chemistry on the screen. It is interesting to note that Michael Redgrave was originally chosen in this role, but was replaced during filming. I wonder what it was? In the end, neither the husband nor the wife will cause you sympathy for one of them. I think Margaret Leighton played very well the role of strumpet. But she could not overcome all the disadvantages of this movie. In addition, as is the case of many British productions of this time, the dialogue is difficult to understand because of the fast speech pattern and cut actors. I saw it on TV and I could not even rely on captioning to fill the blanks for me. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this one.
