The media increasingly tends to denigrate and ridicule men. We see it in television commercials and program plots. Cheats are a good example. They could find a lot of cheats, but the vast majority of them are men. Why? The main threat to the power of any government lies in the male population, which is less likely to submit to authority and more of a threat to physical combat. One way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society via the media. Other examples of psychological propaganda include police crime series, including aggressive women with large jaws, accusing all people of their being in violation of their rights and giving them a sense of to be like crazy. In Australia, many male sports stars have been arrested recently for questionable aggression and drinking charges, another example of the government controlling the male population by arresting their heroes and asserting their dominance. Cheats, in addition to political machinations, constitute an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights, moreover, most of these women attack men! If that were the case, the men would be in prison! If it were an honest show, they would find cheaters, because they are not usually caught because their male lovers are rather happy not to be tied up and go out without making waves. The mistresses of men want men for themselves and want to own and control men and so catch men anyway.
