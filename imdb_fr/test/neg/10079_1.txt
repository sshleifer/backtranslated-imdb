It would probably be a good movie to see ... as long as you have seen all the other existing movies and have thoroughly explored the pimples of your belly and those around you. My God, this movie was incredibly tasteless, with some of the worst (or nonexistent) writings ever written on film. There is no saving grace to this film; even the animatronics are a little lame, and it's just a waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Run. Quick. It's beyond horrible. <br /> <br />
