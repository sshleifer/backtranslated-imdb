There were so many reasons why this movie could have been great. I will give you three. <br /> <br /> 1. Sienna Guillory. It's extremely hot in this movie and that's why I chose to watch it first. <br /> <br /> 2. Tim Curry. Incredible villain and I'm always excited to see it in movies (even in Home Alone 2). <br /> <br /> 3. Jason Donovan. For all Australians and Poms, it's a rare treat. The former 80's star of Neighbor, dressed in a dredge selling drugs. <br /> <br /> However, none of this and the fact that the movie is about drugs / rave culture have managed to make this movie even more interesting. The screenplay was monotonous, the performances ordinary and despite the scenes with J.D and all the scenes with Sienna, I found that everything in this movie was pretty. 3/10.
