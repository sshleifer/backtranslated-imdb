Really! Here, the French cinema is at the top, and compared to this one, the least attractive American horror movies for teens, like the "Friday the 13th", "Freddy" and his colleagues are masterpieces of the seventh art. <br /> <It's all the more annoying that there were exciting original elements: the BrocÃ©liande forest and its legends, the druids and King Arthur, all were splendid assets for a fantastic and horror film onirique.Alas! Filmed, as a user rightly pointed out in a false forest near Paris, the film is a false horror, a false Celtic story, false remains. You should see the teacher (Wilms who was a wonderful Mr. Le Quesnoy in "Life Is a Long Quiet River") is shouting for the "priceless debris" that the production probably bought in a penny shop - fake characters, fake Excavations ... <br /> <br /> Boys disguised as druids are unintentionally fun and girls who seem to be martial arts experts.And what can we say teachers? the monster? A child of ten years would write a better scenario than this grotesque farce.Think that people can spend money for such conduct when artists We are still waiting for a producer! <br /> <br /> Word to the wise: Maurice Leblanc wrote a a wonderful story about druids and old ceremonies in his Arsene Lupine saga entitled "The Thirty Coffins Island." A mini-series was made 30 years ago, avoid this waste "Broceliande" and try to see them in the ace.
