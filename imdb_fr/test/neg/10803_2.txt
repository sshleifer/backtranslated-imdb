The plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only "power star" if we can call it that consists of Joe Estevez. I do not know what is more shocking. The fact that this film was shot or the fact that some people have really made good comments. If you ever see the cover of the video, you will be able to read them. Someone even went so far as to say that the actress / screenwriter could be the mistress of the 90s. Yeah! And Joe Estevez could have more money than his brother Martin. If you still want to check it out, I highly recommend you to watch the MTS version. At least you'll laugh well without going crazy.
