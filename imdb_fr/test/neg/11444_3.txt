This film has it all: it's a thriller, a movie of pursuit, a story of romance, a crowd tale, a comedy, a road movie ... Well, in fact, it's nothing at all. <br /> <br /> As long as you wait for something interesting to happen, but no, you always look at the same dull, uninspiring and superficial shot of a movie with a very bad soundtrack. Even the distribution of actors lacks credibility. A hit man with its quirks, a girl who has trouble getting caught, guys from the underworld acting like hardcore and incompetent cops, yawn ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor, go see "The three burials of Melquiades Estrada" Tommy Lee Jones. Now, that's what I call it's worth watching
