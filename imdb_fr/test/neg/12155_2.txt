The worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months. The plot of the story was irrelevant, the film ended when it became Gingesh Khan, I always thought that something really interesting was going on afterwards. I knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the film was shot had beautiful landscapes, but the film did not benefit. The jokes were really poor. The narrator, Gingesh himself, could have said a little more about history, traditions, etc. Mongolian. My co-spectator did not know, so he was a little lost. I could not wait to see this movie but I was really disappointed after all. It was one of the three movies I've ever seen at the movies where I planned to leave before the end.
