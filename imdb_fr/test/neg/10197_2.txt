To say that this film is a "Sunday school" can be generous, because even as a Christian, I found the religious message so one-dimensional that I would not want to see it in my church. The message is: "Read your Bible, go to church and sign up for a fire insurance, so as not to be left behind by the kidnapping." There was no love. I imagine that in the end, I do not believe in the god described in this film. Count Dracula was supposed to have all the spiritual answers. <br /> <br /> Aside from the spiritual / religious element, the script was tedious - repeating the same thing over and over again. It could have compensated for some of the acting, which was unable to produce a compelling reply the first time, so they just repeated the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> I liked the final scenes. . I thought it made a point without hitting anyone or leaning on a Sunday school formula. The movie was not so bad, but most of the time. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of cleaner, well-made films that present the truth in a non-preaching way. He was not one of those, I'm sorry to say. I took my family to see this film, wanting to support this kind of film. Now, I would like to get my money back.
