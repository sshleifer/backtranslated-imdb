Michael Myers, the disturbed and not-so-young psycho, who seems to be getting stronger and stronger, has been resurrected by his fellow Druids to annihilate more and more family members, as well as those who hinder. The gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy number of people. Michael, who initially preferred chokes and kitchen knives, learns how to handle an ax and how to use all the means necessary to vex his victims. The result is a horrendous, mosaic film on a dollar store, virtually without the help of some really scary footage. Donald Pleasance, who died shortly after the production, seems to have been injected into this story just so that * someone * can be introduced as the star. You will not want to cover your eyes with this one, but you'll shake your head as you slide down John Carpenter's classic creation.
