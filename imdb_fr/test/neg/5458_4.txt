I am shocked that all the "hated" ratings are six and seven, still above average. For me, this seems to be a case of "the emperor has no clothes". I understand that this film was produced with a very small budget in the early 70s ... Anyway, it has become difficult to look in the face. The DVD I saw had subtitles, but about 75% of the speech is not subtitled. Some are difficult to understand. The Jamaican patois was cool to hear, but you have a hard time not to log out after a while. Some of the shots were nice and the realism was there, even if some performances were not great (Jimmy Cliff did a good job) The plot is not bad, but quite predictable. In the 1:43 movie, the highlights are Jimmy Cliff (Ivan) singing for a scene, and a few shots on goal and a fight. Probably 15 minutes or so The rest is pretty boring. By the way, towards the beginning of the film, there are strange cuts with Ivan's character that look like a montage error, which made me laugh a little. One critic stated that this film was cut so many times that there were few copies of the original theatrical version of 1972. The end was quite interesting, showing how media from an early age influence people. It could also be a general comment on the influence of the white man / colonialism on Jamaica. The other main themes are poverty, corruption, church, ambitions ... In conclusion, the soundtrack is really worth it, the film much less.
