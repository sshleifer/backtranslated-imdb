This film was a weak point for Jason Robards and Sam Peckinpah. The main points of the plot are drawn directly from Sergio Leone's masterpiece "Once upon a time in the West" (published two years earlier and also featuring Robards): a man discovers a drinking trough is in the desert, constituting the only water to many In all directions, he plans to build a "station" around the hole and, to ensure that there is a love interest, he falls in love with a prostitute . Add to this a weathered preacher, bad music, quick and stupid action scenes, even silly shots - and you're done. There is little question of why this failed at the box office. The real question is "how could this go so far?"
