I thought this film had an interesting name and might have provoked thought, but I was wrong. This movie was boring, especially at the beginning and the middle. I can not comment on the end because I could not stand watching the whole movie. Recruiting a researcher simply because he or she enters your lab makes no sense. This student had a kind of interesting moving robot in his apartment and, unfortunately, this non-living is more interesting than the characters in this movie. So, if you have sleep problems, I recommend you rent this movie.
