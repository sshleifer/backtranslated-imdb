Again not serious enough to make it pleasant. In fact, this one is just boring. It's pretty well done, even if the script is bad, the effects are OK and the average of the actors. (Except James Mason who is still excellent, but in this one under-used) <br /> <br /> I guess it's hard to write anything about this movie because it did not elicit any reaction in me. dull, dull, dull, dull, dull.
