Years ago, Sara, a young girl, witnessed the murder of her parents. Today, as an adult, she suffers from a variety of mental illnesses (did I mention she had an imaginary friend?), But rather a sense of drowsiness. Mortally boring, I struggled to sit because I could feel my eyelids become heavier with each endless minute of cries without thought and supposed "mystery". Does Sara go crazy? or is it the paranormal? A better question would be, who cares? And the answer to that, nobody. Nobody at all. Ignore this movie, save time that suits you better for other more useful tasks. <br /> <br /> My note: D-
