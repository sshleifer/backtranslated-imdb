My parents may appreciate this show, but I can not seem to find humor. What's so funny about the fact that a dentist's husband impregnates his assistant hygienist and that his eldest daughter is imbued with the captain of the high school football team? Absolutely nothing! It sometimes shocks me to see what people think of today as humor. Blame it on shows like "The Dating Game" and "The Newlywed Game", which put the sex issue in the foreground in the mid-1960s. Of course, the series has its most touching moments, this is still not an excuse for the content that would otherwise have been incorporated into this series. It does not look like the family days of "I Love Lucy" five decades ago. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons this show airs on the Lifetime cable channel is that people in this channel think women can relate to the character of Reba! I absolutely do not like the character of Kyra, the daughter of Reba Hart. She is described as a teenager ditsy and bitter! It's funny, I wonder if the actress who played Kyra; Scarlett Pomers, is like that in real life far from acting. Whoever plays the ex-husband dentist, Christopher Rich, is hardly better. Barbara Jean, played by Melissa Peterman, is ditsy in herself! The characters of Van and Cheyenne are also very annoying. <br /> <br /> Another puzzling element is why the creator of the show, Allison M. Gibson, decided to set the show where I live. 25 miles away; Houston, Texas! Reba McEntire is not even from this state, it's an Oklahoman! Why for a season or more have they decided to make the music sound like a sniffing pig? What I mean by that is that we hear this baritone saxophone played with a drums accompanying it, but the melodies are basically without agreement!
