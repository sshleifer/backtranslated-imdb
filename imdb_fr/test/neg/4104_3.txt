I do not want to sound like an undesirable sport, but if the accidental death of a butterfly by a time traveler had caused such a huge change in the timeline, how could that be since the butterfly would have been cremated? by the pyroclastic explosion of the erupting volcano anyway? And how could temporal travelers continue to return to the same moments and not continue to meet before and after themselves, who were also at the same minutes in the timeline? It seems that there would have been a large crowd standing in front of this dinosaur load. Although I can accept the idea of ​​a time wave, I doubt that this wave would have caused a few changes. As the wave passed, all the changes that would have occurred would have occurred at the same time during the passage of this wave. So, scratch the idea that the city is starting to be invaded by the jungle. And why the jungle? The location of the city would have always been at the latitude and longitude it was before and it would have had a vegetation appropriate to its geographical location on Earth. <br /> <br /> And an endless list of other illogical inanities. <Br /> <br /> Bwahahaha! This film is a strange combination of fairly decent production values, totally ridiculous plot holes and factual errors. <br /> <br /> Too bad. A fantastic idea that was botched by a silly science. <br /> <br /> Sigh ... why, why, why, why? Why spend all that money on production and not even bother reading the script again to see if it made any sense?
