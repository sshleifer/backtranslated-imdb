The series does not start because it means to continue. Although its first two seasons are filled with incredibly average episodes, as well as many failures, the pace is accelerating and one of the most beautiful operas of space is born. The first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation is remarkable for two reasons: an extremely pleasant presentation of all the main actors and the special emphasis of Marina Sirtis, which will disappear thereafter. Seeing how everything started is very satisfying, and seen in the spirit of the rest of the series, rather moving. Otherwise, this is a very poor episode featuring Q and some giant jellyfish. It is true.
