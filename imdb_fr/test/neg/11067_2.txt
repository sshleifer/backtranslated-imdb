It's been a long time since I've had such a good laugh - nor have I seen such an ineffably realized film! It's so bad that it made me laugh! <br /> <br /> First of all, I estimate that for about 40% of the duration of the film, I can not say what was happening, or even what I saw. I can only describe the work of the camera as a frantic encounter with LSD. There are whole segments, minutes, where all you can see are fuzzy lightning and fragments of cave wall, people and various other unidentifiable objects. I spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what was happening, but they could not follow him better than me. <br /> <br /> Then there are the "black" moments, in which we try to scare ourselves (woooooooo) everyone turns off and the screen goes black - and I'm not just talking about a few seconds. I think the longer one lasted almost two minutes. I guess a blank movie is a way to reduce costs ... <br /> <br /> I suspect that the "director" recently read a book about all the "must-haves" to make a horror movie and decided to run them all - about 20 times each. <br /> <br /> There are three positives in this movie: 1 / It's short at 90 minutes (although there is still an hour and a half too much!) 2 / All the characters are dying ( after all, it is impossible to worry about it). 3 / There was really a good scene - when the group looked in the well, it came down, after discovering that its rope had fallen to the bottom (I saw THAT), a big rock is pushed through the opening to lock them up. I WASN I did not expect it and it was really scary. <br /> <br /> And the scenes of the early campfire with shooting, after shooting, after panoramic shot from the camp lights. I swear that the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure that after the first kill, the exact same blood sequence on the floor of the cave is used twice about 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a CRAP film. I will look at almost anything, but it is close to where I would draw the line.
