I did not like looking at DS9 compared to other Star Treks, even Enterprise, but I did not like Babylon 5, and now I know why. They are the same show. I just read the old story that Paramount stole the idea from the creator of Babylon 5, but they chose not to sue for a reason that I do not know or that bothers me, but like a Star series Trek is based on another I will condemn anyone who will even mention the DS9 when talking about the series. Original, TNG and Voyager are my favorites in this order. Before, I did not understand why everyone found the DS9 great and I did not do it, but I know. It's also because the captain has a real anger problem, and I hate people who act cool but panic, who come out of nowhere; and he seems to each episode.
