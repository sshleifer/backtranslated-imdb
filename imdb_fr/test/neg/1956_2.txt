Jack Frost 2 is out of the question, I'm actually surprised that people are allowed to do this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> While Sam and his wife go to the Tropicana for a relaxing Christmas, Jack returns to kill Take time to have fun and take revenge with consanguinity ... <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by this movie, most people say it's a laugh with your friends, but frankly it's a waste of time. If the people who made this film can get a job doing what they do, they can at least take the time and effort to write a better story, especially the names of the nerdy characters.
