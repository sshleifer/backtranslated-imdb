This Spanish-Italian co-production tells an interesting and strange story about Dr. Bannister, a woman who not only has the best years behind her, but also a marked face that makes her look like a monster. But in Madrid, a professor she knows has conducted experiments on animals with a substance that regenerates cells. The experiments were successful, but the animals became aggressive. Because the professor will not allow Dr. Bannister to be the first human guinea pig, she kills him and consumes the substance. She becomes a beautiful young woman, but also a vicious killer when it comes to keeping her secret secret. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is very entertaining, but Piero Vivarelli had neither the skills nor the money to win a cool movie out of it. In addition, the film becomes boring after a good start and fails to regain a fast pace, even if the film duration does not exceed 83 minutes. And while the scenery changes for the Swiss city of Geneva for the last third of the film, it sometimes even looks like a holiday movie because we see how good Geneva is (which is indeed the case), but it does help nothing to advance the plot. ..). Thus, with a more talented director, better actors and a larger budget, "Satanik" could have become an obscure Italian classic. But in the current state of things, it's just a dull and boring crime movie that's not worth looking for. Rating: 3 out of 10
