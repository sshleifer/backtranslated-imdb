Is it possible that a movie is worse than that? There is a group of monkeys who wander, mumbling b ******, acting so-called stupid and we are supposed to laugh There is no plot here to keep you in the first place. Even when women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most awaited things happen and at the end of the movie, you may be well asleep. Warning: this is not a trash cult movie, it's sad - period! I can not believe there is even a sequel to that! <br /> <br /> 1
