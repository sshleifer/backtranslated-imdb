Los Angeles, 1976. Independent film John Carpenter, fresh out of a film school and having a movie - Dark Spoof of 2001, his class project, entitled Dark Star - - to his credit, ends an action film called Assault On the Precinct 13. The story of an almost deserted police station besieged by an invisible gang in Los Angeles, it was a minor hit on the drive-ins circuit and garnered praise from some critics are interested in this project, but that did not ignite the world of the film, contrary to what followed Carpenter-up smash Halloween (1978). In Precinct, Carpenter was still learning how to exploit his almost non-existent budget by appealing to smaller players, keeping the action in an extremely small place and moving the film at a tight pace with a combination of editing and smart camera . Work and be connected to the genre. <br /> <br /> Nobody wants or needs to be hungry in Hollywood, especially if the bill for the week for the restoration of the 2005 version of Assault On Precinct 13 exceeds the total cost of the original. This translates into a certain kind of laziness on the part of a filmmaker: you have an incredibly large team of unionists, a studio and a marketing company who think for you. That's why, twenty years after watching Carpenter's movie, I can still see every glorious moment, from the cold-blooded little girl buying an ice cream, to the percussive synth score. One week after Assault 2005, I remember Larry Fishburne's still eyes and his ping-pong ball. <br /> <br /> "Actiongon of unforgettable popcorn" is perfect for the top of the poster. It's New Year's Eve at Cité 13, a closed resort with a skeletal staff to see in its last hours. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), an ex-narc now deeply troubled and jumping on Jack Daniels and Seconol after his partners have been frosted in the opening scene, will be on call; Iris (The Drea of ​​Matteo of the Sopranos), a nympho adept of the criminals, and Jasper (Brian Dennehy), an old crusteux close to the retreat. As in Carpenter's Assault ..., a bus carrying four heavy truck criminals is redirected to the City. Fishburne, who nearly survived the assassination attempt on an undercover police officer who plans to silence endemic corruption in the organized crime unit led by Marcus Duvall (a tired Gabriel Byrne). Soon, phones are cut, power lines are cut off and police and police find themselves heavily armed with a serious, paranoid police arsenal as they wage war against a working group of corrupt cops Duvall wearing white balaclavas, bulletproof vests, red bazookas and more high tech equipment than the Skywalker Ranch. It is expected that while the helicopters whistle around the top of the police station firing rockets at the windows, it is a covert operation to cover the tracks of Duvall. He could just as easily have left advertising billboards on Hollywood Boulevard. <br /> <br /> As in the case of the recent Seventies remix, Dawn Of The Dead, Assault 2005 takes up the basic elements of John Carpenter's script and, to quote the Seventies, "does his own thing, guy". The main question is: why bother? In 1976, John Carpenter is a favorite of genre lovers, but he is barely mentioned in the collective consciousness of the public. Carpenter himself was busy reworking Howard Hawks' Western Rio Bravo classic into a tight, claustrophobic urban thriller for only $ 20,000. Wunderkind's French director and rap producer, Jean-François Richet, supposedly a fan of John Carpenter's work, seems less anxious to pay homage to Hawks or JC - although the screenplay is peppered with references to cowboys and injuns - and seems to want to use as much hitting power and flash as the multi-million dollar budget can withstand. The result: moments of tension with portable POV cameras, an unexpected (and bloody) number of bodies, some interesting twists, but essentially a class B urban actor at an exaggerated price. With regard to Carpenter, the name verifier is a pure vanity on the part of the filmmakers that is not bearing fruit. <br /> <br /> To Mr. Richet, I say good trip and I wish you good luck in your musical career.
