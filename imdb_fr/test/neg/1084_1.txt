I repeat ... one of the worst films of all time and it was directed by the director who directed one of my favorite movies: "Excalibur". I was upset to see that he scored more than six. This film is nil. It looked terrible. It looked like the filming was in 18 days and Boorman had to sleep when he directed it. Arquette did nothing. Simply terrible, rotten, unbearable and probably the only flaw of the famous Boorman career. <br /> <br /> 1/10 !!!!!
