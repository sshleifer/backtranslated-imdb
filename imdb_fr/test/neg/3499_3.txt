The crash is overloaded, over thoughtful and overcooked. A good example of how to make a pompous and important movie with a message. Haggis strives too much to assert his point of view and exceeds all categories of the film. He feels very much in love with his own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer. Of course, race relations affect everyone and the problem is very ambiguous, but the world of "Crash" suggests that we are all victims of our own perceptions about race. It is a tedious thread that repeats ad nauseum and wears out of its reception in the first 30 minutes. I found the characters' results unsurprised and forced and the film took forever to die of chaos. The fact that this film is one of the top 50 films on IMDb shows the desire of the public to be sucked by Hollywood malarkey. <br /> <br /> Indeed, if you want the real "Crash", go see one of David Cronenberg: dark, crooked and original. This film plays as a predator, boring and masochistic.
