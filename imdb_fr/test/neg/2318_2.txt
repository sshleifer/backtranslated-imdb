Although I am sure that the idea looked good on paper, and that I appealed to me as soon as I heard about it for the first time, this film often trembles and falls flat, and when I look, I just want it to end. The beginning and the end of the book on the film where Lou is forced to watch a troublemaker is at best artificial, although I found that the role of the great policeman was humorous. However, I found little to laugh with the bottom of the canon script that was cast together for these two great comics. I thought it was a mistake to put them in a musical and it stinks of the "Wizard of Oz" scam (with the songs and the black and white format in color). I would not recommend this film to anyone, but to A & C fanatics. All others will be disappointed and they will have many better movies.
