For me, this film is simply a very lame teenage party movie with all the usual clich√©s and boring stereotypical characters (Nerds, Jocks, Popular Girls, Sleezy Gars, etc.) but with an underlying anti-drug theme / alcohol. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the unfortunate chance to see this movie, keep an eye on all references to responsibility and keep it real (do not know how to say it otherwise). I guess the only thing that would make this movie cool, would be if they play on TV it was on fire. This DVD or DVD has exploded ... <br /> <br /> 1 of 10000 - Watch Animal House instead.
