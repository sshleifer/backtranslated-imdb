I decided to watch this movie because it was called "the scariest movie of all time" so that's what I expected. Unfortunately, what I discovered is that the movie did not have a single scary moment (and I am the kind of person who jumps very easily). The film was just terrible pictures and every time there was a jump moment, it was incredibly obvious. The benefits of this film would be the music and the strange scene that was filmed well (like the very last scene when she opens the door and you see Tun in the reflection and that the film comes back to him, you see the ghost on his shoulders ). Overall, this film adds nothing new to the J-Horror genre and lacks creativity and fears.
