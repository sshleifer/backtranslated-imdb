I could not do anything about this terrible film noir. <br /> <br /> The plot was confused, the acting was good, but the quality of the picture was terrible! Although I bought it at Walmart's "Double Pack Gansters" (8 films on two discs) for $ 5.50 and you insert the DVD, it apologizes for the terrible picture quality that some movies may have. <br /> <The plot was rocking everywhere I could not understand it and I had no idea what was going on ... then "The End" appeared and the movie was over. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time! <br /> <br /> I tell you not to waste your money or time on this! Or if you bought this Double Pack Gansters, just skip this one ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
