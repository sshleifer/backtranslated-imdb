I know that I loved this movie when I was 12-14 years old. Now that I'm 24, I looked at it again and wish I did not do it. Because all the things I laughed at when I was younger, it's not funny anymore. it is therefore an hour and a half without amusement. For me, the jokes were lame, not funny or just too childish. So, the same thing that I liked in the movie when I was a kid, now is the things I do not like about it. In addition to not being funny, it is not at all credible. The bad character is very badly done but I guess that's the kind of movie he is. And the last 20 minutes of the movie are pretty lame with bad fight sequences and so on ... But if you're young, you'll probably love it. I rate this movie 4/10
