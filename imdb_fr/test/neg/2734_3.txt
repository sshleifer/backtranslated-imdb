The script seems to have been fat (ahem ahem, cough, cough) "borrowed" from some other movie involving the use of a self-propelled drilling machine. Scene by scene, the two films were almost identical. Just enough serial numbers archived in this one to prevent legal action for copyright infringement. <br /> <br /> But other than that, I must say that I found it a little fun, because I take advantage of the depth of the underground world. kind of movies. It's a little silly from the scientific point of view, but if you're ready to squint and pretend you have not noticed this scientific goof here or there and everywhere, this film is almost bearable. Much better than "Supernova" which was another film in which Luke Perry had a lead role. It was so stupid, stupid, stupid, that nothing could save him. Note to directors: Employ someone who knows the subject of the film. That would only be a very small part of the film's budget, but it would generally help to stop your audience from taunting you for doing silly science. <br /> <br /> Values ​​of production: almost passable. I have seen much worse of my time. <br /> <br /> A new thought for disaster movies: instead of always having a happy ending where the world is saved again, how about some places where things are a tad one little more realistic, where sometimes even the best efforts still lead to failure. Especially when the problem to be solved was caused in the first place by pure stupidity. Catastrophic disaster films with rave and comforting endings somehow justify stupidity by stating, "Even if a problem is terrible, it can be corrected." Which is certainly not the case. A film about an auto-caused disaster with an unfortunate end would be more useful as a cautionary tale: "Do not be so stupid at first." Should you watch this movie? If you are bored and have already seen everything else in the scifi section of your local video rental store, of course, why not. But avoid "Supernova" because I can assure you that you do not get bored. It was certainly not one of Luke Perry's best movies. This one is better. It's little, but it's better. <br /> <br /> A dead hoof to be a deeply underground genre movie. A hoof dead for viciously stealing the scenario of another film of the same kind.
