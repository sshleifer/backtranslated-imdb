Horrible, horrible, horrible show. The problems of the "real world" dealt with flagrant non-originality. Stereotypes galore. What is happening with the eyebrows of African-Americans (blacks!)? Tyrone power! Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible sight. The fact that it lasted three seasons is a mistrust. This show is really a pleasure for critics of mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Saved by the bell seemed almost humorous compared to that. Well, with hindsight, no. It is of the same mundane kind and therefore also devoid of intelligence. The only thing missing so far is the message of Jesus, it's God. The mentality and deliverance are the same, but somehow feels bad and soulless. You can almost hear the TV execs emit buzzwords. In fact, I felt so furious about this excrement that I felt obliged to comment. <br /> <br /> Horrible, horrible, horrible show.
