... a good scenario or a good director could not solve the problem. <br /> <br /> The original "Poseidon Adventure" was a story of human courage triumphing over terrible difficulties and personal tragedy. The survivors were led by a charismatic figure of great spiritual strength who would seize all that God would throw at him. <br /> <br /> The tracking attempts to recreate the mix, but fails through a script and pedestrian direction. Irwin Allen may have been a major producer of disastrous film films and directed the action scenes very well in 'Towering Inferno', but he simply can not bring human depth to his characters. If the characters are not credible, any danger they face also falls flat. <br /> <br /> The script also tries to copy the original too obviously. So we have Peter Boyle doing the trick of Ernest Borgnine being hard and obnoxious (but he has a tender heart); Karl Malden is the moderating influence of red pimples (and is in terminal phase for good measure); Slim Pickens brings comical relief to Shelley Winters, and so on. <br /> <br /> To make the story more contemporary, we have a dealer of malicious weapons about to whip plutonium of military quality to the highest bidder. A really nasty job that mercilessly abandons injured men (the actors who play his henchmen were probably paid in supplements because they do not seem to have lines) and a woman who shot in the back - what a cadou ! Thank God, the French rescue services dug the hole in Poseidon's hull twice as big as in 1972 (and on the other side of the propeller shaft) so he could get his goods out. And while we're on the subject, how could they bring the crates * to * oh, forget that. <br /> <br /> In fact, I paid a lot of money to see it when it was released. Given the film's current reputation, this may sound odd, but it actually received mixed reviews at the time. Some said it was junk food, others said it was as exciting as the original. Never mind, no one can be right all the time.
