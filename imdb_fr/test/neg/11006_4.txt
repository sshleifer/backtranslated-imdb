Shakespeare in Love's director John Madden delivers another very bad movie in Ethan Frome. The plot centers on the arrival of a new Reverend in the city of Starkfield, where he learns the story of the sick wife of the crippled local man, Ethan Frome, and a romantic rendezvous with the maid. Adapted by Richard Nelson from the Pulitzer Prize novelist Edith Wharton's novel, this film is not interesting, because of an extremely disappointing scenario and a mediocre staging that transforms supposedly poignant scenes in laughable schmaltz. Nevertheless, there are other aspects outside the film that work: the cinematography is well done, Rachel Portman contributes a beautiful score and, although no one is at its best, Liam Neeson, Joan Allen, Patricia Arquette and Tate Donovan work well. their roles. But all in all, Ethan Frome is only marginally worth and is easily forgotten.
