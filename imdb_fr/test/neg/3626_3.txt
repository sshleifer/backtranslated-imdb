Okay people, I agree with the critics of almost everyone here. Characters. Are. Stupid. They are all stereotyped, and yet they have nice clothes and are always skinny. <br /> <br /> Do not even tell me about Jamie Lynn's role as ZOEY. Zoey is a pretty young tanned blonde that everyone loves! She has a "rebellious" personality, great, with which everyone agrees, as stupid or extreme as it is. The most annoying of all: his voice is so damn hot and obnoxious. "OMG!" <br /> <br /> Take for example the first episode. By the time she arrives on the huge PCA campus, everyone seems to like her. The boys want to invite him out, the girls want to be his friend, etc. Thinking it's all that, the episode is played, Zoey still being the center of attention; She's the so-called best female player on the unofficial women's basketball team, confident, and she's the plaintiff when she gets hit on the face. Oh boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> My favorite character is by far all this series is a girl who appears much later in the series, Lauren or something, who is the ONLY person to have been featured in the series to hate Zoey. . <br /> <br /> And Zoey does not even sometimes seem to be very loyal to her friends. In one episode, she even calls her friend a monster without ever apologizing and shows no regret in doing so. <br /> <br /> Zoey is ALWAYS the best: <br /> <br /> -Desiging professional T-shirts and backpacks (which become a real success) <br /> <br /> -dock up VERY elaborate formulas by HERSELF to teach a lesson to one person. <br /> <br /> -Full notes <br /> <br /> -Access things that did not even concern her, so that everyone can be happy. <br /> <br /> - Coming with an advertisement that was so good that it was broadcast on television. The list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Ugh. She has no acting talent. She is always the perfect person. She acts rebellious and rebellious and preppy and ... UGH! I can not stand it. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but everyone in the series always has beautiful clothes. EVEN NERD! Her wardrobe is better than mine and mine is pretty decent. <br /> <br /> Nobody cares whether everyone at PCA loves you, Zoey, and would do anything for you, even if it meant giving the right arm. <br /> <br /> BUT whatever these cardboard characters are, the graphs are creative. Not everyday things. They are interesting and fun. Humor is usually fun and fun, but the characters are so much paper that it's hard to enjoy. <br /> <br /> This show would be really good if Dan Schnieder took a little longer to think about the guy. characters that he wanted, because they are so typical, so boring that it's lame and stupid. <br /> <br /> Point: Nobody has any overweight, everyone has stylish clothes, Zoey is Mary-sue's definition, the scenarios are well thought out and the humor is laughable. But again, I want to emphasize that the characters stain the show. Watch the show if you must, but do not say I did not warn you if your eyes were bleeding.
