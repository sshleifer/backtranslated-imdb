G & M created a strange couple down in Man About the House and then entertained the nation in his own sitcom. <br /> <br /> What was the small-scale personal charm typical of couples' chemistry on the small screen G & M's move to the big screen was as appalling as Morcombe and Wise de Genuis and innumerable quality television. <br /> <br /> Unfunny. Unsatisfactory and depicting a patient, Yootha Joyce, who died before the movie was released.
