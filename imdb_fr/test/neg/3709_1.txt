ZERO stars of **** <br /> <br /> Endless Descent has absolutely no reductive value, be it ridiculously bad play, ridiculously terrible special effects, incompetent direction, stupid storyline or musical enervating. Goal. This is the kind of pitiful production that makes me wonder how a film like this one could even have the slightest consideration of being greeted by a studio. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'm going to plunge into the plot other than to say that this is a group of people who are trapped underwater and have to kill a lot of fake pretend creatures. <br /> <br /> Let me go into more detail about what is so horrible about this movie. First of all, the acting is simply dreadful. Jack Scalia is ten times worse than Sylvester Stallone, a feat quite difficult to accomplish. Support performance is not really better. And what is with the actor Luis Lorenzo, the guy who plays the cook, Francisco. He has a high-pitched voice and an accent that suits a comedy, not a sci-fi horror film. <br /> <br /> The special effects are even worse. The creatures range from eels of strange appearance to giant starfish and "most mosquitoes". The effects look like something you would see in a muppet movie, and I do not think I need to go further in this issue. <br /> <br /> Director JP Simon has a slightly cult status because of all the terrible films he has made. I'm sure some people will appreciate Endless Descent in the same way as Ed Wood, but I do not even think it's a good solution. All he does is poor quality, especially the camera. Man can not make a movie, that's all. <br /> <br /> It was the last of the four underwater films, and it's really good Leviathan and Deep Star Six (The two bad movies in their movie). to begin to appear masterful in comparison. Anyway, stay with the Abyss.
