Having already seen the original "Jack Frost", I never thought that "Jack Frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. Boy I was wrong! Once again, A-PIX movies have a way of showing incredibly bad content, even worse than you might expect. I think this is the first sequel to A-PIX, and that may give some idea of ​​what to expect in the future: more A-PIX sequels. <br /> <br /> It's hard to look at this without laughing, especially during the movie. The following parts of the film, in which Jack Frost's offspring (which consists essentially of snowballs with eyes, arms, mouth and sharp teeth) start killing people with typical comic dialogue and ridiculous voices who accompany him. We show them both as puppets (with a stick below to move them) and as computer animations, which, I must say, is very cheesy. The computer animation surprised me, because the first "Jack Frost" had no effect of this type. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend you to see the original "Jack Frost" before seeing this one (the two would be better to watch with a group of friends) to have the total fun, and because it would make more sense ("meaning" being a relative term). <br /> <br /> Now only if there was "Uncle Sam 2" ...
