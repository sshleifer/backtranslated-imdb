What was Wes thinking about doing this dribble? He does not fit well with any of his other works, but again, he seemed to fall into a slight slump after making A Nightmare On Elm Street. This is seen in his follow-up 1.Invatation to Hell 2.Chill 3.Hills Have Eyes II 4.Deadly Friend 5.Serpant and the Rainbow the stairs that he resumed his momentum and started to hit again. Chiller himself has none of the regulars in Craven and none of his suspense. The only good scene in which the old man has a heart attack on the stairs after engraving gravel for his work.
