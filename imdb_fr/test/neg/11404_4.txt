From 2002, Dutch cinema has finally improved. This film is still part and is an example of the bad period of Dutch cinema in textbooks. <br /> <br /> The story is unnecessarily told in a flashback style. All the "present" sequences that take place in France are completely redundant and add nothing to history, emotions or power. For some reason, European filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story in a non-chronological way. I never understood why or how attractive it is. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also not the greatest of things. It is not always clear that the film is trying to go and what it is trying to tell. The story of an inexperienced boy falling in love with a wild girl, who later turns out to be quite psychotic, may seem pretty good on paper and even shows a few parallels to Paul Verhoeven's "Fruit Turks", which film has often been compared before and at the time of its release. However, the end result is far from comparable. The story fails to capture the good emotions, which is also due to the unimaginative performances of the actors. The way the story is told also makes the film far from always interesting or compelling. I lost interest in this film after about 40 minutes. <br /> <br /> At the time of filming, Antonie Kamerling and Angela Schijf were both promising stars with potential and ambitions have pretty much dried up now. Angela Schijf seems to be paying more attention to her family than her career (that's not a bad thing of course), while Antonie Kamerling is trying to start a career in Hollywood. He never went beyond playing small roles in 2 flops Renny Harlin. To be honest, I'm not surprised. It's not that he's a bad actor and he certainly has the right look, but his English is not good enough, to put it mildly. Listen to him, he speaks English at the beginning of this film and you will understand what I mean. These are really not bad actors, but for some reason, it does not show in this movie. It's probably also because of the bad dialogue. I have always loved Beau van Erven Dorens. He has been much criticized but his game seems very natural. He always keeps the characters close to what he is. <br /> <br /> This is by no means one of the worst films of all time, but I would not recommend it either. Bad and irrelevant stories make this movie a bad movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
