It is difficult to write 10 lines of text on this film noir. There is not much to say about it. It's not memorable enough to add to your collection and I have a considerable number of blacks. <br /> <br /> Paul Henreid plays a tough guy here. I do not think he's able to play that kind of role, but that's no problem. Anyway, he's a good actor. <br /> <br /> Everything is good, including cinematography, but not memorable. One thing that stood out: the abrupt end. It was a surprise. It was also a surprise to see this under the title "Hollow Triumph". I have never seen the movie called this. It has always been called "Scar". <br /> <br /> If you read about a "black film", etc., do not believe it. "Tens" is not a precise adjective for this film.
