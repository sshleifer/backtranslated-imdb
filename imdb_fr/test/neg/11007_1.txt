The film interpretation of Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton by John Madden is far from doing justice to a great literary work. As long as the story is kept, the elements that give the new soul are scrambled and are lost in the movie. Madden fails to convey the innocence and the general tragedy of the relationship between Ethan and Mattie turns it into a story of morality. The mark is missed and the point is lost in the added details and the mediocre dialogue. Zeena (Zenobia) in the book is almost completely the antagonist, the least sympathetic figure of the book, where in the film, one can almost complain about it, even if it is a little stuffy for this sick woman that one cheats. The book more precisely describes Zeena's tyrannical control over the house and Ethan. The film just ticked me. The addition of the fox was useless, as was the scene where Mattie was trying to commit suicide. It was just misinterpreted and done. Movie mistakes: Ethan's elusive character in the church's dance scene, interactions with Denis Eady, the addition of a love scene, a fox scene, a store scene , claiming that his plans allowed it, Ethan's lack of display of emotions and inner thoughts, the introduction of the priest instead of an unnamed engineer, leave pretty much what Zeena knows about the growing relationship where the reader never knows what Zeena thinks or knows. Too many faults and bad management decisions.
