I loved the beautiful Greek landscape, but the story, which is not something you can follow anyway, was even harder to follow in the movie. I can not imagine how anyone watching the movie can grab it if they have not read the book. Then, like me, they would probably wonder why Australian Allison turned into French Anne and many other seemingly useless changes in the film. story. The mysteries of the book seemed to be cut into pieces or left out in the film. I saw it when it came out for the first time and I had the same problems at that time because I had read the book several times. I recently watched it with my granddaughter (very smart at 20 and usually in movies I love) who was especially amazed at how young Michael Caine and Candace Bergen were in, but I could not not imagine why we would look at it if it were not for the landscape.
