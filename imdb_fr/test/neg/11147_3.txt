The plot of this movie boils down to Ah-nuld vs. Satan, and what I remember most about the movie is a lot of explosions, gunshots, blood, noise, not to mention that satanic urine flammable. The story is absurd, quite predictable and so full of holes that I can not take it a bit seriously. Stick to "Rosemary's Baby" or "The Exorcist" if you want to see a very good movie about the devil and ... uh, well, I can not think of any good movie "Action" at the moment (probably because they're so-so-in-between), so you're alone in this category. This film gets a score of 3 out of 10 from me for its camp value and for a pretty good performance of Gabriel Byrne as Satan's old fool!
