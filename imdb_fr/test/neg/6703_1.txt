Hi guys, this is my first review and I should have chosen the worst movie to review. As I only watched 5 minutes, but believe me, you could see that this movie was not going anywhere. The acting was deplorable, the camera work and lighting seemed to have been filmed and directed by a 10-year-old group. No offense for 10 years. I just could not stand it anymore. I got out of my couch, took out the DVD of The House of Adam from the DVD player and threw it in the trash. Maybe if you're a fan of Colin Farrell, this movie might interest you, because the character in the movie, Anthony, looks like Colin Farrell. But that's all he's going for, he certainly will never have Col's acting abilities. I gave this movie a rating of 1 (horrible) only because there was no problem in the drop-down list of applause.
