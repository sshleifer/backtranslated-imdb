According to "Lucien Rebatet" in "History of Music" (Robert Lafont, BOUQUINS, 1973 page 338), the character of Beethoven was not very compatible with women. He had a number of "Platonic passions" with female members of the "Viennese aristocracy" to whom he dedicated "sonatas". But the musicians, even the composers, did not qualify for the husbands of "Fine Ladies". Haydn was a "servant" of Prinz Von Esterhazy, Mozart had died of drink or Poison and Bethoven was according to Rebatet an assiduous client of "street prostitutes" in Vienna. A British biographer, Newman, says that Beethoven contracted syphilis before turning 40. He became deaf because of that. It's possible, but not certain. the Kärntnertortheater in Vienna, as well as the opening of the Consecration of the House and the first three parts of the Missa Solemnis. This was the first appearance of the composer on stage in twelve years; the room was packed. Although the show was directed by Michael Umlauf, the Kapellmeister of the theater, Beethoven shared the stage with him in silence. <br /> <br /> What is left of this "feminine fantasy"? The interpretation and characterization of Ed Harris are rather good, but too linear, according to the table of Ferninand Waldmüller dated 1823. I have it in front of me. This shows a man who despises (perhaps hates) the world. With reason.
