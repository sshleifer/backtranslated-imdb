See .. I really wanted to enjoy this movie. There were times when my heart was beating faster, when the hair on my neck started to straighten up, when my muscles began to contract ... but like a striptease, I found myself without real action, without resolution and without money missing my wallet. <br /> <br /> Jaume Balaguer√≥ and Miguel Tejada-Flores apparently do not know the right recipe for making a horror movie. So they used the old amateur cook's method of throwing everything into the pot. This film is really The Shining, Poltergeist, Amityville and Hellraiser, all in one. Incredible, I know, but true. All the flavors are there, you can taste them, they do not mix well. I will not go into the list of all that is wrong in this film; short, good cinematography, mediocre game, worse dialogue. <br /> <br /> The real problem of stealing as many movies and combining them into one movie, apart from the resulting confusion, remains while you CAN have multiple parcels at the same time, you can not have several purposes. And what does Jaume do when he comes up against this problem? Just like a freshman in English 101, you finish your story with ellipses: "The little car disappeared in the darkness and ..... THE END" Oooh, scary. Not really. And very anticlimatic. The end left me confused and disappointed; almost empty. <br /> <br /> Take your $ 10, go rent The Shining, Poltergeist, and Hellraiser ... scare yourself, have a good time and forget that The Darkness has always existed. <br /> <br /> -BJamin
