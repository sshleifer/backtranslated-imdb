SHIT! I accidentally watched this film and told myself that it was Nating Upstream that was launched in 2003. I seriously regret losing an hour of my life sitting there. Shame on anyone who gave a price to this junk. I really hated this movie. In fact, I did not carry it through. After an hour, I could not stand it anymore. I am disgusted at the fact that people are having such an ugly scenario, trying to give up a dozen stories of human interest and play BA-AD. PAINFUL. I rate it 1 star out of 10. An amateur could make a much bigger movie.
