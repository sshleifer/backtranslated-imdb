What do you do with all the material that does not make the final editing of a movie? You can keep it aside in case a director or an extended version is released someday. You could sell some of them as archival footage to use in one part of another movie. You could just throw it away. You can also collect it, accumulating more and more of each film you make, then use it to make another film, regardless of consistency or any sense. Add a very primitive skeleton of a story to this one and line up a number of opportunities (no, excuses) to sneak into your celluloid remnants. Forgive the aberrant and absurd nature of the plot by framing it in the mind of a horror movie director and you get a horrible movie. All this can be done in a few days of filming. And idiots like me will lose two hours of their lives watching it. And then come here and try to warn others. The whole chain of events is a big waste of time.
