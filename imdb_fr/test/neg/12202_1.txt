That's what I wanted to shout and go out of the theater, but I restrained myself. Yes, the acting was great, no it was not the typical Hollywood movie, but the dialogue did not end (or did not become interesting)! And despite all the chatter, you can never really know the characters or worry about them. It's certainly the most boring movie I've seen since Sphere, but I was expecting it to be boring. I had to sit across, but please, spare yourself
