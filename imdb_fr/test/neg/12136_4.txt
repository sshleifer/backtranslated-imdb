Can someone help me please missed the last moments of sight and I do not want to pay money to see the whole movie again. I got to the place where they were in the car and she said, "And this drink now? and smiles. what happens next? is there more dialogue or action? surely it does not stop there? I was a little bored in the movie and hoped that everything would be better. I like Kristen Scott Thomas. Does anyone remember the British TV series in which she was about some nuns? I want to know the name. Sean Penn was awesome Madonna devour your heart! The movie was a little predictable for everyone, it was a "movie of stars". the end took me by surprise I really thought she had burned her boats ..... if you are a fan of one of the stars that is worth watching.
