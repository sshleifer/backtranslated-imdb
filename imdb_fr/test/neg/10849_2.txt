As I mentioned in other reviews, I've become a big fan of David Bradley since I saw him in "American Ninja 3". The guy is great in martial arts, has a kind of charisma and is a cool guy on TV on screen. Unfortunately, he entered the digital television department from his beginnings and remained one of the kings of the television movie until 2001, when he apparently stopped making movies. Now, one thing is to watch Cyborg Cop or Hard Justice which are shitty movies but really fun to watch (they are entertaining if it makes sense), but another thing is to watch tasteless boredom like Total Reality. I mean, this and Crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse dung that this guy has ever done. I would not even recommend it to Bradly's biggest hardcore fans. If I had known that and Crisis was going to be so damned, I would not have spent the 3 or 4 euros they cost me. Total Reality is as boring as Crisis, though oddly enough, it starts to look promising. In the future, a group of military prisoners has the opportunity to stop some sort of disaster in the past (I'm sorry, I did not really pay attention to this atrocity) and they only have 24 hours to come back or something like that. like that. If they do not, they are stuck there forever. The poor director who oversaw this "tries" humorous clich√©s (?) Like convicts who arrive on Earth and do not know what a truck (wow, hilarious ...). The film follows with David Bradley teaming with a girl from Earth for the rest of the film. It bothered me so much that I had to force myself to watch it in 3 or 4 times to at least use the 4 or 5 euros that it cost me. That's because every time I tried, I fell asleep. And if you get a movie with David Bradley with a single 10-second fight scene, then that's the finishing touch that could help you throw it off the cliff a hundred yards away to never see it again. I wish I could meet the "director" of this pile of poop in the street and I swear to God that I would ask him to come back for 5 euros. I would also like to meet David Bradley to ask him why, in the name of God, did he choose to play in this poor excuse for a film. Do not even care about this film, I think from the heart, I do not rent the loan and especially do not buy it.
