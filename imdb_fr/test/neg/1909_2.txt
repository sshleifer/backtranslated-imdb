Ho hum. Rich handsome kid is in trouble, poor girl falls in love with him, jealous ex-boyfriend causes tension .. yadda yadda. In fact, I laughed a lot in many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and just stupid. From scenes to scenes, I often wondered how we got there, as if I'd skipped a few chapters of a book. <br /> <br /> The script was rather pitiful and had not robbed me or my wife caring much about one of the characters except the jilted boyfriend. Now, if the ex-boyfriend had had an ax and had separated the girl and the rich child, then ... then we would have a movie, and all this stupid dialogue and all these jumps in the plot might be acceptable . But, since this film tries to be touching and totally misses the boat (and ends up resorting to the romantic equivalent of a divine intervention to try to make a tear) ... it falls really very flat. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Cut your nails instead, you will have more fun.
