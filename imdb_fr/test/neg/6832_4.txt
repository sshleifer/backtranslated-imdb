Very soon: a bad movie. If you are looking for pure action and no brain (or "illusion" of brain) or if you are under 15 years old and like Bruce Willis, it's THE movie. Also, do not expect the storyline to be consistent or even believable if you think a bit, so do not do it if you just want to have fun.
