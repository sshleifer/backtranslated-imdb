It's certainly a "less known" comedy from the 1920s. The only reason I saw this was because it was on a Kino Films DVD containing shorts other than Laurel and Hardy with Ollie. They are interesting and historically important, but they are also generally average to below average for the style movie. Compared to the short films of Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are clearly below quality and humor. In addition, the accompanying music was rather mediocre compared to other silent DVDs. I ended up turning off the sound because of the inadequacy of the music to set the right mood. But, despite this, they are still worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest about this short film. It was the last of the 8 on this DVD and when I got there, I was very bored of the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 short films. So, it is possible that the film is a little better than a 4 - but certainly, if so, no better than a 5! The film is a fairly standard short film about an incompetent hunter. Nothing particularly interesting and there are certainly MUCH better silent short films.
