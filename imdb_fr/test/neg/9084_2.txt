Once again, director J. Lee Thompson joins forces with actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action film. In fact, it's probably Bronson's most brutal movie (a feat for a man appeared in Death Wish, Ten To Midnight and Chato's Land). However, brutality is not in itself a good movie, and The Evil That Men Do is ultimately a disappointment. If you remove his brutality, the film would have very little interest. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a retired hitman (Bronson) who leads a pleasant life on a Caribbean island. He is confident of coming out of his retirement to find and eliminate a sadistic torture specialist who practices his vile work around several South American hells. Throughout the movie, especially at the beginning, we are witnessing graphic torture scenes to show us just how bad it is. <br /> <br /> These themes are actually quite serious. Repressive dictatorships in Latin America are subject to torture and ordinary citizens must undergo painful and painful experiences simply for expressing an unpopular point of view. But the Evil that men do - despite all its good attitudes - does not really care about the plight of these poor people. It's simply a shame to give Charles Bronson an excuse to remove unpleasant bags. It is only an exploitative actor who persists on real problems. The torture sequences make you, the viewer, feel like a dirty and disgusted voyeur, rather like someone enjoying watching snuff films. The scenario is full of horrific dialogues, including excessive descriptions of torture. The Evil That Men Do is unable to explore his disturbing ideas ... he serves them as entertainment and asks us to appreciate them. Sorry, but it's wrong.
