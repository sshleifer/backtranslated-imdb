In a world full of movies - like "You Got Served" - that will surprise you with its huge amounts of mistakes, you would never have imagined that there would be worse movies ... until now. Ron Hall's "Vampire Assassins" goes beyond cheese. He KNOWS that you are angry with her. Firstly, there are no assassins in this film. In fact, there is only one good fighter in the whole movie. Second: The location ... is basically a location: a moron house (or a basement - it's up to you.). Third: Special effects (clearly expressed) can kiss my ass. Fourth: the acting game beats "Plan 9 of outer space" in the category of the worst performers of all time. Ron Hall can not act to save his life. Finally (and certainly not the smallest problem): THE EDITION. The person who edited this movie hopes better than I ever find it. The cuts and the shots are HORRENDOUS !!!! Other problems: lighting (almost none), the fact that the type on the cover does not even appear in the film and the fact that this film exists exists. <br /> <br /> To summarize this film, say that I tortured the copy of the DVD before bringing it back to Hollywood Video (do not worry, I used the MVP subscription, so it was free !). NEVER SEE THIS FILM !!!!
