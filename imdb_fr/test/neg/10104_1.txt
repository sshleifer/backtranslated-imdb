This film is really pathetic in every conceivable department. horrible, frightful, frightful. It only takes about eighty minutes, but believe me, you'll feel like you're watching a movie by Andy Warhol (again, twenty hours in the life of the empire building would surely be a lot more interesting ). <br /> <br /> Where to start ... the putrid scenario, disgusting cinematography, bad behavior, spectacular effects, dreadful music, or just the sieve-like plot. This film is an incoherent chaos <br /> <br /> A particularly remarkable scene takes place in front of a caf√© when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat. Ask the waitress to look out the coffee shop window with a "God Damn" English accent. To straighten this woman. Hell, that horrible monstrosity. <br /> <br /> Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves. Let's hope the director never finds the funds to work again.
