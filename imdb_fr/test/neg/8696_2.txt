For a really wonderful movie, you can also try to see the movie about St. Francis of Assisi - good for any audience. The best thing that I liked in this film is the Mexican landscape, and the film goes to a 2. I'm surprised that these actors do not have terrible sunburns, but they are not not desert dwellers. And it is said that Moses has a speaking impediment, but certainly not here. Even the "miracle" scenes were artificial and implausible. And what's the use if you can believe anything in a TV report? You're talking about confusion, I thought Hallmark's movie was pathetic, and I can see why others hate Hollywood. I do not do it, but only some of these for-profit grocery producers. "Jesus of Nazareth" does not require any kind of religion, but for this waste of celluloid, you have to be bored, do nothing, be stupefied and religious. And for a true cinematic experience, try "Short Cut to Nirvana", a very well rated movie.
