OK, this 'horror' movie had to be a joke, right? Please, tell me it was supposed to be a joke, so I'll understand. <br /> <br /> A big croaking bird with giant claws - or a claw, in any case - throws itself on the ground by unsuspecting people and engulfs them up. Mara Corday and Jeff Morrow have reacted enough to keep things interesting, but at least you'll have a generous sneer when you see the "monster". It sounds like a cross between an upset chicken and Mortimer Snerd. <br /> <br /> Director Fred Sears just made this picture in a hurry and knew that the bird looked completely ridiculous, or he really thought that his film and his creature were truly authentic. scary. I prefer to think - and hope - that it was the old one. <br /> <br /> P.S. The bird needs a haircut.
