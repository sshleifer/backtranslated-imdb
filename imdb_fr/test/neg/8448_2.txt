This is just one of those movies that can not justify much of what's going on. These people go hiking: the girl wants to photograph animals. There are really no Piranhas, but I suppose the psychotic hunter is the real piranha. Anyway, there are a lot of animals and a lot of driving. There is a lot of anti-gun discussion, but we all know where it's going. Towards the end, there is a lot of action and rape committed. Someone has to pay, and that's what he does. It would have been nice to have two piranhas to complete the whole thing. There were a lot of monkeys. If you move quickly in dull areas, you have five small minutes tight.
