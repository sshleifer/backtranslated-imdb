Let me start with this, I'm a big fan of George Clooney and I love John Krasinski in 'The Office'. Well, it was and I did. <br /> <br /> It was the worst nail in the world and it took 113 minutes to tear it apart. The amazing boredom was interrupted only by the efforts I often made to read my watch and gauge when it was finished. <br /> <br /> Every funny scene was in the excerpts. All three. There was no real story, no character development, and the script was just bad. I had a colonoscopy that was more pleasant. <br /> <br /> The title should have been SuperDuper Bad. This film is a lock for a Razzie. There should be a lot of Razzies. I want my money back.
