Unbelievable. "Philosophy". "Depth". "Engineering". "Masterpiece". People had to see another "Oldboy" because the one I saw was a sordid and badly designed piece of the poorly written, poorly crafted "Kraapola" series, which for a moment ignored the ridiculously violent scenes that did not suit the eyes of a child, could barely satisfy the imagination and thirst for consistency of a seven-year-old plot. <br /> <br /> The "depth" of this sad mix was exhausted in a little piece of wisdom, "Laugh and the whole world will laugh with you, cry and you'll be left alone", kind of annoying fortune cookie, according to which a great author, be it Shakespeare or, more exactly, IMDb, Kurosawa, would have thrown in the trash without hesitation. Where this film should have landed too, if we did not live in a time when shocking, shocking and perverse disgusting are confused with what was once called "great art". In short, yuck. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 100. This is not 1 in 1000 just because of some occasional camera work. Not enough to save this infantile failure of anything.
