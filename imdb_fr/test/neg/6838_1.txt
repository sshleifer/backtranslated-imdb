Spoilers !! Bruce Willis, the comical and funny part-time guy plays a Hispanic assassin nicknamed after an African scavenger meadow dog? I guess all Hispanic nicknames like Sicatriz (Scar), Scorpion, Viper, Cobra, Snake, Tarantula, Latigo (Whip), Navaja (Blade), etc. were not available ?? And why would a South American assassin get acquainted with a terrorist from the Irish Republican Army? The last time I checked, the IRA is not looking to open a South American headquarters. And why would an Irish terrorist hardened in jail and weary of battle look like a middle-aged Richard Gere? I thought this movie might be a parody of "The Crying Game" when Gere's character was portrayed as the person who was going to hunt down "The Jackal". What a bad casting! And why would the FBI have hired depraved terrorists to find murderers? It looks like a terrorist who goes to mass destruction, and an assassin usually hits a target in a non-spectacular way. But Gere is the only person to ever see Willis alive, according to the FBI. I thought this movie was supposed to be a remake of the very big movie "Day of The Jackal" but this movie is just a silly version of "Assassins" with Stallone and Banderas. These two movies are really stupid, and part of it is the fact that the public is forced to watch Bruce Willis follow his routines and we should say "Wow, is not he smart!" THE PROFESSIONAL with Jean Reno was a much better movie about killers. "The Jackal" is just a movie about two big middle-aged millionaire actors who could be paid to stay around and pretend to be smart! "The Jackal" is so poor that I expected to see Sly Stallone, Dennis Rodman, Mickey Rourke and Jean Clod Van Dumme make appearances as "other" hitmen or FBI. Needless to say, "The Jackal" escaped the FBI for twenty-five years, but as soon as Richard Gere took office, there are only a few days left before "The Jackal" has become kaput! I guess the positive message of this film is: "Thanks to the terrorists, our streets are safe from assassins." Overall, the "jackal" has no quality that redeems.
