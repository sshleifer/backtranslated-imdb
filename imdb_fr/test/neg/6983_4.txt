Yes, I know that his character was supposed to be drunk, and he may have been just clumsy. But something tells this reviewer that Mr. Pleasence drank a lot and was intoxicated during his scenes in the movie. Basically, everything he says is confusing and often incomprehensible. Or maybe it was just bad production values ​​... hard to say. <br /> <br /> Anyway, The race for the Yankee Zephyr is a movie that simply does not work. It's a shame too, because the film has a great opening and a generally interesting plot. In the end, the production values ​​are simply too low and the action is too sparse for this New Zealand adventure to deliver the goods. The story is about an American war plane filled with gold, silver and medals crashing into a lake in New Zealand during the Second World War. The plane remains lost for about forty years, until it goes to bed and a drunk (Pleasence) discovers it literally. At first, he picks up all the purple heart medals and tries to sell them in town, actually getting $ 75 each for them! He hardly knows that once he sells them, the local jeweler gets on the phone and starts looking for information about the plane. Before being able to blink, all the attention attracts a rich booby (Peppard) and his henchmen in the city, who are trying to force the old man to abandon the plane's location, knowing that he does not It's not just about medals. . The trading partner of the drunk old man (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) then rush to try to claim the fortune before the bad guys can get there. The resulting action is just not as fun as you expected. <br /> <br /> The action is pretty awful, except for Pleasence. George Peppard tries to make (I suppose) a Austrailian accent, but it is hardly convincing. Lesley Ann Warren is not that bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He's making his best impression of Michael Paré on his worst day. And it says something. I hope he made enough money with this movie to repair his teeth that were a bit crooked. I do not remember if he had straightened them when he was in Wiseguy. The rest of the cast is rather talentless. Probably mostly locals who have never done much else. I guess the biggest problem for me was the lack of action for much of the film and the lack of danger. The bad guys are too kind and clumsy to be taken seriously. And honestly, there is NO helicopter in the movie that looks like the DVD cover. And none of the boats in the movie have painted teeth, either. <br /> <br /> The film has its assets, however. The beginning, which begins with a news film before being part of the story, was a nice touch. Brian May's score looks a bit too much like Mad Max 2's, but he included a nice little step that they play for Pleasence in some scenes. It looks like the one of the great escape! There are a few helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stuntmen during the shooting. The landscape, despite the grainy aspect of the photo, is still very beautiful. What you'll remember most is the drunken antics of Donald Pleasence. It was almost enough to save this movie. Almost. 4 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The hunting dog.
