I love independent comedies and movies, but it was way too slow and the humor was extremely regional. I guess it would have been better if the main characters were nice, but they were just typical gen-x slacker types, just like the people who had been causing problems in high school for forty years ... I can understand High Praise for a young independent filmmaker when he deserves it, but it's an extremely average film.
