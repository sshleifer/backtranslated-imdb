.... so why the hell would I see 'Sex Vies of the Potato Men'? Answer: Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook. Vegas, I saw live and fully appreciated. I think he is an intelligent and unique intellectual comedian who manages to maintain extreme madness. Crook, I only know the greatest comedy of the last 10 years with Alan Partridge, "The Office". As a Gareth, he was just hilarious, and I wanted to know how he would become another character on the big screen. <br /> <br /> OK. So the boyfriend and I went to the multiplex last night and the movie was very funny, only because the insane mediocre dialogue and the jokes of Ferris and Dave had been delivered with aplomb and enthusiasm by the talent of Vegas and Crook. They are destined for better things (have actually done better in fact) and I even think Vegas would make a decent honest actor. The banal scenes where he says he misses his wife are almost touching, although ** SPOILER ** fell on the stage at the end where he was taken back by his wife needed to be lengthened, this was simply not credible. And throughout the film, Vegas seems to miss his wife only two or three times. <br /> <br /> The film became grotesquely malunous and a little old, well, grotesque, when sex was mentioned. No, I add, when it was shown on the screen. Tolly's free explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why was not even a bit funny, and just made me feel a little sick. The inclusion of Jeremy's character taking his nose, before displaying a close-up of the bogey on his finger, was also quite useless. The mere fact of taking his nose would have made him smile, he was a pathetic character and it would have made him look as low as possible, but showing snot closely was simply not necessary and was ranked. <br /> <br /> A scene that I found hilarious involving sex was Vegas in threesome. His fucking good conversation with the second guy just highlighted the fact that the trios are not always ecstatic. Not that I know ..... <br /> <br /> That's about all I can really say. I will end with this and it is actually my main criticism of the film. This is supposed to revive the British film industry. There is no "Trainspotting", that's for sure ... it's not even a "Love Actually" (it would take a heart of stone not to vomit in front of it), and 3 million pounds could really have been put into a better project. "Mike Basset England Manager" was a wonderful little known British comedy, designed for less than 3 million people. I only hope that CFB will learn from 'The Sex Life of Potato Men' and will not become so free in the future. Although the appalling critics that this movie gets do only boost the box office revenue. :-)
