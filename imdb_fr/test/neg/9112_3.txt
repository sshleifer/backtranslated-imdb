This film suffers horribly from its staging "Julian Grant" and his incompetent Steve Guttenberg, who is striving to win a Bruce Willis look-alike contest! The writing is imprudent, a Hollywood action thriller; Sean Bean - including one of my favorites - David Fraser and Kim Coates gives a decent performance. The film is well below average. 3 out of 10! I wonder what the Hollywood studios have thought, giving the nod, to a director as weak as Grant. And I would say to Sean Bean "what were you thinking of even if you were thinking of participating in a film like this, after such outstanding movies as GoldenEye, Ronin and Patriot Games!
