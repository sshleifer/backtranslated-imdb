As we know, movies are not meant to be a direct incorporation of history, but it's a shame when a movie is shot and there is absolutely no correlation. I hope that the director and / or scriptwriter has done his research on this subject. All this film does is create a forum for hatred between people, while causing a conflict that should not be there. This film portrayed Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative manor, while giving the impression that the third group (Hindu) was not present in the brutal killings of the population of both countries. The inaccuracies, combined with Gian Singh's garish contempt for faith, was a shame for the highest format. Although on a more positive note, the actors did a great job playing their roles. Kristen K and Neve C both played exceptionally. I hope that those who watch this film do not see it and do not use it as a model for the historical event.
