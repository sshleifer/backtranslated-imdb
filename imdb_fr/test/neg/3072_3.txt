Terrible. There is no way around it. A Mexican soap opera scenario, a choice and use of filming locations that make the film both labyrinthine and repetitive and monotonous, with disastrous performances of almost the entire cast. The references to Tarantino's work, so badly made, are more an insult than anything else. I guess it was not for shameless exploitation and unrelated to the plot of the generous curves of Matadinho, nobody would take the effort to go watch this movie in a theater. <br /> <br /> These are the kinds of films that make me have no desire to watch Portuguese cinema.
