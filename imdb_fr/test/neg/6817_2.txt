PDQ Bach did better. The bulk of "Bach" is composed of letters written to various customers complaining about the amount and speed of payment. Anna Magdalena's diary, which deals mainly with the death of children and other family problems, is more interesting. The music is disconcerting: orchestras and choir chapels of the size of the seventeenth century producing sounds of concert halls of the twentieth century. The quality of the overall production reminded me of an undergraduate slideshow. JS Bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself. This film adds nothing. Netflix sent me 2 discs that could not be played, so I streamed the movie. Clearly, Netflix was trying to tell me something.
