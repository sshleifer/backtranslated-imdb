The Shwaas may have a good story, but the director is totally devoid of talent. He does not know when to stop. When the story calls people to be confused, there are scenes of about ten minutes miming the act of confusion. When the story calls for a bit of history, there are ten-minute scenes of Konkan's greenery. When the story asks a child to make tantrums, you see the idea. <br /> <br /> Not to mention close-ups to be able to count the hairs on people's noses. There are movies that should be seen on a big screen, this movie should be seen on a 13 "television." Amruta Subhash, who plays Asavari, is the worst actress I've seen in a long time. need I overwork for years to accomplish what she does effortlessly. <br /> <br /> I give her 4/10 only because the subject is different and the story is not bad The fact that a film like Shwaas arrives at India's entry to the Oscars speaks volumes about the state of Indian cinema, but about the state of Indian judges' committees: a film is not good simply because his subject is artistic.
