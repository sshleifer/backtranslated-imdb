After a bad 19th century double weapon, a charming young woman becomes a vampire. Not only does she become one of the undead, but she uses her gothic, tempting character to support her cold-blooded assassin abilities. This is a low quality B feature that should have gone straight to the video. The violence is vicious and bloody, but actually quite sweet. The scenario is so weak and the dialogue so random that it is difficult to generate much interest. Eileen Daly is the main character Lilith Silver. Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth and Isabel Brook are also part of the cast.
