For all the actors and team members who worked on this excuse for a movie, another payday in Latin America. For any public who hopes to get a fair return for the entry price, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this horrible exercise (for me) is that we watch an extremely talented actor, Pacino, apparently playing a parody of himself. That's what stayed with me like a total mystery. I can perfectly understand the need for people in the film industry to work and therefore earn a living. What I can not understand is an artist with the talent of Al Pacino who prostitutes and is embarrassed with this level of crap brainless. I hope he will choose better value projects in the future ... and for this value, you will save time and money hard earned. Skip this !! Let's send a message to Hollywood and Al.
