... and the boy is the deafening collision. A phone line player is supported by the spirit of a recently deceased ninja, undressing to give him tomato juice on his body so that his boyfriend can lick him, perform a seductive dance, then will kill the policemen killed the ninja she owns. Only to be hunted by a one-eyed ninja master. Just like in real life, huh? Animated only by Sho Kosugi's martial arts choreography (and his refusal to put his odious children in it), you really have to see this to believe it. It's the ultimate mix of totally incompatible genres.
