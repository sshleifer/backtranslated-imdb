I watched this video because I love Malta and this film was shot in its entirety. Very disappointing because it fails to capture the aroma or beauty of the island, but only hot, dry and sterile elements. The film was dull, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious and devoid of any imaginable plot. You had to be a medium to follow the plot or its absence. He had his moments, of course. but it's the same to go to the dentist. <br /> <br /> In short, I would prefer to undergo another colonoscopy before revisiting this horrible disaster. It was so terrible that I could not really fall asleep. There are many "Eurotrash" movies that have been made without the supervision of an adult. This is one of them. On the bright side, who is Nadia Cassini? Never before have I seen a more beautiful set of legs. She is the only grace that saves from this movie. <br /> <br /> What was disturbing was also the cruel boar hunt described in the ending credits. A wild boar that was released on someone 's property (Malta has very few native mammals, all little rats, bats, etc.) and then attacked by dogs before being slaughtered. Oh, well, go anyway to Malta despite this movie. It is a beautiful colorful island. rich in history and very fun.
