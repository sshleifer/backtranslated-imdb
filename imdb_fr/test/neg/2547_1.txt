What a terrible movie! It perfectly represents the state of degeneration of French society, where the most basic respect for healthy values ​​and traditions has completely disappeared. The plot is absurd, the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely superficial and uninteresting. At the very least, direction and cinematography are very poor and uninspired. Catherine Deneuve is an actress as bad as she always was, even though she was run by Bunuel in Belle De Jour. The rest of the usual cast (Vincent Lindon, Line Renaud, Jean Yanne) seems completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity, platitudes and agitation. I can not help but draw a parallel with James Ivory's wonderful "The Divorce", with his thoughtful description of French and American customs, his exceptional cinematography and his excellent distribution. After seeing "Divorce", you feel a sort of empathy for the French, no matter how weak they are. "Mother-in-law" leaves you only a nauseating disdain for its protagonists morally bankrupt and unintelligent.
