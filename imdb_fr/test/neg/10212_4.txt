As a wrestling fan, wrestling movies are usually void (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura), but this one is not the worst I've ever seen. Yes, it's bad but it's better than some of the others I mentioned. <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan interprets the main role himself and, for some reason, a rival network wants to hit him because he does not want to be on this network. Let me explain this so that everyone can understand .... picture The American network having Rip ... and TNT will try to get it. <br /> <br /> Does it make sense ... no? Well, do not feel bad because it makes no sense. Nor does it make sense to have a legitimate ex-combatant fight with Rip at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Nothing from this movie makes much sense, but compared to other wrestling movies and later, Hogan films his step so badly. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
