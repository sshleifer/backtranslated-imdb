Two LA policemen track down a serial killer nicknamed "the man of the family" who exterminated entire families and when one of the police officer's wives seizes the six deep, questions arise and it turns out that a serial killer is not responsible, but rather gangsters. Seagal's idea in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept. Indeed, one could see Seagal playing a good serial killer, but making him a cop who has a ridiculous inclination for prayer beads and sharp credit cards turns out to be more silly than presumably ridiculous. A common joke also involves Wayon's enjoyment of eating powdered deer penis and this scorching material is utterly out of place. Not to mention the beginning of the hostage-taking of a school because of the breakup of a boy with his girlfriend. After Seagal neutralizes him, the girlfriend tells the boy that she loves him. Now, there is a lesson to be learned from all of this: If you want your girlfriend to come back, taking the hostage from school can put you back on the right side. I thought that flowers or an old-fashioned phone call might work, but again, I'm old-fashioned. In addition to who am I to put a stop to someone else's brilliant reconciliation plan. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
