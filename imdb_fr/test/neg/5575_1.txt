It must be the worst movement I have ever seen !!!!! It was not just boring, it was "gagging with a spoon" stupid. Where did you find the actors ... at the corner of a street? Who made the special effects ... Maaco? For God's sake, I could have made a better movie with my cell phone. And if that was not enough, you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see how stupid the actors were in real life. Who ever made up the aliens ... must have spent $ 5 in your local used costume store and called it a day. And who in the world wrote the description of the film on the back of the DVD case should be shot. PUH !! It's not even 1/8% of what it's described. This description is just to encourage people to buy, rent or pay for a ticket to see it. No wonder there was never a trailer .... we would have all hunted !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Bad actors ... $ 5 <br /> <br /> Special Effects ... $ 5.50 <br /> <br /> False fires .... $ 1.89 (cigarette lighter) <br /> <br /> Time spent watching this movie ... total loss! (I should sue you for the time I'm watching)
