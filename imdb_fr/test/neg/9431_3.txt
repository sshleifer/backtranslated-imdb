"Shadows and Fog" is surely one of Woody Allen's weakest films, just like "September" and "Hollywood Ending" (although nothing that Allen did is equal to the terrible "Anything Else") . <br /> <br /> "Shadows and Fog" is Allen's tribute to the German Expressionist cinematic style, both dark and stylized, shadow and light ... and you guessed it ... a lot of fog . But you can say that Allen got caught up in technique and parody and forgot to make a film that would interest everyone. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, he made "Husbands and Wives" the same year. not a total wash for him. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
