Too predictable for spoilers, but I will not be suspicious below, so do not read it if you want it. <br /> <br /> a few boring writers together for a half-afternoon, and even when they lack ideas. So let's start with a wanted criminal all over France ... no matter what he did, we'll think about it later (that's not the case). a few seconds of suspense, but not too much, and nothing unexpected, as this requires art. half an hour is needed to finish the film; I understand: have them burglar at a jeweler and take a lot of time to avoid alarms, etc. everyone steals jewelers in movies just like that, it's going to work (it does not work). no humor, no character (ok, yves montand has a hard time doing it) and everyone is talking in an impassive voice meant to make you think of black, but just gives the actors a depressed sound. if they keep quiet, it will make them duller - but we will also avoid writing their lines. we'd better add something for the women who will stay at home who are going to watch this movie, so give them something to make them sympathize with our husband (we forgot to put women in the movie). I got it: a marijuana son - oh, and ask him to commit suicide for no particular reason (shame? His father is a mafia boss for shouting loudly, but the audience will feel his paternal attentions, and if not , make them shit). oh, the dishonest cop was a classmate of the guy who got him in the end; ripping, huh? let them all die at the end, or we'll never finish that kind of thing. Is it in the box? yes, it's over, thank you god. who will we get for the director?
