It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I think you can get that in the title. In addition, there is a special love scene that could be the strangest in the film's history. I do not even remember why I saw this movie or when. Only it is an absolutely horrible movie viewing experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for the strangest movie that will cost you two hours of your time, then rent it. Good luck finding it in your local store though. I doubt that this film is in a very wide distribution. And, please, do not show this to the children, that would not in any way distort their impressionable mind.
