As a major in Canadian history, my first thing to say is that the historical facts are not accurate! How can a producer do this? The deportation of the Acadian was not in 1759 when we see Franklin in London, but in 1755! How can he do that in the movie? The scenes in Londo were also useless. Then, for the story of all who read "The Old Canadians," you have the plot here. This is the story of La Coriveau, this "witch". Also add a love story and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter that ends. Of course, it made me cry. But that's all. Then there is the fact that he seems to be living in Quebec City, but he was mainly filmed at Fortress of Louisbourg. Of course, it is a historic site and at the time indicated, but it was obvious that the scenes were not all happening in Quebec City. Overall, if you are looking for a documentary about New France, get Candad: a story of people, a documentary about the history of Canda and New France. If you want a love story that will bring you tears, a story set in a beautiful forest, look at New France.
