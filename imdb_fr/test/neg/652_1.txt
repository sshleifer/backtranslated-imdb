To sum up this film, it is LaBute who carries his sadism into the world of comic farce. The predictable result is that he constantly tramples all jokes by insisting on surrounding them with bloody violence and extremely hateful characters. There is also evidence of his constant efforts to insult and ridicule everything that is happening in sight, but then apologize for weak gestures for the PC. Basically, the movie simply does not work, its plot is unimaginable, the characters are one-dimensional clich√©s, there is no coherence or development, and the comedy (where it is not totally moved) is the worst sort of High Concept Drivel. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are completely clueless with characters that resemble parodies of studio-driven spectator proclamations. No matter, make them friendly, neutral (and neutered), moral platitudes. Crispin Glover is here just long enough to convince you that he does not belong to the movies anymore. In fact, Chris Rock has a negative chemistry with his successful counterpart, Freeman. It's like they're acting in different rooms, even two inches apart. Indeed, Chris Rock looks like a digital insert. At least he's not as boring as Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> The 15 minutes of LaBute may well be over. It already seems that he has exceeded the duration of his reception.
