I really wanted to love this movie. The glimpses seemed slightly amusing, but I thought they put most of the fun things in the glimpses. In this case, not only did they do that, but they twisted the clips so that they would appear much more funny than in the real movie. I love John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, Rock, Cedric the Entertainer, etc. I wanted to love this movie, but it did not seem to have anything to do with it. <br /> <br /> I saw Get Shorty. not particularly take care of it. Too slow and not funny for me. This film is certainly not better and, even worse, worse. There were plenty of opportunities for some good comic moments but it did not take any. <br /> <br /> The acting was ok but even John Travolta seemed dimmed. Cedric was fine but he was too master to be really funny. Vince Vaughn and the Rock were pretty good and ready to be funny, but they let everything go. I wish they had the chance to perform the fun things they prepared, but instead, they always came back to the same thing and just put Vaughn and Rock back to make them funny ( although we have never allowed punchline or comedy). <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a very disappointing movie and I'm glad I only saw it on video. At least it was cheaper than the theater.
