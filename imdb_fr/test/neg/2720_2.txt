It seems that I am in the minority, but I thought that "Radio" was pretty terrible. It seemed to contain almost all the clich√©s of these types of "comforting" movies. <br /> <br /> The motivation for the characters to fall in love with the radio has never really been explained. We were supposed to accept that everyone liked radio, except for a few bad apples. <br /> <br /> You could see almost every moment of history at 100 meters. When the movie wanted you to leave "Awww" or remove your tissue, I rolled my eyes and wished I had looked "Rudy" instead. <br /> <br /> The actors performed well. Too bad they did not have a better movie to appear.
