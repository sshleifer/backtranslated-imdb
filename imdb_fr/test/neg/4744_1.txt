Turd Pie: <br /> <br /> * Take x2 Franchises * Boil for 5 minutes * Incorporate mixed cardboard characters (the actors do not work better) * Add 2 tons of snapshots then microwave in the oven you're bored. * Serve with a pinch of Dawson crack (not a typo) <br /> <br /> That's it! - Brain rot for the Emo / World of Warcraft generation <br /> <br /> Finding the keys in the siphon was the best thing (?) <br /> <br /> Aside from the first 5 minutes , its one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Utter, Utter, Nonsense.
