As you may not know, EÃ§a de Queiroz is one of Portugal's most famous writers. He was witty, he spared no one among his critics and now has to roll in his grave. And this is not because this film is bad, which is the case, but as a result of the treatment he has given to one of his masterpieces "O Crime do Padre Amaro". It's treated like a cheap and disposable junk. <br /> <br /> When it was announced that it would be a "modern and urban" version of the book that I feared for the worse, normally modern in these contexts, it means taking the liberty to take the p **** during an adaptation, reduce it in the most sloppy way possible. Thus the moral and social dilemma of a priest with a secret and defended affair is replaced by very long passages of people drugging and singing hip-hop for no particular reason or relevant to the plot. It's as if that may not have been possible. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there is a lot of sex so you can at least rely on it when you put it on. Do not forget that all 80s movies, no matter the genre or tone, have always found a way to sneak into nudity? If it was a thriller and they did not need it, they would simply find a way to capture a criminal so that he "lies" in bed with a screaming woman (naked of course) when the cops were bursting Ahem, free is the word I think. Even if the nude scenes do not present any inconvenience, they give the creators of this film a desperate look, simply because the film has nothing else, it's totally devoid of what you call a dramatic content .
