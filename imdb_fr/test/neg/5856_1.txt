This film is a little more than ersatz Verhoeven. The shoot is supposed to be tele-realistic, but is simply disgusting. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story that seems to be taken seriously. Brechtian breaks for non-existent announcement brakes are tedious, and even painful; without any doubt, there was no real intention to make this Brechtian film, it was only an accident that happened like that. If you want to see a parody of reality TV, watch Celebrity DeathMatch, more funny and more spiritual, and especially shorter. I have rarely felt so much pain watching a movie. To avoid as a rabid rabbit.
