Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen! "The Beginning" was not the best either, but better than this one. This is not a good way to lead to the original movie. It's just awful! CGI hyenas were so wrong in both movies! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed the old Sinbad movies better than that. I was royally disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and the clothes that captured this era. I understand why this movie was redone under the name "The Beginning". It's just that bad, in my opinion. Where does the money come from? Give me a multi-million dollar budget and I'll show you how!
