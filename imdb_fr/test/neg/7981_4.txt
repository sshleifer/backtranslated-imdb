I was recently in a scene version of this piece. And, on the last day of the race, I was excited to see he was going to play on television. I stuck a tape because it was lit late at night and I watched it the next day. I must say that I was very disappointed. The actors of the movie have made few discoveries that are in the script. This is understandable because the sales process is probably different, but it was overwhelming. Much of the original script was also edited for the movie to improve it for the screen, but I'm not sure it helped the movie. I gave these 4 stars only because I know the script and the writing is much better than what this movie describes.
