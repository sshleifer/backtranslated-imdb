It is clear that this film was designed for a younger generation that may not have had an idea of ​​Charles Bukowski's work. Henry Chinaski's autobiographical character in Bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by Mickey Rourke in "Barfly" in 1987, also featuring Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has ever seen Factotum should definitely see Barfly to better understand how Bukowski wrote his character. 'Factotum' lacks the greasy character of Bukowski's script and the fearless desperation of his lone hero. The involuntary humor in the dark despair of Chinaski's misadventures does not work for Dillon, as he does so admirably for Rourke, a fool of blood-soaked blood. Rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the misbehavior of the previous night a scene for another horrible and painful day in the life of a drunken and misanthropic drunk writer. The character of Dillon misses these brands in favor of a writer at once beautiful, neat and sleek look, which passes at any time in the history of Chinaski. Wanda, Dunaway's nauseating heroine, is the perfect complement to Henry, a fool. The women of 'Factotum' can not hold the candle to Dunaway's 'goddess in distress' and the use of more profane sexual subjects in 'Factotum' turns out to be more of a gross distraction than a hat-trick to the Bukowski's raw and shameless head representations of dysfunctional relationships. I was stunned by the exact number of identical scenes used in "Factotum" (Marisa Tomei who buys all this material and the load of the old man is a real scam of "Barfly"). <br /> <br /> If you want to see the best stories of Bukowski, see "Barfly" and "Love is a dog of hell" (also called "Crazy Love").
