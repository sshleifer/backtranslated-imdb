May or may not contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Inuyasha is not a good anime. It's actually very overrated. Why? There is absolutely no scenario, no plot, and the series is dragging on ... and again ... and again ... That's because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that advance the plot. And the fillers are exactly the same stories that are repeated over and over again. The same episodes seem to go with the same plot: Kagome detects a burst of jewel, a worm / slime / tentacle demon appears, Inuyasha says "Wind-Scar", "Iron Reaver Soul Stealer", etc. and kill the demon, they recover the piece of jewel, and then we simply repeat this scene 160 times or more. <br /> <br /> Besides the repetition of episodes, there is a repetition of comic devices, and they are no longer funny. Wait, they've never been. Sexual harassment is not funny. Viz rated the Older Teens series, 16+. I do not know why they noted it. There is nothing wrong with that, other than the so-called sexual harassment fun, which is rather suggestive and could make you stop these days. <br /> <br /> This is how we know that Inuyasha is overestimated. Video games. They all sucked. Especially the mask game. I played it at my friend's house. It was nothing interesting. The game was slow, boring and the Nintendo 64 looked like a graphic. In a magazine, he got a 4/10 rating, stating "... this role-playing game is slower than the milkshake going up a cocktail straw." Then there are all those stupid Inuyasha toys, action figures, trading cards, stickers and coloring books. COLORING BOOKS! We thought Inuyasha was 16 years old and over! Maybe not ... But after being a member of the Inuyasha groups on MSN, about half of those in attendance were 10 to 13 years old. I guess Inuyasha is a little anime, after all. (I think a little editing was done for this show, it could be shown on Toonami.) There are over 40 manga volumes. I can not help wondering how many kilometers of forest have been cut down to make it. Sad ... <br /> <br /> Then there is music. The music is so annoying. We hear the same 5 songs in each episode. After 10 episodes, the music becomes really annoying. In other cartoons, they have music that suits their mood and we do not often hear some songs. There are about 15 different soundtracks of Inuyasha. Do not waste your money with this garbage! <br /> <br /> And how do you think I know all this? Because I was a fan of Inuyasha. I am ashamed of myself. I would rather watch Kim Possible or Pokemon. Unfortunately, these two series have more romance between the two protagonists that Inuyasha will never have ...
