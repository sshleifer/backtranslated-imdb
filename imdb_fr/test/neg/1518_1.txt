I've always been a fan of Bottom, grabbing as many videos as possible from the show here in the United States. The chemistry between Rik and Ade is always great, and the combination of intelligent writing and completely stupid humor seems to work forever. So I sat down to watch this film with a lot of eagerness ... and I was completely disappointed by the end. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film can be described as uninspiring and misdirected (sorry, Ade!), but with moments quite brilliant. Unfortunately, these moments of laughter make you realize how much the rest of the movie is less than brilliant. The slapstick starts in a fun way, but ends up getting a little boring, with only the kinky jokes to keep the humor. <br /> <br /> The end of the film (the "green" scenes, for those who saw this) was ... maybe the worst end I've seen in the last decade. Honestly. It was a joke repeated about thirty times, followed by an abrupt end that made no sense (which did not bother me) and was not funny (which was). <br /> <br /> In summary, I was deeply disappointed by this film. I'm going to focus on the few brilliant moments it contains to keep the best memories possible ... but I must warn you that if you are about to pay too much for your NTSC conversion band from the local importer , do not do it. There is much better to spend your money.
