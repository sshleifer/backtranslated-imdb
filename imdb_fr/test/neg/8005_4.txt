The circus could have been so much better if it had reduced the number of twists and developed each best movie. The film has a very talented cast that usually works well, but it totally loses the audience. Basically, everyone is stabbing everyone and not behind. at the same time, because they stab someone else and work with ... did I lose you? Although the film is even more confusing, written clearly by an author of the first hour, it has some redemptive qualities, although in the game of actors especially Famke Janssen shines like Lily, but unfortunately gets a lot of screen time WITHOUT USAGE just standing up, doing nothing ..... the dialogue is a bit cheesy and the accents sometimes irritating, but it's always worth watching if you're a fan of any actor, especially John and Famke, who pass the most time on the screen, but do not forget to look at it with a notebook so you can note which is double crossing that every second ....
