OK, we have JP from Grandma's Boy and Chuck, well Chuck. I thought this film would be pretty good from the critics, and it started quite high up in the scale of my movie, but about mid-way it was so long that I kept losing interest . In fact, I was so bored, probably because you can see right away what will happen in the end; The story is actually quite thick, I jumped 15 minutes and I have not forgotten anything! This film should have been a short work, maybe about 45 minutes to an hour maximum. It starts well and ends well, a pity that the filling is bland, boring, dull and lacks everything except time. Some people say they like music; I do not care about jazz and I'm not going to see films for their score, I go for the story and when it stretches ... well, the notes drop in my book. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Good open, very close, boring filling. The story was cool, but if you do not know what will happen in the quarter, you have not seen a lot of thrillers.
