Trite and tiring, the one-liners almost made me cry. My 4 year old son left the room and ended up doing a puzzle. I do not know for what age group that was written, but the writer himself did not even want credit. As for the song, it's slightly amusing. At least it was ten years ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I have seen much more than that, they are always nice. Whenever this happens, I try to encourage my child to look at something else. A positive note, which allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1, is that it encourages good moral values. It would have been encouraging if someone had watched.
