Two days ago, I had the chance to watch this movie on cable (TV-Asia). I have been very disturbed since then. The film "Baghban" has been very successful in portraying only one aspect of real life. It's very biased towards parents. Have you ever thought about the other side (kids)? There are few parents in this world who give birth to their children but do not give proper parental care. I am a victim of this. Why do you (the parents) want to have 5 children in your life if you make only 2,000 rupees a month? I was working on the streets with my brothers and sisters. I do not know at all how I managed to reach the IIT from there. It's been a long time, but I still do not believe it. Now, I am a researcher here in the United States. I gave my parents all the necessities, with the help of my two brothers who stay with them. They could not provide us with basic things when we were kids. I find this film very resentful. It's very partial. This deeply hurt my feelings. I urge the producer / director of this film to look at Indian society from another point of view and to make another one.
