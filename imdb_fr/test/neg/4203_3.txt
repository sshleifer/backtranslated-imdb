I bought this DVD of Chuck Norris, knowing it was one of his first films, and it shows. We all know he will never win an Oscar for his role, but that's not why we're watching him. Although some earthquakes have occurred in California since the shooting of this film, there has never been a desert or hills between highways 99 and 5. Billy supposedly crossed 99 to 5 people a distance less than 15 km. I wish the writers, producers and directors of these films can at least look at a map. As a truck driver who spends a lot of time in California, I could tell from the start that the geography was bad. However, there is worse way to spend an hour and a half. So, take your Doritos and an adult drink and enjoy a trip back in time.
