Old Ed was active in the late 1950s. He was apprehended on November 16, 1957. The PR-24 police baton was invented in 1974. Yet the cops all carry the PR 24. At the time It would have been a Sheeze standard, if you want to make movies, do your research and do things right. In addition, he makes no mention of Ed's use of the body. He has tanned most of the hides and made various items, including a shade, a belt and several masks. He also had a wide selection of "narrowed heads" that many local children knew because he often kept for them. He was declared incompetent and incarcerated at the State Central Hospital for insane criminals.
