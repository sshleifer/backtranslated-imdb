The first twenty-five minutes are arguably the worst of modern British cinema. Director / Adapter William Cartlidge has treated Wilde's original with such reverence that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a film audience. Fortunately, the quality of management and editing has improved significantly after the first half hour, but the damage is done. Among the actors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast each time they are on screen. The other exceptions are Arthur, by Jonathan Firth, and Mabel, by Karen Hayley, who is left with enough leeway to deliver their replicas with the true sense of humor desired by Wilde. The apparent heads, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are in comparison dull and wooden. In an obvious attempt to earn every penny on a meager budget, the play was updated nominally for the 1990s, but in conjunction with the original script, the effect is more dramatic than a 1970s drama. True comedy moments are rare, but when they arrive are very entertaining - a sign, perhaps, that a more judicious pruning of the rest of the play could have led to a more rhythmic, more balanced film.
