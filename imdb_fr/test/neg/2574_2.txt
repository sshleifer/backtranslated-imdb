Seagal was totally irrelevant with this movie. I'm one of his fans and I'm now expecting nice fighting scenes and sharp liners, but this movie had none of that, but injections and old-fashioned music. Even if you are one of his fans, I strongly recommend you to stay away from this film and watch it in a state of siege or even on deadly ground.
