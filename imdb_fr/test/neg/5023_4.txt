To be quite frank, the popularity of this show saddens me. Inuyasha is certainly not terrible - there are some good moments, some flashes of intelligent humor and, unlike so many anime, dignity. However, it completely misses the essential elements of a story worth living. From the beginning, his premise condemns him to be stereotyped. The main plot is centered on collecting pieces of a broken jewel before they can be possessed by evil, and is, as one might suppose, a case of epic fantasy totally generic. The story follows a familiar pattern of fighting various enemies for pieces of the jewel. It is therefore quite predictable, lacks complexity and easy to lose interest. , realistic characters. Unfortunately, no one saves the story of Inuyasha. Kagome, the main character, is the stereotypical heroine of the anime (and reminds too much Akane, the main character of the previous book by the author of the comic Ranma 1/2); she is kind to other women, but deals with many men, especially her love interest, with an unjust, unthinking and unjustifiable brutality. Inuyasha is a hard guy on the outside, but soft on the inside, and Miroku is the lamentable character of the "pervert". <br /> <br /> The defects persist in what happens to this plot and these characters - namely, nothing. Despite the constant action, the story does not progress. Despite regular romantic moments, the main relationship does not do it either. Despite the time available, the characters never really change. And to add a cherry to the sundae of mediocrity, all this stagnation spans about 150 episodes. <br /> <br /> My last criticism about this anime is animation. Although it is certainly not ugly, it shows an almost disrespectful laziness on the part of the creators. The animators seem to rejoice in the long Inuyasha scenes jumping in the air whistling in the wind, in which they have little to do, but moving a background. <br /> <br /> his keyboard is perched with the fingertips, there is absolutely no reason to watch Inuyasha.
