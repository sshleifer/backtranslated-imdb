I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I have ever spent. It's LAME! I could not believe they could find something like this. <br /> <br /> The plot ... there is no plot. Whatever you expect it to happen, it happens, but in a worse way. The game was horrible. My dog ​​could have done better. Special effects have no effect except that they induce total disbelief. And the cheese lines ... I mean, why even bother? <br /> <br /> The only credit I can give to this piece of sh * t are the opening scenes. They were actually pretty pretty. And one of the reasons I decided to rent this. The illustrated graphics are probably the best and most realistic CG of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Total Reality gets 1 out of 10 so they can not score lower.
