I am rather surprised that anyone found this film touching or moving. <br /> <br /> The basic principle of the film seemed to me to be an excellent idea, although provocative, for a film about some kind of rare relationship, but one (if I can judge from the real examples that I I have known) is extremely deep and loving. <br /> <br /> However, the film is written at a good price - poorly written - and even if it has a number On very pretty shots, I did not find anything special. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is probably that he is too short and poorly composed to give his audience time to invest, emotionally, in the characters: we are not really interested in none of them, so their stress and their obstacles do not really affect us. <br /> <br /> I think a REMAKE - from the script up to ... with a development of character by very good writers - could greatly improve. It is instructive to compare this film with Brokeback Mountain, which the writers took to much higher levels than the script writer - writers who were clearly aware of how to write a classic tragedy and who fulfilled their task . with care, planning and superb work of artist! However, people only seem to redo those movies that do not need them! You will not really miss anything if you skip this one: I found it very disappointing, and it is only saved from receiving a star from me because of the audacity and courage it took to do a film about this sensitive subject. .
