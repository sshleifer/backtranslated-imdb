I understand that this is Llyod Kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was the wells. The whole movie is dubbed because the audio tape was undesirable. The voiceovers were so bad and so terrible. As much as I love Troma, they tend to be a bit heavy at work. The game was terrible. One of the things I liked about this movie was Trey Parker's quick reaction to joking with the aristocrats with a clumsy wig. There are many great directors in this film like James Gunn and Eli Roth (Lloyd Kaufman's friends). Once again, I think it was the Llyods' attempt to save a crappy movie and try not to lose thousands of dollars. I will not continue again and again, but this movie was a mess. Check out other Troma titles.
