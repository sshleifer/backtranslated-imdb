* This comment may technically contain "spoilers" but it certainly does not contain surprises * <br /> <br /> My cousin and I rented this last day in the hope of laughing a pretentious eccentric typical amateur of a horror movie. Unfortunately, we have not laughed too much and we are certainly not too scared. <br /> <br /> Description of the route: an airplane containing the daughter of a business leader and a strange technology is stuck in a head of our company brings together a team of personalities, rather than experienced hunters, to recover it. <br /> <br /> For the first 3/4 of the movie, things get pretty boring. These are mostly Big Foot shots lurking in the trees, members of the group sometimes hearing it, and making it seem like nothing. We also see several shots of the party from Big Foot's point of view, and he apparently sees in thermal vision. <br /> <br /> To set up the plot, we have to watch footage of the group sitting around the campfire talking about the possibilities of justifying the existence of sasquatches and actions. "maybe he can avoid bullets ... if he sees them coming". Indeed, we will see later. "Sasquatch may live on many unexplored lands, perhaps one of them has been neglected." And obviously it is. "Maybe the Sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members." And of course, that's the case. In addition to these scenes, there are some "Oh my god it's the sasquatch oh wait it's just you!" scenes, and unfortunately, they are among the scariest. <br /> <br /> Then, finally, people start to die. Well, 2 people at least. In addition, the bodies of past victims are discovered. The scenes of death are rather lame. Most of the time it's up to our imagination to show Sasquatch seize them, then move on to another scene, but first, we're entitled to horrific cries from the camera. <br /> <br /> We finally get to see her the final confrontation of the protagonist with the monster. I must admit that I found it very exciting as long as it lasted. But alas, his life was short-lived and we were treated to an end that makes a half-out-of-the-ordinary effort to look cryptic. Then a closing text with a rather boring conclusion. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I recommend this movie. It's not serious enough to give the Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it's certainly not scary and boring enough to make it a horror movie. Do not bother with that.
