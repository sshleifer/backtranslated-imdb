OK .. at the time of writing, 65 people voted for this film, which earned it a rating of 5 out of 10. In my opinion, only the film crew voted. I am here to do justice to all this. <br /> <br /> Never has a film provoked public intelligence like this. Since I laughed loudly - but the movie / story did not want me to do it. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of bad movies. A LOT. But man, this one rejects them all. <br /> <br /> Talking about 1996 computers, playing ridiculously, and doing wheelchair racing - and we have young Tarantinos who can not get funding for their ideas. Yes, life is a cruel joke.
