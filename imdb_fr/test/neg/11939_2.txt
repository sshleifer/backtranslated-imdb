I'm really not going to waste my time with an in-depth analysis, I'm just going to say that I'm extremely disappointed that Catherine Zeta-Jones made the mistake of playing the leading role in this absurd, nonsense full of boring cliches to death pathetic, thoughtless essay in cinema! There is no point trying to find the positive sides of this film, because on the whole it is poor in all respects, and the sad thing is that Zeta-Jones is so uncompromisingly trained in the clich√©s she has absolutely no chance to show even 1% of her talent! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, even on the occasion of spending the night at home with the wall !!!
