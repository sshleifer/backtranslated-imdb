Of all the Perry Mason films I saw after 1985, this one is my favorite. <br /> <br /> I admit that I never liked Diana Muldaur as an actress. She seems to know how to play only one type of character: a career woman bitten hard, with an indefinite chip on the shoulder, for which it is extremely difficult to sympathize in any way whatsoever. This one is no exception to the rule - its form is faithful. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this film, in my opinion, is a sincere performance of Scott Baio as a prosecutor - I found myself feeding him win, and the film is worth seeing for only him.
