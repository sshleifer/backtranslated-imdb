The movie was there for a lot. Good Acteurs (SergioCastellittoaparticular favori; il était excellent dans "Uomo DelleStelle" / "TheStarmaker" but was created by Giuseppe Tornatore, a great engineer for the opposition to a doctor who made this effort), but terrible, deceitful scenario, terrible and a designer who seems to have heard that he was going to say and finally said nothing. A slice of sloppy slots, but it's a movie genre that some Italian pseudo-intellectuels that I would like to get you to know in a little while, I'm not sure, Italy has no monopoly of them- ci, where I can find them partout you probably acclamer as a great chef-oeuvre. Je n'ai jamais beaucoup I thought of Bellochio as a designer. Je me souviens avoir vu are the premier film "PugniNella Tasca" / "Fists in the Pocket" (or a title of the genre) in Rome when it was a tournament for the premiere already 50 years ago (I've been here at the bottom of the " époque). I've had the usual pseudos in where I will go, but I've just let it down. I do not even think that I was three times in the midst of the time and did not make any changes. The age is certainly not ameliorated, and I film is one of your best.
