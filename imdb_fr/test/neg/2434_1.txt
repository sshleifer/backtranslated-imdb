I think it was a horrible mistake on the part of Disney. First, Kuzco does NOT need to go to "Emperor's School" to become Emperor! It never happened before. Secondly, the new voices do not look like the original ones at all. Very poor to redo. And while I loved the movie The New Groove of the Emperor, the new school is just stupid. Like all jokes are the same, and many are film. The plot becomes redundant, always Yzma (that's how you spell it?) Trying to become Empress, Kuzco preventing it, etc. Or Kuzco learning to become a better person. I think Kuzco is annoyed by his complaints and his constant questions. He's a spoiled kid and it bothers me. I do not think it's worth five minutes of your time, let alone half an hour.
