A waste of time, talent and space, it is a really catastrophic film. What are the big leagues such as Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Dan Aykroyd who waste their time in such garbage ?. The little criminal Reeves goes to the wedding of his brother (Vincent D'Onofrio) and ends up leaving with the bride. A comedy? Thriller ?, romance? Honestly, I do not know! Reeves is wooden in the lead and Dan Aykroyd as a policeman is so terrible that you have to see it to believe it! Only bright spot of a dark and dark tunnel is Diaz and even if it is not very good. Rent something else. All those involved in this mess should hold their heads full of shame and deny themselves, in order to be lost in oblivion in the years to come.
