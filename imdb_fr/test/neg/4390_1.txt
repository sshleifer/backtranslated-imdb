The box is the reason I originally bought this film and the back, which is why I rented it. But I soon learned that I had been fooled. I thought this movie would look like a Road Trip / Eurotrip / American Pie deal. But I was wrong. This movie is one of the most stupid I've seen in a long time. The unclassified version makes you look but will disappoint you completely. The acting was awful and the sound effects were just screaming. It seemed very small budget with all of the set up in the same building. Exit and take Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can not believe the National Lampoon gave its name to this subject. DO NOT BUY, DO NOT RENT. Do not waste 2 hours of your life on this.
