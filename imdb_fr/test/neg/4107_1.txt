A sound of thunder. One of the biggest short stories ever written. By one of the greatest masters of fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> But what film vomit! <br /> <br /> In Bradbury's sci-fi story, a company called Time Safari offers big game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule number one is Stay On The Path, a floating metal gateway that does not interact with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt, a man leaves the trail and inadvertently crushes a butterfly. When the group of hunters returns to the present, the world as it knows has changed dramatically. While there are paradoxes in all time travel stories, Bradbury's narrative was a quick feature, a parable of the ripple effect. <br /> <br /> A sound of thunder was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia, the most republished science fiction of all time) and illustrates the theory of chaos, Darwinism and the butterfly effect (which will only be invented only in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury's history, the wonder of time travel was eclipsed by corporate greed, itself eclipsed by the mortal danger to the existence of humanity itself. <br /> <br /> In the movie, A SOUND OF THUNDER (directed by Peter Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO), a group of bad actors walk the portal from time to time to try to rectify their mistakes, like a dung version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The film has nothing to do with Bradbury's powerful story, except for the initial shake-up of the group of prehistoric hunters traveling back in time. Bradbury's story takes considerable liberties - baboon-faced reptiles, plants invading Chicago concrete, waving waves in the city, CGI insectoids - for which Bradbury should sue the pants, panties and buttocks of the city. filmmakers. <br /> <Novel writers Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier are expected to create a Big Ball Agency because they believe they can add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that would improve it. How do these guys walk in a straight line with such big balls? Ben Kingsley is the owner of Time Safari, with a hairpiece that looks so much like a hairpiece, Edward Burns is his main hunter, Travis, and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough, in BRAVEHEART) is a scientist with the best breasts. <br /> <br /> I absolutely can not relate the hundreds of thousands of stupidities and insignificant pieces of dialogue, but here is an example, spoken by David Oyelowo as a kind of "scientist": he refers to the group Pleiades stars, "The Seven Sisters, they look like stars, are not they, but each of them is an entire galaxy." Uh, no, silly scientist, they are actually stars. <br /> <br /> These three morons who rewrote the story of Bradbury have forgotten that they knew nothing about physics or astronomy. Or writing. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick's chest struggling against her one-size Scottish blouse. <br /> <br /> --Review of Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).
