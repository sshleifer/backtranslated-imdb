A frightful and stupid film against corruption at the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be corrupt and incompetent. A member of the college's English department can only sign his name with an X. <br /> <br /> When it appears that a senator (Victor Moore) with an imperious complexion comes to the state to investigate , everyone tries to blame the innocent but insane character of Bob Hope. <br /> <br /> Is it any wonder that Vera Zorina did not get the role of Maria in 1943, "For whom does the knell sound?" <br /> Of course, the Corrupt officials accompanied by Hope are trying to show Zorina photos with Moore in order to ruin him politically. Moore marries the head of the restaurant he insulted when he asked for a ham sandwich. He thought the reason she was upset was that it was a kosher restaurant. This is the breadth of humor that characterizes this film. <br /> <br /> When Hope tries to defend himself in Congress, he takes off from James Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". At that moment, the film is too far to give a good answer. <br /> <br /> The music and the lyrics are absolutely terrible. This song praising Louisiana, sung in different ways, is absolutely terrible. Does Irving Berlin have anything to do with the music of this absolutely awful movie?
