Does not this sound a little familiar to you? Oh, wait, it's true .. 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been made in the TV series. What is the purpose of repeating yourself, you can ask? Is it to the advantage of Americans who have not seen the program? Are writers short on inspiration? Or maybe everyone on the set suffered a sudden amnesia attack and forgot that he had already covered this ground? Anyway, for someone who attended the first three shows, it was really boring. I had to extinguish it during the "tablets that turn your green water" part .. yes it's very funny, but give us something original for the sake of God! In fact, if the best thing you can find is Leonard Rossiter's on Saturday Night Fever, you can forget about it. <br /> <br /> The guy they had to replace the late Richard Beckinsale is a look-alike, but not half of the actor. Personally, I was exorcising the role as a sign of respect for him. Or better yet, do not bother making the film, just let the show's hilarity speak for itself. But no, they could not do that ... not as long as there was money to be made. Sad, really. 4/10
