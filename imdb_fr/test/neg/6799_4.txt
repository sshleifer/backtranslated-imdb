Bizarre. This film is supposed to be based on a famous photographer, but everything that happens in this film is fiction. I guess it tries to explain why Diane Arbus was fascinated by quirks and made her her main photography center. In the film, Wolfman settles over his. She becomes apparently obsessed with him and falls in love with him. She places her children and her husband in second position on the wolf-man and even attempts to incorporate him into his family reunions. Some of the Wolfman's Show series kicks come to visit her and she mingles with them. The whole thing is very weird. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Nothing unforgettable. There is just something strange about a woman pulling her tears from the werewolf's shave. I think you can find better movies there.
