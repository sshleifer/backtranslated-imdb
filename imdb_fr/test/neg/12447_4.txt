Do not be fooled by the "rewards" and the comment below. This is just 1 poor movie. The way George Katt played his character (the sweet gangster) makes him very annoying to watch. The conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic display. In the rest of the movie, the character's head seems to be elsewhere. His emotions do not match what is happening in the film. What he says in voiceover adds nothing to the film. This simply makes Zeus an even more helpless character with his head in the clouds. <br /> <br /> The story and the film were mounted with a total lack of fantasy. All parts of the film have been badly stolen from other modern filmmakers. Hope Jon Rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.
