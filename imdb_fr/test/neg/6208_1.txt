You talk about playing more ... !!!! not only by Govinda, but also by Salman and Lara ... The management was awful. The first half-hour, you'd almost want to turn off the movie..because this movie is a real joke (mark my words.) <br /> <br /> I liked Govinda in some of his comedic roles like Haseena Maan Jaayegi, Jodi # 1, Akhiyon is Goli Maare and Jis Desh Mein Ganga Rehta Hai, which does not compare to any of them. And Salman Khan should not play the role of comedian at all !! Andaz Apna Apna, brilliant alongside Amir Khan, is the only comic role he has played in comedy. <br /> <br /> There have been so many scenes of "too much nonsense" in this movie that make you want to take out the DVD and burn it so that no one else in your house will ever look at it again .
