The title does not make much sense to me. I do not know which door of the film should not have been opened. <br /> <br /> The film begins without incident, with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train wagon. , complete with the sound of the traveling train. In fact, the man's house is a train wagon and he has a cassette of train sounds. The woman leaves and calls a young woman. The young woman told her boyfriend, a doctor, that she was told that her grandmother was sick and that she had to go back to her hometown. She has not been there for thirteen years. <br /> <br /> Go back 13 years ago. A dark character enters a house. He caresses a sleeping girl, then goes to another room and stabs his mother. The girl wakes up and enters her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife. She screams and an arm comes out of nowhere and taps a hand on her mouth. She looks up in fear. This early scene in the killer movie stifling his cry, and the girl's gaze is one of the few effective shots of the film. <br /> <br /> There is not much to do in the Visual Department. Sometimes the sound is strangely used and in an attic, most windows are red and blue, there is a strange light. <br /> <br /> Back to our days. The young woman arrives at her grandmother's house. There is an old doctor she does not trust, with the man from the opening scene "Judge" and Kearn, the operator of the city museum. She does not trust any of them and it is true that they inspire no confidence. It is rather unpleasant throughout the film. She wants to check her grandmother in a hospital. The men of the city want his house and the museum operator wants to insert objects (his museum already contains many objects of the grandmother). Inexplicably, the woman wants to keep the house. <br /> <br /> The young woman begins to receive calls from a man who speaks in a sinister murmur. He makes various threats and wants her to act to wake him up. Such scenes often happen again. Unfortunately, there are so few characters in the film that the possibilities of knowing who it might be are limited. Worse still, we see from the beginning who makes the phone calls. Thus, while the young woman does not know it (even if the caller sometimes falls back into his normal voice), the public always knows it: no suspense. Each call shakes her more and more. <br /> <br /> The end was unexpected for me, so maybe I'll have points for not going with the obvious, but I'm not sure I care about anything.
