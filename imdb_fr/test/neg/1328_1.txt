The horror. The film about the Nazis - the Germans. The murderers of babies, the rapist girls ... For whom do they regret? What interests them thousands of miles from Germany? You do not come to mind is? Fascists are now good Samaritans? Think, killed, tortured, 27 million people. No, of course, they do not want to. They were forced to Hitler, he gave them to everyone and forced to kill: every fourth inhabitant of Belarus, all the Jews, the Gypsies ... killing the Slavs. The facts: At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, when they were captured by (German) fascists, they were provocative and shameless. We kill you all and so on. Since 1943, when they were taken prisoner, they suddenly became anti-fascist and peaceful peasants, forced to surrender to Hitler and personally. For such films should be put to life imprisonment for the glorification of fascism. <br /> <br /> If you want to see what they did, but you've already been to Stalingrad, watch the movie "Come and see" (1985).
