* Spoilers here * <br /> <br /> Where do I start, how silly was this movie? "People the size of a mole, living under the garden attacking the inhabitants of a big house" !!! When I first sat down to watch this movie, I did not know that the protagonists were not poltergeists, but 10-inch tall goblins that seemed powerful and easy to hit hard and far. I kept looking at it because I like to see the movies all the way, even the most awful ones. this movie was terrible. My girlfriend, who went to sleep for the first ten minutes, except that I thought he was a great help to sleep, thought it was hilarious to bother to watch everything. <br /> <br /> Tiny goblins even in large numbers (the thought is stupid, I know) are as scary and threatening as the flat cola. They only managed to fatally stumble a guy and kill a cat before they were exploded, The End. I mentioned it was bad, no?
