A film of "revenge" has something wonderful about it. Everyone wakes up in the morning thinking that he is the star of the "movie" and that anyone who interferes with his personal agenda is somehow the enemy. Revenge intrigue movies work especially well if a person has low self esteem. Rather than retaliate on the moment, the "hero" relies on accumulated internal anxiety to engage in a single act of power in order to restore balance. Naturally, in the "real world", this type of revenge rarely alleviates tension, because life is not a film; after revenge, the measures taken have their own consequences. A good revenge movie helps people to ignore this bitter pill. In movies, the end credits and responsibility are resolved. <br /> <br /> "Swimming With Sharks" is presented as a comedy, which is undoubtedly an act on the part of producers to find a way to sell this quirk. . It's dark, but it's not a black comedy ("Company Of Men" and Todd Solondz's works are getting closer). Some parts of the film are so brutal that they are earlier than the "torture-porn" genre that everyone is so obsessed ("Saw", "Youth Hostel"). There are laughs. There are bursts of laughter in "Saving Private Ryan" as well, but it's not a comedy. <br /> <br /> The intrinsic problem of this movie is that it did not win its revenge case. This is apparently a young man who is abused by his boss and who ends up taking his boss hostage to "pay him back" for all the abuse. The hero (aptly named "Guy") is an "ordinary man" so vague that we literally know nothing about him ... what does he do with his free time? Does he have friends / family? How did he get where he is? What are his interests (this becomes a common motif in the film, no doubt inspired by the filmmaker's own struggle ... "What do you want?", The answer to which we are denied by a wave, cheat of an end)? It is very difficult to deal with this character, even if he is well (even Tom Hanks becomes an insidious character, like "Punchline"). Kevin Spacey as boss, "Buddy", is supposed to be a monster but he is too charismatic as an actor. The biggest laughs came when he abused his assistant - he seemed almost as surprised that the audience is probably what Guy will endure. When Kevin's character is tortured, the point of view adopted suddenly becomes an empathy for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a mesmerizing monster without rationality. At this point, any message from the author had been lost; there is no "hero" in this film, ergo, no reason to worry about it. <br /> <br /> It is not an exaggeration to assume that this story is based on the author's own troubled career in the film industry. I worked for a similar boss and can guarantee that it is not so exaggerated. At that time, I had fantasies similar to fulfilling my wishes and I thought I was justified. I thought you could conquer the most beautiful woman in history (actually, the ONLY woman - there seems to be about four people in the universe of this movie), just by being your naive and impatient personality, this eagerness has been greeted. and that a boss abused you because he was a nasty person. Time and the tide have revealed the truth that most "monsters" are actually demons of an individual's personal psyche and that resentment is usually based on the ego. As the movie points out, if Guy was so unhappy, he only had to leave. The film offers no denouement, "surprise" despite everything. We still do not know anything about the protagonists, we can not even be sure of anything, and everyone will have their cake and eat it as if by magic. In summary, this story made no sense, except to point out that (the shock!) The film industry can be quite brutal. <br /> <br /> There are many good movies that tell a solid and satisfying revenge. fantasies of style, both the variety of well-being ("9-to-5", "Working Girl", "" The devil wears Prada ") and not so much (" War Of The Roses ", the remake of" The Hills Have Eyes ") This is not one of them - despite a fun tour of Benicio Del Toro as Emily Blunt of" Prada "and some interesting works by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, c is a frustrating, nasty, confused and slightly boring self-creation - the indulgence of a director who, we hope, has "settled everything" now ...
