This movie would probably have been good if it had not used computer-generated images (CGI) for wolf-like scenes. It gave the creatures a fake appearance and the werewolves looked caricatural. . Twister.But when we see a movie where the creature must look completely real, CGI is not the way to go.Look at an American werewolf in London.No CGI.Just, a makeup and a mechanical creature, and what you propose was more realistic This film offered some funny gags to watch and the humor of this film seemed to attract me but it's nothing more than a movie that I thought was OK and it's not good enough. In my opinion, an American werewolf in Paris does not resist the original.
