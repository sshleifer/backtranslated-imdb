Although this series and the mini-movie in particular were very important at the time of the film's release, I feel that the series as a whole was actually quite poorly written with a weak cast. The problems at the heart are extremely well portrayed, but it is difficult to understand and understand the problems of the film when the role play and the scenario are not convincing enough (especially when you watch the mini-movie). <br /> <br /> I do not believe either that this mini movie or this series has stood the test of time, because many scenes are quite laughable. The problems are still crucial, but Boys From The Blackstuff can not fully help the cause of understanding the problems in Britain in the 1980s.
