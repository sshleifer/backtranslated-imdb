1st seen 29/10/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Stephenson): A slightly entertaining story of a group of five children forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight and work during the First World War World. England went to war. They are told not to go into the greenhouse of the uncle's mansion, which of course they do again and again, and they discover a sand fairy to whom they wish every day that it only lasts until bedtime of the sun. This is the "IT" mentioned in the title, created by the group Jim Henson and expressed by Eddie Izzard. The problem is that their wishes usually lead to other problems that they are supposed to learn from. This part of the film is not very well done because it is obvious that the children, mainly the character Freddie Highmore, do not learn from them but continue to return to "that" to solve their next big problem. "IT" is not as funny as it could have been with comedian Eddie Izzard. He has not really been left with much improvisation and Kenneth Branagh is lost as an eccentric leader, although he is the best character. The kids are fine with their acting skills, but the story would probably have been much better to go to the fantasy world but they also had a human story to tell, which probably caused confusion with the filmmakers. So, overall, it was a decent film but could have been much better.
