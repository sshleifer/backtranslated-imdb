If you're like me and sometimes like watching terrible movies (I guess it's a bit like slowing down in a car accident), you can not do better than that! The plot is absurd, the special effects are hilarious and the acting is one of the worst you can see! 4 INCHES DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO !!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and the "actors" can sleep at night! It is painful, yet hysterically funny, to watch and I highly recommend it to those who want to punish themselves for something. If you can look at this shit without grinning, you are a better man than I will ever be! I wonder if the producer of this bin had any idea what he was putting himself (and his money)!
