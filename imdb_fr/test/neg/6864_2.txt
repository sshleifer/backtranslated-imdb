This film was a waste of celluloid on which it was printed. It's a disastrous scene, a bit like a particularly horrible train wreck. <br /> <br /> Seeing this is like trying to explain the meaning of life. The main plot is that the character played by Steve Guttenberg is a party animal who is not supposed to play, because that would violate his parole. The children with whom he befriends refuse to play with him as a coach for a while because he plays. BUT ... a few minutes later, once they have won the championship, a large sum allows them to save their shelter. Where did they get the money? GAMBLING!!! Add this to the scary scenes of the funeral home (why are there exactly bedrooms in a funeral home?) And the useless peripheral character
