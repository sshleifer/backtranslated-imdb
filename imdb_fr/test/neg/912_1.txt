The first 4 episodes of season 6 are just vomiting, predictable and the worst scenario I've seen. I hope I will not buy it. We have also seen during the seasons that these episodes of space they did are even more worthless. All I want to say to people who do this is: do not do a full episode on space, because they are afraid. The fact is that season 6 is even nil than previous seasons. It gets worse from season to season. I am so disappointed and frustrated to watch the first 4 episodes of Season 6 that I just had to write this. Only people who have brain washed can look at this shit. It seems that people who write the script get rid of ideas for a long time. Think my 2 year old nephew had a better idea of ​​the episode than these people.
