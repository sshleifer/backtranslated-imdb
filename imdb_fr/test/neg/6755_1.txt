I was completely misled by the comments on this film, mainly by someone who said they saw him at a film festival and loved every minute of it. Expecting this to be a nice series of American pie movies, I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the work of the camera is horrible, I do not think that the director knows that the cameras can move scenes rather than remain still and that the actors move from near and far of their own free will. <br /> <br /> Second, the landscape! My god, I saw more furniture in a bird's nest. The club was totally unconvincing with about 3 extras dancing in the background at a time. The apartments were bare and lacked personality. <br /> <br /> Third, the actors. Sensational. The director has obviously opted for the typical character of "Reaper", a wimpy main character with a gruff character "I do not give a f ** k" who takes shots in the hand. All the main character said and done was a chore, so much that made me wince. <br /> <br /> Overall, the plot, the supposed theme of revenge, lasted for about 30 seconds and lacked real motivation. The characters acted irrationally and do not seem to have any real relationship with anyone. No character had depth, they might as well have been cardboard cutouts walking in front of the static camera. <br /> <br /> A really horrible play, worse than a freshman, short of 2 minutes for youtube. Advice to the director? Change your name and refuse any association with the movie that will probably sell a copy at a garage sale in Ohio.
