If you want to see a horror movie that is horrible and very bad taste, it's really the movie to see. This film begins with two young teenagers who have crazy ideas to go to a chat room and go out blind. They are likely to end up as a little lamb at the slaughterhouse. A lot of blood, blood, nudity, handcuffs and all kinds of draining hooks and things you never dream of anyone can perform on men and women. If you like piercing, this type of piercing deals with heavy heavy hooks and many tattoos; in addition, many needles and thread to seal objects on the human body. I really hope this movie does not give a sick person in this world the idea of ​​playing these horrors in real life.
