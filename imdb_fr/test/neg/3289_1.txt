I finally managed to spend an entire episode of this show. I was very very tired. Clearly. Previously I had to turn it off because I thought it was so bad. Watching a full episode convinces me that it's really so bad. I could not even tell you what happened but I clearly do not remember laughing. For people who think it's the newest member of the family or married with children ... have you ever watched these shows? They are well written and well played and most of all, funny! This show is not funny. You may think this is the first sitcom you have watched. I do not know who else would do it. I echo all the previous feelings about Arrested Development, etc. It's probably my fault if I'm frustrated with television and do not watch it, allowing the stupid to dictate what's left live.
