According to Andy Warhol's portrayals in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat, this is the type of movie I predict Andy Warhol could do - airy, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The (almost non-existent) plot of the film, which is sometimes incredibly incredible, is counterbalanced by the film's rough and real cinematography. The film has a way of being unreal, while dictating reality to the viewer. The only interesting aspect of the film is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly and each element of it must be considered as a characterization tool. I recognize that some comic scenes are fun, but Trash is really just an uncomfortable, uncompromising character study if you're not bothered by nudity and i.v. drug use.
