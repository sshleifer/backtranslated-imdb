Fred Williamson, one of the two or three best stars of blaxploitation. Cynthia Rothrock, one of the two or three best American actresses. Imagine a movie with these two together for the first time! Now, imagine the worst movie that can be done with these two together for the first time. Welcome to "Night Vision". Of course, this film was shot in 1997 and they both had their peak, but that does not mean they did not have enough - they just needed the help of a good writing and direction. They have neither here. Rothrock manages to shoot a few shots towards the end, but this film is so awful that you probably will not be awake to see them. (*)
