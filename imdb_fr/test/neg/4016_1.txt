An "independent" film that, at the bottom of the box, promises twists, an adventure and an emotional adventure that we will never forget. This film also encourages us to watch it by showing Rachel Lee Cook with a lead role. After the first twenty minutes, you realize that this movie will not bring you anything. The story goes on aimlessly, revealing nothing new or important for us to remain interested. The three characters "disturbed" have only small stories to force us to take care of us. By the time you come to the end, everything about history is changed and instead of helping the audience catch up, you have no idea or, more importantly, no interest in "why" . The director, who also thought it would be a good idea to play the role of co-star, seems to be entering the film without any prior experience or knowledge of making useful films. The whole room looks like a college "art" movie designed by a first-year film student trying to hide a lack of real talent.
