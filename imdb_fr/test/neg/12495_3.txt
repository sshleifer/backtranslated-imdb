CyberTracker is set up in Los Angeles in the near future when bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'The Dragon' Wilson) saves Senator Robert Dilly (John Aprea) from an assassination attempt perpetrated by a group known as UHR, the Union of Human Rights, who is angry at Dilly for spearheading the computerized justice system in which robots called CyberTrackers are sent to determine and bring justice to the guilty. Anyway, Eric saves Dilly who is very impressed and decides to see if he can trust Eric in his shady activities like the cold-blooded murder of a traitor, being the handsome guy he is Eric is not impressed when Dilly kills a woman and is told to keep quiet. Eric escapes and tries to kill Dilly. However, Dilly has a lot of powerful friends and he uses his influence to trick Eric and have his CyberTrackers chasing him ... <br /> <br /> Co-produced with directed by Richard Pepin I think movies like CyberTracker give a bad name to the movies, I did not like it at all. Jacobsen Hart's screenplay is quite predictable, it does not excite, it steals most of his ideas and themes from other better sci-fi movies and the intoxicating mix of martial arts and science action -fiction that gels badly. There are some fights, some car chases and some shots on goal, but all this is rather bland and forgettable. The film lacks imagination because it takes place in the future and deals with robots, technology, the way society is run, and its justice system in particular. Speaking of which the fantastic Robocop (1987) brilliantly mixed his violent action with his intelligent social commentary, CyberTracker did not even attempt to make a relevant social statement or attempt to describe a meaningful moral message about the law application. Robocop also has robots and shoot-outs, but has also managed to include a good story. In CyberTracker, there is very little that I can say that is entertaining and that's what movies are. <br /> <br /> The director Pepin is fine, but nothing is remarkable, it's a bit forgettable and it's not really exciting. The elements of science fiction are nothing more than the robotic side of things and overall, the film does not look as futuristic. The action scenes are good, there are cars exploding and filming but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> Technically, CyberTracker is average, for a film supposed to take place in the future, it already looks aged and the special effects are mediocre. The acting game was bad, I wonder if Don 'The Dragon' Wilson signed checks with that name? <br /> <br /> CyberTracker was a waste of time, nothing original or exciting here and the action is instantly forgotten. Bad & that's all that needs to be said, not recommended.
