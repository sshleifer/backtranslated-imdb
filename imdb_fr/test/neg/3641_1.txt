Well, where do I start? I can not even imagine this so-called pathetic excuse for a show. Imagine this: a boarding school, where children whose parents have money just throw them to go around the world. It could not be more evil than that. <br /> <br /> If you teach these children, do not even improve them by calling them teenagers, because they do not even behave like sensible homosapiens, were egocentric, think again. . About 23 minutes filled with their so-called problems, boy problems and others. <br /> <br /> The heroine of the show, of course, Miss Zoey, played by Polly Pocket, Britney's All Little Miss I'm This sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, obviously has a lot to learn about the craft actor. However, I will give it a face, because its superficial, one-dimensional character does not leave much room for depth. She plays the sun, the moon and the stars of the Pacific Coast Academy, a cross that fights for the condition of all women and equality for all genders. <br /> <br /> Perfect in all cases, always with her two loyal followers, Nicole, the daffy bimbo, who obviously has too much money from dad, and Dana, who is a tough guy, is a tough to cook. Both left the series in seasons 2 and 1 respectively, not that I blame that. But the horror of horrors, Lola arrives, who considers herself the greatest actress since Natalie Wood, with green feathers in her hair and a fake tan. She's even more impolite than Zoey herself, if that's possible, and even more silly than Nicole, and we know it can not be possible. <br /> <br /> This show, like all the excuses of Nickelodeon television is a major victim of stereotypes. Gather the girl next door and clutched at her best friend's feelings for her Zoey, a great friend, though sometimes inarticulate, her best friend, Chase, a cool and arrogant lady, Logan, a boy and a girl crazy about clothing, which is not very bright, Nicole, the one that everyone thinks is strange just because she is extremely smart, the nerd, Quinn, the perfect model for Malibu, Lola, too dramatic, boring and yet super slim , and the woman at once hard and soft, Dana. Now, where have I heard these characters before? I'm sorry, but what's the problem with having a personality? Just because Quinn is passionate about science and concerned about her future and her academic success, which should also be of concern to others, she is "weird" and "nerd"? At the beginning of the series, Lola proved to be a good potential character with her sneaky manners and different perspectives, Zoey just had to get out, get out your forks, burn her at the stake, she was going back to Weird Town and all the rest. this jazz. So much for women's rights. Unfortunately, Lola is simply no longer another clone of OC, in all her anorexic glory. Probably not to overshadow his mistress. <br /> <br /> But hey, the 2000 generation of MySpace whores seem to like him with the typical Chase / Zoey fairytale novel, the tension between Logan and "hot", Logan and "hot" kick- ass "Zoey or Dana, at your convenience, and the pretty people Please, this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism, they prefer a pretentious, superficial and tasteless lifestyle. to tell you this will not happen unless you have a large trust fund and parents to protect you.
