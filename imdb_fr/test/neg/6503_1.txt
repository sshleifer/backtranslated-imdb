ABC is preparing its repertoire company for another unrealistic portrayal of rural Australia. Yes, everything is there. Baca Bourke (Jeremy Sims, talented actor) Hero of the fire, Lill (Libby Tanner plays Bronwyn Craig in the bush), bitch of the city of Fifi (Nadia Townsend), takes the brother of Baca, Joe (I think). Then there's Uncle Geoff, the grand father of Lost Springs. Uncle Geoff's scenes resemble Tennessee Williams in speed. The only thing that saves is the Russian actress Natalia Novikova in the role of Loony Missus. She is awesome. I do not understand why John Waters took the job as Lilly's psychologist husband. Must need the money I'm waiting for! Still, it will not last long because Lill and Baca will be absolutely right. Just look at this lemon to see how bad an Australian show can be. Frankly, I'm ashamed.
