I did not have much hope for this one. Before seeing it, history shouted to me a "stereotype". <br /> <br /> I mean ... come on! It's so stupid the plot about the innocent android that realizes that the people who created it are immoral and then decide to change everything. <br /> <br /> I had to see him three times. I fell asleep the first two times because it bothered me so much. It's very rare that movies bother me so much that I fall asleep during their movie. The third time, I forced myself to look at it, just to be able to warn people about it. <br /> <br /> I had the clear impression that the makers of this mess had tried to take all things cool / neat from other scifi / action movies, and bring them together to make a movie ! They took the android / robot, a lot of action, a thin story, stereotypical characters and a great fight in the end and threw it together. Unfortunately, the film is nil. The acting is so much wood that you could build a house, the scenario / scenario is absolutely laughable, the filming and editing are horrible, the direction does not exist, and to top it all, everything is so cliche and ridiculous that it you are angry. <br /> <br /> I still had the feeling that I could have spent the time watching this one do something much more creative, like cutting my nails or watching the grass grow. .
