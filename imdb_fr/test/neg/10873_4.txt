Director / director Larry Bishop has tried far too hard with Hell Ride. The film wants to be edgy, witty, provocative, bizarre, biting all that, apparently in Quentin Tarantino / Rob Zombie style. But it's not angry. References seem forced. The dialogue tries to be intelligent and fails. Humor is never funny. Try to set a hard tone but we should be concerned about the characters or the story so that they can succeed at a distance. <br /> <br /> You only have nice Harleys and pretty girls surrounding a group of tired, old and out of shape "bad boys" in what looks like an attempt to make a modernized western Sergio Leone. If this film can interest the new generations to films of the 60s and 70s, we congratulate it. But on its own, it is rather boring and irrelevant. I think there is a place for style on substance. But this film is not.
