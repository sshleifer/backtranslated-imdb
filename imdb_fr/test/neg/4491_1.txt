I suspect that this forum will soon be full of comments from overly emotional people praising "Dear John" as a "pearl" and a "roller coaster ride", as well as all the other vague words that the film's target audience uses. usually. <br /> <br /> I'm certainly not the target audience of this film, but I do not hate romantic dramas either, as long as they are well done, here is my goal: the film. <br /> This is not good. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie either. But the plot meanders, the development stagnates where it should have gone (to be more precise in the middle), and as for the end ... we almost had the impression they were short of ideas, so they suddenly said, "Hey, let's shoot one last scene very quickly, let's put a sentimental soundtrack on it, and finish it that way." Even the beauty of Amanda Seyfried could not save that. Channing Tatum also gave a good performance, but you can not do more with a flawed script. <br /> <br /> About music, it is unbearably predictable and kitschy. From the singer folk schtick to the smoky and irritating voice (certainly chosen to appeal to the majority of university girls who will go see this film) to the combo overused "brilliant strings and piano", this only annoys those who pay more pay attention to the film as a whole rather than its own "feelings". The film has a good start and the major conflict that throws us into the second act was promising. So was part of the second act itself, as the story unfolded. Then the movie just dropped the ball. Beyond that, I should give spoilers. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" is not a bad movie, but it does not work as it should. If you want to see a really moving movie about the long-awaited love waiting to be reunited, go see "Notebook", which was really superb.
