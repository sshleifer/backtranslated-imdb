Sensational !! I did not even know this movie before looking for the name of another classic Mark Hamill (Time Runner). Some things are better left unknown. The role of Mark Hamill is pretty ... limited. I would compare his appearance in this film to all the appearances of Vincent Price and Christopher Lee in these bad horror movies of the 60s and 70s. In these movies, they appeared in the first and last 5 minutes of the film. Mark played a memorable role with phrases such as "Do not try to run, you are under arrest." Did I mention that he said this thing EXACT more than once. Bill Paxton fell into a spiral of drugs and alcohol after Aliens, because he found himself in this movie after waking up on the set after a binge. Hair .. hair !!! .. Bill Priceless. Really, should have been "GAME OVER" for Bill .. but anyways ... he got treatment .. and kept getting better ??? movies. This film is blowing. It's duller and boring than The Crazies. At least, this movie was crazy ... it's just boring. DO NOT WATCH THIS SOBER FILM.
