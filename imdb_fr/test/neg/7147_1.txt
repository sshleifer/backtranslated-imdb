Throughout this film, I continued to wonder why they did this as a "documentary", without actually including actual images of the interviewees. Of course, it would have been like any other documentary, but it would then be up to the filmmakers to find the meaning of the film's broadcast. <br /> <br /> Using a host of well-known movie stars (many of whom have apparently asked to be represented) to describe "real" people have given me the impression that there was a predetermined message to convey, and the director was so fond of it, that the real and repeated scenes were used. (Yes, I know it was also a play, but a documentary should be a documentary.) I was really shocked by the different stars and I did not have the expectation that any of them give up a character and say, "I am This is a good person because I am there." <br /> <br /> This movie could have been the subject of a much more powerful social commentary had been more objective or if we saw Matthew Shepard and his murderers as people rather than symbols. (The very superior "Boys Do not Cry" had an unshakeable view of the people involved - good and bad.) Instead, the Laramie Project gives an almost relentless lecture on the fact that someone's sexuality should be accepted despite everything and pretty much anything else.
