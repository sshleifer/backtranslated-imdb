In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown - an unproven actor who was playing in one of his early films. And, because he was a stranger, the film they gave him was clearly a B movie - a fast film with relatively low expectations. After seeing it, I understood why it would take several more years in Bogart AND another movie studio before becoming a household name. Even if the film is not terrible, it is certainly not good, which makes it more of a curiosity than today. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a pilot who dreams of building his own aircraft engine. business. However, when a rich and empty girl comes to him, her dreams all seem to be suspended. As one of the characters in the film said, the combination of both looks like water and water - they do not mix. <br /> <br /> As Bogart throws off a promising career, her sister goes on the road to Skankville at full speed - after meeting a sordid guy who convinces her to sleep with rich men so they can shake it for tons of money! Bogey has no idea that her sister is NOT the actress she claims to be and does not realize later that the rich woman he loves is leaving him for the same type whose mistress is .... sister of Bogart !!! All this leads to a reasonably pleasant finale. However, what follows is one of the most stupid scenes I've watched in a long time! Now, the rich lady is not going to marry the sleeping guy with Bogey's sister (phew!), But because she's poor now and she's bad for Bogart, she's about to fly and commit suicide. Bogey discovers it, pursues the plane on foot, jumps on the plane as it takes off and crawls along the fuselage to take control of the plane and save it !!! It's so ridiculous and ridiculous that I found myself laughing aloud. Until then, I might have noted 4 or 5, which has made the film to 3 (a commentator has assigned an 8, it exceeds me). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it was a talking and silly movie. In addition to that, everything is wrong for Bogart, because the action hero at the end and the mocking lover are horrible matches for his character who was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. The man and the solid will suit man better - one of the great American actors but clearly out of his element. <br /> <br /> By the way, those who love pre-code movies and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one. Virtually everyone in the film believes in and practices pre-marriage sex and Bogey's curses in the film - things you would never have seen after the adoption of the Reinforced and Moralist Code of Production in 1934.
