There is not much to say in the end. We could have expected much more from a director who had made much better films in the past. It just seems like he did it without really worrying. The actors do their job (although Belmondo is far from incredible), but you do not get hooked. In a word, it's boring. It's even more disappointing since I've heard many times that this movie could be seen as a reaction to all the big American blockbusters, which are considered a threat to the French exception by those who just can not admit that they should turn to one another. employment. I tell you, if this is the best reaction we are supposed to have, my boy, I will be very depressed soon ...
