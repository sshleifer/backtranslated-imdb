This film is filled with sentimentality, unprofessional flights that cringe like a pilot, and irrelevant material. Why present Rachel, for example? It has absolutely nothing to do with the film, except to allow him to continue his van "Follow Me" and crash against Dorinda's fence. This must be one of the most stupid sequences among many others in the film. Another is at the end when the plane (a B-26 or an A-26? Both designations are used in the film) is left with spinning accessories and no shim in place. This of course serves the plot, but revealing it would commit a dreaded spoiler. In the current state of things, the plane would have started to roll without control. The end (again, avoiding the spoilers) involves far too much discussion - as at the beginning of the sound films in the 30s with all the final speeches. Here, Dreyfuss babbles again and again. The end also includes other radical violations of the aircraft protocol and some improbabilities / impossibilities that I will not describe. What a boring and disjointed effort!
