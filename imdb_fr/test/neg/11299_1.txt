Synopsis: The sequel to the famous Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails; not only is he not as intelligent as his predecessor, it's not even a splash, a suspense or a horror movie, but a totally boring loss of time. Do not be fooled by the hype of the media, especially the stories of people throwing to the cinema and healed mentally for the rest of their lives because of the brain-eater scene: in the movie, it looks like a SFX ridiculously bad. Why do so many people in this forum claim that H is "not so bad" and that "deserves to be watched on the big screen", etc., it's beyond me; and it's not "so bad it's good" either, it's just boring. I normally respect the opinion of others, but in this case, I must say that they clearly can not say **** of Shine - Ola. They may have fallen prey to the hype, perhaps they have never seen a Ridley Scott movie and were they impressed by its excessive use of background lighting, smoke, and the many AC fans. He is totally devoid of suspense; Instead, we have countless scenes of Lecter flying over an English speaking Firenze, a totally unconvincing and elusive plot with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing H, I woke half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot, and when I wrote them, I quickly filled 6 pages in small print before forcing myself to stop). Rather than waste your time and money on seeing it on the big screen, I would advise you to wait until the film goes on television in a few years; and then go to bed early. <br /> <br /> 1 / 10. <br /> <br /> Below are some additional bones that I have to choose with Hannibal: <br /> <br /> - This is the continuation of SOTL, despite what some people claim from this forum. And even though SOTL was a very difficult act to follow, there are sequels that resemble those of their predecessors (SOTL itself was the sequel to Michael Mann's "Manhunter", based on Thomas Harris' "Red Dragon", and even the first, the episode was a very nice movie, SOTL was even better, another example would be the Alien series initiated by H's director, Ridley Scott - both for the descending suites theory. next is not an excuse for a film that is only crap. <br /> <br /> - This movie has a renowned director, it is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the cast is strictly a list, excellent cinematography, a big budget, top-notch screenwriters, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is just a fart in the church, so what went wrong I think that the producer of the film, Dino DeLaurentiis, must be held to re Here is my interpretation: DDL produced "Manhunter" which, despite all its qualities, was a commercial failure. Disappointed, he gave free rights of the character Hannibal Lecter to Orion, which allowed Jonathan Demme to do the SOTL. The rest belongs to the history of cinema. DDL then had to wait another ten years (he is now 81 years old) until Thomas Harris finally offers the rest of the novel. I think at this point, DDL had lost interest in making a good film and was desperate to finally get his piece of cake before bursting his cap. <br /> <br /> - Another aspect that bothers me greatly This film shows that it is the subject of undue publicity hype in the media; I mean, it's boring, but one of the most profitable productions to date, so there's no need to give it free publicity. And although most critics insist on the drama of the scene in Florence and the reason why Jodie Foster did not participate, the mere fact that this film is a final flop is not mentioned. But there is more: Hannibal is not only in a rage, it is also used to set the media agenda of a plethora of "documentaries" (usually the remains of similar productions in the wake of SOTL) on the serial killers. , cannibalism and profiling. However, not only does H not even pretend to be realistic; Lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer (he only kills by necessity or to help Clarice Starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so it's not necessary to create a profile) and there is no more cannibalism: Lecter feeds the brain of his drug addict, which makes him unconscious in vivo - self - cannibalism. Try to make a documentary from that. <br /> <br /> - There has been a lot of talk about the actor: mainly if Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (lead Hannibal Lecter) is generally given a lot of praise. I think all these discussions are debatable. There are several of my favorite actors in this movie (ie Liotta, Oldman and Moore) but the script just does not give them anything to work with. Ditto for Hopkins: his character does not develop and he is in no way challenged. And by the way, he's playing almost identical characters in all his movies, except that in H, he has to commit murder and gets the $ 11 million to do it.
