As someone has already said, the Living Dead Dolls are cute and if they came out as a new series of little Wicked things, I would buy one or two. Basically, this film was dark, not in a scary sense but in the sense that I can not see it. And it was boring. Three women in a house, the youngest having been ordered not to go into the woods (in any case, it did not sink in) and it would have been better if this advice implied their death. And if no one cleans or whitewashes or anything like that, you'd think it's going to cause a lot of coughing. A sexy young mother where you waste your time trying to determine her age (according to my calculations: 34 or 36). And it seemed like it was more than 20 years since someone lived there. older album? I am so tired of clichés that writing is lazy, and here they arrive quickly and well. Teens get screwed and get drunk in the car and you know where that leads ... death and apparent deafness too, while Tim seems oblivious to the howling of his friends. I mean, I pushed a lot of cars where the instructor did not scream and I heard them. Cliché strange man in the woods that nobody believes. Plumber who has lived in these neighborhoods for years, is his first experience with the said children. He avoids driving a young man in the middle of the night with a pickaxe. Cliche ... wandering in the woods without having any idea where you are going, armed with the knowledge that children holding up a pickaxe (yes still them) are outside. Insane scene of brutalization of the pig ... why do so many filmmakers see no problem of mutilation and slaughter of animals? I would have seen the kids running and biting their thighs better than that. Zombies do not seem to have as much energy in other movies. Was the villain inefficient? Her big role was in the store .. coming in and demanding to be served first. What an eventful man he was. Why not kill him earlier, before the family arrives and avoid shooting the film or doing it differently. I give my marks at home, woods and small Gothic figurines that I want!
