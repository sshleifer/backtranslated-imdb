It was a horrible and boring film, even for a documentary. Sometimes it gave a glimpse of life and presented humorous moments, but overall it was not worth seeing. Whenever I began to feel sympathy for Mark and hoped he would succeed, I became disappointed by his lack of responsibility and abuse of drugs and alcohol.
