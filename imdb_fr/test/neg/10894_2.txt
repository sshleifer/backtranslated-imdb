This film tells the story of a young couple who fled to start a new life in LA, which ends up being tracked by a psychopath at a deserted rest stop. In fact, it's really just about the girl (Nicole), since her boyfriend literally disappears in a few minutes. The film moves very fast, and at the beginning, you wonder how he could possibly extend his story. You'll quickly realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with useless scenes that lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> The story is not only thin as paper, it is also unstructured, stupid and incoherent. A few minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and her car, Nicole finds a mobile home at the rest area. She sees a flashing camera and SAVE people are inside, but she easily gives up seeking help when no one answers her door. After being informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger, she goes around the rest stop doing all kinds of stupid and useless things. This includes turning on a television (and even looking amused when she thinks she's stumbled upon a porn movie, even in this appalling situation), sitting, wandering and drinking a bottle of alcohol for hours. She does all this KNOWING that her boyfriend has been kidnapped, that the murderer is still free and harassing her, and taking no steps to ensure her immediate safety (she does not bother to lock the doors or remain vigilant ). Oh yes, she tries to use the radio to ask for help, but why not worry when there is a mobile home with people inside, there at the breakpoint? It really seems that the writer has forgotten this important fact by writing this part of the story. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of trap or danger always present in this story. The heroine walks freely around and around the various buildings in the rest area, and the killer only occasionally scares her, before leaving. Nothing prevents Nicole from taking off simply (even if the point of rest is far from anywhere else, it's better than sitting), but she chooses to stay anyway. At one point in the film, the main character RECOGNIZES that she can run away, but does not. <br /> <br /> The story is not going anywhere, but just going from one segment to another. Finally, Nicole enters the mobile home and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of religious fanatics sheltered, probably consanguineous or psychotic. They seem deliberately ignorant or indifferent about the killer's actions (but nothing indicates that they are related to him in any way), and then see Nicole after several minutes. <br /> <br /> In the next irrelevant segment, the main character walks into the bathroom building. She discovers one of the previous victims of the murderer (a young woman named Tracy), still alive and locked in a closet. For some strange reason, Tracy begins to vomit ridiculous amounts of blood. Nicole goes off to get a crowbar to open the closet door. When she returns a minute later, Tracy and her pool of blood are gone without any explanation. What was the goal? Nicole finds a notice board showing many missing people and finds Tracy gone in 1971. So, was Tracy a ghost? The writer never has to explain. <br /> <br /> Then, a policeman arrives in the middle of the night to go to the police station at the rest stop, which was left unattended for the whole day. Nicole tells him everything that happens and when the killer arrives in his truck in front of the office, the policeman goes out to confront him. What does the police officer do, knowing that something is really wrong? He rises and speaks calmly to the killer (whom Nicole had even indicated as the guy who was lying in wait for her), and accepts the lie of the killer he was driving simply and needed directions. Seriously. The policeman then speaks to Nicole outside, totally unconscious as the van turns to overthrow him. <br /> <br /> The cop begins to quickly tell Nicole that he is a goner who has "the chance to breathe", but he strangely does not die for a while. The two of them talk more for no reason, and the very important fact that he owns a gun is annoyed in a boring way, even for a long time. When the two of them end up trying to use the weapon, Nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets by firing blindly on a door while the killer may be behind. While he has two bullets left, the policeman asks Nicole to use one to euthanize him. She draws one in her mouth and remains motionless for a few moments, a piece of her head being expelled. Then, suddenly and inexplicably, he shouts, "You missed!" and she must shoot him again. Attempt to shock completely cheap. <br /> <br /> Nicole ends up fighting the killer - and fails. The film ends with a scene that unfolds shortly after, with a woman arriving at the rest stop now strangely more active. In the bathroom building, she hears Nicole screaming for help in the closet (locked up like Tracy). She asks a police officer to come in and check, but he finds a closet apparently normal and clean. The cop leaves, thinking that he has been deceived. We see a battered Nicole coming out from behind boxes in the closet (she would have easily been spotted if the cop had spent 10 seconds watching), apparently too stupid to have said or done anything while the policeman was there. WOW. <br /> <br /> This film is apparently the first of a new range of "quality" movies directly on DVD, marketed as being too extreme for cinemas. In fact, it's even more clich√©, B-Movie garbage.
