I will start by launching the film. Remove Abbott and Costello from the cast and you get a poorly colored film, a rigid cardboard from the distribution department, a badly doubled sound (especially during the singing!) And an annoying dialogue (for example, listen to the line "Mr. Dinklepuss" infinitum). Clearly, some movie studios thought they could enjoy Disney's classic "Mickey and Beanstalk" presentation, but the audience was perhaps more gullible at the time (improbable) or stuck in a double line (more likely). Even children should feel insulted to see this film shown to them. A total waste of celluloid. Now let's talk about the role played by Abbott and Costello. Bud Abbott always played the right player and, in every way, was the nicest person on the board. On the radio, his character was usually the quick talker, and was particularly funny when his speed led him to erase his lines and iron out his mistakes. In the movies, he always plays the straight man, but is no longer a crook. Not that it is bad, but this character was played to perfection by Groucho Marx. The real parody of the duo on the film is Lou Costello. Once again, on the radio, he was funny. He played a character a bit slower than Abbott, but not too slow! He was also casual with the aftershocks and he made me laugh when he indulged in Abbott's mistakes. On the film, I do not know if it was his decision or not, but in the movies, his character becomes a usurpation of Stan Laurel, which was done even worse by Jerry Lewis. Why this change? He was funny on the radio when he was smart- but here he becomes a child character that looks like an assault on the cameras with every shot. this characterization is shown in every film they make and only stains the reputation they had on the radio. What's left of their film career is a mediocre (very, VERY mediocre) copy of Laurel and Hardy. The films would have been a lot more fun if they had played their characters on the radio instead of a casting retreading.
