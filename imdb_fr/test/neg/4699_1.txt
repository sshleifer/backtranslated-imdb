This film contained all the ingredients of a good adventure movie, but revealed incompetence on almost every level. <br /> <br /> The presence of Roger Moore in the list of actors is usually a sign that the film is not going to be anything more than mediocre, because Moore still has leading roles and he can not act. But this film also had Ian Holm and Lee Marvin, and was based on a book by Wilbur Smith, so I thought I might give him a chance when I saw the DVD for sale in the trash box. . <br /> <br /> It was a mistake. The opening scene seemed to start in the middle of a reel, the sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been truncated. The scene showed a dreadnought at sea with a German crew. This bad montage was a sign of things to come, but the scene with the dreadnought was interesting enough to keep me looking. The special effects were good, and the crew wore the appropriate uniforms and spoke in German, which indicated that the director had at least paid attention to the historical details. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> So I kept looking, then Moore appeared and my supicions were confirmed. Bad acting, clichés, clichés of cinematography and cheap humor ... but, worse yet, there is a disastrous attempt to associate the light atmosphere of the film with serious drama and tragedy. It just does not work. <br /> <br /> The film ends as suddenly and as badly as it started ?? in the middle of a coil.
