There was not much thought in history on many fronts. It's a good action movie but that's about it. <br /> <br /> - The film claims that lycans were kept to protect vampires during the day. Yet they are kept in cages and have a necklace on their necks. Thus, they can not turn into a wolf or do anything that another slave can not do. How does it protect vampires during the day? Who do they protect vampires from? The uncontrollable lycans? Slaves in human form are only peasants. <br /> <br /> - I understand that vampires are immortal and do not grow old. However, Sonya ages from child to adult. Do they stop aging at a certain age? I understand that Viktor is old because he was shot (as explained in the second movie). But are vampire babies getting older? Strange. <br /> <br /> - I did not know that vampires needed torches to see the night. Yet we see them carrying torches throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Silver was the only thing supposed to hurt Lycan. Yet the wooden steaks from the huge crossbows also kill the lycan. <br /> <br /> These are just some of the things that reflect a lack of thought.
