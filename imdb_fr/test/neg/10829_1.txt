Why can not there be better TV movies? I was at the end of the day today and watched this film on a satellite channel in the UK. What a terrible waste of time it was. Bad scenery, poor actor & Oh my god what a terrible flood. Blimey, this woman can even exceed a torrent of water too. <br /> <br /> I really want people to make movies for television with better effects, better or more credible intrigues and better acting. Killer Flood is up there with a bad acting quality. Some pieces of ham could not do any worse. <br /> <br /> 1 last thing that I really share with the comment on the dog, but I think it would already be better in real life!
