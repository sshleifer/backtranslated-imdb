Why this is nothing but Ator has played hilariously with Miles O'Keefe. Surprisingly, I had the misfortune to witness this turkey before Mystery Science Theater 3000 tore it up. I highly recommend viewing MST3K as it is hilarious and one of the best episodes of her life. <br /> <br /> This film is in itself the kind of film typical of film B that Italian filmmakers produced in the early 80s. This film was apparently designed to take advantage of the craze for Conan, but it fails miserably in all respects. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on the scenes where Ator fights a giant rubber snake and hangs up during a cut. <br /> <br /> "String, the fish is ready!" <br /> <br /> Note: the film itself-1 The MST3K version: 10
