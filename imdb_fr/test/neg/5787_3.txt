The contemporary chapter of the elite submarine demolition team of the US Navy is called to do what he wants, apparently. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen was appointed officer. The scenario is already incredible. Michael Biehn is his immediate captain, but he's holding Charlie on a long enough leash and one of the guys is paying him early for being killed by Charlie's patented stupidity. The rest of the team spends their free time committing offenses at courts martial. It is essentially an exercise involving a random spark and an unscrupulous ethic. These particular seals could best serve as dummies for crash tests. <br /> <br /> Good action scenes counterbalance crazy procedures.
