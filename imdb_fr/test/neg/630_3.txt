I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after spending a few weeks (fantastic) at the university myself in Barcelona. The premise is right at the right time - a confused and disordered young person enters a world of young people who are also confused and disordered. But the director's weaknesses in symbolism, philosophy, and social commentary were completely false, and this leaves the viewer confused and disorganized. Bravo. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if this film had been presented as a European film "American Pie", I would be able to get by and keep playing. But from the beginning, the director piques our deepest senses by introducing the symbolism of twisted highways and the dichotomy of the "inner self" in relation to the "public self" (his "mother tongue" in relation to his "secondary language") . . In addition, he tackles the subject of racial / national stereotypes with audacity. An interesting start, huh? <br /> <br /> FALSE. That's all okay. These interesting subjects are barely mentioned again, except for the artificial end of the epilogue type, which seemed to be the way the director struggled to get back to the subject. It reminded me of a sinuous speech that leads nowhere, but the speaker concludes by saying, "In conclusion, I hope you will see how it relates to my original thinking!" <br /> <br /> In addition, as other commentators have done, pointed out, the cynical blow to stereotype betrays itself. If the goal is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, why then did the director present a brat English speaking beer, as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the director portray the American as a Neanderthal (literally beating his chest and making monkey sounds at one point) while the Europeans tolerated him with supercility? Why is the British girl the one who stoops to utter insults (calling the French "frogs" and slaughtering the French language) while everyone is above all that? The answer is that it's not a deep film or well thought out. It's simply an Anglophobe replica of Anglophiles. But it's really no different from the prejudice he's trying to ridicule! Now, there is an amusing irony to consider. <br /> <br /> OK, apart from philosophy, artistry and socio-political commentary, this film always bored me a lot. There is a very funny gag about cheating on one of the girls' buddies, but other than that, I was hardly entertained. The only reason I've watched it all the time is that I would like to perfect my French and Spanish. (You see, we, monolingual Americans, may be stupid, but we try.)
