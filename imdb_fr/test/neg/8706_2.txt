With a name like "10 Commandments", you would expect a movie to be representative of the story in the Bible, specifically Exodus. Not so here. This is the standard procedure for any biblical film made. Remember "Noah" ?? It was a total fiction and one of the worst films ever made. At least, this film had "a" truth of the original story. However, Menerith, who was a major character in this movie - Moses' half-brother, is not in the original story. The other characters were absent, not to mention important events that were completely eliminated. So what, you can ask? Because it should be representative of the real story; otherwise, some might and believe that this is how things went. Nowadays, people derive their religion from movies rather than the church and reading the Bible. In addition, it is a big mistake. See Revelation 22: 18-19. The script is already written. Why change it? Besides the story in Exodus itself (which should be the main focus), you have to compare Cecil B. DeMille's film, which is clearly a much better presentation. <br /> <br /> The night of her first broadcast My wife was eager to see him. I told him not to give him hope because it was a Hallmark movie. She looked puzzled and said, "Why, Hallmark makes good movies." That may be true, but they are slaughtering the Bible. I'm sorry to say I was right. Not only the story, but the actor too. With current technology, you should be able to make a wonderful Bible movie. I am still waiting...
