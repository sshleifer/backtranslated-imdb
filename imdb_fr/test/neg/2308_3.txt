I remember the release of "The Love Machine" in cinemas. I was barely 13 years old, too young to see the movie being defeated, but not too old to take my mother's broken copy of Jacqueline Susann's novel to school and review the "naughty details" with my classmates of class. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not sure about my problem at such an early age, I was passionate about the book. I bought and wore a ring "ankh", as on the pocket cover, and I remember the ads for the perfume "Xanadu", which had been promoted cross and clumsily appeared in the film. Despite such interest, I did not see the film until several years later. I should have left things as they were. <br /> <br /> "The Love Machine" is without a doubt the worst of the many bad movies adapted from Susann's novels ... making it of course the most fun to watch. His faults are numerous: his jump rope script that jumps from one incident to another without any connection wire; his music score ersatz Bacharach, horny and dated (wind instruments, I mean); flat performance, first grip; Boring sexuality - I had never seen bathrobes so prominent in a movie. It's like a fetish! Whenever sex, nudity or something fishy is called, fate someone in blue dress! Very strange, that; and most certainly, the fashion circus train of the 70s that are spread endlessly. The performance of poor Dyan Cannon (who is certainly not a big shake but dominates the rest of the cast) is constantly undermined by the breathtaking climb she is called to wear. However, the film's main responsibility is John Stone Law, stoic, stone-like, as (appropriately) Robin Stone, the object of affection of all girls (and one above those of the inflamed male photographer). <br /> <br /> The law is just awful and runs as if it was taken off the street, handed out the pages of the script in a hurry and said to give a cold read on the spot. Just no life! Not only that, but he seems desperately in need of a blood transfusion or something like that. He looks pale and sickly and weighs several pounds less than most of his teammates. Robin Stone should be a handsome kid, not a handkerchief. <br /> <br /> For those who find the film difficult (it's rather slow compared to current standards), please stay for the culminating "fight scene". Here, Ms. Cannon (balancing 23 pounds of teased hair) finally abandons her fetish style of play and lets out a contagious and loud laughter, setting in motion a memorable film free for all that should have become a cinematic highlight now. Trying to compete with the infamous "Toilet Wig" scene of "Valley of the Dolls", "The Love Machine" is finally doing something good. <br /> <br /> The unique waste brand of Jacqueline Susann is sorely lacking. Maybe someone owns the rights to Rona Barrett's "The Lovomaniacs" and will revive the genre.
