Despite a completely misleading advertising campaign, this film turns out to be an enigmatic and haunted domestic film, with a totally absurd ending. Index # 1 for anyone considering this turkey: Sam Raimi did not run it. Although the film's commercials highlight his involvement, he is in fact one of four producers. Too bad someone as talented as Raimi has let his name be associated with such a mediocre film. I do not think he would ever have realized something like that; this task was left to the Pang brothers. <br /> <br /> The scenario of this film seems to have been concocted from many other "horror" films. You will not find any original content in "The messengers". "What we get is a scene here and there straight from" Pulse ", a couple that could come from" The Birds ", one or two from" The Others ", etc. Almost every scene, almost every line of dialogue, is the one that has been raised from a number of other films.This gives a film so predictable that almost everyone will be able to understand the "surprise ending" well before it happens. <br /> <br /> It should be emphasized here that advertising This campaign, centered on the idea that only children can see the ghosts, has nothing to do with this film.In fact, everyone can see the ghosts.The characters of the teenage daughter and the mother certainly see them, even early in the film.I am sure that the marketing manager has designed this campaign, because the film needed a unique angle to to seduce the wickets, which is otherwise completely absent.Now you know, then do not be Do not be fooled, maybe what's missing from this movie is something that looks like chemistry between actors. It's just not there. All interactions appear as clumsy. Add to that a hateful story and ridiculous intrigues (what does a guy who murdered his entire family always hide around the small town where the murder took place? Anyway? Someone did he not think to stop it?), All this adds up a deeply unsatisfactory ghost film that can only surprise the more than ten years with low blows: loud noises, visual flashes, and nothing less than a silhouette in a strap jumping from a closet and shouting "Boo!" All we get for our money this time around is another shoddy movie about the spirits trying to warn people of their homes. If there is a message that "The Messengers" delivers, it is "Do not waste your time on this movie".
