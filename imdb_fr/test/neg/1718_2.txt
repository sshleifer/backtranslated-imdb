Tycus is one of the worst movies I see ever watch video movies. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this product does not appear at the cinema.Bad visual effects (the beginning is terrible) bad actors (I do not understand why appears in this movie the great Dennis Hopper) and Bad screen Without meaning. My alternative: Armaggedon or Twister. PHRASE FOR TYCUS: Do not watch this movie.
