The Mexican "classic" was the third entry in the Aztec Mummy series. As you will soon discover, this film is anything but a classic. It looks more like a movie that deliberately tries to annoy you. <br /> <br /> A scientist wants to steal an Aztec treasure in a grave, while protecting it that grave is this commercial toilet paper advertisement: the Aztec mummy. Knowing that he can not beat the mother, he builds a robot, and a very bad robot. We only see Mr.Robot in the last reel, while he slams and fights against the Aztec mummy. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of sci-fi movies of poor quality, The Fi movies I see are shabby, but this one, for its total duration of 64 minutes, is the worst film that I saw, with Fubar coming in second place ... <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Do not waste your time.
