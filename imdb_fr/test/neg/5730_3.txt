Red Sonja is a career in the wrong direction for Arnold Schwarzenegger. After shooting a few sword 'n' sorcery movies (like Conan), he had moved into slightly more serious roles in movies like The Terminator and Commando, then made a mystifying comeback to the sword genre 's for this debacle of 1985. It's hard to understand why he's worried, because it's weaker than Conan's two movies in every imaginable department. This film should have been Conan's third film, but for one reason or another the focus was on the main character, the titular redhead, leaving poor Arnold playing an incredibly boring support role. Also think of director Richard Fleischer who had given classics like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Fantastic Voyage, The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place. In this penultimate film, Fleischer has also taken a huge step back in his career. <br /> <br /> The evil Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) wants to rule the world and she needs a powerful and priceless talisman to do it. She and her brutal army invade a priestly dungeon and steal the talisman, slaughtering defenseless priestesses as they leave. One of the deceased priestesses has a sister named Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), a fiery warrior who, on learning of her sister's death, swears revenge for the evil Gedren. Sonja travels the country in search of Gedren's lair. On the way, she takes fellow travelers in the form of Prince Prince, Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his bodyguard, Falkon (Paul Smith). She also meets the muscular warrior Conan - sorry, I mean Kalidor (!) - who proposes to join her in her quest. Initially, Sonja does not want the help of Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), preferring to prove that she can confront and defeat her enemies alone, but she ends up listening and accepting it. <br /> <br /> Red Sonja is a surprisingly poor film, especially when you think it was shot in 1985, when the genre of sword and witchcraft was coming to an end. It sounds so simplistic and amateurish that one could easily take it for an example of the kind. Overall performances are mediocre, ranging from the embarrassing OTT of Bergman to the incredibly irritating spoiled child of Reyes to Schwarzenegger's unsung wooden hero. Nielsen is slightly better as a heroine - probably enthusiastic about playing her first role - but she is very disappointed by the stupidity of the Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser screenplay. The film is riddled with blunders, including a scene in which Schwarzenegger is seen hacking villains, but in a long sequence in the same sequence, no corpse is in sight. Technically, he is also very inept, with mediocre special effects and frighteningly mechanical monsters. There are some offsets, such as the pleasing music of Ennio Morricone (Morricone spent a good part of the 80s providing good music for terrible movies, for example The Island, The Four Crowns Treasure and Hundra) . Another compensation is the focus of Giuseppe Rotunno on the scene. In fact, most of the time, it is much more rewarding to watch the beautiful landscape than the actors in the foreground! After Red Sonja, there were very few sword movies' s' n 's sorcery. In some ways, he could go down in history as the film that destroyed his own genre.
