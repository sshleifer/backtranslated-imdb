I watched this movie a few weeks ago and I must say: I was not impressed, not at all. I rank alongside the other posters in terms of good performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie. <br /> <br /> On the discussion board, I found a review written by an anonymous poster that captured a few. main points. He says: "Deed Poll" is a film that raises many questions, but does not answer much; a disturbing film and above any attempt at categorization; an experience and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes. of Barbara Kowa and André Schneider, the editing in part very impressive and the good work of the camera (Steffen Ritter) compensate for the rough plot holes and some technical misses (especially in the sound), although the public's boredom should be treated for 40 minutes left. "Unfortunately, that's right, history did not intrigue me at all, the protagonists are cold, unambitious, they consume a lot of drugs and have a lot of (incestuous) sex. So, management often seemed almost non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was extremely annoying. <br /> <br /> What is the interest of the film? What is the message behind everything? The anonymous commentator said: "Somewhere, Biermann did not clearly explain the project and the film hangs in the air without any message. This is the trouble I want the film. The film is reserved and emotionless, cold, almost neutral. not long to see the flaws: for a long time, the characters of Sean and Ivy are not credible (they clearly have difficulties with English pronunciation), the character of the silent brother is not very well developed, some moments are very promising. Although - in the scene where the call-boy is skinned (the one and only true love scene), one reaches such an intensity that one would like to see the whole film for a long time. As a spectator, you must regret the chances that have been given. "Once again, I have to accept, I liked the final scene, especially because of the beautiful faces captured by Gianni Meurer and André Schneider, but that was nothing compared to the boredom I had to endure. the first thirty minutes. (The sex scenes, however, were aesthetically staged and perfectly mounted.) <br /> <br /> In summary, "Deed Poll" was not my cup of tea - a good idea controversially lost - but it was interesting to see how a film can be done with virtually no money, maybe if they had a larger budget and a more experienced director, it would have become a better movie.
