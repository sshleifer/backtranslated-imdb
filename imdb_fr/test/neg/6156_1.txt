The quote above says just about everything for "Slipstream". I should have come out of this movie after the first half hour, but I decided I had to be fair and give it a chance. I will not look at it anymore, so if someone with temerity allows me to come back with the number of lines in the movie, I'm sure it will set a record. <br /> <br /> Some actors, otherwise good and talented, got involved in this clunker; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his career. The character of Paxton has diverted the prisoner from Hamill, an android taking his name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his mate Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can keep an eye on the pair. The real question, though, is why he did not just throw the device on Byron, eliminating the middleman. <br /> <br /> If you like incoherent scenes, with tedious characterization and a ridiculous pretense, then I guess you'll find something interesting here. But you can not convince me that the film makes sense at every level. The scenes of a futuristic stone age give way to snobbery in high society, but the height of bad taste is reached when the character of Paxton is displayed after a night of festivities with hickeys all over his chest . If anyone thinks there is a hidden meaning here, you will really stretch out. <br /> <br /> Wait patiently for the frame proclaiming "The End" to be visible, alas, even if it was refused. If beauty is in the viewer's eye, so is understanding; this film had neither one nor the other. Yet there was only one redemptive feature at the beginning of the closing credits: an impressive view of half a dozen hot air balloons. Apparently, the movie kept them afloat.
