GINGKO BED is a strange movie. It's very complicated, as if he had a lot of ideas but not the ability to bring them together in a coherent story. Instead, we get various intrigues that diverge in their own little separate films. Oh, of course, they end up ending up, but it seems rather ... superfluous. It should be noted the girlfriend and her problems at the hospital. Was it ... interesting? Then there were the elements "we are spirits, so we have no physicality", which poses the same problem that GHOST has, namely: what, no, how exactly do they prevent them from falling to the ground or to float above the ceiling? <br /> <br /> GINGKO BED has been highly touted as a new generation of South Korean film. There are a lot of special effects, but the film itself is hollow and its fake melodrama will only "touch" those who are easy to touch. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this film and reviews of other foreign films)
