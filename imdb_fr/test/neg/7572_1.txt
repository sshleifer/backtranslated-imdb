and you can enjoy this stupid movie. Apparently atomic bombs are maiming life in about a day or two (or, according to other viewers, wake them up). Or it seems. And apparently, massive atomic explosions off the Spanish coast do not ask anyone questions. If you think about it, the plot is meaningless (why would diabolical sock puppets attack lighthouses?), So that non-active nuclear weapons do not stand out too much. <br /> <br /> OK, beyond that and the fact that the "monster" is a glorified thing that you make with socks in kindergarten, you may be able to bear it. But for once, the total lack of blood does not help, leaving the monster attacks in all their "glory" of minimal budget. <br /> <br /> I doubt you can look at this, so it's better to stay away.
