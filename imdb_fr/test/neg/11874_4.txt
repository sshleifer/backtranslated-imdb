Since Wesley Snipes has descended (or raised) into the world of DTV action movies, the result has been Miss, as well, and Miss. Unstoppible was weak. 7 seconds was fun. The shooter was proverbial scraping of the septic tank. <Br /> <br /> And what about the detonator? We would have nothing to fear that the shooter arrives again. But the detonator holds a small amount of merit hampered by a lazy star and a small budget. <br /> <br /> Sonny Griffith is a discreet operative who crushes illegal arms traffickers in Poland.When his last mission ends with a buffet of bullets leaving a bunch of bodies, he orders Sonny to escort a witness; Nadia (the always hot Silvia Colloca) in the United States.Trouble is; Sonny is fooled by a traitor from his own organization who keeps his focus on Gangsters with Nuclier Ambitions. <br /> <br /> Snipes book in the action department.It is in half-blade mode here. well in the first 15 minutes of the detonator, before sinking into a pure sleepwalking mode that ruined the sniper.Colloca does more than look pretty. His scenes are convinced. Many actors seem familiar and have been in the last 3 or 4 Seagal / Snipe movies. It's always a pleasure to see Michael Brandon again. <br /> <br /> The action is telegraphed here.But never boring.Pushing, car chase, Fights.The director Po-Chih Leong seems to have improved after the Seagal prank; Out of Reach.He is doing a credible job.But he is constantly embarrassed by the low budget.Thank you by the east of the euro-lieux.It reduces the look of the movie.Vancover can not be too expensive, is not do not you? The detonator just ends in the middle. It does not have the improbable playful aspect of Seag al 'Mercenary for Justice. But he is not nearly as entertaining as Van Damme's second in command. Nor as thrilling as Dolph's Mechanik. Maybe Dolph should lead Wesley after eh? <br /> <br /> Its big time Producers inject a little more money and think about these DTV titles with the kind of money they earn.Its only fair.The result could be a big seller maybe be? <br /> <br /> Snipes would be advised to try to make this one his last DTV action movie. It is sad to see yet another waste of the talents of this talented actor.
