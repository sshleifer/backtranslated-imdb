This is based on Michael's life from 1983/24 to 2004. Flex Alexander made a good performance but did not look like Michael at all. I think Michael was portrayed as a stupid person, which I do not believe (although he sometimes trusted bad people). I thought Flex Alexander looked Chinese when they made Michael white. I think that Latoya should be described in this, she was always photographed with her brother in the 80s. I never thought that other actors look like their counterparts. Lisa-Marie Presley's son looked like he was about 4 years old in the wedding scene, even though he was not yet 2 years old when Lisa and Michael got married. Also, when Michael tells his mother Katherine that he thinks that Debbie and he should get married if she carries her child, Katherine decided to marry the two.
