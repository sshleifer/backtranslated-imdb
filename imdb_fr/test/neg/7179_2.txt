This is without a doubt the worst film in the Hamilton saga and the worst actor to do Carl Hamilton. Peter Stormare simply can not cope, with his psychotic look and no style. It can be good to make psychotic killers and maniacs as in "Fargo" or "8mm", but in this type of role, it is simply useless. The presence of Lena Olin was useless for this film. She could not save him from what she was: an Americanized copy. big budget action movies like "Goldeneye", "Die Hard 3", "Broken Arrow", etc. This film only has Swedish actors.It is clear that some Norwegian directors with McTiernan as a model director have done this. </ br> The presence of Mark Hamill is only laughable. 2 of 10
