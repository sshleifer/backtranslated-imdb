This movie was ok. Mary-Kate and Ashley play the twin sisters (sorry for the obvious) who, against their will, are sent to Paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something. <br /> <br /> Two French boys (who looks slightly inbred) start talking to them and taking interest. Bla bla bla It's a twin film Olsen - we already know what's going to happen between them. Anyway, the twins meet a FABULOUS French model because they are in Paris, the world capital of fashion. They make bff with the model and spend a fun montage of shopping in the City of Lights. Yes. <br /> <br /> Basically, I really do not remember what happened. I guess that might mean something, but hey, it's an Olsen movie. "Olsen film" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment". <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was annoying. I mean, can I really identify with two girls who are devastated when they learn that they are going to Paris? Really? Plus, the jokes were really not funny. However, I watched the whole movie. So it had to be somewhat entertaining. The fact that it took place in Paris is what probably kept me watching.
