I think there is a reason why this movie has never been around. It was probably my neighbors on the street who filmed this film with their mother's video camera. The acting game is very amateurish. This movie is certainly not something you would want to watch unless you're bored. The actors even seem to double as directors and crew members, without any "professionalism". If the director (s) and / or actors choose to continue their efforts in making films, I would certainly advise them to perfect their skills and maybe take some lessons (good, a lot) on the production and the movie game.
