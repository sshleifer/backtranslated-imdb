Dictated by a limited experience (of life and industry) and without cash, Sofia Coppola's short film is almost by necessity an observation made on a high school campus. The actors are rather weak and do not take advantage of the shooting in black and white (it is difficult to distinguish the characters). Sound editing does not help much in telling a simple story of unstable allegiance to teenage girls. <br /> <br /> But there are a couple of things to note. Among the incoherent mounts, the high school campus is filmed with a balance of close-ups intense and intimate. The editing on music also creates an interest and an impulse (without descending into the underground world of music video). Coppola clearly tried to vary the rhythm of the film. The dramatic turn is cut quickly and to the point and the second act is almost nonexistent; we recognize that this was played in tandem with the first, which is the aim of the crutch narrator's trope (which is a character curiously added in this first act). <br /> <br /> Despite these notes it's a clumsy short. 2/10
