Why would anyone make such a movie? Why would someone invest in a film like this? Why would someone in the film industry work on a film like this? Why would a theater show such a movie? Why would a television channel program such a movie? Why would a reviewer bother reviewing a movie like this? Why would anyone watch a movie like this? Why not mentally examine the writers / producers / directors of a film like this? Sometimes, there are movies so bad that they are good. It's such a horrible film that it's horrible. IMDb really has to institute a "0" or even a negative scale to embrace the works of this horrible, pretentious horror.
