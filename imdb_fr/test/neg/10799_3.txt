First of all, I read the director's comments below and I would like to thank him for giving his opinion. I've always wondered what the directors of the films about MST3K thought their works were shredded (not to mention how Best Brains acquired the rights). Rissi's comments, however, make me curious how many sci-fi could have cut the film to make it different (now, I think I could rent it to NetFlix). Of course, I've never seen the full version of this film that is not MST3K, but even after seeing it on MST3K, I've never seen it as a bad movie or something unassailable (even if I thought it was a pretty funny episode.) certainly not, as Pearl describes it, "skin that peels terribly"; not after seeing the likes of "Future War" and "Hobgoblins". <br /> <br /> Regarding the cutting of the film, this has already been done at least once on MST3K. Example: Joe Don Baker's film, Mitchell, in which the secondary plot of John Saxon's character is cut out in the MST3K version, but Joel and the Bots comment on the absence of Saxon after his appearance at the beginning of the film. If I can submit a review of MST3K, if you have to cut the film for time reasons, that's fine, but be fair to the movie being cut (even if it's a movie as shabby as Mitchell). Of course, such criticisms are rather useless with the end of the series, but I think this aspect of the series was rather unfair. Anyway, if that's the case with Soultaker, that's important to me. <br /> <br /> Still, I say it's a nice MST3K episode, although the movie itself, even the version that was "hacked" into MST3K, is not that bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, in a strange coincidence or perhaps a case of Synchronicity, I watched The Hudsucker Proxy the day Soultaker aired and you would not know, the guy who played the Vivian Schelling's father had a little share in this film; one of his other three credited roles, actually. I thought it was a little weird.
