Louis Gossett Jr returns to the pit once more as Chappy Sinclair goes to Doug Masters (played by Jason Cadieux who replaces Jason Gedrick who wisely refused) to teach a new group of recruits, but this time they discover corrupt drivers treat toxic waste. It is a series that only gets worse with each new entry; it does not have the zip code, nor even the action necessary to make it even more interesting to see on the cable. Iron Eagle IV is led with such indifference that the fights unfold as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. It's horrible to watch and Gossett Jr who did his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces: Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious about Louis Gossett Jr is that he seems to be like Christopher Walken in his quest to do something while he works. As I watch his post Oscar wins. Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Principal are some of his best films. Considering that the last two films make him co-starred with Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi, it's indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action movies are in the running for his best work. Of course, Enemy Mine and Diggstown remain his best work after an Oscar. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
