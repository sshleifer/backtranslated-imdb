Notorious for being "introduced by the digital effects team behind Independence Day," Coronado is even more a spectacular failure because of its juxtaposition with ID4. This ridiculous mess of a movie begins with a brainless premise and descends completely from there. A wealthy couple soon married to Beverly Hills is the subject of this silly story. Claire's fiancée is away on a business trip as Christmas approaches. She decided to fly spontaneously to Switzerland to spend the holidays together. I particularly like the fact that his first reason for wanting to go was because he had left home documents that she thought he might need. She grabbed them and shouted after him as he drove away, concluding that his best bet would be to fly to the other side of the planet rather than calling his mobile phone. I refuse to believe that a couple living in a mansion as cavernous as theirs did not know the existence of cell phones. <br /> <br /> So far, the movie is incredibly bad, but take a look at it, this is where it starts to get bad! She arrives in Switzerland and when she can not find her husband, she takes a cake and calls her friend to complain about the injustice. This woman is not an action hero, and she is certainly not a German, Indiana Jones, for shouting. She is an inviting cheerleader, a pampered sorority whose outdoor experience is probably limited to stretching her heels when she is sufficiently energetic to walk on the lawn at a wine and cheese party on the cliffs. <br /> <br /> She learns that her fiancée is in South America and that she flies so fast to have it. Once there, this idiot thinks that she will go alone in the jungle, sniff the enemy base and save his poor helpless boyfriend. She laughs at a comment about the danger of going there, then gets upset later because she realizes there are battles. "You never said anything about the battle!" <br /> <br /> There is a moment when Claire and a journalist she met drove this huge truck on a bridge several meters high and several suspended by two by four. Literally. Thousands of thin pieces of wood are tied with string and these morons decide to drive her. Not only does he collapse under the weight of the truck, but Claire manages to fall, falling hundreds of feet and landing on his back in the shallow river below. Later, she remembers the event, laughing like, oh, maybe it was a hundred or so She was not spinning chewing gum on her fingers. <br /> <br /> What is really sad about this catastrophic film is that they even managed to convince the talented John Rhys-Davies, a talented TRUE veteran of Indiana Jones. There is a lot of nonsense about an uprising at the end of the film, where we meet an extremist rebel leader who, when we meet him for the first time, has such a thick accent that he gives the impression that he's in an advertisement for Ruffles, and then later he talks like a guy who's left the streets of Venice Beach. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The special effects are negligible. The team that gave you Independence Day, the very fact that it was involved in ID4, was simply following the movements by throwing blue and blue screenshots together, I have to believe because they had nothing better to do. The story is incredibly bad and Kristin Dattilo, quoted by many other IMDb users as the only reason to see the movie, makes no effort for her performance. Maybe she thought the digital effects team behind Independence Day could overlay something with this mess. <br /> <br /> And seeing how much they fell, they thought maybe they could do it too. <br /> <br /> They could have at least tried.
