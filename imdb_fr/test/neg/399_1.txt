I was amused to see that some of the reviews posted here were supplemented by ** SPOILERS ** the joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that is not given on the back of the Title box. I may be a dense 17-year-old American who would not know art if he bit my leg, but I prefer movies that contain at least a few words. This movie is the second half of 2001: a talkative low space odyssey. This film is so slow that it's not even art, it's just boring. We follow this scary guy following this boy around Venice. The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of the book. A movie should not make you go back to the book, it should be able to stay alone. This film has no way to stay. He does not even have the bones of a plot to lean on.
