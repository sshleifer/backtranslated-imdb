I went to see this with Albert Finney alone. He is one of my favorite actors and he is rarely missing. I do not know if the plot is interesting or just idiotic: it is about a little boy about to be born, but at the moment when his mother gives birth, he refuses to go out! This sends God and the whole human factory into crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to try to convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born. Finney takes the unborn child on an adventure in the Big Apple in hopes of showing him all the reasons he should want to live. <br /> <br /> Despite the ridiculous conspiracy, I could have accepted it if the director I had not tried to turn this into your typical film of moralist message in Hollywood. In terms of direction, the film was rendered unbearable by a dreadful soundtrack of sentimental music that Hollywood filmmakers seem unable to resist. <br /> <br /> He then slaughtered the unconventional story by giving his hand every moment. The twists in the plot were completely revealed by the way the story unfolded. It was as if the director thought that the audience was just a group of idiots who did not see obvious clues from far away. <br /> <br /> Even Finney in his performance, though satisfying, seemed a little embarrassing of place; and the little boy with curly curls, even though he was supposed to be cute, was actually rather dull. Bridget Fonda seemed to be trying to replicate Demi Moore's performance in "Ghost", shedding tears at any moment. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film has not been successful so far to be distributed in the United States, which surprises I think it has the box office potential to be a success modest, attracting both children and sentimental adults. As for the quality, it's not a horrible film, it's just not very good. (4 out of 10)
