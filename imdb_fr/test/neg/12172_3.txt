Horrible. I hope to save two hours of your life by warning you. I just finished watching the movie, BTW. <br /> <br /> I like good genre movies. This is not one of them. Show me a sci-fi comedy, a dramatic joke or a religious action movie, I'll watch them all. But you can not settle for epigrammatic jokes at a party of the hike, the camp, the schlock-horror and attract my applause. <br /> <br /> I like philosophical films. This is not one of them. All those who wonder at the depths of the intellect in this film have not read a good book lately. Or never. The "provoking reflection" dialogue is, at best, banal. Maybe he lost something in the translation. <br /> <br /> I like a good horror comedy. This is not one of them. To laugh! I thought I would never start! Squirm? Only trying to think of a polite way to express my comments on the film to the friend who recommended it. <br /> <br /> Rupert is incredibly good at this film, but he can not resurrect it. I only wish he shot the director instead of the zombies. <br /> <br /> Too bad, that the country that gave birth to The Inferno is too. Dante would be spinning in his grave.
