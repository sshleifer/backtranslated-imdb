I was watching TV one day with a friend and we listened to the last twenty minutes of "Going Bananas". Believe me when I say it was enough to have a good judgment of the film. The first scene I saw was that of the monkey, the child, the fat guy and the black guy who looked like Dave Chappelle, flying in a giant chandelier thousands of feet in the air. While everyone was solemn about this trip, the monkey seemed to be in a state of excessive drug consumption and shouting something that looked more like the English word. They then landed on a twenty-meter platform in Africa. After feeling a farewell when the monkey cried (Hahahaha), the "villains" of the film appeared. They were completely cleansed in their vintage Cadillac when the evil monkey jumped from the dock on the boat that was 40 meters away and sank them into the Pacific Ocean. After seeing this movie, I have a new purpose in life; to find the dwarf who played the monkey and stab him in the eyes with a fountain pen.
