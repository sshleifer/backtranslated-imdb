"Red Sonja" is flawed, weak and missing. Even the camp is not good. <br /> <br /> There are only two good things about "Red Sonja"; Costumes (even if the Red Sonja costume is ridiculous) It is ironic that a girl who is even afraid of being touched by men, because she has been raped, always chooses to wear so few clothes, even when it's raining.) And the music by Ennio Morricone. The film is still a little watchable but certainly not to recommend. <br /> <br /> The story is extremely simple and they did not even bother to make it interesting. The story could have been forgotten if there had been good action sequences and a little humor, both are present but have serious flaws in many ways. The film takes itself too seriously and tries to impress but fails completely. <br /> <br /> Brigitte Nielsen is a horrible woman. I do not know who the accent is worse; Hers or Arnie's and on top of that; She can not act. In addition, there is absolutely no chemistry between the two characters, which makes the love story totally incredible. Even worse, Sandahl Bergman was the main villain who acted worse than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was pretty good in his role, but my God, he looked horrible, he has changed so much since his role (well known) in "The Adventurers of the Lost Ark." Maybe it had something to do with his illness that cost the life in 1991? And by the way, what was it with all these actors "Adventurers of the Lost Ark" in this film? Next to Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow appeared in a role, it looked like a sort of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" meeting. <br /> <br /> The only times the film has a little interesting is during (sword) fighting even if some of them are useless and weak. <br /> <br /> Only really watchable for fans of the fantasy genre. <br /> 4/10
