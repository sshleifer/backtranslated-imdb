Maybe even just to laugh at how my favorite works of Jane Austen has been portrayed. Maybe I'm too harsh on this adaptation, but I'm afraid I'm biased to version A & E. I can not imagine Mr. Darcy being portrayed by anyone other than Colin Firth. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed superficial and often dialogue by force. Lizzy seemed to miss the real feeling that is so obvious in the book. His fantasy for Wickham was overplayed, then his love at first sight for Darcy was inconceivable. <br /> <br /> Darcy has been pretty well portrayed, I'll give it to her. He managed to maintain the required distance, but I had the impression not to project the feeling and inner struggle that make his character so charming, especially in the scene of the proposal. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were also well played, but seemed to be lacking in many ways. Ms. Bennet's average mood was not fully taken into account in her performance. <br /> <br /> Mr. Collins was a good portrait. Quite in line with the book. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from commenting on Lady Catherine, except to say that she is probably the worst representation of the whole film. <br /> <br /> Other problems I We can see that the few freedoms they have had with the order of events are such that the presence of Darcy at the first meeting with Lady C. and that Miss Lucas and Sir William did not join Lizzy during his visit to the Collins. <br /> The choreography was terrible during the dance scenes. The scene where Lizzy and Darcy dance lose a lot of intensity because we can not have the impression that they look disgusted on the floor of the ballroom. At least this version of the BBC left out the dialogue between Lizzy, Darcy and Sir William when he praised them for their dance because they played very badly. <br /> <br /> There have been times when it interested me, but overall, I find this version disappointing. I would only recommend this film if you are like me and you are excessively hijacked by such foolishness. <br /> <br />
