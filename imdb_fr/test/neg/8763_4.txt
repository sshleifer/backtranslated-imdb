John Carradine is one of the most animated actors of the Nazi scientist, who turns humans into zombies in the service of the Reich. Brain-wrinkled brain, only obeying the simplest order ... much like the McDonalds staff. <br /> <br /> Hitler is not mentioned by name, because America was not at war at the time. they were filmed, but it's pretty obvious to know who the bad guys are working for! <br /> <br /> There seem to be two types of zombies in the film, the type of traditional voodoo popular in the old black and white movies of the 1930s and 40s. Empty eyes and following the orders of someone one another while they stumble. And then there is the guy we know in the following movies, like "The Night of the Living Dead" and "The Evil Dead". Always wandering but with the sole intention of killing and eating the flesh and brains of their victims. Both have their moments in various movies over the years. <br /> <br /> "Vengeance" shows the old type of zombie, although they have a particularly awkward appearance and look more like home in the old monster shows like the geeks who bite the chickens' heads . A black zombie called Lazarus with his raging hair looks like a young King Don. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, the devilish doctor decides to make his wife a zombie with the others and this error. Although it allows him to keep his strappy heels like a feminine touch as he turns her into a living dead, she is not happy. <br /> <br /> All this goes terribly wrong and ends in tears, and the moral of the story must be, never, ever, turn your wife into a zombie, she only asks for trouble ... <br> /> <br /> The film is quite interesting and it comes quickly to the end, but never rises above its poor line origins. Not a patch on the real zombie classics, but fun all the same.
