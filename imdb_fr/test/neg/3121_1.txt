It's hard to express how bad this movie is. Even in the 1950s, fashionable, where the intellectual pursuit of the meaning of life was fashionable and the rejection, by the beatnik, of physical comfort, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. was a common reaction to the low morals of the middle class of the United States and Western Europe. were a stinky. The plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina (if it's the correct Latin grammar); the actors play consists of impassive glances broken by occasional hysterics (by the principal male role as well as by the women); the free view of Catherine Deneuve's breasts (or anyone else's) is worthy of a Budweiser advertisement; the repeated repetition of cacaphone orchestras in the abandoned building is, I'm sure, fraught with meaning in the director's mind, but for me it's just another stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless film - I unleashed me because my time was lost watching this scam excuse for a cop art. The landscape is beautiful and the sex scene is hot - but under his clothes, this king has no substance.
