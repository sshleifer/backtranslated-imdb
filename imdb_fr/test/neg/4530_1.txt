The audience sat in silence for most of the movie, with a few uncommon and occasional giggles. The character of Maxwell Smart was so incoherent that I felt whipped. When it suits the plot, Smart behaves like a spy master. At other times, he acts like a fool. They raise many classic lines of the TV series, but they do not work in this version. The classic "missed by so many things" is fun if it is spoken with a bragging attempt by someone who is an obvious failure - but he loses all humor when spoken by someone who is skilled. To a lesser extent, many other characters evolve at a dizzying pace, ranging from talented to incompetent caricaturist. Siegfried, the main villain, seems to be smart, but makes decisions that make no sense. Yet none of the characters in the film are as incompetent as the authors of this mess. I am totally depressed by the fact that so many IMDb users think it was a good thing.
