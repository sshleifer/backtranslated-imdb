The film Razor Blade Smile has an interesting title and a leading role. Now, most people might not like this movie for the plot and the acting is a bit cheap, but it's the appeal of a film like Razor Blade Smile. In a way, it was supposed to be a bad movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you watch this film until the end, you will see that it is, as I said, a cheap vampire movie with a little humor. (It is also very interesting to know how they manipulated the colors in some scenes.) <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is a type that you rent and that you laugh with your friends and that you appreciate it what he is. Because no movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> As Lilith Silver says, "Humans do not smile enough ..."
