Alice Dodgson, a New York doctor, has her license suspended when she treated one of her patients with an unapproved medication, resulting in the death of the patient. white landowner.The brother thinks he is a zombie and is deeply involved in voodoo practices and rituals of the local population. "Ritual" is a poor horror movie. a bit of gore as someone kills whites with a machete, but not too much. Cinematography is decent, but the acting is really sad.Finally avoid.4 out of 10.
