I spent a year on a mission in Iraq, and among the hundreds of films I saw here was this little gem called Vampire Assassin. Judging by the cover (African American with rows of corn with curved blade, a leather coat and the behavior of a tough guy), I was expecting a scam from the blade. Very well. <br /> <br /> So I inserted it and I observed an overweight African American, without a blade, without cornrows and, finally, nothing at all, except ... I do not know. If you have read any of these reviews, you have the essence of the film. That sucks. Wrong. Really bad. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it was the Highlander-Esquire flash after killing an immortal vampire, or karate sound effects for the camera zooms, or the twenty dollars on props, or the "ok, we have 90 minutes to film this before being filmed in a Johnson & Johnson parking lot", or the martial arts that are as exciting and fast as two older people having sex, or the seventh-grade talent actor, or the eccentric Asian master who is senial or on acid, or whatever, but the film manages to force you to question your existence. And it's great. <br /> <br /> Few movies can be so bad that your head will explode like scanners. If you heckle (or MST3K) with your friends, this movie is for you. I have seen it three times, and I think it could have caused permanent damage to my psyche. If you still have no idea of ​​the quality of the film, people were trying to give it away for free and nobody would take it. Not even strength. <br /> <br /> Long story short, look at it. Either as masochistic pleasure or punishment. It will rock your skull (and for the most part, for all the wrong reasons).
