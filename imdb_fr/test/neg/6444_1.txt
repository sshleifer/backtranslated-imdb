It must be said something about the state of our nation that this program is one of the most popular currently broadcast. <br /> <br /> The "square" is populated by a group of characters as miserable, untrustworthy, amoral, malicious and implacably dubious as one can imagine. Everyone stabs someone in the back, everyone tries to commit adultery, everyone tries to deceive someone. That, or they are stabbed, cuckolded or scammed. Nobody is gay. Nobody laughs. Nobody has a blinding chance or a really nice day. It's hell, with cockney accents. <br /> <br /> I guess this program should be sponsored by the Samaritans. It's a perfect viewing for the depressed. It does not comfort them; what it does is to present a whole community of people so sad that viewers are desperate and that the viewers are convinced that their fate could be much worse: they could live in "Albert Square". <br /> <br /> above; as a representation of the east end of London, it is a pure hokum. The programmers have obviously never crossed the city. The first thing you encounter on the Mile End Road is a colossal mosque. And that defines the racial majority of the population. White British Londoners are a scattered and rapidly decreasing minority. A large publicity currently accumulating advertising near the Bow Road Bridge and sponsored by Tower Hamlets Health Care states that "eight out of ten community members can now see their doctor more quickly". Ten smiling and healthy faces are heading towards the observer to confirm. Eight of them have dark skin ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I worked with a group of Anglo-Saxons - dare to say "pukka" - cockney a few years ago. And I can tell you that a more racist experience than I ever had. Every day was like a rally Oswald Moseley. They could not spend 5 minutes without denigrating a race or a nationality other than their own, with repugnant and obscene terms. "Fackin 'Pakis" and "fackin" Maceroons "were the small change of conversation.In fact, their stock of adjectives (and extremely limited) is fixed on the sexual organs and their application Alf Garnett was a model of liberal virtue in comparison. <br /> <br /> Any show that is meant to portray the true nature of London's East London Caucasians would be totally unfit to air, even after the decisive 9 o'clock turn. of the Ku Klux Klan written by Quentin Tarantino and you would be somewhere near the mark, but when they were not inveterate bigots, they were at least extremely happy. <br /> <br /> I do not know how a Such a soap opera was born.This naive imaginary island of white misery has absolutely nothing to do with true culture, and if you are optimistic it will quickly reduce you to tears. e relatively ordinary chronic depressive with cockney accents - what is it for? <br /> <br /> Sad, dull, insensibly disappointing and ethnically absurd. The most popular program of a seemingly sick and dying nation. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague.
