The acting was awful, the green, fictitious and ridiculous cheese effects were ridiculous and the creatures were completely late. The only good thing about this movie was the concept, and the laughter I had in watching such a bad movie - and then I became quite angry because I realized I had lost $ 4 to rent it . Why would such a movie ever be in theaters? I know this film was released almost 5 years ago, but does anyone make any more effort to make films? I am writing random things to fill the entire space, because I need ten lines of text to publish this review. This next line should almost do it. Annnndddddd there!
