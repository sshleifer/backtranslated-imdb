It's as if the marshmallow man in Ghostbusters' turn had reincarnated in Rutger Hauer's body and was taking revenge on a rival's pregnant wife! If seeing an obese, Hauer pursues a very pregnant Isabel Glaser (imagine the thrills that sting you as part of this contest) is right for you, watch this movie! Seriously, if Hauer is what an Iraqi prisoner of war looks like after six years in prison, hungry people around the world should go to a Baghdad prison. Overall, "Tactical Assault" awards 2 stars instead of 1 because Mike Mitchell like Hawk is great. Mitchell burns the screen as a NATO pilot until his plane burns itself (by an enemy missile), after which the film loses the little excitement it had at the beginning.
