Whenever a film depicts a dwarf or dwarf in an important role, the director gives him a probability of 10 to 1, because he did not know what to do so that the film is always interesting. In this case, the little guy described is not so bad - he manages to keep his dignity for most of his scenes (except the part where he leads the main man down the dungeon stairs), but the film him - even uses it as a dog to chew toy. <br /> <br /> The problem is common to low-budget films: this is a good idea, but the director and screenwriter do not know how to develop it. A good director would take the different elements of the story - brain transplants, crazy doctors with secret labs and dungeons, car chases, fist fights, monstrous Frankenstein wizard, mind control, treason and conspiracy, and so on. exciting, involving a film full of thrills and fun. <br /> <br /> Instead, we come here to a group of people who stumble and argue in the doctor's lab, then a lame operation where the patient bleeds tempura paint, followed by some of the same people stumbling and chatting in the doctor's laboratory, followed by another subgroup of the original group that was driving and had an accident, followed by a dungeon escape scene that consisted mainly of a woman who was putting back her shoes, followed by a continuation on the roof of the film), followed by a series of confusing events where everyone in the movie apparently escapes from the others, followed by a beautiful walk to the countryside where everyone pursues, collides, strikes or escapes from everyone again, followed by, well, not much else. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in this place is a frightening peroxide blonde dressed in white, a well-intentioned heroic type who looks a bit bland, a three-foot lab assistant, a big cradle with a mass of melted rubber glued to one side of his face, a kid who wonders in the middle of the film about the "Frankenstein factor", a brunette who falls in love with the hero for no apparent reason, and the crazy doctor himself , who must be the luckiest man in the history of evil super villains, because nothing is going as planned, but things are going well for him anyway ... and all because he's is reminded to stick an electrode in the grafted brain at a given moment of the operation. <br /> <br /> This is by no means the worst movie I've seen, nor even the worst movie I've ever seen, nor even the worst-selling movie I've ever seen. I saw, but it's just there. , cheap and inattentive to detail at every point, and there is no real reason for even bad moviegoers to look at it.
