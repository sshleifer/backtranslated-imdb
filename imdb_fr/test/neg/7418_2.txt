The Untold ... is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story seems really original, but it was poorly projected on the screen. Lance Henriksen, a good actor, found himself in this shit. But hey, he made a lot of low budget movies ... you have to pay the bills, you know? Joke. Lance is an excellent actor, but he ended up with this stupid group of actors. Seriously, Andrea Roth was there just to have a nudity scene, and other actors ... well, they were right there. There was constantly a fade in the editing, and it makes me sick! It was the most horrible thing that continues to happen and it makes you really angry. It was also very predictable, boring and slow. It has a weird tempo that just goes ... badly. <br /> <br /> I can not say more ... do not rent it, or do not buy it. You can watch it, if on TV.
