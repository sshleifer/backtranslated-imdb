As a child, I have never understood WHY anyone would want to watch this very crappy show. It was pretty stupid and I always wanted Spridle and Jim-Jim to engage in some kind of fatal accident (they were SO Boring). <br /> <br /> Now, almost 40 years later, I have a new attitude towards the cartoon. Although I still think it was complete crap, it only concerns the American version of the series. It was because I read an anime book and discovered that the shows we watched growing were completely different from those originally shown in Japan. You see, the idiots in charge of the syndication of the series thought it was too violent, so they eliminated that from the episodes. It's bad enough, but what they did was incredible - they actually cut the episodes and stuck them together to create shows that looked nothing like the originals! For example, an episode may consist of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! As a result, I really do not know if the original series was really bad - it could have been brilliant. But who can say in view of all we need to look at is this Americanized mess !?
