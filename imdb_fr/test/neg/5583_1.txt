It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The highlight of the film is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina. <br /> <br /> The acting is pathetic. I know that playing is hard work, but that's why it should be left to real actors. Watching these people act is like watching Michael J. Fox get brain surgery. It's fragile at best. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments would make you believe that the movie is saved by Dan Gordon's acting talents as Chris. Only Dan or maybe his mother could believe that it was good to act. <br /> <br /> The special effects of this movie were terrible. The worst effects were the gas explosion in the lighthouse. It looked like someone was shining an orange light at the bottom of a model built from a refrigerator. Of course, there was a bit of computer animation superimposed, but it did not help. I suppose the special effects of this movie were created and rendered using a single Amiga computer from the late 80s.
