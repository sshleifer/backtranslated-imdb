Hideously bad movie on a dealer who wants to be a writer and on the incidents that make up the casino life. Move with turtle step. Dull, dull, dull! Virtually everything in this film is amateurish and unconvincing, with one notable exception: the performance of Clive Owen, who looks like a Rolls Royce purring in a slum. The tips for the casino footage would have been provided by a professional but, judging by the way they were handled, they were completely ignored by the director. Although the casino staff may very well be a different breed from the rest of the world, he is far from being as devious and weak as the characters featured in this script. Odds and goals are inserted into the script to try to provide a compelling background, but would seem to have been noted in a list on a cocktail napkin. For all those who make their living in the casino sector (as this writer has done for forty-one years!), This is a picture of the poverty of their world that has NEVER been lacking in this world. absence! A frightful and insulting disorder of a film that moves forward, advance and advance along a silly end and unconvincing. American critics loved it.
