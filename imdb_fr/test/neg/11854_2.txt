I'm a big fan of Eric Roberts, I collect his films and I'm 60 years old. But I'm honest to say that he sometimes makes awful movies. But that's why I like him - he's entertaining. <br /> <br /> But this one must take the price, I can not help wondering why. One way or another, they managed to bring Eric and Corbin Bernsen to the picture. <br /> <br /> While Bernsen is really horrible (I really do not like him), Roberts manages to be the best thing in the movie (and that does not mean much). He does it practically on a routine basis. <br /> <br /> The caterpillar (Brasselle) looks like a plastic doll and behaves like a doll. And Tim Abell and his team look like action-man plastic dolls and act like to. <br /> <br /> The plot is really embarrassing. I did not see any carnosaur film, so I do not remember the pictures that were added, but that explains some things. But there are still huge holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> The first attacks take place outside the laboratory, in the neighboring woods. But in the end, they destroy the entire lab and make sure everything is finished, but they forgot those from outside ?????? <br /> When the pilot of the helicopter is devoured, I wonder how she could not notice a T-rex climb in the helicopter ???? <br /> <br /> The guys in orange overalls are my favorite - what do they do for a jog or what? <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a standard B-movie sex scene with silicon titties involved too. This time it's Lorissa McComas who welcomes us. I have no problem with that (she looks awful) but look at a guy who squeezes her breasts and is on the threshold of the climax for 8 !!!! a few minutes is too long. <br /> <br /> Shame on you all (including Eric Roberts) - I can not wait to watch Con Games (I'm wondering ???)
