Christopher Tookey, of the Daily Mail, had some choices to make about this film, including "look at it all through its miserable 82 minutes, and I guarantee you shake your head asking," Are we really down? 'Yes, we have, because if ever a film showed the total cynicism, the lack of taste and the moral corruption of those who order and make British films, it is this abomination.' "Tookey continues:" This sex comedy is so sordid, insignificant and smelly that it's enough to make you forget sex and movies, for life, with unwashed underwear, disgusting spirits and joints that graze the sidewalk. ", before concluding" The Sexual life of potato men is not just a really naughty movie, it is symptomatic of a new national culture of personal gratification, yobbism and sadism that is now being celebrated on the screen. "Normally I do not I do not listen too much to the critics, but in this case, Tookey was very profitable.This film goes beyond the evil in fact, it goes beyond the simple fact of being unusual and enters a strange parallel universe where every minute p√©n ible drags on for an hour and the definition of the word "hilarious" seems to be "say a brummie accent". It's depressing for anyone who has half of the brain and who grew up with Goodies, Monty Python, Spitting Image, News Not Nine O'Clock and Fawlty Towers. Ideally, Sex Life of the Potato that the men would have He disappeared quietly after his movie release and joined The Fat Slags (2004) and the evil vehicle All Saints Honest (2000) in the celluloid graveyard, but it seems destined to endless filling of night hours. screenings and misplaced "best movie of all time!" I am sorry to have tried to repair a wrong that the British film industry, in all its wisdom, has inflicted on an unworthy world. Yes, I'm really sorry to bring this celluloid death back, but I actually remember saying, "It can not be as bad as the critics said" ... but, as God is my witness was worse. <br /> <br /> Acting - from beginning to end, special mention to Mackenzie "The legs of Albert Steptoe on the body of the young man" Crook. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack - cut and paste "ladrock", Jukebox mainly based on ska, which brought back horrible memories of seeing these tweeting cocktails make the Lambeth Walk to a diluted imitation of the madness of the buttons from Specials in every 80s comedy / variety program ... and Motorhead's "Ace Of Spades" as title music? What is it ... to try to conjure up memories of one of the most truly thrilling scenes ever offered by The Young Ones, in fact, never offered by ANY comedy show ?! Low blow, well below the belt. <br /> <br /> Script - written by a 12-year-old who has just read all the numbers of Smut and Zit in a long session powered by Red Bull ... SURELY? Come on, no real, decent, mundane, adult person could possibly put that kind of hogwash on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in ... Mark Gatiss ... the least annoying member of the League of Gentlemen and Goodies fan taking part in such a pile of fly-blown film feces? "One of the brightest British stars in comedy"? No more he is not! About League Of Gentlemen, someone offered me a pair of lead-lined diver boots and Steve's face like a collapsed rectum, as well as a long weekend in a soundproof room before my death ... PLEASE ... <br /> <br /> The cinema, British or otherwise, is no worse than that. The Headless Eyes (1971) by Kent Bateman is a masterpiece of the new wave compared to this disgusting coal.
