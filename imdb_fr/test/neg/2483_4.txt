This show had a promising beginning in some way the opposite of "Oceans 11" but became a shallow display of T & A. In fact, according to my little brother, this is the only good part of the show. <br /> <br /> The first season was by far the best, it's a new and interesting thing. The only point that redeems this show is James Caan. Other actors lack luster. The characters lack depth and they seem to be incredibly selfish and generally uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> To quote a friend "Las Vegas is like Baywaych in a casino" In my opinion, very generous, Baywatch was much better and much more realistic.
