[Warning contains spoilers] <br /> <br /> I had no sympathy for one of the characters, including the main character, who overcomes the death of his girlfriend very quickly (but that's okay then that he is a former prostitute of the casino where he works). The main character is portrayed as this wonderful intelligent writer who is dragged into a web of deception while launching his monologue of the book he is writing. I can not say that I would buy the book. A much better hypothesis might have been if the voice-over (which annoyingly interrupts to tell a part of the film that you might not have understood through his book) would have 52 different customizations ... for represent each card in the game, but I move away from the subject. In the end, there was a turning point: the main character was set up by a loved one, but as I hated his character so much at the time (I can not love anyone in this movie, characters are all one-dimensional (zombies) that I really did not care and that I'm glad the movie is over. <br /> <br /> Positive points: ER's English actress making a dubious accent on South Africa. Negatives: An irritating film.
