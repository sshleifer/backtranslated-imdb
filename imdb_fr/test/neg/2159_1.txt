Yes, my summary says it all. <br /> <br /> If you have not watched this, try it. But not for fun. For studies on one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct, family oriented and "cool" at the same time. <br /> <br /> Men always think that they know everything, that they are stupid and that they are finally relaxed. beautiful women. Etc. This is particularly shocking when all the characters are just as terrible and stereotyped. I mean, ok, "Cody" was funny at one point or another, but unlike other "stupid characters (tm)" like Woody in Cheers or Joey in Friends, he does not have any good phrases. His stupidity is expressed in a "duet" way, which becomes rather annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> The morale of the family is awful. Everything for the family Mother and father are supreme dictators who, between severe punishment and old parenting practices, constantly say that they "love" their children, and of course, in the end, the children love them back * barf *. <br /> <br /> And there is always a "tender point" like this one that slips into "action", where moral lessons are imposed on viewers, about sex (in a mature state, you can not have sex before you are 18 years old (!!), kind of drug). Even the habits of the church are described in detail here. The concept as a whole is directly disgusting, all made in a shy way to make money. If there are people like Karen and Frank, please lock them up and disintegrate the key. <br /> <br /> So, with themes going so far as to revolt religious propaganda, I think it's fair to conclude as I did in my subject ...
