This film could be o.k. otherwise for all the language it contains. I think the script itself is not bad, but I would be too embarrassed to let my wife or kids see the movie. I know children will learn all the bad words in the end, it's true, but parents should not help them in the process by allowing them to see and hear what's going on under the guise of an entertainment. <br /> <br /> I quite used to Robert Loggia; he has a distinct grain quality with his hoarse voice, but in the last few years, all I've seen him do are roles with a lot of language. If we had a price for an overuse of the word F, he should be a competitor. Unfortunately, I think he has lost me now as a fan. In the future, when I see his name on films, I will think twice before choosing this title. <br /> <br /> Listen, I'm not a prude. I sometimes use language too, in extreme circumstances, but when we watch a movie, it's in everyone's interest, which we hope will bring us joy and escape. I do not want to be reminded of what's happening in the streets of a big city these days, and it's tedious to ask if a movie is right for my family. <br /> <br /> I like Matt Modine too, but it's a shame that he's associated with an image that has dropped his image like this. He probably did a bit of work in the movie, but I turned off about a quarter of the course after being abused by another person in the cast. Why can not these actors simply say no when these scripts ask them to continue with this gutter language? Once enough actors (especially the big names) win, the screenwriters will stop putting it in the movies! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not recommend this photo. Too bad too, because I think it would probably have been good if things had been well enough prepared so that decent families could look at them! Thank God, I wasted only $ 2.00!
