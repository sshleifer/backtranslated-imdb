Guy Pearce looks like a Calvin Klein underwear model or one of those bimbo guys who wear Levi's jeans and stand in front of a flock of mad buffaloes, as they realize that Buffalo is like Levi's. In each scene, Guy Pearce seems to say, "Look at me, I'm so pretty!" As a hero, his character is a real wimp. In all scenes that appeal to courage, Pearce has the short handle. SPOILERS: Yet at the end of the movie, this debauched bookworm character surpasses a group of baboons-like Morlocks who can run and jump along walls (like Spiderman). Around the same time, the TIME MACHINE seems to cause a nuclear explosion that erases a whole valley. Strangely, even though Pearce and his friend Mumba are about a foot from the last Morlock killed; Seconds later, Pearce, Mumba and the tribe watch the valley explode with the safety of their mountain. Now it's fast! Jeremy Irons as king of the Morlocks is awesome. It really makes the movie a lot better than it was. Mumba, the model became an actress is not very cute and she does not play much in this film. The scenes that take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. Even though vintage clothing and vehicles are shown, the characters act as caricatures of how they imagine twentieth-century people would walk and talk. The original version of this movie was much better in this respect. The characters of the time were much more realistic and they were much better actors. The original version of this film gave the PAST the appearance of the true base of the characters. This new version lacks substance and feeling. The scenes in which Pearce discusses Emma's death and fails to save her from her fate are very good. The question of the Morlocks as cannibals is not very well explained and it makes no sense that they have a big black butchery filled with knives and cutlery, and yet they are never seen in the process of use weapons with the exception of one shot. As stupid is the giant pit full of water and bones. Throughout the subway, the Morlocks walk around chewing fleshy bones. So, how can all these skeletons be in the pit? It seems that there are Morlocks of which Bar-B-Que eats their humans and eats them on the grill, and other Morlocks only like filet meat ?? And where are the toilets for all these creatures? As I watched the dozens of Morlocks stuffing themselves with human flesh, I realized that they needed a sophisticated toilet and plumbing system, knowing that they were spilling a lot of bone. All these questions have never been addressed. At the end of the film, Pearce holds the hand of Mumba, but you can see that he catches the eye of his friend, Mandingo. Another totally irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop music of LION KING who is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802 710 AD); LION KING's music never stops, and whenever Native people are present, there is this African Moaning Singer (Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) who begins to lament over the music of the LION KING jungle. I watched the credits at the end of the film and the jungle music is not specifically identified, but I think Elton John should probably look into it. Time Machine was a mediocre film with some good effects. See it once and then forget it.
