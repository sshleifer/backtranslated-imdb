I have in the past loved Tim Burton. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. Costume costume scenes in the beginning were the kind of hackneyed and heavy things that tormented the historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the scenes that cut off the head, which left me cold, and that's the kind of thing that should make sense, I think. Yes, there were beautiful bare trees and misty evenings and the jumper jumping from the tree was a nice special effect, but overall, the movie was just boring and useless.
