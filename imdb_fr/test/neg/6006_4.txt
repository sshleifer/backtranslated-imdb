This movie was really poor. I went to the theater hoping for something exciting, but I had the opportunity to hone my skills "guess the next scenario before that happens". Seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick pencil for everyone to see. Nothing was really shocking. In fact, even the gore was so suspended from his beliefs that he did not count much. <br /> <br /> The excessive explosion of nonsense and the cops' discussions at the scene of the crime gave the impression that more fake. And the scene where Lambert's character struggles with the clues and reaches his "epiphany of investigation" goes a long way to indicate the expected level of intelligence of the audience - little. <br /> <br /> Probably the most boring aspect of the cinematography was the "X-Files" treatment: every building in the film, whether it's the enclosure building, a house noon or hospital, suffered from a discernable lack of lighting (not to mention the lack of 'patients' in the case of the hospital). I do not remember a single scene where someone turned on a switch. It would certainly have been nice. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lambert is really not an Oscar-level actor, so I guess you have to take this film for what it's worth. In the end, I came to the conclusion that the only thing that would make this movie more entertaining would be to watch it after watching "The Warriors". Otherwise, you end up with a dull and unoriginal effort, which is far from comparable to movies like "Silence of the Lambs".
