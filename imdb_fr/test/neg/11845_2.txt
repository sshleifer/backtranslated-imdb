The most important and disconcerting thing about the Raptor movie was ending because the Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur, except that the kid in the loader was a little better played and the action than the adult. The similarities with Carnosaur's films were rather mediocre in terms of scenario. The only thing that worked well was the start with the kids in the jeep. Then the plot descended from the hill. It would have been nice if another plot had been designed, rather than cloning the previous movies. The raptor film should have drawn lessons from the series Jurasic Parks in various plots. The last film that came close to a good dinosaur movie recently is Aztec Rex. The scenes repeated as if they were extracted from the carnosaur films leave someone who thinks about these films.
