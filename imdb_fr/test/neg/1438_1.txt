Wow ... This movie is really bad ... said Nuff. <br /> <br /> The story: A psychopathic predator on the Internet follows and trains young men and women in crooked traps ... That's how, kidnappings people, they find it, it becomes a changed man and is released on the world once again, finds his old habits and starts the torture again ... The story is stupid, improbable. The characters are stupid, they are implausible ... or at least beyond. There are very violent pictures, and if you have a week's stomach, you might just want to stay away ... But again, even if you do not have the stomach of 'a week, you might want to stay away ... stupid. <br /> <br /> The cast: Dee Snider, Kevin Gage ... If you're an unconditional fan of Twisted Sister and Dee Snider, this one might interest you, since he's the writer and the star of this film. His game is ridiculously bad, and you can say that he wrote the terrible script. Kevin Gage ... Well, they say he has been in many other movies I've seen, but I do not remember him for any of them ... And you will not remember him for that ... These two, unfortunately, make the film ... They do not make it good, you ... They just do it ... <br /> <br /> Scale of one to five: 1 It's bad ... It's very very very bad. ..In fact, it's so serious, that this movie should come with a clip loading gun to play Russian Rullet with ...
