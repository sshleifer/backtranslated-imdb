This is one of those road movies that would tell you a lot about women, the universe, the better life, the terrible loneliness of the brilliant architect from Manhattan who cuts all ties with everyone, including his child of three years - who in fact, the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old school friend, which begins as a kind of good old conversation and ends on a threatening note: the oasis of a desert movie. <br /> <br /> The scene with-the-father-who-left-the-house-when-I-was-a-child was told and told and told. Of course, that did not stop the offspring from making its way And when you see the attitude of the hero's wife, you may think she has never heard of the lib. of the woman. <br /> <br /> The best is the soundtrack that includes great songs from Willie Nelson, Tom Waits or Bonnie Raitt ... But you can enjoy it without this tedious and pretentious work.
