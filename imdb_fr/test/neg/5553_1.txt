Except Frank Kress (who played Abraham Gentry), an appearance of Henny Youngman and the last few seconds of the film, this film is not particularly good. Why it is currently rated 5.3 and loved by some critics, it does not matter to me - the film is 99.44% shit ... and exactly what I expected the director Hershell Gordon Lewis. In the 1960s and 1970s, Lewis was known for producing a series of very low-budget films, such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER A GO-GO. However, in recent years he has been dubbed "the father of the gore" and he has many, many fans, fans who ignore the unfitness of his work and focus only on how some of his films have were revolutionary. But apart from the liberal use of fake blood and real guts, his films are at the heart of sheer shit - and do not trust scores of 9 and 10 for his films. It would be like putting on a velvet Elvis painting at the Louvre !! <br /> <br /> The film is about a series of very horrific murders perpetrated against strippers. When I say horrible, it's very bloody and sick for 1972 - although by today's standards, the special effects look incredibly lame. Thus, although very deviant and cruel murders occur in the film (I would prefer not to explain them - they are of a rather sick mind and show a particularly sick contempt for women), at least they will not be nauseating because that they were done so badly. It is obvious that in many cases they cut out rubber dolls and mannequins. But to make them perform certain sick, even unrealistic, acts is pretty nasty and shows a lot of misogyny. <br /> <br /> The only hope in the film, the police being all idiots, is a guy named Abraham Gentry - whose mannerisms and speech style are very close to the actor of the series, David Lochary, from the first John Waters films. Although his game is bad, he is so flamboyant and funny that he kept my interest. It could be quite funny and curiously it's the only movie he has ever done !! It was also strange that so many women wanted him - especially because they just did not look like his type. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the movie people, they are morons and idiots who could not act. In fact, I was hoping a little better than MORE was killed - they really had it coming! None of their roles were credible and apparently, the director NEVER re-shot a single scene - as most scenes in the film were worse than Ed Wood's masterpiece, PLAN 9 FROM EXTRA SPACE. In fact, for many women in the film, the only prerequisite for their appearance in the film is that they are willing to undress. Now, I know this will sound pretty nasty, but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like drug addicts who undress to have their next dose. When these ladies undress, the men in the crowd give them money to put it back (wow - Henny Youngman should have said that in the movie)! But given Lewis' budgets, it was probably the best "actress" he could have had. <br /> <br /> Overall, a bucket of dirty bile that manages to be worse than most other films of the director ... and that says a lot! It's violent (still silly), anti-women (treating them like meat and mutilating things) and is completely incompetent from start to finish.
