This film was horrible and the only reason it was done was because the story was about the far left. I consider myself moderate and so I could see this film as a pile of waste. Although I'm not a Bush fan, your aversion to GW is not reason enough to see this movie. <br /> <br /> For starters, the film was shot on a film as mediocre as it is cheap, rather than artistic. Moreover, the characters seriously lack depth. The character of Chris Cooper was a poor parody of George Bush; better suited for Saturday Night Live than a dramatic movie. The other characters are traveling clich√©s and are poor reproductions of much better movie characters. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs!
