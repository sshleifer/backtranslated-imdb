This film is certainly strange to say the least. The basic plot is composed of 3 former associates who invite 2 foreigners to return home for bringing back a wallet containing 10 dollars. The two who appear fall in love. The three older businessmen die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two youngest guests. So that may make sense, but then we have 3 old guys who apparently have live bread together..very weird here ... Harry Carey plays his base role, you can not tell if he's a nice guy or really a sting. I mean really, do you decide that I can deal with it. Then there's Richard Carlson playing Texas's James Houston ... hmmmmm, he looks a lot more like a gentleman from southern Kentucky than a Texas resident. This one is not even close. Then we take the 3 ghosts that would have a better chance of helping the New Orleans Saints win a playoff game than help them ... In fact, they really do not help us at all and why they are even in the movie is beyond any reach of knowledge .. Silly movie in which a cast of characters act totally out of character .. You can avoid this one ..
