I would not deny that I enjoyed watching Japanese horror movies, but everyone must be fed up with having seen the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> The film follows the story of the Grudge. Audrey, at the request of her mother, will recover her sister. But when she arrives, something strange happens to her sister and she is killed. She wants to discover the truth behind the spell and a photographer (Eason) joins her. On the other hand, one family and three girls are also affected, but they seem to realize it too late ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not see the points for the three school girls to appear in films because they are not (all) related to history. The reason that the woman who holds the grudge continues to kill people is still not very clear (it seems to me that they tell exactly the same things as in grudge). And the sudden appearance of Audrey in front of the boy is undoubtedly strange, which, I suppose, is an attempt to connect the story of the family. The scenes of massacres are absolutely the mixture of those of the Ring and Shibuya Kaidan. The acting game would be another negative point. As a Hong Kong, I would really like to support Edison Chen's first effort in Hollywood, but as a movie lover, I really do not find any interest in supporting a bad actor. Other actors like the father, even if he appears only in a few scenes, should have done better too. What's good is the atmosphere of the movie, especially when I watched it alone in the middle of the night. <br /> <br /> If you have the time, really enjoy all the horror movies and have seen all the horror movies possible. except that, like me, you can go get this to kill a little time. But if you really like Japanese horror movies like this, you should spend some time watching the Japanese version of the Ring.
