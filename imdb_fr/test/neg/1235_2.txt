I will give him a second chance but I was very disappointed with the first one. He would not hold a candle to the other series. He has many meaningless dialogues that add nothing to the plot. I agree with others that this does not seem to develop an interesting story. It's slow and painful and I do not know what the Comanches intend to do. Maybe all of this will be linked in the second installment, but I will have to force myself to look at it and find out. I am of Apache origin from Texas and New Mexico, but I do not recognize much of what is happening. I may not know the facts, but it does not do much to educate me.
