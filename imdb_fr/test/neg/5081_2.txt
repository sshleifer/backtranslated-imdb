those people who told me that "this movie is good", shame on them! This film is intended for an audience that has no problem to watch everything {especially when it comes to hard guys, guns, pursuits and theft}. I would compare this movie with "The Inside Man" (the same loss of time). I'm tired of copying / pasting films.and I'm unhappy, but what can I do? Fans of this type of movies are much more .... if you want to watch a good movie of this type, I will recommend it to you "Lucky Number Slevin". I'm not mean, I just do not like this movie {weak actors, weak scenario, weak action}. probably someone else will like it. Many people-many tastes.COURAIT FOR ME "CHAOS" IS TASTELESS!
