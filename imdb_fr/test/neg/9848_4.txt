Telling with finesse the story of Garden-of-Eden - nothing new, nothing shocking, although I think that's what the filmmakers were looking for. The idea is banal. Daisy Eagan's strong performance is pretty much everything. I thought she was 13 years old and her character interested me. The rest left me cold.
