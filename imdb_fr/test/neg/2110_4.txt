So I was stimulated during Snakes weekend on Plane, after the movie we still needed it. Why not snakes in a train? Seriously, his snakes probably kill people in trains. Snakes were supposed to be rots. First of all, my friends and I thought that snakes were garden snakes and harmless company snakes, with the same sound of rattling sound. In fact, we sat completely ready to extinguish it (we are too lazy to be able to eject). We then learned that we did not know what was going on, but that something fun was happening at the end. This is one of those endings that you will rewind a few times just to silence the laughter because you have suffered so much. <br /> <br /> Last 10 minutes an "8", rest of the film a 2.
