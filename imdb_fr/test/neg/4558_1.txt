I am impressed by the number of people who consider this film to be correct ... much less awesome! Do most people even have basic standards for a movie they watch? I just do not know anything. <br /> <br /> This "commercial film product" does not really deserve the respect of being called a movie. To say that Dean Cain is a talent is a blatant injustice to anyone with real talent. I have a lot of respect for Lori Petty, but most of these things have been lost. At least, his role was extremely small. Perhaps she had a bill that desperately needed to be paid. <br /> <br /> The ignorance I noticed when viewing "Firetrap" was incredible. Let me start by getting rid of this: if you can not show the fire realistically, do not show it at all. Okay?!! Everyone involved is embarrassed when you have lame effects that do not even look like a building that is burning. <br /> <br /> Some interesting information: 1. A concierge opens the door to a large storage cupboard and finds the whole room engulfed by the flames. What is he doing? He tries to put out the fire with his broom! 2. The same concierge (who knows the building is on fire) later meets a door marked "DANGEROUS MATERIALS". His brilliant mind told him that it would be a good idea to open the door. Big mistake! 3. A woman makes an incredibly generous donation of $ 100,000 to a greyhound rescue fund, but ... she wears a fur coat during her charity event! (Would people who care about animals not care a bit about this kind of thing?) 4. Many people in the film are forced to enter a safe with massive steel walls that impulse electromagnetic (!!) could not have. t penetrate. Still, they have a large air vent leading to the back of what everyone can explore. It seems to me to be a flaw in security. <br /> <br /> I could go on for a long time, but I got tired of thinking about this lame movie. Our "hero" whom we are supposed to encourage is a career criminal who tries to kill police very early. What a swollen guy! If the general public wants to spoil their minds with this decision, they will have more power. I just wish I could erase it from my memory. 1/10
