At least it's with this episode. We have here a time traveler, the Gilligan's Island teacher, going back in time to 1865. What do we do - why try to save Lincoln of course! No really interesting variation sounds on this old theme. As another reviewer puts it, this episode is particularly dull and unapologetic, and there is no indication that "the professor" is really back in the 1860s. Budgetary limits are obvious and management is frozen. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark but the production remains very flat. We too often feel on stage sets, waiting for something intelligent to happen. There is a minor twist at the end, but I insist on minor.
