Hi! I am Sheena, an African (but white!) Princess from the jungle tribe who has the incredible ability to turn into the cheapest and most indescribable monster in the world (imagine the 60's extraterrestrials, Star Trek) in rolling seductively in the mud! When I found myself for the first time in this horrible position, I took the only logical action: I made a torn bikini in the jungle in which to perform my antics. I love romance novels and occasionally tear up an unimpressive African warlord. And I would be remiss if I did not mention my sidekick (white, of course), Mr. Cutter, a former American soldier who seems to have fled the United States after his divorce. Can you say "dodge alimony"? In any case, it provides the occasional distraction of my difficult life. I mean, how many blonde idiots do you know who are also an endangered species of monster ripping flesh? Despite my many difficulties (playing is so difficult! * Moaning *), I did not give up and, after many reflections, I finally discovered my role in life: terrorizing insomniac viewers end of evening that are so unfortunate not to have cable or satellite.
