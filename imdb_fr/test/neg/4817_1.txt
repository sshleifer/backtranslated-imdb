A totally dead-man actor made in the Philippines. This belongs to the mode of Filipino films that have tried to pose as American films in the international market. After a rather boring start, the film takes off and never disappoints. This is actually a scam of the worst films of Chuck Norris: an American prisoner in Vietnam is brainwashed by the Soviets who implant a chip to kill him so he kills the pope, then President of the States -United. One of his old friends (played by the pillar of movie B, Max Thayer) is sent to stop him. Totally ridiculous action scenes, a putrid action game (Nick Nicholson's performance as a devilish Soviet commander is an event not to be missed!) And an implausible plot offsets one of the most action never seen by the general public.
