"When a Killer Calls" is an unusually nasty slasher movie, with very unpleasant and disturbing footage. The decision was clearly made to try to take advantage of the "When a Stranger Calls" remake by inserting - almost word for word - the phone call sequences of this movie. They seem very forced. <br /> <br /> In addition, the filmmaker commits the capital sin (but too common) to make the heroine's friends repulsive fools. So, for the beginning of the film, we love the babysitter (a credible job of Rebekah Kochan), but she was joined by her teenage classmates and the atmosphere is ruined. <br /> <br /> The movie genre works, but it's probably a lot more unpleasant than you'd expect, so be warned.
