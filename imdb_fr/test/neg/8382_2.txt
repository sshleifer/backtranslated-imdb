In studying the differences between religion and worship in college, Mindy (Rachel Miner), who is the best student in the class, convinces her classmates Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel Michaely) and Morgan Venegas) to investigate the massacre of Kwan Yin worshipers by their leader Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) twenty years ago in California. Quinlin had found an ancient amulet in southern China that would give him enormous power after the sacrifice of human souls, but a woman resists and is destroyed. However, after Morgan's death, which seems to commit suicide, the students discover that Quinlin has returned and pursues their soul with his amulet. <br /> <br /> The story of "Cult" is not totally bad. Unfortunately, unfortunately, the screenplay, the staging, the role play, the camera, the CGI and the edition are awful. I was completely bored and tried to use the FF button on the DVD, but I resisted and lost 90 minutes of my life watching this endless shit on a Saturday night. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Amuleto Secreto" ("The Secret Charm")
