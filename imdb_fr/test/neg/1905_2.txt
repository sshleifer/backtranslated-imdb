Without Colin Firth, the movie would be ready for the trash! So predictable, so silly and so bad! As always, only Colin Firth shines through this mess like a single light at the end of the tunnel! <br /> <br /> The worst was the role of Jennifer Rubin, of course! It may be because of this script (did they actually write one or was it invented "on the way" ???). <br /> <br /> To make a story too short: <br /> <br /> It's a must to see only for Colin Firth Fanatics (like me) because he's incredibly sexy and a good actor (he struggling against this "mental challenge" scenario). These minutes of Colin-Screen-Time are an important part of this film. <br /> <br /> Do not spend too much money on it. Try to see or get the cheapest possible (an auction or something like that) and stay true to Colin Firth's scenes. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie could be dangerous for anyone's mental health.
