The Women of George Cukor remains one of the glittering jewels of 1939, the most worthy golden age of Hollywood. The film creaked and sparkled and his absence of men was a subtle touch, hardly noticed because of all the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Flash forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York, in front of Saks. Large crowds jostle along the avenue ... but something is wrong. The picture reveals only well-dressed women (attractive and young). More scary than I am a legend, the visual concept continues inside the store and later at a big fashion show. What fashion show in New York does not have at least 5 gay men? The rule of "no men" is imposed on us, creating a foreign world, unbalanced and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Enter Meg Ryan, who has been seen for the first time rummaging through her garden wearing a ridiculous outfit with her retro curls. and waving arms. I immediately sympathized with her husband and I understood why he had looked elsewhere. Later in the film, she turns into an old Jennifer Aniston and keeps her arms to the sides. It sounds intentional as if to say, "Look, I can always be relevant!" Ryan's character is overwhelmed by a group of unmatched friends (insert the Sex and the City comparison here) who, if it were the real life, would despise each other. Annette Bening plays the role of the potential bitch who, during the film, realizes that the dream of her life does not make her really happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is the lesbian of power, all endearing, useless for any of the men who are not there. Debra Messing is a kind of baby factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes is a strange choice to say the least. She looks fake, acts fake and humor, she tries to demonstrate falls flat. Someone commented here that she seemed transgender was perfect. Different stars come to rearrange the furniture of this Titanic. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved this movie would have been the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could have named their price, firmly put their tongue in their cheeks and achieve something very smart and profitable. But no, Hollywood considers itself too much for such exploitation. Instead, we are given this thing that growls awkwardly without spark. Entire sections of the original dialog box are raised and embedded in a scene with appalling results. At one point, Ryan exclaims, "This is not a 1930s movie!" No Meg, it's not.
