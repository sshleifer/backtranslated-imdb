I came out of this film and I did it only once before with the Australian film Sweetie almost 20 years ago. After about three minutes, I wanted to kill the cameraman and I just could not believe that this movie had been shown anywhere and, guess what, had been nominated for two independent Spirit Awards. What???? Regardless of the possible realism of the dialogue (I will never use the word "guy"!) - who wants to listen to these conversations? I do not go to the movies to be bored but that's all I have. The only good thing I left with is the realization that if this film reaches Sundance and other festivals, everyone can. Well, wait, it might not be a good thing after all ...
