It's absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. I hope the REAL family and other characters represented have lawyers suing VH1 for their interpretation. The acting is horrible, the writing is worse and the representation of the characters is scary. It's supposed to be a drama, but it was a comedy for me, you have no choice but to laugh at the bad acting. I usually like to play Flex Alexanders, but this time he completely missed the goal. <br /> <br /> One could say that he took this role for some laughs himself, because it was so horrible. If you really want a dramatic movie for the night, DO NOT CHOOSE IT. But if you're having fun for a bad acting and a stupid writing, give yourself. Apart from that, do not waste your time.
