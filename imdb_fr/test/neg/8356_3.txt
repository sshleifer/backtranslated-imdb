I have a question for the authors and producers of "Prozac Nation": What is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in America? In Christina Ricci's moving film as Liz Wurtzel, the film depicts a young woman with unlimited potential, Harvard student and writer. But it's not a story of success, it's a story of self-destruction as we see Liz putting misery into the lives of everyone who comes into contact with her. The film examines divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol and prescription drugs as possible causes of Liz's dissatisfaction. But none of these superficial explanations is satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At some point in the film, it would have been helpful to suggest to Liz to take responsibility for her life and her problems. The film claims not to have been highlighted by the film "The United States of Depression". In the story, Liz had a caring therapist (Anne Heche), a caring roommate (Michele Williams), a caring boyfriend (Jason Biggs) and a worried but caring mother (Jessica Lange). In a key scene in the film, Liz is lying on a hospital bed watching the burst of the Space Shuttle Challenger. Instead of equating Challenger with Liz's life, the film should have used the image as a starting point for healing and recovery. <br /> <br /> This film made me think of a generic film of "victim" designed for cable: the network for life. An excellent cast was wasted, especially by the serious performance of Christina Ricci. The real life of Elizabeth Wurtzel has obviously found in her the resources to deal with her depression and become a successful author. It is unfortunate that the film can not offer us the slightest glimpse of its courageous spirit.
