The idea of ​​bringing Dracula to contemporary times is not a bad idea. After all, she could revive the show a bit by adding a new story element to a series that Hammer has almost exhausted in a long series of generally excellent films. However, because the present turns out to be the early 1970s, the results are quite ridiculous and more closely resemble LOVE AT FIRST BITE (a deliberate comedy). Seeing Christopher Lee in a movie filled with 70s jargon, electric guitar chords, and laughable rock music just seemed stupid. To make matters worse, the acting is much more exaggerated here - with an intense and stupid performance by "Johnny Alucard". I also found it very funny that Van Helsing's grandson realized that "Alucard" was "Dracula" spelled backwards - no one else noticed it! Wow, what a trick! <br /> <br /> That's why so many things were bad in the film, why did he still get an almost respectable score of 4? Well, when the story came to the expected showdown between Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Drac (Christopher Lee), it was exciting and ended very well. In addition, and I know it will seem very sexist, but if I had to watch a bad movie, at least the character of Stephanie Beacham wore very pretty outfits that revealed his many "talents", so to speak. So at least it was a nice movie to watch. <br /> <br /> By the way, the film ends with the phrase "may it rest in peace FINAL" at the end, though it is not the last film of Hammer Dracula with Lee. He came back for "Dracula's Satanic Rites" shortly afterwards and it was in many ways even worse than that failed monster movie.
