I'm a fan of Get Shorty. It is the continuation of the film which did not need continuation. <br /> <br /> Chile is back but Ren√© Russo left without a glance. Unfortunately, the game of Chile was played in the first film and rather than finding an interesting personal arc for him, they simply ask him to repeat the lines of the first film. It's pretty warm. Travolta looks old here. It's as if they were moving people around him because his bones were cracking. His pink gloss and blue eyes are very strange. The second role is Edie (played by Uma Thurman). She is a music producer, a role that only asks her to be Reuben Kincaid's wife. ("Hey, these kids have a great new sound.") In any scene, she hits the wrong tone with motivation or emotion, or both. It's painful to watch. Despite his many problems, Be Cool improves after a very unattractive start. <br /> <br /> I certainly had my laughter (Vince Vaughan having ignited, Cedric the Entertainer, Ludicrous, The Rock, a -shirt that says "widow" on it), but it does not offer no good memories once it's over. It is a festival of love in helium light from the first image. In the first film, Gene Hackman is an inestimable idiot. It's just about doing good in the world, for a couple of kids who deserve a chance (Beyonce & the Rock). Ho-hum. The first was not a preacher. <br /> <br /> Working (repeatedly) in gags and replicas of the first film is annoying, just like the stupid concession to Rock's wrestling fans (he raises his eyebrow twice), funny jokes to the Inside: Steven Tyler saying "I'm not the kind of singer who makes appearances in the movies" ar ar. <br /> <br /> The spectacular composition of the stars is part of the problem. The first film was not overloaded by "stars". <br /> <br /> For a rental of money, let's call it the same.
