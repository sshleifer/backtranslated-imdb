A real failure, the novel is a trip to the madness so great that the stomach is done, but it's made for nonsense as in the TV movie style is turquoise and painfully slow. Stick to Mike Hammer. I can not believe that no body created a brilliant version of this book, Kubrick springs on the cover, he should have taken the reins of it. Stacey Keach is too soppy like Lou Ford, and all of it has the same production values ​​as this 1970s TV derivative of Planet Of The Apes. I strongly recommend you to buy a lot of Jim Thompson's novels, in fact, The Grifters is not too badly done, it's one of his, starring Jon Cusak.
