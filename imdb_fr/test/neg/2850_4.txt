Well, it was not a complete waste. As usual, Armand was very good in the movie ,,, the whole thing between the Turks and the Germans was a bit strange because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the beginning of the film. These are serial killings with all gang warfare that are loosely woven. Never seen a movie where the characters looked Italian, supposed to be Turkish, taking English (American accent and euphemisms) with German words. The highlight was the most intriguing part and there are some that still do not make sense to me. In any case, if you have nothing else to do, you can watch this movie ..
