Have you ever seen one of these shows that has become so popular that it could eventually get away with the slightest hogwash and repetitive gimmicks without enthusiasm that its creators can get away with it? If you have not done it yet, then you've never seen Family Guy. <br /> <br /> Fans of the series seem to think that it is spirit, edgy and poignant. It's none of it, it's still dull, repetitive, insulting and uninspired. <br /> <br /> The show's humor comes from two sources. <br /> <br /> 1) Idiocy irrelevant. The show often has flashbacks about things that have nothing to do with intrigue and that are mostly simply absurd and useless. And then, there are random movie references in which the show's characters recreate a scene from a popular film without parodying it effectively. . . or parodying it at all (which is not funny !!!!!). <br /> <br /> 2) the same shit that is in every episode of the series. The only guy is a sexual deviant with STDs, AHA HA! Is not it funny? Hey, you know what's even more funny? Make the same joke on him anywhere between one and fifteen times in a single episode. And do not just tell it a few times in a single episode, be sure to drag it so that a whole scene is dedicated to telling a joke. Now, also imagine that this same routine is used again and again for virtually every character in the series. <br /> <br /> The offbeat humor "a-PC" is not as "a-PC" as they would be. are you convinced, most of the time, they just say what morons think about the latest newspaper headlines, politicians and random celebrities. <br /> <br /> The series had its strong moments, but now I think it's time to take the show off and finish with it. <br /> <br /> Do you know what's funny? I still love this more than Nausicaa from the wind valley.
