The characterization in this film is among the worst I have ever encountered. The dialogue is banal and clich√© to the point of causing extreme distraction. None of the characters' problems are developed - they are only superficial details intended to convey a message without having to establish a credible dialogue to support that point. In addition, the description of the Chinese characters leaves something to be desired - I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father learns a flawless English in a book (or implicates him in a scene) so that he can teach it in his own language. girl . Etc. <br /> <br /> The smile train is an excellent organization and it's a good idea to make a heartbreaking film about the impact of a program like this on the lives of children, but in the Together, I found film to be more frustrating than anything.
