Have you ever read a book, and then seen the movie, and wonder-how could they lose it so badly? This is one of those. Huffaker's book, "Nobody likes a drunk Indian" was awesome, incredibly funny ... this movie is not. It seems that no one cared enough to move the direction, so we were concerned about the characters. This film, which addresses real concerns about the Indians, makes you wonder why we have not seen more comedies about the Holocaust or slavery. Not well done.
