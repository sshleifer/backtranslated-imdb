I rented this movie hoping it would provide good entertainment and interesting knowledge or stories about poker. What I got was a type of documentary about a normal guy's life that turned out to be really good in cards. Do I want to see romance with his wife? NO Do I want to see everything that happened in this guy's life except poker? NO. That's what you get with this movie. The acting game is good for a shit on a budget. The film never tries to break the mold or do something original. He just sleeps his way through the script. The end is disappointing and never really looks in Ungar's mind. Instead, he focuses on what was already obvious. He was a drugged card player with a mean life unlike any other joe in vegas. The film focuses on aspects of his life that were extraordinary at the UN rather than extraordinary. The poker scenes of the entire movie total about 4 minutes of footage. Ungar's success in winning the WSOP 3 times seems to be a life after reflection. A 10-year-old boy could do a better job in making this movie .. or maybe it was the scenario that was a shit from the beginning that condemned this movie joke. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie movie about the game watch the Rounders. He has at least some style.
