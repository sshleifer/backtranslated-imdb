..that separate good memorable movies from movies like this one. It's not entertaining, touching, funny, interesting and sometimes feels a little subhuman. The directors act as if they were from another world, in the worst case, when they are supposed to be in relation to each other and to the public. <br /> <br /> Begins fairly conventionally. A rich child gets a new car to graduate, but the dean said he could not get the car before the ceremony. Still going to party and stop in the dining room on the wrong side of the slopes for a quick argument with local onlookers. Wise-asses the waitress / girlfriend's yokel head. Surprisingly, they play chicken until they accidentally burn the dinner they left three minutes earlier (are not the guests all five feet from the gas station?). <br /> <br /> They said they had to pay the price in court Therefore, the only reason this fish out of the water must stay in town is to propose the scenario that the two boys must participate in the reconstruction of the restaurant. Worse than that, the rich kid lives in the non-rich kid's family, in the room above the attic. This "room above the attic" saved many people needing a bed. <br /> <br /> The rich child is inexplicably well treated by the girlfriend, who never tells him that he almost killed her. Of course, this does not bode well with her boyfriend and is never fully explained. You do not know why Sam (Leelee Sobieski) craves for Kelley (Chris Klein), or why Jasper (Josh Hartnett) allows it. <br /> <br /> Chris Klein is tolerable, Leelee is totally intolerable, and Josh does not have much impression. The character who has the most life is the judge who sentences Kelley and Jasper to help rebuild the restaurant. It retains at least one amusing remark, which exceeds that of anyone. Everyone is so moody and humorless that you will feel a little sick if you even think about smiling while filming. <br /> <br /> The end is a way to finish the piece, not the most original, but at least it was over. I do not like to miss a movie that a little girl somewhere in the world would like a lot, but since I'm not, I have to do it. The nicest thing I can say about this movie is that it's not mean-spirited, and even if it does not manage to constrain it, its innocence and banal and provocative dialogue come from a beautiful place . 4/10.
