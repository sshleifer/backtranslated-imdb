OK, let me start by saying that it's not a horrible movie at all. It's just not good. I remember a poster saying that acting is not a show but it is nuanced. No, I saw nuanced Japanese and Asian actors. I'm sorry, you're wrong. This is the camp. <br /> <br /> The characters are totally unfriendly, the dead are totally random and totally insignificant. The writing is bad. I agree to suspend disbelief, nor can I leave everything in the form of a plot. But this movie has no plot. One critic said, "This film is happening in a small town where people are going crazy about swirls and spirals." This is not a presentation text, it's all the creepy movie. Congratulations, I just saved you almost an hour and a half. There is nothing more. No development of the character, no development of the plot, no explanation, no resolution. And not even the lack of resolution "Acceptable in the kingdom of J-Horror". Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, the score is made by a person who obviously did not watch the film at the time, because it is random enough to cause a whiplash. Cognitive dissonance is one thing and well done, it can be brilliant (see Dark Water), but here it looks like the score was designed to go with another movie. <br /> <br /> The best example I can give, it's as if the Japanese remake Evil Dead without the slightest evil or good actor. It falls flat. It's J-horror without horror.
