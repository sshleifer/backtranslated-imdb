The sometimes memorable dialogue of screenwriter Frederick Fox and a study group of former pros can not save this lukewarm western on whites, stuck in the desert by a gang of bloody Cheyenne indidians. Aside from his sometimes catchy dialogue, Fox's scenario does not leave any surprises for this confrontation between Whites and Indians. The characters of "Dakota Incident" arouse only a minor interest, certainly not enough to distinguish them as much as some of Fox's choice dialogues. Unfortunately, a good dialogue is Fox's only contribution because this little conventional sagebrusher has a dull ending that contradicts his previous 80 minutes. The end is as artificial as they come and lacks credibility. Most of the characters are nice, but some just miss common sense. <br /> <br /> Dale Robertson is pretty tough and tough. John Banner, one of the three bank robbers who has to kill him down, partners without counting. Famous Western actor John Doucette (Rick Largo) plays the best of criminals, while Skip Homeier, lost in an unimportant role as Banner's brother, Frank Banner, later dies of an Indian arrow. Doucette tries to attack Banner at the beginning of the action, but our left-handed armed hero simulates his own death, finds Largo later and hits him in a town called Christian Flats. Naturally, Largo bites the dust this time, but Banner makes an interesting discovery. One of the passengers of a Christian Flats diligence in Laramie is none other than the bank teller from whom he stole the money. Not only John Carter (John Lund) is himself looking for Banner, but he also wants to silence his name at the bank that has published the posters wanted for his arrest. Clearly, the authorities were wrong and expanded Carter's role in the robbery. Carter is ready to take Banner to Laramie and send him to court, but Banner has other ideas about Laramie. Banner's ideas change when he meets Amy Clarke (Linda Darnell, former beauty of Twentieth Century Fox), wearing a bright red dress and still keeping all her breasts. Like all the others mentioned in their critics, Republic Studio's Truecolor highlights RED in every area, from Darnell's stained-blooded outfit. The problem with the fact that Director Lewis Foster behaved this way is that everything is wasted after the stagecoach lost a wheel and our heroes find themselves plunged into a chasm to defend themselves against the Cheyenne. The good guys and the Cheyenne finally miss ammunition, but "Dakota Incident" never misses clich√©s. Ward Bond has had many interesting moments as a politically correct politician who defends the redskin path. At the end of this 88-minute dust lift, you'll feel like you're trapped in a ravine and threatened to steal yourself in Cheyenne.
