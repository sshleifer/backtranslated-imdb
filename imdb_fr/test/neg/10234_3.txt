Wow, this version of THE RACKETEER was hard to watch! Although none of the other critics mentioned it, the version of the public domain I watched was seriously flawed. The soundtrack was turned off by about 10 seconds, which means that the dialogue and action never matched. So, you hear something happen well before you see it - a very confusing proposition! The worst is where you hear a shot and only later is the guy hit and dies in a taxi. <br /> <br /> Even if it seriously spoiled the film, it was also easier to focus on the dialogue. -and showed the serious shortcomings of it too. The dialogue was simply horrible - often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling. As one critic put it, it was like watching a play in high school. This is partly understandable because the sound was a new medium, but the dialogue of this film was bad even compared to the other 1929 films - really bad. And, like many of these early sound films, the film was too talkative - with too sneaky and melodramatic language and little action. And you would think with a title like "The Racketeer" that there would be action !! However, it is a true love story - with very little action. <br /> <br /> The film finds Carol Lombard on horseback with an alcoholic musician. She ends up stealing to try to take care of him - and the scammer, Robert Armstrong, comes to his aid. When Armstrong catches her cheating at the cards, he protects her and then helps the drunk brother to get up - and he naturally falls in love with her. The problem is that once the drunkard has lost his temper, he too wants Lombard and she has to choose between them. Wow ... a recovering drunkard or a gangster ... talk about some great prospects! Overall, it's a little hard to evaluate considering the ugly impression I've seen. However, even if you do not know it, the film has many problems because of its misuse of dialogue and its overly talkative nature. And ... it was so ugly.
