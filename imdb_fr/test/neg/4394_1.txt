When I went to the video rental store to get a movie, I saw this one and I immediately thought it would be funny. The picture looked like it was a type of classic comedy involving teenagers (like a road trip) that I thought was worth watching. When I shot the movement, I was disappointed because the jokes were awful and old-fashioned. The only small gesture that the director could have found amusing would be that someone slips on wet ground. It's not a joke and would not make people laugh. In fact, I planned to close this film halfway through. I was annoyed by this film because it was only a waste of time and money to rent it. We did not take enough care to make this film and not enough time and work. I found the acting act pretty bad too. The only time I laughed was because of the very bad actions of "jokes" or really funny acts !!! I note this film a 1/10. I hope you found this review useful.
