I saw this film only because Sophie Marceau. However, her acting abilities are not enough to save this movie. Almost all actors do not play their characters well, with the exception of Sophie and Frédéric. The plot could give a better movie if the good pieces were in the right places. I have seen several good French movies but I do not like this one.
