I was eager to watch this movie because I loved the David Lynch version. In my first attempt to look I fell asleep. Nothing was happening. The next night, I tried to watch the rest, and it still fell asleep! Nothing in this film has ever happened that could keep anyone's interest. The only time it was a bit more exciting was when I tried Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disc containing bonuses. Needless to say, I did not have a hard time withstanding the torture of watching over Dune (2000). Here are the weak points: the acting was bad, the plot was moving slowly, the sets were and seemed cheap, the direction was pathetic and the visual effects of CGI were childish. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Dune, save your money or rent the 1984 version.
