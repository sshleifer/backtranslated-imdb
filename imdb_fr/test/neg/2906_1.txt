This is by far the worst movie of all time. I have no doubt. I've seen bullshit like Manos, Space Mutiny, etc., and I can honestly say they do not hold the candle at Science Crazed. <br /> <br /> Science Crazed does not have a confusing plot. Something about a guy who puts a Turkish-born pregnant woman and the child born * hours later * is an adult and ready to kill. Of course, being a newborn baby, it takes him about an hour to kill people. The director continually loops the footage and takes about 15 minutes to create an awkward death. There is about a dialogue page for the whole movie, but the dialogue comes about a minute after his conversation. <br /> <br /> Example of scene: the monster is walking in a room. We know it because it has about ten minutes of videos in loop of its feet. Between loops, we have two working women. Repeat ad nauseum for about 20 minutes. When the monster appears, nobody moves, and everyone seems to be a deer in the light of the headlights, because it takes him another 10 minutes to kill him. At the acting level, you will guess that the characters are already dead. <br /> <br /> I know my description does not look too bad, but believe me, I can not fully describe the pain of Science Crazed. <br /> <br /> Stay away and boycott all the video stores that offer it. :) <br /> <br />
