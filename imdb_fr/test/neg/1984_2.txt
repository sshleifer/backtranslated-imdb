This film is sometimes called "The Story of O-Pt.2", which attempts to pose as a sequel to the French erotic thriller "The Story Of O". Although I have never seen the original version, I still saw this sorry mixture of sexual and social politics. I guess the angle "O" comes from some occasional S & M nuances (which were never as explicit (and as unpleasant to look at) as those of "Mistress." Klaus Kinski is the only recognizable face of this French production. -Japanese (but speaks useless lines in English - at least in the version I saw) .The useless use of surrealism manages to make it just a boring example in an even more pretentious pseudo porn (what are they looking for?) to prove with the representation of a piano floating in the water?) It is obvious that after all the tendency "porno chic" in the cinema is tarnished (ouch-sorry, bad play of words!) In 1975, the producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel to try to please the masters of adult cinema, not to mention Foreign / Art Cinema, moviegoers have had to face dreck as "The Last Woman", and others like that.
