Wow .. where do I start. I rented this movie because it looked like something I would be interested in watching. With a name like Val Kilmer in this film, I thought how serious it could be. It must be the worst movie I've ever seen with such a big name attached to it. I wondered why he had fallen through the cracks and I never remembered hearing about it on his first outing. It starts rather well and is somewhat reminiscent of the introduction sequence into the Bourne identity, but after the first 30 minutes or so, the situation worsens and then ventures into the WTF lands. If you have not already seen it, do yourself a favor and do not rent it unless you are a masochist or do not want to see all of Val Kilmer's films. There are many more titles that are worth your time. This film (if you can call it that) is a real waste of time. I want my 82 minutes back.
