Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist at a Pittsburgh steel plant who recruits workers from within the party, even if it is isolated from his son, his family and his neighbors. What makes the situation even more difficult is that Cvetic is in fact an FBI agent masquerading as a communist in order to obtain information about the party's activities. The party is trying to create a strike at the factory, through which the pro-strike movement will drag the workers into a wave of propaganda. Cvetic also faces the beautiful party member Eve Merrick, a teacher at her son's school, who discovers that Cvetic is a double agent. When Eve learns the ugly truth about the real motivations of the party, the reds decide that she must be liquidated and Cvetic must help her without putting herself in danger. The film should have a lot of suspense and double crossing but there is very little in this film but (according to current standards) a very old propaganda and little action or thrills. Lovejoy is very good in the lead role, but even he and the rest of the cast seem apathetic. Some surprises here and how did this film receive an Oscar for best documentary? Note, 4.
