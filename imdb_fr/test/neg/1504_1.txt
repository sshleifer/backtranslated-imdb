An object lesson on how to make a bad movie that pretends to be a horror. Without going too close, I imagine that it is the results of a group of students from film schools who have all added elements to the story, then who really acted! It's a bit like a movie studio and it's a film that badly needs an editor. In this case, it would have lasted 10 minutes! The director of this bin probably had more money than sense. Consider the number of submitted scripts or even unreleased movies that could have benefited. The so-called Granny who kills people in a rather stupid way resembled Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future - or maybe to musicians Johnny Winter / Edgar Winter. It starts with 20 minutes of boring and boring nonsense from students - something about paranoia. To give this waste 1 is because it can not get less. It does not have a single redemptive characteristic - and when one of the girls thinks that the body on the floor is covered with blood, it's the guy who's laughing, she really needs to taste the red stuff before she know it's not tomato ketchup! It's an insult to the intelligence of an idiot
