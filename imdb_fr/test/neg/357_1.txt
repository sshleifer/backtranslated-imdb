I just watched this movie on Bravo! and it was absolutely horrible. He has the plot of a Shannon Tweed movie without nudity. The premise was quite interesting, a winning lottery ticket in an isolated area and people who have reasons why they want money. The characters were commonplace, as were the observations about human nature and greed. <br /> <br /> For a movie called Class Warfare, it had very little to do with class differences other than the first 20 minutes and the predictable end. This movie could have done a lot better if there had been more motivated characters to get the ticket and was a "who did it?" <br /> <br /> The acting game was not fantastic, but it's hard to look credible with such a terrible script. Lindsey McKeon is very cute and I would like to see what she could do in a better production with a better screenplay. She is probably the only reason I spent the whole movie. <br /> <br />
