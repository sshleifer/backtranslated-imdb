Poor Jane Austen. This bitch from a production does not do justice to her wonderful language. From the top ... poorly adapted. The screenwriter deserves extremely low notes for trying - thinking well, I do not know what she was looking for, but suffice it to say that she missed the bar of light years !! If we add to that all the excessive and awful production values, this is an adaptation that should never have happened. It would have been much better to simply give all the money they paid into this flop and give it to a worthy charity. Do yourself a favor, read the book. It is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to miss out on this atrocious production!
