This film defines the word "confused". All the actors remain faithful to the scenario. It's a shame, because the role play is good, but the scenario is a confusing pastiche of pseudo-psycho-analytic random ideas. The cadence is extremely slow and the soft focus lens cinematography quickly attacks the nerves. I give it 4 out of 10.
