this movie is basically a misinterpretation of the old urban babysitter legend that receives phone calls asking her to check the kids, she calls the police who retraces the calls and finds her coming from home. When a killer calls for such a simplistic story, a little child could have written it. not a lot of suspense, it is clear who is the killer halfway through the film. at first, when the first victim is killed, it looks like a bondage fetish scene on a porn site or something like that. What's up with that? the film is a typical slasher film with a scenario as original as a Beatles concert. Even at low budget slasher standards its tacky. Do not waste your time with that. Nuff said
