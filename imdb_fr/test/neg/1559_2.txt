The aliens let loose a giant monster named Zarkorr, then send a hologram that looks like your average stupid teenager to tell the postman, Tommy Ward (Rhys Pugh, in the only movie in which you've ever seen him) who was chosen to combat. Moreover, if he loses the plant, he is condemned, so he leaves to fight against Zarkorr the Invader! This film is bad, very bad. So bad that you need negative numbers to give him a rattan. Horridly written, bad staging, well below the wooden game table you're just shit for a horde of lumberjacks to come out of nowhere and cut them! And do not get me started on the theme song at the end. The people who made this S $ @ # movie should not be aloud near a camera or anything related to movies. Zarkorr is a cool monster that should have been in a movie a million times better than this one. Do yourself a favor and do not see this movie, it's 80 minutes of life. The actors who participate have never worked again. <br /> <br /> 3/10
