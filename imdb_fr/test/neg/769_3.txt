Dumb is right: Tom and Jerry reach their goal of a nonstop flight to Africa, but then worry about mingling with the natives. They put the "black face", crashed the plane, tried to survive in an airplane wing floating in the ocean, and then survived wild animals once on shore <br /> <br /> After having read some reviews before seeing it, i knew what to expect. It was just these two guys who made their impressions of Amos and Andy / Stepin 'Fetchit. Offensive for blacks? Of course, but these are the 1930s for you. Some of their lines were funny, others stupid. The main fault I had with this caricature was the audio, because it was often difficult to understand what these two guys were saying. <br /> <br /> In all, it's a matter of curiosity, but do not let racism stop you from checking. At least, it gives you an idea of ​​how times have changed ... for the better.
