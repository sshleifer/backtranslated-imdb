I understand that the budget was low for this film, but hey, it's a really terrible movie. The script is just awful and it was the free party. The effects are not bad, but this film unfolds like a conventional R movie with nauseating fears and flawless violence, rather than a no-frills, unposed party and intentionally designed for video. Who were these joking guys? As if it would have been released in the theaters. <br /> <br /> The acting game is terrible. The editing, another free aspect of the film, is not amateur, and the plot, as I said before, leaves little to be desired. The film is not original. Gore fans, avoid this one. For filmmakers: try something original the next time or stop making movies together. You are not good at that. People hate rushes, especially low caliber ones. TO AVOID! It's not even worth making fun of.
