It's a show to watch, it's neither the best nor the worst. I look at it for a long time and I do not like any novelties. This show has changed into a basket of teens and lives a lot differently. I do not like this shit..I do not have an IQ why they completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was really nice to watch and was partly fun. The 2nd season is just out of this stupid world. I do not really know why the writers / directors have changed this show. many more people liked the 1st season better than the 2nd and the 3rd. I will only watch the first season of this show from now on, every time I see a new episode, I will change the chain f * ckin ... you heard me! He gets a 3/10 because I enjoyed the first season but hated the 2nd and 3rd
