It's a pity that IMDb does not let you give negative votes. It's the most dreadfully horrible show ever imposed on the American public by our friendly neighbors to the north. The parents are a troglodyte and a neurotic monkey. It is as charming as a well-used fire hydrant, respecting the same standards of hygiene. She is a model wax museum programmed with more neuroses than the entire cast of THE VIEW. Children are non-feminine entities and pushing beyond any male belief, especially the main character. The boy is a serious candidate for the most insignificant, unsatisfied, arrogant, and vain male character of Disney, who says something. This show has obviously been conceived as the anti-BRADY BUNCH, but it presents itself as the antichrist. And why is photography so dark?
