What starts pretty well (and quite disturbing) goes quickly into a messy clutter. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider (of Twisted Sister Infamy) apparently wrote the script from his own idea and Stacking Pierce Freak has potential, they really mess up here on an irregular rhythm, a bad dialogue and the one of the biggest non-achievements you've ever seen. Despite lifeless performances, the director manages a truly scary first reel. It really looks like a low budget endeavor. <br /> <br /> No luck. The plot goes all over the map, and Snider's character spits relentlessly lines of boring psychotic fortune cookies that are supposed to be seen as constructive dialogue. Even worse, the support cast barely registers and the only half credible dialogue comes from a girl helping a detective navigate the Internet. <br /> <br /> What a waste of a good idea. Oh, and there's a new crooked song from Sister, if you care.
