Perry Mason: The Glass Coffin affair allowed Raymond Burr to defend David Copperfield / Rick Blaine, like the wizard Peter Scolari, in a murder charge involving one of his assistants. A trick involving a glass coffin hanging in the air goes awry and Nancy Grahn's body is unbuckled. <br /> <br /> Nancy was one of six female assistants who work with the act and we learn two things about her. At first in a drunken moment of weakness, Scolari was seduced by her and she claims she was impregnated. Second, she lives under a pseudonym and had a secret from her past. <br /> <br /> Billy Moses, who probably never thought he would do such hard things in law school eventually get confused with some good old boys when going to get the truth in the city natal of Grahn. A little more action than usual for Ken Malansky, he is almost killed. <br /> <br /> A big defect of this mystery is the simple forensic science. The forensic report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim had been killed in such a way that Scolari could not have actually done the act. The police should have looked for the killer in a different direction. <br /> <br /> When you see who the killer is, you will not blame the individual, but you will also see how investigating officer James McEachin was wrong from the beginning. It spoils Mason's film a bit.
