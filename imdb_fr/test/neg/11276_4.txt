When you look at this film, with its deterministic causes and effects, its clich√©s, and its ridiculous feeling, can anyone be so naive as to think that Barrie's life was like that? You look at him in a position of disagreement. Hollywood biopics are no longer based on individual lives, they are simply rewritings of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood were filming a movie about your life, it would be filled with such a perfect synchronization that you would barely recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be erased by a certain explanatory and simplistic background. Your story would look like "Rocky" because it's the only arc of life that Hollywood knows how to produce. We could not let the public think about everything that was left open. This film does not trust an audience to solve problems without being driven. I perceived the hook / mother reference of the captain before the film translated it literally for me. I could see the 25 children spinning for days. <br /> <br /> It's a completely average film. Not horrible but not great. This is why it is likely that some Oscars will be announced next year. The Academy likes nothing better than to congratulate itself for having finally noticed the schemes put in place during the last thirty years. <br /> <br /> From the New Yorker article "Lost Boys" by ANTHONY LANE: <br /> <br /> "Arthur Llewelyn Davies, also adored his boys, and he may be unfair from "Finding Neverland" to omitting it from the scene to rationalize it: by the time Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she's already a widow, while Arthur was very much alive when Barrie first entered consciousness and Little by little in the home of the Llewellyn Davies family. <br /> <br /> "Finding Neverland" is a weepie.Since the moment that Barrie met George and Jack and began to think of ways to make them immortal, the story is sad, but the reality is even gloomier: 1907 Arthur Llewellyn Davies dies of a cancer of the jaw 1910 Sylvia dies of lung cancer The five boys are orphans Barrie is appointed guardian 1915 - George is killed during World War I, fighting with his regiment in Flanders 1921 - Michael, an undergraduate at Oxford, drowns while swimming with a friend. The two found bodies are found glued to each other. <br /> <br /> On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies, then a well-known publisher, threw himself under the London Underground. We should not pretend to read a tormented spirit, but we can note in passing that, had he lived more than a month, he would have reached the centennial of the birth of Barrie and so imagine a new wave of interests in "Peter Pan" ?? "this terrible masterpiece", in the words of Peter Llewellyn Davies.
