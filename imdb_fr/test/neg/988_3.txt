Being a history buff, I rented this movie because of its subject. The idea of ​​the Ellis Island experience at the beginning of the century centered on a small group is intriguing. Unfortunately, the film falls flat. Much of the story is just boring. there is not much going on for long periods. The director uses zany images (proposed in the form of sequences of dreamy reveries) to seemingly attempt to break the glacial rhythm, but on the contrary clashes with the authentic aspect of the film. The characters are also poorly drawn. In the end, we do not really care about them as much as we should. It's a shame that this is not what it could have been. I would still like to see a good movie about the experience of American immigrants, but this one is not.
