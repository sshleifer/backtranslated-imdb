This is happening in the 1920s in Harlem. A black-owned nightclub faces gangsters and corrupt police officers. <br /> <br /> Terrible vanity project for Eddie Murphy. He tries to mix comedy and drama and fails both. The comedy is just not funny and the drama is boring and badly done. You think a movie with three comedy legends - Eddie Murphy, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor - would be great, but it's not. There are swearings all the time and the OPEN scene has a young boy who kills a man to death (this is shown as OK). We also have the beautiful Della Reese degraded to play a ma'am. One of the highlights of "comedy" has a long, vain and terrible battle between her and Murphy. A boring, offensive and stupid mess. Not the worst Murphy movie but close enough. A 1 all the way.
