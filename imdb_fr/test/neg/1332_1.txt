Woa, speak frightful. Do not waste your time. I would have liked to have seen other usage comments first. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I did not look at everything. It was too horrible. The worst dialogue, the most sober ... I could go on and on. But what made him really unassailable was the direction. The poor actors. You can not even tell if they have talent, because not only do they have pathetic speeches, but the director has given them nothing. If you check out the director's filmography on this site, you'll see why this film did not have a chance. <br /> <br /> That would not even be good as a movie made for television. <br /> <br /> Ouch!
