I like Bam Margera a bit, so I was curious. <br /> <br /> But watching a home production with someone else with family and friends, with a decent camera and a type of sound, is simply not a good achievement. <br /> <br /> Writing, directing, playing and editing is at best catastrophic. But I sat for half. And why? <br /> <br /> This film gives perfect examples of what not to do, it's a film student's dream of what to avoid at every step of the process. Cram it into cinema school curiculums everywhere in the joint! <br /> <br /> So thank you Bam! Now, I know that Jackass is for real - because you are not looking to win an Oscar, dude :)
