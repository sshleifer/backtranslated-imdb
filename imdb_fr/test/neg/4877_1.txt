Where do I start? Let's start by listing the positives of this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Mikael Persbrandt is great as a Thomas Gangster. This is the only character who will really interest you, and he's a bad guy! (Allthogh never does anything wrong, and is usually a pretty nice guy) 2. Kjell Bergkvist is always great. He is a little moderate here, but he is still quite funny 3. The film looked good under Swedish standards, good use of depth of field and lights. <br /> <br /> Now the bad. This is by far the worst scenario for doing it on the big screen. The acting game by everyone was very bad and excessive. The management was horrible. A totally meaningless story, characters and events totally unrealistic and lasting one and a half hours. During the emotional scenes, everyone at the theater laughed. People just started going out during the screening. <br /> <br /> There is no way to summarize the story into something coherent, so I will not even try. Every clich√© ever conceived is there, and in all the bad places. I'm sorry to say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Look at him for a good laugh, but try not to pay for it;) <br /> <br /> .R
