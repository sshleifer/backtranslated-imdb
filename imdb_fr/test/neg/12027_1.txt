I bought this film without being seen at a science fiction convention and I had what I deserved to do something so stupid. In simple terms, this movie is incredible, boring and unassailable. <br /> <br /> I was so bored and disgusted with the lack of development of the plot that I turned it off to watch a rehearsal of Mythbusters. I understand it was a very low budget move, or at least it looked like a very low budget move, but that does not excuse the horrible acting, the dreadful intrigue and the camera work even worse. It sounds like something a group of students did between classes and get drunk. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the villain was not so laughable and the plot was something that could actually happen in real life with regard to the right the app can become so serious that it's funny. This movie is not funny, it's just bad.
