I entered a bookstore in Brentwood, Tennessee. I will not say the name because I am a dedicated customer. I am satisfied with every item I bought here before this one. The Bell Witch Haunting was on display at the front of the store. (May I mention that this is the only store where I saw it on sale?) I had heard about the story somewhere and I remembered that it was supposed to have happened. I was very excited and could not wait to watch it. I had high expectations for that. I could not believe what I saw when I watched it. It did not look like a real movie. It looked like a home video. I felt like it was supposed to be a horror movie. I mean, the movie was supposed to be a witch haunting you know. It's not a horror movie. You will not jump from your seat watching this movie. I gave the film all the chances of the world to improve as and when. I swear I did. It never improved. There were several scenes of this little child being thrown shit and pee. I did not find it entertaining at all. I watched the whole movie in disbelief that the store would sell me that. I guess that's how bad this economy has gone. I have this to say to the actors and the team. Do not show this film as a material for other jobs. Do not do it. I sincerely mean it. I congratulate you for trying. For people who bought this. I say that. Do not sell your copy to someone. They could be very angry. Have a very good day everyone.
