Friz Freleng's "Snafuperman" is one of the least private shorts. Noting the importance of studying your field manual, "Snafuperman" says it awkwardly enough. The story, in which Technical Fairy, First Class, makes Snafu a superhuman to help him understand the mistake of his behavior, is predictable and unpleasant. The first rumors of Snafu, Freleng, were full of ideas and laughter, but the director is stuffed with a rather boring subject and he has trouble making it an entertaining short film. Even after about three minutes, "Snafuperman" seems to hang around and, unlike the best cartoons in the series, it's like an instructional movie and then an entertainment. Although they were eliminated faster than Warner's usual cartoons, Snafu shorts have largely maintained a surprisingly high level. "Snafuperman" is a reflection of the quality you would more reasonably expect from a group of less talented minds.
