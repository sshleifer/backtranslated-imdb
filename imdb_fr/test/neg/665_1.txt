After watching this film, I have nothing but contempt for those who participated in making this awful movie. On the one hand, as a general comment, the screenplay was literally amazing and filled with incredible shots. The same is true of the dialogue which leads to the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. The game was also awesome with Kane showing, throughout the movie, at most 3 separate and distinct emotions. Even the use of modern special effects has failed, each accessory being easily recognizable from its equivalent. Overall, I would not recommend anyone to even consider displaying this feature because it would definitely waste 83 minutes (or even 90!) Of your life.
