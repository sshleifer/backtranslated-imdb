As a fan of bad movies, I was delighted to find today a pack of 3 horror movies cr @ ppy at Best Buy. The set was cheap and included a terrible movie called "The Dark" that I remember actually having seen at the theater. <br /> <br /> The other 2 movies were just as bad. "The creatures of the abyss" is probably the worst. Since they were all bad, it does not say much. But his stupidity, his mediocre action game, his terrible effects and his delayed scenario made it a very entertaining movie to watch. I rolled on the ground with each new development of the plot. The discovery of the abandoned ship, the missing crew, the realization that there was something terribly wrong !!! It was great!!! Of course, everybody's favorite scene seems to be the sex scene. OMG !! I almost lost it !!! Between that and the "monster camera", I must say that I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of bad movies, so I enjoyed it, but in all fairness, I had to movie to 1. THAT WAS DEFECTIVE ... But if garbage is your bag , praise at least this one ... (YES bad pun was intentional)
