Ok, of course, this movie will never win an Oscar. Citizen cane, this film is not ... BUT why does every film have to be controlled? When was the last time you saw a movie that was funny, not because it was good, but because it was bad? Nobody remembers Roger Corman, king of exploitation? <br /> <br /> Well, I had fun. I liked the cheese. Go ahead, do not expect to think and get ready to throw popcorn on the screen.
