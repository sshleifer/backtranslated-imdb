This is a perfect example of why many people say that the '90s are dead in horror movies. A terrifying voodoo terror story on campus featuring Corey Feldman, once so promising (STAND BY ME, THE LOST BOYS, etc.). There may be just enough things to keep you from falling asleep and it does not seem too cheap, but it's still a horror for an audience that has reached adolescence in I may have been part of this audience, but I still can not watch it when I look at it now. And nowadays, teens are already used to a lot more and better, and I can not imagine any of them knowing or caring who Corey Feldman was. Or "is", in fact, as the guy is still making movies. But the only thing that still connects him to his glory days, is the continuation of LOST BOYS 2: THE TRIBE that was made recently. And I imagine that even that will not encourage anyone to look for VOODOO. Just another film that got lost in the horror of the 90s for obvious reasons.
