First of all, I liked the book, more than the most popular Da Vinci Code. Although the DVC movie was not well received, I liked the DVD and bought it. However, there is no chance that I want to look at Angles and Demons again. <br /> <br /> The film hardly looks like the book. In fact, only the general premise of history is present. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, I was disappointed. In the book, Robert Langdon receives a call and a fax from Maximilian Kohler, Director of CERN. Who finds the body of the father (does not remember the name) and then asks Langdon to come, using the super fast plane ... In the book, the only people aware of this technology created by the father team and girl were themselves and the camerlingo ... However, in the movie, a huge team was involved ... so the tension never existed ... how did they discover it, etc.? <br /> <br /> Let or rather change that A whole part of the story was a huge mistake and it was to me what made it a mediocre film ... everything has changed since that day. shot the video of his wheelchair, the commander rushed to take the camerlingo but was filmed by Olivetti. In the film, it was the commander in the room and Olivetti was shot down ... (uh, I think I understood, but I was bored and I do not really remember the events of the film) .. There was no love interest between n Vittoria and Robert and in the book she was not at CERN when she arrived and she was actually flown from his research work. In the book, the four preferratti were killed, but in the film, the last of the four survived the fountain. In the book, Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to rescue her and they killed the murderer at the Illuminati Church, not as if he had been filmed by the Camerlingo. The piece where Robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there, saved by his alarm clock Mickey Mouse Watch. Okay, in the book, we are led to believe that Langdon came out of the helicopter, enough to say that it was a bit too tense, but it was important in the film because he had to fight back with the film ... Over there Vittoria and her adoptive father were not mentioned, but it was also important to know the character of Vittoria. <br /> <br /> In one of the worst movies I saw, I would have left early, but my brain became numb and I lost the use of my legs temporarily. A really poor attempt and not one of the best Ron Howards, in fact, the way he will find work exceeds me !!! I want my money back!!!
