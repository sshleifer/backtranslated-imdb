The Palestinian situation is a fertile ground and still largely fallow for the realization of films. "Divine Intervention" strives to give us insightful insights into the almost surrealistic lives of those caught in trouble, but the film comes down to a handful of (albeit charming) visual jokes thrown at celluloid, while The links between them become more and more obscure as the film moves forward. A missed opportunity to say something more coherent on a hot topic.
