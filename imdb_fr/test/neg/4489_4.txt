Having read this story a while ago, I was very excited to see the movie. I reread the book. This is one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks. I think what makes history is relationships. This was the hardest part for me in the film because I think the relationships were poorly expressed in the film. I have no idea of ​​the interest of changing the roles of the main characters (characters Tim and Alan). The film did not capture the relationship of John and Savannah at all. Maybe if you did not read the book, you might like this movie, but I found it so boring compared to the book. I thought Channing was a great choice for John, but I felt he would get all the young adults to watch him, so I think it was more for them. The end of the reading cuts the whole story of the book, so I was not happy with that. I was hoping the movie looked more like a notebook or walk to remember and how they captured the books. I really feel that I lost a Friday night and 10 dollars on a sullen love affair, not at all the story I was expecting to see.
