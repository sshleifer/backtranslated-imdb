Okay, so all Australian films are not good. Yes, there may have been very few who have a lot of merit. Take Away is however an absolute bomb, qualifying one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I wanted to like that. I thought I'd give it a shot. I even met one of the screenwriters, Dave O'neil, so I feel a bit like a traitor who gives a bad review to this movie, but ... The plot is pretty skinny (I will not get myself worth telling it ... read the synopsis), that I can forgive: many films can cover this subject with some good jokes. Unfortunately, the jokes of Take Away cover her plot like a $ 2 prostitute skirt. The only other laughs that came from the other 6 people in the cinema were probably the poor actors and the dialogue. Take Away is like a week simulator ... You might understand this joke if you see the movie, but the joke is not worth it.
