Wow, Jeez, I do not even know where to start to comment on this thing they called a movie. I really do not know what David Bradley started smoking after the realization of Hard Justice, which, in my opinion, was a very good movie after the American movie Ninja. I had not seen any of the latest movies of this type after Cyborg Cop. Fortunately, I saw them on Amazon for about 5 pounds each and I can safely say the following: if I had thrown into the water the 5 books I had spent for Total Reality, Crisis and Expect to die, I would have been happier than having to sit down for the last 90 minutes each of them lasted. My God, how can the HECK be called "movies" by someone? And why do the action / martial arts actors collapse to the finest horse poop when they reach their peak? I mean, David Bradley is not an Oscar, but his first films have been quite entertaining. Hard, cool dude with a very good martial expertise who delivered nerdy lines, but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to a certain extent. But I would seriously like to know what went through the head of this guy after making Hard Justice. His last 3 films must be the worst I've ever known. As I already mentioned, I would like to get my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought. The crisis was the embodiment of drowsiness, Total Reality was hard, but this Expect to Die is nonsense. I bet the director was either mega-stoned when he did that, or he just pee all fans of David Bradley who would sit in this shit. The plot revolves around a doctor (Bradley) who develops a type of virtual reality game in which he kills different people, one by one. Sorry, but I just could not take this guy seriously by playing the villain with his hair, his glasses and his gray pants and doing absolutely NO physical fight (frankly, his best asset). The film is even worse than all B movies on Saturday afternoon, because the acting is laughable, the staging is horrible and the few fights in the film, well, what can I say ... actors seem to be training with their gym buddy. We have a muscular and mute cop who starts to show his fighting stuff like an hour in the movie and fails heavily ... a French hairy version of Van Damme who simply can not fight, act or speak for his life terrifying and Bradley, the supposed protagonist, playing the devilish doctor for which I was really happy when he stopped doing this type of expendable waste. I do not even think he kicked this movie, probably because of his heart problem that was already bothering him. For a Series B actor, I must admit that I really liked this guy, his style, his physique, his fighting skills ... But I'm really happy that he stopped acting after this monstrosity because that honestly, I could not have sat down. through another ninety minutes of pee-like material like this. Avoid at all costs, even if you are David Bradley's family, you will not regret it, word.
