The portrait of ex-Kaishakunin Ogami Itto, a fugitive from Wakayama Tomisaburo, seemed quite natural. His behavior, his voice, his appearance, all that was talking about dislodgement. When he entered a space, the characters on the screen could feel that he did not belong in his place and that his determination to be expressed trouble. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that Mr. Wakayama had actually taken a kendo training (Japanese fencing), which would explain his comfort with the katana, which was beautifully revealed at each cutfest. If you watch the movies, from the moment he pulls when he locks the sword, you feel like you're witnessing something inimitably ugly. He would even turn the katana quickly to extract the blood before covering it and it would happen in an instant without effort. <br /> <br /> The return of Nakamura Kinnosuke appears as a restitution. It's like he's trying too hard to be someone else or telling someone else's story. As a result, every time I tried to engage, I lost my grip because he did not seem to master the role himself. As if it was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The sword in the television series was also entirely Hollywood. Shots to hide Mr. Nakamura's clumsiness with katana, slow action, motionless targets, etc. Extremely bad, from the spectator's point of view. There was a moment in the episode The Castle Wall Attack when Mr. Nakamura pulled his sword like a child. It was embarrassing. He treated it like it was heavy! I almost fell off my chair. <br /> <br /> And let's be honest: the story is about an excellent swordsman. Period. The sword is a problem. <br /> <br /> Realism is not, however: the game of the sword in the movies was excellent and looked like a manga, as expected, I'm sure. (The baby carriage was equipped with a group of automatic quick-fire muskets operated by a 3-year-old? Yes ... in the manner of a manga.) Captivating films. (Read Musashi from Yoshikawa Eiji [% historical legend]%!) I could not really miss the episodes of the TV series. They just felt cheap. See the movies first and you'll know what I'm talking about.
