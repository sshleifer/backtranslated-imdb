A plane carrying employees of a large biotechnology company - including the CEO's daughter - is traveling to a dense forest in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is canceled, the CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), forms a small, motley group to carry out his own search and rescue mission. But what does Knowles look for and seek to save, and what follows and watches them in the woods? <br /> <br /> Oy, what a mess this movie has been! It was a shame, because, on the one hand, it is Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite actors of the modern genre, and, secondly, it could easily have been a decent movie. He suffers from two major flaws, and these are probably both the fault of the writer / director Jonas Quastel - this film (which I will call his nickname Sasquatch) has about the worst editing I have ever seen with Alone in The Dark (2005), and Quastel's constant advice to actors seems to be: "OK, let's try again, but this time I want everyone to talk about each other. others, improvise non-sequencers and try as annoying as possible. " <br /> <br /> The potential was there. Despite aspects related to scams (any element related to the plane crash was obviously trying to create the project Blair Witch (1999) and any element relating to the titular monster yielding to Predator (1987)), an exhibition similar to Ed Wood and a ridiculous dialogue. , the plot offered more subtle and much less saccharine possibilities and sub-texts The monster costume, once we saw it, was more than enough for my tastes. The mix of character types that crisscrossed the woods could have been great if Quastel and his fellow writer, Chris Lanning, had declined the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships. The "hideout" of the monster had a pretty production design, especially the corpse decorations as a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). If editing was good, some scenes with a decent dialogue could easily have been effective. <br /> <br /> But the most scary thing about Sasquatch is the number of mistakes made: Quastel thinks it's a good idea to cut out the dialogue scenes that are taking place a few minutes apart in real time so that we see rather a few lines of the scene A, then some lines of the scene B, then again in A, in B, etc. . <br /> <br /> For some reason, he thinks it's a good idea to frequently use black screens between dialogue snippets, that we need the idea of ​​an indefinite amount of time between irrelevant comments or irrelevant messages. comments seem to happen one after another from time to time anyway. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he does not care if scenes are shot in the morning, afternoon, in the middle of the night, etc. to them at random. Moreover, the scenes we showed seem to have been selected at random. Important events never or hardly appear, and we are faced with too many useless scenes. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he left a scene on rock art in the film when he needs to be exposed more to justify it to get there, or you just have to cut it out because it is not so important (the intelligence and "humanity" of the monster could easily have been shown in another way). <br /> <br /> For some reason, there is a whole character - Mary Mancini - left in the scenario even if it is superfluous. <br /> <br /> For some reason, we suddenly move to an extremely sweet porn scene, even if the pattern never repeats itself. <For some reason, the characters continue to call Harlan Knowles "Mr. H" as if they were stereotypes of Asian domestics. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Quastel insists on using "Blur Cam" and "Distorto-Cam" for monster attack scenes, even if the costume does not look bad and it would have been much more effective to put fog, a subtle filter or something other than bad cinematography. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie better than me? I am a fan of Henriksen, the subject intrigues me, I loved the setting, I like the hike and it is actually a movie about the hikes of a level, but I could not just not. Whenever I thought it was going to "get better from this point to the end," Quastel made another horrible gesture. In the end, my score was 3 out of 10.
