Let's be realistic here. This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. My wife and children showed real promise in their first season and did not come down until later. It's so bad that words do not describe. The acting and writing are so terrible on a consistent basis that I wonder if Damon Wayans was producing such a show on purpose. From top to bottom, each performance is ridiculous. Damon Wayans the phone completely and George Gore II is so horrible that I cringe at every over-activated line. Can anyone really watch this show and find it entertaining, let alone fun? Please, I beg you. Do not watch this show. As soon as television affiliates stop doing syndication, we can finally get rid of this absolute filth.
