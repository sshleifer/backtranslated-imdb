At first, I turned to Paranormal State because I find (more or less) that the kind of paranormal research is an interesting television, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> I really like Ghost Hunters because more than half of their investigations result in total undressing, and find Hilarious Most Haunted with his use of mediums and British women frumpy with the eyes of a Paris Hilton day fainting with fear / demonic presences, all shot in a beautiful nocturnal green. <br /> <br /> Paranormal state has none of this call. It's as if she had been tinkered by "tracks" that Ghost Hunters rejected. Episodes ranged from family trash to single mothers with emo teens sitting and scared to an "interview" with a 5-year-old kid on the monster that lives in his room (the monster goes to RAWRRR, we said). All these people use a university club to solve their problems. The whole series talks about Ryan and his partner, his huge ego. He leads his troop of doe-eyed students, except when a case is deemed "too extreme" and orders them to stay at the HAHAHA hotel. Better to leave that to the pros, that is to say to himself. <br /> <br /> The involuntary comedy of this show highlights the credulity of the participants. Ryan tells his stories of tracking, followed, etc. by a demon he met for the first time when the Catholic Church recruited him to help him in a case. Sorry, but the Catholic Church has people who can do it. They do not need the day team leader at Quiznos to pay his 2 cents. <br /> <br /> This show is awful, a shame for A & E for its finance This foolishness, trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better shows on the subject of the paranormal. It's almost involuntarily funny, except that Ryan is so arrogant and charismatic that watching the show long enough to make fun of it is not worth it.
