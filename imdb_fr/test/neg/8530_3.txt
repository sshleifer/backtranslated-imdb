Special previews are always a good time. No matter what movie you see, the theater will always be filled with people waiting for it, like free movies, who thought it would be something to do or just lost. Be that as it may, whether the film is good or bad, the public alone will make it enjoyable. Now, when the movie is a pseudo-horror movie PG-13 (can you really get into the horror when the MPAA is on your back by censoring everything?), You know there will be gossip, laugh and breathe. With The Messengers, the crowd did not disappoint to give many bursts of voice and warnings to the characters on the screen. Regarding the film itself, I'm sorry for the people involved, because it could have been much better if it had been punctuated properly and allowed to stretch your legs beyond the progress of the scaring / the black / the show of these films. In the end, we are presented with a boring and painful story, without surprises and with some moments of real suspense. <br /> <br /> The story is common. A family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try to rebuild relationships with each other. Once installed, the spirits of the house address the reformed troublemaker child whose past makes it even easier for parents to not believe everything they are told. Of course, the child does not cry the wolf and those around him only discover it when it is too late. I would like to thank the Pang Brothers (the makers of the famous movie The Eye) that I would like to look beyond before to see what they can do without Hollywood interference - so-called covers of The Messengers have been made by someone another, but the brothers have kept the credit That's a pity what our studio system does to foreigners, especially when it comes to creative independence that made the films that introduce them and not of a background interference), to really have a proper style and to keep a somewhat cool tired line of intrigue. Unfortunately, I must also pay tribute to them for this almost unbearable slowness. Similar to the reason why I do not like what's behind, I could not stand the stretched suspense, which goes so far as to make it laughable. When our heroine and her brother stand in a corridor with a ghost behind them, the scene lasts about eight minutes, with static and strangely composed close-ups and changes in depth of field that culminate in a climax. In 84 minutes, I almost think it would have worked even better. <br /> <br /> In addition to a very effective opening sequence, featuring the fantastic Jodelle Ferland, (strangely playing a boy), and a great atmospheric sequence credit, the only thing that saves the movie from the trash is actors Game. With the exception of Penelope Ann Miller, who first made me wonder what had happened to her, then, after a few scenes, made me understand why I had never asked this question in the years she was absent, and Dustin Milligan, who was completely lacking in credibility, playing is very strong. Dyan McDermott does a good job as a father, trying to keep his family together during difficult times. He has many small moments of light comedy to thwart his serious and dramatic role. William B. Davis (the favorite Cancerman of all) is used effectively as an almost disturbing character, unfortunately not used more. Our real stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett. Stewart plays this emotion very well and shows promise as an actress with Panic Room in her resume. As for Corbett, if he did not stop his role, the whole movie would have completely collapsed. I wish he received more work because I appreciate it since the underrated series "The Visitor". I still have to take a look at his first role in "Northern Exposure", a series I have not seen yet. able to catch up. It's a pity he will probably be more recognizable for the overrated My big and big Greek wedding. <br /> <br /> The messengers introduced me so well to the work of the Pang brothers and re-energized my desire to consult their Chinese horror catalog. The atmosphere and the performances were there; it was just a simple, vacant story that required far too much padding to make a feature film. If they plunged more into other characters, rather than those of Stewart, it could have been more effective, while having something more to show then scenes of ten minutes without anything. If our protagonist is the only one to be attacked, there is no doubt about how far the creatures will hurt her. The moments of danger had no gravity for them and until the end, all that remained was filling material. However, I am excited about the free comic book distributed after the special screening, as we hope that the support will allow a more rhythmic and captivating story before attempting to surprise.
