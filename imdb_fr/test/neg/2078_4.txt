Before you start to know if this movie is worth your time or not, I must inform you that I have never seen another adaptation of Carmen. Therefore, if you are looking for a critique of its ranking among others, it may not be very useful. to you. <br /> <br /> The only time I came across Carmen was in the car when she was traveling across Spain on a family vacation when I was a teenager. I did not pay much attention because I did not like opera at the time and I did not know better. The story has been around for about 150 years. Do I feel that I missed after seeing this movie? Yes, mainly because of the plot, but also because if all the actresses who played Carmen looked like Paz Vega, all the adaptations would happily be placed in my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Directed by Vicente Aranda (who also co-rewrote the story with Joaquim Jordà), the story is told through the eyes of the original author Prosper Mérimée, a French writer crossing Spain in the nineteenth century. He comes across José (Leonardo Sbaraglia), a delinquent soldier and one of the many men who fall in love with Carmen (Paz Vega), a sensual, sexy and dazzling gypsy, who has the mouth of the devil, the mood of a toro ', which leads men to their loss recklessly. When she meets José, she is attracted by her neutral behavior. But she grabs him, sends him away and lets him go several times. Until the day José is wanted for murder. Carmen persuades him to join his band of gypsy smugglers. They seem to settle down, she has fallen in love with him, but she meets the charming Escamillo, the bullfighter. Can José control his jealousy or destroy it? <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful, seductive story, almost like a Shakespearian or ovid plot, with a portrait of a huge passion and emotion that can transform or break us and transform us into do things without a character. It's poetic, fiery and especially slutty. I was suspended, I did not know which way to turn. I always hoped that José would change Carmen's dirty little ways. I will not tell you if he's successful or not. <br /> <br /> The synopsis above is what I learned from the film, but I was not impressed by the film itself. It was not until I looked at it that I deepened the story a bit and understood how much Aranda had missed a missed opportunity to retake Merimee's classic. It was a dramatic, shallow and bitchy time blunder that saw Paz Vega spend much of his time partially or totally naked (though I'm not complaining about that!). <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting was poor. Sbaraglia as José did not impress me. I still do not know if he was a weak actor or if José was supposed to be a weak character, I did not read the book. He is supposed to be a man who has a burning desire for Carmen, but he spends most of the time looking confused, jealous and a little weak. Paz Vega was slightly better than Carmen. I was convinced by her hard and nasty character, although I have already witnessed more convincing performances of her in other films, such as Zapping and Lucia y El Sexo. She looks too pretty to play a Gypsy woman (although I did not meet many Andalusian Gypsy women), so in a sense, the role did not really suit her. The other actors in the movie were not great either. They seemed to do everything without conviction. The story is passionate, emotional ?? they seemed half-dressed, as if they were impatient to take out the tight costumes of the nineteenth century they wore. <br /> <br /> However, the costumes impressed me - one of the redeeming factors of the film. I love Spanish culture, soldiers' uniforms, top hats and women's flamenco dresses. They have adapted the weather well. That's all I can really say about it. Sorry, let's go back to the criticism. <br /> <br /> The script, as stated above, was co-rewritten by Vicente Aranda and Joaquim Jordà, and it was so badly done that he would have allowed Merimee to turn in his grave. It was boring. José's intense passion for Carmen has not been exploited at best. There were rowdy lines stacked on one and the other, with connotations of Satan and the devil everywhere, among the millions of words sworn. I know that the Spaniards are in favor of offensive words, but the film was littered with puta, literally every whore. Maybe it was realistic in Seville, in the nineteenth century, poverty-stricken, but history itself did not need it. <br /> <br /> The editing and the work of the camera were sad and ordinary. In fact, I liked only a little bit, it was when the camera followed a fly in the air, which landed on the face of Carmen. It was good. But the rest? Boring. <br /> <br /> To conclude, it is sad to see such a beautiful story get lost playing and performing unconvincing roles. If you are a professor of literature, let your class carefully observe this adaptation to get an idea of ​​the story. However, only the male half of the class will pay any interest to the film, thanks to Paz Vega. Otherwise, stick to the opera version (although I hate musicals). I give this movie 4, just for the fact that I like the story! And Paz Vega!
