The group decides that there is no better way to show their sorrow than to participate in a virtual bloodbath. But the more they play, the more they realize the connection between play and the death of poor old Loomis. <br /> <br /> Production: This film is just another entry into the latest budget Hollywood hype The horror of the PG-13 series was intended to catch the attention of the high school crowd.
