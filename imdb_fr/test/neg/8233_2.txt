This film is a classic in my part of the country because it was shot in my own small town. I now have many friends who are custodians at Dixon Correctional and I myself worked for 3 years at the SuperAmerica store, next to the Krogers store where the old lady was. However, it is still the most stupid movie of all time, intended to be presented by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer, if it has not already been. A little triviality, Illinois does not even have a parole hearing, and Dixon Prison is a medium security institution that houses burglars and vandals of vending machines. The classic clucking / seduction scene is perhaps the most fun writing I've ever seen, especially with the buildup of suspense
