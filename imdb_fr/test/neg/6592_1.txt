You might think that the plot of this movie was written during the shoot. It begins as a "punks vs. vigilante" movie, but in the middle of the film, the plot changes abruptly when the vigilante turns out to be an honest man with his honest daughter and honest gym and has to fight the corrupt "businessmen" who want to close the gym at any cost to build a shopping center or something. Then the plot changes again and we forget the corrupt types. The villain is now the friend of the leading man, who thinks he is a Ninja. The guy becomes "crazy crazy" and wants to win a martial arts contest at all costs. Seeing this movie is like having a nightmare with television.
