(Warning: there are still spoilers.) <br /> <br /> What an unbelievably bad movie. Iron Eagle 2 looks good. <br /> <br /> The story is this: Captain Holiday (Rutger Hauer) gets shot by his friend Banning (Robert Patrick) to prevent him from demolishing an Iraqi airliner filled with innocent civilians. Six years later, Holiday returns to take his revenge. Among other things, sitting in a tank, he continues Banning (now colonel) and his pregnant wife on a field. He manages to fire shells and to drive the tank at the same time. After detonating the tank with a bazooka, he survives miraculously and steals a fighter. With him, he slaughters a number of Allied fighters before attacking NATO headquarters in order to kill Banning's wife. <br /> <br /> An added bonus is that Major Baxter (whom Holiday occupies in his office) has placed the insignificant rank on his right shoulder at the back. Elegant.
