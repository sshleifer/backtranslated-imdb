This film must be one of the most boring movies ever made. The only thing I liked was using Argento-Esquire lighting in most scenes. The music is awful and the pace is so slow that you can watch it at twice the speed and even then it would be slow. The story does not exist. There are not even shocking scenes. <br /> <br /> It is classified (at least on this site) as a horror, but it is not the case. It's a kind of art film exploring the dark side of human nature. If you like these things and can handle the slow pace, look at it, but I would rather recommend something Japanese (for example, Ichi the Killer). public committing suicide collectively because of the enormous boredom generated by this film. These 80 minutes of its length would have been better spent watching the paint dry. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1/10 just because there is no 0 in the drop-down menu
