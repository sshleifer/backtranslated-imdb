Gordon goes above the fashion of the full moon, but that's to be expected. Combs is surprisingly discreet and keeps its performance at a more realistic level than the one we are used to. We also lost the usual dark humor of Stuart Gordon. The film is effective enough to show the collapse of Combs and his last heroic act to save his wife and daughter. You really feel sympathy for his character, despite his flaws. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was more surprised by the nudity and borderline porn sex scene than by graphic violence & gore. <Br /> <br /> Not a Gordon classic, but certainly something you could enjoy if you've seen his most famous movies.
