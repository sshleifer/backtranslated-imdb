Nothing more than a soccer game against The Mighty Ducks, this movie has been boring in many ways. This is one of those situations where your parents ask you to take your younger siblings so they do not have to take care of them for a few hours. At the very least, my younger sisters liked it, but it turned out to be too much like the much better Mighty Ducks. Oh, at least Olivia d'Abo was hot and Steve Guttenberg still had a job at that time.
