Carrot Top's "Chairman of the Board" and his AT & T commercials are living proof that faeces stolen by flies are available in orange. Not available for FREE, however, HBO charging for this garbage. Blehhh! The advantage of COTB is that it certainly fills suicide hotlines across the country, perhaps providing a job for thousands of telephone therapists who have lost their jobs after being discredited, though (unfortunately) Carrot Top probably contributed to the bottom of his godfather, AT & T line with the increased telephone traffic of devastated HBO viewers. I can visualize the hordes of traumatized viewers, the phone in one hand and the other .45 in full charge, evoking last minute desperation before leaving the scene of life to escape the specter of the orange haired monster of the COTB. in their synapses as the anxiety of an irreversible and irreversible meningeal swelling.
