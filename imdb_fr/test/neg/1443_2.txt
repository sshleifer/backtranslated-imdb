Unbelievable. An excellent cast, an honest acting game, an interesting plot. <br /> <br /> But this film has such graphic cruelty that is neither tense nor source of thrills, just to disturb a united. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Everyone could see coming freak returns to his habits. And that Robert Englund acted (was he?) Like an idiot; forbid your daughter to sleep with a football player, but try to kill an idiot and love kiddypr0n, how are you ?! <br /> <br /> The policeman whose daughter was kidnapped - did anyone have the impression that he was a cop and not an actor? Not me. This film hangs around again and again with an end we see in other horror movies: if the returns were good, part 2 could be made. Bad, really bad thing. Maybe give inspiration to goose bumps ...
