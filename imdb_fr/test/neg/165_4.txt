After seeing this, I concluded that it was most likely a girls' movie; Subsequently, I discovered that Keira's mother had written the script to confirm it. However, a movie of chicks can have a certain attraction for men; this one does not seem and does not really seem to please women as well (looking at the lamentable box office recipes). One of the elements on which both sexes agree is the stupidity of the scene in the film, in which an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth and the pain of the amputated limb without anesthesia. Although men do not experience the pain of childbirth, we understand that this is a painful process; yet it is a natural pain whereas an amputation certainly is not! Women understand it even better. I guess a woman was trying to make a bad feminist statement. In fact, many things in this film are in very bad taste. Although current movies are known for their bad taste, this one really "excels" in this department. It could have been a good movie showing the struggles of Dylan Thomas during the Second World War; and how strong was the feeling for the men who had then managed to avoid serving in the army. Keira's mother who writes on the screen tries to show how this feeling was used against Dylan, but she is really confusing it. Instead, we see how two young mothers connect; kind of. In a sense. Perhaps. Somehow. It should be noted that a soldier (the husband of Dylan's wife's friend) is sent home after serving in combat; but we do not know if the war is over! Many things about this movie are also unclear. and although I have said that, I will do it again because that seems to be the central motive of this mess.
