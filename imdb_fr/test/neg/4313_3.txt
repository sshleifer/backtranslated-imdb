I have read the comments of other users and I am happy that someone compared it to Kamal's original entitled Perumarzhakalam published in 2004. <br /> <br /> The original had a tight history and no Fault, as described above, about the Indian government does not have the proper records, or even the wrong catches and nipples. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and delicate and well described by others. But unfortunately, the fact that Nagesh is credited, because his own story is a sad thing and is nothing but plagiarism. <br /> <br /> I guess he was affected by the so-called "inspired" Bollywood Syndrome. <br /> <br /> He must at least recognize the merit. <br /> <br /> I liked some of his older films, but I now suspect if some of them were originals after all. <br /> <br /> Here is a link in IMDb for the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment I recommend to everyone to see the original, even with subtitles if necessary, to know what is the direction of class and the game of class.
