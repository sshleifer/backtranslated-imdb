I found myself watching The men of Sex Lives Of The Potato, frowning, wondering why so many talented and spiritual comedians have decided to engage in a totally humorous film. <br /> <br /> Rocky and funny jokes are funny when you're eleven years old. Over 18 and you start losing friends around the water fountain. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie will give you some fun if you're the type of person who frequently plays matchstick jokes, or maybe participate in "man" competitions at night by soaking up the vomit / urine, etc. of your companions when you are not back in the basement of your parents hitting your teenage wife. <br /> <br /> Even then "Sex Lives ..." is hard to recommend. Maybe if you're really weird in masochistic cranial surgery and you spend your evening slapping the elderly or watching the toilet faint, you might think a close-up of a bogie is worthy of a film distribution. <br /> <br /> I 'd discuss characterization, storytelling or performance if I had not completely zoned following the long tuna-paste / vagina comparison.
