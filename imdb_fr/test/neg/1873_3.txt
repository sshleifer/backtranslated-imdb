It's not a good movie by the standards. It's very poorly written and the acting is just a bit above normal (some performances are way below normal, but Swayze and Gray do a pretty good job with little work). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The dance sequences were very well choreographed and, as noted above, Swayze and Gray were highlights. <br /> <br /> What was bad: <br /> <br /> The scenario. The "bad guys" were just too bad to be credible. The best villains are those who are not so obviously perverse. These guys (the nephew of the owner, the waiter who permeates the girl) do and say NOTHING that would let me believe they could be real people (maybe there are guys like them, but I certainly do not want to see a movie about it). <br /> <br /> Another scene, the first where Gray and Swayze meet when the resort's staff "dance". Swayze and Gray dance together and seem to be having fun. The next time they meet, Swayze will be hostile to her. Why? What happened between the two to make him hate like that when they danced together? <br /> <br /> And a few of those lines, I mean COME ON (I collapsed in the end when Swayze whispered the replica the corner.) How he NEVER did that with a straight face. ) <br /> <br /> Another thing that is wrong, the setting of the 1960s. Everyone looked and was dressed like in the 1980s! Who was responsible for costumes and hairstyles? <br /> <br /> The music (original music of the film) was laughable (with the exception of "I had the time of my life" which was a good song). <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but the most overrated
