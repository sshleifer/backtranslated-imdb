This film is very modern and forward. It's about 75% in English. It is intended for the young multiplexed English-speaking public. The basic plot is similar to DDLJ. Playing is below average. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they give a wrong image and set a bad example for young people. Tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle or tequila about 5 or 6 times in the film. The director does not even recognize that she is an alcoholic and has a problem with alcohol. Throughout the film, she wears bikini tops whether at work, at the beach or at a wedding. This heroine of the film gives the impression to the young people that this behavior is acceptable. <br /> <br /> The less we say about Uday Chopra's failure as Shalrukh Khan in Shahrukh Khan's DDLJ game, the better. The film talks about gender equality. But equality should not consist in making the same mistakes, but rather in doing the right to do what is right. If men have been portrayed as chronic casanovas in films, this does not mean that women should also adopt the same behavior. <br /> <br /> Although the film is made in a fun way, it encourages so many false social conceptions in the name to be prominent, this "fun" part of the film has no impact. Not even in Canada, women dress like that, or the guys behave as they showed in the movie. It's certainly not a reflection of Indian society or even Canadian society. At first, they should perhaps have a warning saying: "All characters and events in the film are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film." The only good thing about this movie is the duration, 1 hour, thank goodness.
