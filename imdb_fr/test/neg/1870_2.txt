I do not know why IMDb lists all Ghoulies movies as theatrical releases. They were all directly related to the video films. Same thing with the Puppet Master series. Why has nobody noticed it yet? Of course, you stumbled upon Ghoulies IV, probably in an old abandoned video rental store dating back to 1993. You looked at the discount section and found this ... Look at the front and back covers. What are you waiting for, The Shawshank Redemption? It is not necessary to review this film so critically. This is the fourth movie of GHOULIES! I bought it on DVD for 6.50 € because ... it was 6.50 €. I knew it was not Kubrick material. And I was right. A non remastered DVD without extras, not even a trailer, claims an insignificant movie. <br /> <br /> It actually contains the star of the first Ghoulies movie, Peter Liapis ... which does not have much. "big" roles outside these two films. And I do not see why ... He is not too bad actor and is rather amusing. But I suppose if you play a leading role in Ghoulies' films, Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. He is also present, his idiot sidekick, Bobby Di Cocco, who, despite his very small resemblance to Al Pacino (very small), does not retain any of his acting abilities ... A complete idiot who is just clumsy to watch. Then there's Stacie Randall - obviously a porn star, I do not need to look for that. She looks pretty sexy, although her costume, her character, and everything she does tarnish the credibility of the film, which is not an easy task for such a movie. <br /> <br /> Then there are the Ghoulies themselves! Who also manage to let us down. Ghoulies III made them talk, but no. 1, but Ghoulies IV goes even further. Instead of being puppets, this time, the Ghoulies are actually children in costumes !!!! The filmmakers decided to make an extra effort to insult the audience. In addition, there are only two, and they are not the highlight of the film, because they do not appear often. However, sometimes they are slightly fun ... And they are not evil this time either. <br /> <br /> It's really a hilarious thing, it's amazing that I could enjoy it. I do not know why ... Part of the black humor is actually funny, although the script does not usually require effort. Imagine that Satan only threatens to "kill you, slowly ... painfully ...". <br /> <br /> But at least Full Moon had no implication this time around. Do they? Yes, a very bad and inexpensive film, with a production value of 0, but not too serious to be part of the ranks of Puppet Master 1/2, Lawnmower Man 2, Surviving Christmas or even Ghoulies III.
