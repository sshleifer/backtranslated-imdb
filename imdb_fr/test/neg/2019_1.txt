Being a big fan of horror movies, one of the most difficult things to take into account the lack of plenty of good movies of the genre, and having seen hundreds in my life, I must say that Dracula 3000 is by far the least inspired. , badly made trash that I had the misfortune to see. STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM! It's so bad that it's not even laughable. The special effects (did I say "special"?) Were probably obtained by spending a few dollars, the acting is terrible and the scenario should have ended up in the trash after the first reading by the studio who decided to take charge of this miserable project. The whole movie was literally filmed in a warehouse. In addition, for those who like nudity in their movies, do not be fooled by the rating of R. If you think you have the opportunity to see Erika Eleniak even half-naked, you're wrong. She is fully dressed throughout the film. And the cover is completely misleading! In no part of the film, no scene looks, even marginally, to the awesome cover art they've placed on the box to draw fans of unsuspecting horror. <br /> <br /> Too bad that the ranking is only 1 to 10. I would give this film a -10. Be warned. Do not waste your money or time on this one.
