Despite the star cast, this epic attempt fails. It comes as a set of stereotypes of flat cartoons linked together by a clever social commentary. <br /> <br /> It's as if, at each dialogue and introduction to a new character, the writer glanced at him and said, "Is not it smart? "Is not this a biting social comment?" And, unfortunately, the answer is always "Ummmm ... no." An absorbing and absorbing film that looks more like a TV drama (in the worst sense of the word) than a movie ... and an obvious attempt at immortality on television. Fortunately, he died young. Empire Falls falls flat.
