I just saw this movie at Fantasy Filmfest BERLIN. I am not impressed. <br /> <br /> Regarding history. Too many girlfriends return from their holidays in Mexico. While waiting for their luggage, they meet two boys who then take the last and of course bad bus to go to the city. On board is also another older man, so strangely depicted that you instantly guess he's one of the bad guys. The other is the driver. <br /> <br /> The shuttle takes them to an industrial wasteland, then succeeds, a little blood, cuts of extremes, violence, playing mainly with the fear of girls In the end, after high and lows, and there are some times, not very scary, everyone is dead except the driver and girls. the girls end up in a garage where one of them is murdered after confessing that she slept with the other girlfriend's boyfriend. The other girl, who is the conclusion, is sold by the kidnapper who remains (yes, weirdo was killed) in a cargo chest in Asia (a freight port being the final photo.) First. Story. Tons of loopholes, questions you ask yourself, questions that are not equal and a conclusion that is not a good revelation, but a total disappointment. I do not see how a loser so unprofessional is supposed to have taken dozens of women (as indicated by a drawer filled with driver's license ... aha) Secondly. Acting. Poor at its best. <br /> <br /> Third. Scare Factor. OKAY. but I am missed by torture as a means of doing only himself. Trading with humans can be a good reason for a horror movie, but it is not used as such, but as a background. <br /> <br /> Fourth music and sound. Some nice attempts, but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape, the warehouse garage and the sounds of trucks have not really been explored. The music? It would have been worse without that, but other than that. Some pseudo-moving synth string themes for emotivity when girls reach their final destination. OK, I guess. <br /> <br /> Verdict: AVOID IT!
