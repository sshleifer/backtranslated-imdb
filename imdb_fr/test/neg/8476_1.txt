"The mask's son" is a terrible excuse for a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I would have liked that we saw rather "Because of Winn-Dixie". I must say that it's partly my fault, because I agreed to go see him with him. As a fan of the first movie "Mask" (Jim Carrey was hilarious), I had hoped it was not as bad as all critics have said. <br /> <br /> I knew for ten minutes was headed for disaster. Disgusting and futile attempts at funny, crazy things have sparked laughter in seven and eight year olds, but the rest of us have been regarded with disbelief. <br /> <br /> Find the film as repulsive as possible It's amazing even for me, because I loved "Scary Movie" and "Anchorman", two movies that many people I know have found brutal and offensive. But the fact is that "The son of the mask" is not funny unless you are less than ten years old. <br /> <br /> The film contains a lot of CGI, but it can not save this waste. Anyone who allowed this film to go on the big screen probably thought it had potential, given the success of its original film. Unfortunately, he has none of the laughs, fun or excitement of the first film, making it a parody of the original movie. I recommend renting the original "mask" to anyone planning to see it. 1 star in 10 is generous towards this terrible mess.
