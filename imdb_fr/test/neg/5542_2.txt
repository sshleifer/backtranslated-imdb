The sequel to Screenwriter / Director Michael Hurst's Sci-Fi Channel to Stan Winston's classic revenge horror story has its moments and some decent gore, but ultimately falls short of the original. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty Of course, the filmmakers were not trying to do a comedy, but I caught myself laughing all the time. A family quarrel started on a car accident is the basis of this entry into the franchise. The Hatfield and McCoy families live in a remote town with dirt roads, drive vans, drink moonlight and jostle at every opportunity. Just when they thought it was safe to hate each other and live happily ever after, Jodie Hatfield (Amy Manson) and Ricky McCoy (Bradley Taylor) decided to fall in love with the situation. One night, the two lovebirds decide to have a good time in the woods while Ricky's sister is on the lookout, but it turns out that Hatfield accidentally killed Ricky's sister and caught him that same night. with Jodie. You know what happens next. Ricky finds his sister's body and decides to visit Haggis to get his revenge on the mighty Pumpkinhead. Ye Haw! In addition, Harley (Lance Henriksen) is back to warn potential damn souls against using Pumpkinhead to relieve their pain. This really wiped out the story because Harley would have called on Pumpkinhead for many years before this story happened, but the set and characters look like dirty pilgrims who have gone back in time to bring the van back to Plymouth. Then there's the sheriff (Rob Freeman) who has his own links to the demon and seems to belong to a revenge movie of the 70s instead of a horror movie designed for cable. <br /> <br /> the special effects were nice, but instead of staying true to the thinking of a man in costume, Hurst used terrible 3D shots for certain scenes. A particularly embarrassing picture shows Pumpkinhead jumping from tree branches like a mis-rendered 3D monkey. The cinematography was exceptional and raised the quality of the film. The acting was pretty good too, with the exception of some poorly executed accents. <br /> <br /> Family quarrels never end well, especially when the families involved in the quarrel have to deal with Pumpkinhead. I did not enjoy every minute of this movie, but it was way better than most Sci-Fi movies. Perhaps this is a sign that the channel is trying to match the quality of its films to that of its original series. I would not waste any room on a rental, but if you are lucky enough to see a replay on a tube, I would advise you to check. It's not such a deadly film, but it slightly exceeds the level of garbage that can be burned to DVD nowadays.
