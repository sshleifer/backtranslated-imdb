Firetrap is yet another bad action movie about a guy - yada yada yada - and a happy ending, a fire, and a burn, and overactivity, a bad suspense, and predictable, and -------- ----- ------ You do not see. <br /> <br /> (Dean Cain found himself stuck playing Superman on Lois and Clark and no longer has good roles, so I do not know if he does it, a good or a bad actor <br /> <br /> That's not good. <br /> <br /> Why can not anyone stop those bad guys who keep doing these things? AI swear they're right * * * on a treadmill and hope they are good.They have to do a guy whose job is just to burn the movies that look bad, just a bucket of carosine next to him and empty the housings every day lights and goes home.
