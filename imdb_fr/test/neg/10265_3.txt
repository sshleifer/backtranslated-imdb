(Spoilers more than likely ... nothing very important that you could not understand yourself) Yeah, it's really weird. I rented it to a blockbuster because he had absolutely NO description of the movie on the back of the box, but only a list of bands that had songs. But after that, I had the trouble to find it, even here on IMDB. I kept confusing it with "Night of the Demons", but, you know, it's basically the same thing. <br /> <br /> What I liked most about this movie is everything in the garage. This black gym guy was hilarious in the way he shouted ALL the time. Even when shouting was not really necessary, he had let out a "LISTENING NOW !! BLOCK THE DOOR WITH CARS !!!!" and so, they would run cars in other cars. But then he got bullets and got hit by a zombie with a broomstick, I think. The other part that caught my attention was the crash outside the building with boys they did not want to see coming ... What significant aspect of the film did it give us? what was that? Why was that? Why did the movie end with a guy who broke TV in the studio? I saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen, but he was a bit far away. I mean, he could have just turned off the TV. Yes, this film was shot on a whim and yes, I hated it. Have a good day...
