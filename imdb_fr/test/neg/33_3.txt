Sorry, but Jacqueline Hyde (included ??? - Jack L and Hyde - Jekyll & Hyde) is one of the worst actors in the hardcore scene, not to mention a scenario apparently written by a freshman with learning disabilities undiagnosed. <br /> <br /> Jackie Hyde inherits an old manor from a grandfather she never knew. Guess who? Yes, an inventor of the special formula slowly resuming his body and mind - yes, Mr. Hyde! <br /> <br /> Despite beautiful skin scenes, this movie shows no feelings or emotions other than uncontrollable laughter. <br /> <br /> As much as poor Jackie tries, she can not stay away from granddaddy's special formula and the result is an hour and a half of lost time.
