Honestly, how difficult can it be to make a good remake? Obviously quite difficult! I was so excited to see this because I loved the original and my friends will see it and tell me it's really bad. Well, I finally saw it and I was so disappointed. Ok, the shower scene was more realistic ... that's why I gave it a 3. Otherwise, it was fearing. Vince Vaughn does a terrible job playing Norman, he's too dense or something. I do not know, it was just terrible. Do not see it!
