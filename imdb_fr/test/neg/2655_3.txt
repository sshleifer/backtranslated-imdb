Being a Harrison Ford fan, I'm probably nice. It was predictable, skinny ... my husband made a lot of ragged sounds as we watched him. What a disappointing film. Our local newspaper (San Jose Mercury News) actually awarded 4 stars out of 4 stars! Hard to believe that the critics saw the same movie as us.
