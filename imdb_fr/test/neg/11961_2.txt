I watched the Scarecrow's first movie and did not win it, even though I knew it was category b. In fact, he had a decent gore and the guy who played the scarecrow was a great acrobat with good skills. The effects were better and the costume looked much better than this movie. <br /> <br /> I borrowed this one with an open mind, I'm also a fan of Ken Shamrock (former champion ufc superfight) and hoped it was a decent movie. <br /> <br /> The boy was wrong, the film was nil, the monster was pathetic both in appearance and actually scary, the scenario was so predictable that it was like watching the movie in preview mode As I was already guessing what was coming, the music was so bad, with a horrible lip sync song that made me want to hit the screen. <br /> <br /> Overall, avoid this shitty movie. <br /> <br /> Save money.
