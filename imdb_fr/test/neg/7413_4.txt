An airplane carrying the daughter of a rich scientist falls in a thick desert. He gathers a group to pick her up and find the others, but the rescue group soon suspects that something is waiting for them. Then, the subsequent motives of the expedition are revealed, which only adds to the already existing tension. <br /> <br /> The film is a decent idea and an interpretation of the popular legend of Sasquatch would inevitably lead sooner or later to filming the film. . However, the direction of the film violates a fundamental rule of making thrillers and thrillers, which shows too much and too early. Of course, the public knows that there is something stalking the characters, just read the title! But showing what should have been the kicker of the movie so soon ruined most of the suspense and, therefore, a lot of fun. The film also lacks a good atmosphere and there are almost no landscape shots showing the extent of the wilderness, but there are many monster-looking shots that add nothing to anything. In fact, they shamelessly eliminate 'Predator'. The low-budget horror film "Wendigo" did what this movie tries to do much better. <br /> <br /> Some tensions of characters and an uncliched end manage to compensate this rise, but it remains poor and considering the places and the potential, very disappointing. --- 4/10 <br /> <br /> Noted R for some violence and blasphemy, but it's pretty docile compared to most R-rated horrors.
