"Five characters looking for an exit" must be one of the most boring "zones" ever created. It was on Sci-Fi this morning and, as usual, I changed channels. I put it in my list of the five worst "zones" ever produced. Dull and predictable, and not worth watching. Serling has worked on this theme until death (earthly alien hands, often giant), and in this version in particular, it just does not work. Anyone who has not seen it before will understand it quickly. This is another element of the philosophical spirit of Serling, parallel to the distress of prisoners of war or concentration camps, where prisoners may lose interest in knowing where they are or fighting their wars. kidnappers. William Windom, as a soldier who is the last to "land", is the only curious to make the effort, and it does not take long to imagine the result.
