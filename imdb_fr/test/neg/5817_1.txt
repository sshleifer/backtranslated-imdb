I am a big fan of very bad B movies. And I particularly like extraterrestrial / scifi movies. I say the cheapest, the cheese and the campier the better. A small budget and a fun idea are pretty fun for most bad B movies, but this movie is so bad that I felt really embarrassed for the people who made the movie and for the schlocky ad-lib actors. First of all, there is no real plot, it's a kind of "comic" situation (if we can call it that). The "comedy" in this film is more centered on characters who say in essence: "Look at me, I'm in this crazy situation! Is not it funny?", But it's only pathetic because nothing what someone does is so funny. There is no comic actor talent, no plot to stage all imaginative scenarios through this dull shit. <br /> <br /> The bad comedy and the lack of something comic at a distance is aggravated by the bad ad-lib the acting of actors, actors who repeat really stupid things over and over again (maybe in trying to look for slogans, maybe just because everyone is so bad), really unattractive women being played as hot girls, and chatting and fainting bathrooms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, there was a mature actor who, I know, had acting skills and was a little convincing in his role. He was as out of place as a solid BM in the bathroom of a detox unit on weekends. Corey Feldman was filmed for about 3 minutes in total (thankfully, we do not have to stand it anymore), and he was filmed off site, probably outside his apartment. He said some really fun things about extraterrestrials and extraterrestrial sex and that was the extent of his appearance. <br /> <br /> If you care about your life and the 90 minutes (and years of trouble remembering) you will lose looking at this trash, avoid it. If you consume a lot of drugs, like Adam Sandler's (and therefore have no standard), and you are considered mentally slow, you may like this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I think people who are thrilled should work for Troma or something like that, because I can not believe that people can be lame enough to enjoy this movie. (Does the drug really spoil your judgment?)
