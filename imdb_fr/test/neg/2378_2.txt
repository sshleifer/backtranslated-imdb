I think it's the first time I'm going to a theater and I'm so disappointed. I went to see "Asterix and the Vikings" for two reasons: first as a film buff and then as a big Asterix fan. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film does not satisfy any request. . It's simply a big mess and it proves that the franchise Asterix is ​​getting worse. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is the case since the death of the first writer René Goscinny in 1977. His faithful collaborator, the illustrator Albert Uderzo took his place, but the following works obviously lacked the present quality during the Goscinny years. <br /> <br /> "Asterix and the Vikings" is based on the book "Asterix and the Normans", which was published under the reign of Goscinny. The basic story is the same: Goudurix, the "nephew" of Abraracourt comes to the village and Asterix and Obelix must turn him into a real man, while the Vikings come to Gaul to discover what fear, because it seems that this fear gives wings. . <br /> <br /> The similarities end here. What follows in the book is a non-stop series of laughs, gags and hilarious dialogues, which allows the Vikings to discover fear and flee Gaul. The film is silly, foolish, fast, nerdy ... Well, just name a defect and it has a good chance of being applied ... <br /> <br /> The difference between the book and the movie could be more acceptable if the movie was good. But new ideas are simply piling it up in a bottomless chasm. Even the older Asterix movies, such as "Asterix the Gaul", which has almost transferred the lines one by one without modifying them, are much better. <br /> <br /> The animation has the quality of the other films of the 21st century, but it has its defects and any beginner in cinema could find the errors. The best example is the continuity error, where the day follows the night after a split second, in the same sequence. <br /> <br /> Imagine. They have taken animation studios from many countries and still have not managed to make an adequate film. <br /> <br /> The changes in the original story are simply unbearable. And they could still be even if there was no original story. Goudurix, in the film, has a domestic pigeon called SMS that acts as a mobile phone (!). Grossebaf, the Viking leader, has a rebellious teenage daughter named Abba (!) And she constantly challenges her father's authority. There is also a stupid Viking wizard, his caricature son and silly and muscular, the faithful wife of Grossebaf obsessed with decoration (her name is Vikea!) And ... well, I can not stand it any longer . <br /> <We are far from the original gags of the original book. The biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring images to the big screen, mainly because the biggest laughs in the books come from verbal jokes and visual gags that do not have the same appeal on a theater screen. I remember that the greatest moments of the book were Obelix, who laughed at the names of invaders (all ending in 'af') and that Goudurix was trying to scare them ridiculously. <br /> <br /> And if all was not enough, a member of the advertising staff decided to write on the poster of the film that there was already a Celine Dion song that would appear in the final credits . If it was a new song, I could have understood. But using an old song is just another proof that the film is so badly done that they are ready to do anything to attract moviegoers. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that it's so stupid and the end is so bad that we can not go out of the theater without being cold. In a summer outing, it does not hurt ... <br /> <br /> The only other acceptable point of the film is the way Goudurix becomes brave. His psychological transformation into the book is too spontaneous and unreliable, while it is better described in the film and the motivation is more credible. <br /> <br /> So, if you have not seen the movie yet, do not waste your money on it. Take the book instead. <br /> <br /> Oh René, why did you leave us?
