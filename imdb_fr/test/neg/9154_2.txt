THE MEMORY GARDEN'S GIRL, in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards, was a bestseller that was a resounding success and probably featured in more reading groups than any other novel in its history. diffusion. So what happened when the novel became a movie made for television? Perhaps it's John Pielmeier's mediocre (oops!) Scenario below, which galloped unabatedly in an awkward pedestrian way, thus removing any credibility from the story. Perhaps it is the direction of the cut / paste of Mick Jackson that misses the rhythm and the delimitation of the characters. Perhaps he is suffering from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the musical score "liquid tears" by Daniel Licht. For all these reasons (or all these reasons), this novel-to-film survives because it argues in favor of public education about the abilities of those born with Down syndrome. And for that, it's worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a well-known orthopedic doctor, is married to beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and their lives are changing because of their pregnancy. On a stormy winter night in Kentucky, Norah goes to work and the Henry rushes to a nearby clinic where David delivers his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the help of his old friend. Nurse Caroline Gill (Emily Watson). After the birth of a perfect boy (Paul), Norah continues to give birth and (surprisingly ...) gives birth to an unexpected twin (!). David and Caroline immediately recognize that the little girl (Phoebe) is a "Mongoloid" (this is before the use of the term Down syndrome) and David, who has already lost a little sister because of a congenital anomaly, decides to send Phoebe. to an asylum for the mentally handicapped: Caroline must perform the delivery and Norah is informed that the second twin has died at birth. <br /> <br /> Caroline follows the instructions, sees the conditions of the "house" where Phoebe must be filed, shrinks in horror and decides to keep the child. With the help of a friendly trucker, Caroline changes her lonely life and the Phoebe mothers find a new life in Pittsburgh. Norah insists on an official funeral for Phoebe - a fact that profoundly disturbs David's psyche. Henry's life continues with the only child Paul, leaving behind a deep pain in the absence of Phoebe. Norah offers David a camera ("people's lives are like a camera, that's where they live - in a room captured by a moment") and David becomes obsessed with photography. Norah cries, drinks, and loses David's attention, while David traces Phoebe's existence with Caroline - sending money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stentiford to Jamie Spilchuk) grows up, discovers the infidelities of his mother and is moved by the lack of communication and understanding of his father. He then decides to achieve his goal of becoming a musician and then goes to Juilliard. Meanwhile, Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has matured to become a very fit girl, and the way the Henry's Broken Marriage and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe's and Paul's lives, associated with courage that has supported Caroline Gill's struggle to gain acceptance in the world of people born with Down syndrome forms the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> The troupe of well-known actors does their best, but only Emily Watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this slimy script. Jamie Spilchuk demonstrates a promising young actor. Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen have trouble shaping empathic characters from the silly lines they are responsible for delivering. The film is a mess, but the message on acceptance of children and adults with Down syndrome is important. Grady Harp
