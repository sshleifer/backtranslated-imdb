As usual, the leader Leo Gorcey (under the name of Slip Mahoney) and "The Bowery Boys" have trouble finding money. After trying unsuccessfully to sell their old record, the guys asked for help at the local bank. There, the unfortunate Huntz Hall (like Sach) gets his picture taken by the pretty photographer Teala Loring (like Cathy Smith). But, as the shot was fired during a robbery, Mr. Hall looks like the main suspect. With his buddies Bobby Jordan (Bobby), William "Billy" Benedict (Whitey) and David Gorcey (Chuck); Mr. Gorcey wants to free Hall and collect the $ 1,000 reward. "Bowery Bombshell" follows the movements, with a main force of Mrs. Loring. <br /> <br /> **** Bowery Bombshell (20/07/46) Phil Karlson ~ Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Teala Loring, Bobby Jordan
