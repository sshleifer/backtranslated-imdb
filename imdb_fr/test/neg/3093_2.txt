I was sucked by the big names. Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, Burt Reynolds and the fact that it is an independent film. Incredibly slow beginner: 35 minutes, two sad songs and a sloppy scam. I did not care about the characters, and the plot never tempted me to pretend that it could be realistic. I can not believe that's what makes it on the screen. I loved watching this movie because it was so good when it was over.
