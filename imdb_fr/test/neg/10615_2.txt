There are films that are leaders and movies that follow. <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" was a leader. And here is one of his followers. <br /> <br /> "Party Camp" is about as interchangeable as any member of his group who has traveled the depths that "Meatballs" (the original) had exploited so successfully. Of course, this one had Bill Murray. So, what does "Party Camp" have? <br /> <br /> I'm glad you asked this question. <br /> <br /> Jewel Sheperd made these films her bread and butter, and what a flat side she provides! Even as an innocent girlfriend (wink) of a rich twerp (Cribb), she provides that stifling steam she gives to all her parts. And yes, guys, she shows (if you know what I mean and I think you do). My God, his smile could melt through the titanium. <br /> <br /> What? Oh yes, the movie. Nothing special as I said; every cheap joke aims and hits (roughly at the crotch level). And the eternal teen Jayne is good to laugh or two. But instead of a sense of humor, there's just nudity, lame sexual jokes, more, nudity, a sequence of soft-core dreams, a sex-symbols nurse just for purposes playful (dressed!), Even more nudity .... <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... Maybe it's a good idea that Bill Murray is not in this business. <br /> <br /> Two stars. For Jewel, of course. A lot of "camp", but not really a "party".
