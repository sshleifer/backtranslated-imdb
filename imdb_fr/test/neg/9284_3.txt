Martin Lawrence is not a funny man in Runteldat. He has too many things in his head and he is too angry, causing his play of words to play early in the game. He tries to make fun of the critics, which amounts to "the fuck". Then he continues with rather primitive sexual jokes about smokers with throat cancer, and everything begins to deteriorate. 3/10
