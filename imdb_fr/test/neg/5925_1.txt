An example of all the worst homosexual stereotypes of a movie. <br /> <br /> And why are you talking in this strange British / loud pseudo accent, and do you insist that the kid also speak that way? Has anyone else noticed that all the music on the soundtrack is exactly the same? You should stick to the good old Hollywood camp, where you are so talented! Die Mommy Die II, the sequel !! I do not see the value of spending time and money on a project like this; there are so many stories of REAL young people to tell and we should see them, not that trash. Sheesh, what a waste of time. An embarrassing example of gay cinema.
