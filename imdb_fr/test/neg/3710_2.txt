A terrific B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive. I challenge all movie buffs "Aliens (James Cameron 1986)" to count the number of times almost entire lines or sequences have been stolen from the first two Alien movies to create this classic bin. <br /> <br /> Members of the cast such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with no talent and the lead role of "Jack Scalia" was really horrible. I think they threw it for his huge split chin. I was also annoyed by the stereotypes of the only black man on the set, John Toles-Bey, who must watch this film and marvel. Watch it from time to time as it has made a lot of interesting movies. <br /> <br /> But on this movie: the script, as I said earlier, was a modified Aliens scam and turned into a submarine "thriller". This included phrases such as "I had a bad feeling about this" and "Kill me" because a crew member is infected with one of the mutants and his belly starts to "jump" extraterrestrial "just before it gets out of his stomach. There is also a scam of the classic "get some!" via Bill Paxton. We also have a group of marine grunts running through caves with scary creatures popping up from the walls. Even explosions of mutated creatures are very similar to extraterrestrials while they charge marines in the movie "Aliens". And most importantly, some mutants spit acid (as opposed to acid for blood). There are many other major examples. So, if you want this script to be well done, look at the first two classics Alien and Aliens (with Sigourney Weaver). You will have a more pleasant time. <br /> <br /> The plot could have been interesting and better executed if there had been no confusion in the sequences at the beginning of the film and a generally poor editing. The shots were rather boring and honestly, it was not too difficult to stop to watch the movie and walk around the room to grab a snack or check his email. Many interactions between the characters had little or no meaning and were nowhere more often than not. The entire command structure between the crew and the captain was poorly made. I'm not even sure if there are captains in the army who totally control the nuclear submarines. In general, this simply shows that little research has been done to make the film look at least a bit respectable and there are many other similar examples (such as diving depth, etc.). <br /> <br /> If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to laugh and shake your head then this movie may be for you. As for me, this one is back on the shelf ... permanently.
