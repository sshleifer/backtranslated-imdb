The novel WEAPON, which serves as the basis for this atrocious trash, is one of the best techno-thrillers to defeat the pike for a long time. The character of SOLO, who is NOT supposed to look like a human being, is wonderful creation and it was just awful to see him reduced to another Terminator clone with Mario Van Peebles trying horribly to "behave" like a robot. This film is worthless. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood insist on getting the rights of great novels and then slaughtering them? There are so many problems with SOLO that their list seems as unfair as inviting a legless man to play hopscotch. Avoid this horrible film and look for the two novels of ROBERT MASON that showcase the formidable character of SOLO. The books are WEAPON and an excellent SOLO suite. But do not pay attention to this horrible film.
