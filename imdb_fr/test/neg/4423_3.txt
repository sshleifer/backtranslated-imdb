This film is a waste of time. Although there are actors who have the potential to do something decent, the game in the movie is below normal and has a clich√© point. "You never know what will happen tomorrow, so live your life to the fullest and do what makes you happy." This sentence saves you from losing hours of your life with this movie. People who love this movie are the same as those who would like to sit for two hours before discovering that the whole movie was a dream sequence. If the most important part of the movie will not even happen, make it at least fun to watch and captivating. There is a reason why this project did not make a theatrical release, and although indy films can be very good, it does not even come close to it.
