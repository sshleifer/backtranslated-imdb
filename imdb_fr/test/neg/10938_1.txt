Oh my. Oh, it's a * really * bad movie. The acting is absolutely atrocious, the screenplay is horrible and the photography is simply awful. <br /> <br /> What sets this movie apart, however, is that you never care about your soul once ... Good guy or villain, alive, dying or dead-- in 87 minutes. "Oh, he's dead? Uh ... I thought they'd do it" was the best reaction I could have after each murder. The characters are so black or white that with the volume turned off, you can always know who was who. While the voices of the cast had a strange monotonous quality, their faces give the impression that you are looking at an old silent movie with a lot of frowning eyebrows, exaggerated frowns and "pensive looks". Each character is a one-man pony without humor, passion and one dimension; once fulfilled regardless of their particular role in this required fiasco, they are summarily dismissed. <br /> <br /> That made me vaguely think of what would happen if Thomas Borch Nielsen (director / writer of "Skyggen", American title: "Webmaster") decided to make a low-budget version of "American Psycho "and was a little distracted along the way. <br /> <br /> This film is not particularly horrible; the cold and passionless casting assures that. This is not an offensive film; the director plays it so loudly that no one could find it that way. It's just a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. We were not so lucky and really paid to watch this bomb on Pay-per-View. As part of my penance, I write this review. <br /> <br /> Enough said.
