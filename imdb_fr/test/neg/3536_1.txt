SPOILER!!!! Mind Ripper hmmmm ... I had just watched the nightmare on elm street movies and I had just got to know Giovanni Ribisi. I thought that Giovanni Ribisi had no horror, so I checked. I saw "the outpost" (mind smashed), I checked on my Tivo for that. There was an air date on Sci Fi. So I was ready. I prepared my popcorn and sat on the couch. What is it? A bold freakin guy in blue track pants run screaming! Nothing is scary about this movie! If something is funny! It's funny how budget is low, funny as it's predictable, funny to play badly and funny to make a lot of money. Ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor but this movie is silly. It's so stupid. They killed him at the end, then they took the plane and the "monster" is on board. They shoot him in the head with a rifle that falls very far to the ground. And <br /> <br /> -GASP- The deadly ending, she is still alive! WOOHHH! Scary! woooohhhh! Big bag of shit waste of 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Result: you have a place to go and you have to waste time. Mind Ripper is not the suggestion. I prefer to stay naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time. <br /> <br /> GLOBAL GRADE: F- - - - - - - - - - (ENTERNAL)
