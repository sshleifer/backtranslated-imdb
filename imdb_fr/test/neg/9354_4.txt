Helen of Troy follows Helen's story and the outbreak of the Trojan War. It's more a love story between Helen and Paris, which is wrecked and falls in love with Helen without knowing she is queen. The film portrays the couple as a pain of love and wishing nothing more than being together. (Other movies and books have different representations of the characters, but in this one, they are simply in love with each other.) The movie is rather slow in some places, but the battles and details of the decor unfold rather well. There is also good performance. I thought the slave girl was doing a very good job and she was one of the most loved characters. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good fit if you can look beyond the slow history places and look beyond some of the cheese romance and dialogue. In my opinion, a perfect Iliad movie version has not been created yet, but it is entertaining and contains good elements.
