A good old movie is almost necessary to have a moonlight, car chases, a scenario that looks vaguely like a "plot" and at least a very pretty country girl, barefoot with shorts and a top. The pretty girl is here (wearing branded jeans) - but the redneck prerequisites stop there. Jimmy Dean is a natural spokesman for sausage, but as a former sheriff, he is very short. Big John is fat, but he does not convince with the "bad" part of his nickname. Insolent, Jack Elam is always funny and Bo Hopkins has been playing the same role for decades. Ned Beatty also plays his role in a small role ... but there is no HISTORY. It feels more like an episode of In the heat of the night than a feature film. Cornpone cornball with easily predictable feeling. Perhaps the most obvious problem in this film is Charlie Daniels who sings the theme. You know the one he was made famous by ... Jimmy Dean.
