Star Trek V certainly deserves the dubious distinction of being the weakest movie in the Star Trek series. Despite the good efforts of the actors, he suffered from the general lack of funding of Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures was not thrilled with the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the Enterprise team taking advantage of its extended coastal vacation to rephrase its message to save the Earth from a total ecological disaster. Their coastal leave is shortened when a disturbance occurs on Nimbus III, the planet of intergalactic peace. Captain Kirk and the Enterprise arrive at Nimbus III only to be diverted from their ship by Sybok, Spock's half-brother. Sybok brainwashes the Enterprise crew and puts him on a suicide mission to get to "God" just after the Great Barrier Reef in the center of our galaxy. Captain Kirk then has to find a way to regain control of his ship and drive Klignon's pursuers back into the Enterprise. <br /> <br /> The only positive point of the film is the acting and the director. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill and the rest of the cast are all performing well. William Shatner is also doing a great job in making this movie. <br /> <br /> However, the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. First, Sybok's share was originally offered to Sean Connery, but he declined. So Laurence Luckinbill had the role. Second, many of the special effects have been significantly reduced ... reducing the entertainment potential of movies. Third, the scene describing the arrival at the Great Barrier Gate left much to be desired. Finally, the romance between Scotty and Uhura in this film does not make much sense ... since no such romance had ever occurred before in the Star Trek universe and never explained how such a romance could suddenly materialize Star Treks IV and V. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very weak movie. You should probably just skip this movie and go to Star Trek VI. After all, the actors and the team created Star Trek VI in part to save themselves after their debacle with Star Trek V.
