SPOILERS, ATTENTION! Flashdance is a fair movie, in my opinion. Some things baffle me (for example, Jeanie asks Alex how long she has been so good at dancing, Alex says "about 25 years", is not Alex supposed to be 18?) And some things passionate about it (I loved the tricks!). But overall, it intrigued me. When this film was made, I was not even born. I did not really live in the eighties (I was born in 1985) and I have to wonder: sometimes Alex just ran a little in place, or jumped everywhere, did not really dance, just typed in the objects, to throw it away. his head back and waving his arms-was it considered "dancing" at the time? If that were the case, I'm not sure I could have supported it. The turns, flips, flowing movements were excellent, but some of them - my neighbor's toddler could have done better! Plus, if Alex is a welder during the day, would not she be tired after a hard day's work? If she does not work for nearly a week, would she not be fired? Living in a warehouse, I can almost see it, but not quite. It does not seem normal for her to be a welder, to have a warehouse AND to try to get into ballet. None of this really makes sense. I should not judge too much considering my own background, but please. Maybe Jennifer Beals is too feminine to think of her as a welder, I do not know. But anyway, they could have chosen a better actress. The actors were good. I even liked romance. You make your own decision. But mine is renting it once, do not see it again, it's not worth it.
