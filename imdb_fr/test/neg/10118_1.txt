Hm. Where do I start? I usually do not know the rating given to IMDb when looking for a movie, because I think I'll like it anyway or whatever and I should at least give it a chance, but this time, I would like to have your attention. <br /> <br /> I know that some people have loved, and I'm not trying to say they should not. It was half fun. But if you are like me and you do not like to watch the cats prancing in the undergrowth for 20 minutes, random scenes of rapidly moving clouds, dogs barking in cages for another 20 minutes on a background of "thrilling" music and close-ups of faces while people are talking, you might want to avoid this movie The actors were either really wooden, or really out of date, and the quality of the film was horrible, blurry and gritty and bland and not at all artistic. And I know we were supposed to think that Carol was not just a crazy maniac with a shotgun of the innocent with this strange religious psychosis, but ... well, she does not really convince me otherwise. In fact, I really ended up hating his crazy character. And what was happening with souls in space? I understand it's a fantastic movie, but go for it. <br /> <br /> I will say that the angel at the end was really terrifying. It was the scariest thing in the whole movie, much more frightening than the demon of Dark Maul's lava face. I gave them props for this scene, it was good. But not enough to see the movie. And the opening credits were excellent, but make no mistake! I would have preferred that they use the money spent in these credits to improve the movie. <br /> <br /> Bah. If only I had not bought that for the $ 2 I paid, I could have bought a candy bar instead. : /
