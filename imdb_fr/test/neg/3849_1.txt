I had the misfortune to see this movie at friends' house. What a waste of time. What a total crap and complete this movie is! Absolutely nothing is funny here, from the shower scene to the insulting and degrading depiction of the Germans. There is no plot, the acting has silenced me and in the end, I personally wanted to beat John Leguizamo with a stick. I thought John Woo's movies were bad ..... This movie is officially the worst movie I've ever seen.
