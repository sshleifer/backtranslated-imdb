River Queen attempts to sum up a complex and complex historical narrative in just under two hours. There are breathtaking battle scenes and the landscape of Wanganui is beautifully captured. However, the film suffered from some bad tracks - Samantha Morton (Sarah) in particular seemed unconvincing. There seems to be some uncertainty as to how the role should be played - as an impotent victim launched by fate or as a strong and determined character, with a clear vision of his destiny. The character of Kiefer Sutherland - Private Doyle - seemed useless and for the most part unintelligible. Keifer's Irish brogue needs some polishing. On the other hand, Cliff Curtis, Temuera Morrison and Rawiri Pene (as son of Sarah, "Boy") were complete and credible. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of River Queen were particularly compressed and rushed. It seemed that they had decided to solve all the problems before 120 minutes had elapsed. For example. How did Wiremu find Sarah and Doyle? No explanation and very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> I went to this film with an open mind. I had not read or heard anything except his troubled production. What I experienced is a mash mash of New Zealand history, beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing.
