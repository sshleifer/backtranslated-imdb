It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story was about a prisoner sent into space trying to save mankind, but it turned out that the prisoner was taken aboard a spaceship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander. The whole story was about sex again and again. All these images were not necessary - just create a soft porn movie. Of course, we had to see the movie's heroine make love for about 2 minutes. I do not know what all this has to do with the plot of the movie - except to make men watch it. I gave it 1 out of 10 just because there was no other lower note. Do not waste your money or time, it has nothing to do with science fiction but rather a movie that young teenagers can watch for news stories. The creature was only shown more than half of the movie and looked like the alien in the movie with Signorney Weaver. Bad excuse for entertainment.
