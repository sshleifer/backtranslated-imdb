I live in Istanbul for 24 years and I (a 39 year old experience suggests it), I know what Istanbul has gone through all these years. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin is still very young (born in 1973) and falling into the great mistake of being ORIENTALIST when we look at Turkey (as her other film Gegen Die Wand did). This film seriously misses contemporary Turkish urban life and deceives the public when it gives (quite false indications) geographical and cultural clues. dissemination of Istanbul. <br /> <br /> Anyone who can speak Turkish could easily attest that many of the underground groups and groups described in the film (Siyasiyabend for one) are SO MISERABLE and that their members can not even speak a suitable language. be considered as "representatives" of contemporary Turkish music. It's even less a shit that many Turkish listeners do not even know at all. <br /> <br /> We Turks have long been used to the "super-perfect" Westerners who look at Turkey from an Orientalist point of view: What is new in this film is the fact that a director of Turkish origin (Faith Akin) makes the same mistake: to look at Turkey with false Western glasses and try to describe it if he understands better. A vain effort. <br /> <br /> Ask any Turkish friend: what kind of musical documentary is this without mentioning the names: Zeki Muren, Baris Manco, Ajda Pekkan, Teoman, Muslum Gurses, Ibrahim Tatlises, Ferdi Ozbegen? .. and many others who have shaped so far the real music we listen to today? <br /> <br /> Faith Akin has a long and long lesson to learn before chatting and baffling the minds of others with fake images of contemporary Turkish music.
