Have you ever thought, after watching a horror movie with a group of friends: "Wow, it's so cool, we have to make a horror movie splashed ourselves a day later. is not as difficult as it sounds "? Well, that's certainly what crossed the mind of the younger Campbell brothers in 2003, presumably just after watching Sam Raimi's "The Evil Dead" or a similar horror-like classic. This "demonic summer", however, is so embarrassing! These young amateur filmmakers obviously love the horror genre and know their classics, but that does not make them almost talented. I have seen a lot of bad B movies in my years as a horror fanatic, but honestly, this is one of the biggest nonsense ever made. And it's pretty sad to be so open-minded, because all the actors and the team clearly had good intentions. There is virtually no script at all. A duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a jerk and, while reading a few, one of them turns into a dreadful demon who starts killing members of all teenage groups: dorks, hot catholic girls, troublemakers. That's about all, except of course for all the mandatory shots, like the sexy girl who cracks for the biggest dork, etc., etc. The performances are really hard to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry! They remain motionless until the script indicates that it is their turn to interact. I hate that! Some of the makeup effects are both decent but not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most terrible punk songs of all time. This film should never have been released ... I can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be part of the production, but it is completely idiotic and does not contain the least redeeming element. Not even a bit of amateur nudity, cursed!
