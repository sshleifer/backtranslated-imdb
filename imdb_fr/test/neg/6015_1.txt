What's the point? Has not that already been done, better? And even? Why does Werner Herzog lose his good skills and his time with junk food like this? Should not he shoot a movie somewhere - I mean a real movie? <br /> <br /> Everything felt wrong from the beginning. Werner Herzog would never have made a film about the myth of Loch Ness - at least not on such a small scale, surrounded by losers - so the plot was not credible from the beginning. The actors who are supposed to act as if they were not acting obviously acted. The story was not interesting, the "ordinary people" required in each fake documentary were invisible, the personalities were out of date, the jokes were not funny, the effects were unconvincing and the end was not found. <br /> <br /> I simply do not see the goal. It's a fake movie about a fake movie. Hah, hah. Maybe those who have imagined such a movie have tried to make one that makes fun of those who were really looking for a real Nessie, it could have had potential. But Herzog is not a believer and has never claimed to be one. A fake documentary about the crowd of cryptozoologists would have had so much more fuel. <br /> <br /> It was a failure.
