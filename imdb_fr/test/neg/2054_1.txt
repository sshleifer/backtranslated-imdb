I rented this movie today ... the worst movie of my life. It was a total waste of time and a horrible story. The game was horrible, especially by the actress "Sai". She was so bad that it was ridiculous. I can not say if it was his bad role or because the character was as stupid as that first. I can not even understand how horrible and useless this movie was. I'm surprised someone even thought it was a good idea to FILMER this movie and take it out. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie Vampire / Horror .. this is not the movie for you. Move forward! It is a waste of time and money. Heck, I would not even download this movie if someone paid me. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that it does not even deserve a "1". I wish I could give him a "0"!
