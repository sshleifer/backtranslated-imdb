As a fan of Henriksen (I liked him in the series "Millennium") and of course Lorenzo "Renegade" Lamas, I was expecting at least that this film is something. Unfortunately, the plot is predictable, the acting is bad and the computer graphics used for most stunts do not work. Sometimes it even looks like they have captured images of Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is also nil. In the beginning, superfluous superficial camera work only hurts (at ridiculous dialogue) and gives the movie a cheap and video-friendly look. It works in hiphop movies and Jet Li movies, but seems out of place in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would have liked this film 10 years ago. I was then 11 years old.
