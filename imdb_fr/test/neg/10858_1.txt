Larry Bishop, the screenwriter / actor / director, focuses too much on the camera, music and visuals. The film resorts to insignificant divagations and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no other objective than to annoy and irritate the public. From the beginning to the end of the film, the actors live a bumpy adventure and are caught in a frightful smoke screen. Hell with the ride. The film is a bomb. <br /> <br /> The Victors are portrayed as outdated vigilantes, seeking their own form of justice for what they consider anarchy. They are bikers, anti-heroes and protagonists. Pistolero, played by Larry Bishop, is the avenging leader of the pack. The Gent (Michael Madsen) is trapped in his own fire of chaos and psychosis. <br /> <br /> Comanche (Eric Balfour) is faithful, but mysterious. Deuce, played by David Carradine, should have passed the tour, as well as ticket buyers (if you decide to see the movie, you'll be sorry, but you'll find out why). Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) is a lecherous and poisonous character, completely full of disdain. <br /> <br /> What puzzles me is how this film, with all its continual ramblings and vulgarity, has ever prompted anyone to invest that is going absolutely nowhere. Buyers of tickets, follow my advice: do not pay for the trip. Please do not make the same mistake as investors. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes of the film are both confused and unintelligible. Dialogue, which quickly turns into a meaningless monologue, has no meaning. The whole movie is determined to go nowhere. Poor Dennis Hopper is in a real mess. He too should have passed the round. There are decapitated heads, slit throats and naked women fighting. It is clear that Bishop does not know where he is going with the movie. He is completely lost. But, at the end of the journey, you will be completely fooled. Mama Mia! Stay at home. And, of course, do not take the ride. I rate this movie 1 out of 10, but this movie is so horrible that it deserves a zero.
