This movie is reserved for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. <br /> <br /> I am angry at TCM for showing this mess more often than Bachelor Mother, the delicious original. I'm even angrier that some Hollywood breasts thought it would be a good idea to redo Bachelor Mother, filling it with lame songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of a cute comedy. Instead, Hollywood could have spent the time, money, energy and talent wasted in this horrible remake to give us something new and original - Wow, what a concept! <br /> <br /> Bachelor Mother (the original), with Ginger Rogers and David Niven are a spicy stew, quivering with sexuality. It's a wink of the 1930s at the Hays office. Bundle of Joy (the remake), with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, is strictly milk and cookies. It's a handshake of the 1950s with Eisenhower. <br /> <br /> What distribution do you prefer to watch - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou, or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, each member of the cast in the original version is much better than his counterpart in the remake. <br /> <br /> In the original, a beautiful girl, Ginger Rogers, is at its peak. David Niven perfectly meets the expectations as a spoiled, sophisticated and yet confused descent from a wealthy department store magnate. And I still like to see Charles Coburn in a movie. In Bachelor Mother, he is priceless as a desperate grandfather. <br /> <br /> In Bundle of Joy, Debbie Reynolds is her usual perky. She is doing well in this role, although her performance (as well as Fisher's) completely changes the tone of the story. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is hopeless. It lacks completely "presence" on the screen. Here he is too healthy for this story. His game is completely bland and without intelligence. Likewise, his singing is so bland and unusual that he has been completely forgotten by the whole world. The only time he is not completely painful is in Butterfield 8, where, incidentally, he does not sing. Here, Fisher's poor performance is enough to ruin this movie. Adolphe Menjou, favorite actor, delivers a competent performance, but not one of his best. It is noisier than ordering. He and Fisher are not convincing as father and son. <br /> <br /> Do you see a musical for the music, the story being simply fortuitous? Or do you watch a musical for a story, with good music (hopefully) used for seasoning? If first, you might like this lame remake. Otherwise, you'd better watch Bachelor Mother, the original non-musical Ginger Rogers.
