I'm not kidding: there's a scene in this movie where a tramp hits his head on a tunnel key and explodes (without a fireball, though) into a million pieces! It caused a kid in front of me to scream in terror! ... In a movie rated G! <br /> <br /> This film could be used to convince children that Santa Claus is evil! His assistants are ugly, misanthropic, overflowing and mean! When Santa Claus (here an anagram of Satan!) Appears, all 200,000 elves start singing "Santa Claus comes to town" as if it were a druid war song. Then, in the reflection of the object "Rosebud" of this film (a bell that whispers allusions to why you do not hear it ring: "doubt ... doubt ...)), the old Saint Nick appears, resembling a stoic Donald Sutherland, his face glowing like Moses's "K10C." When we hear him speak, his thunderous voice sounds less like an old Elf and more like James Earl Jones slowed by about 20% Scary! The syrupy music is moved, boring and repetitive, it does not follow any emotional thread (as in the very effective score of "Titanic") to generate sensations of warmth and magic.It does not stir not, partly because it does not correspond to the imagery of the film.There are some wrecks musical train (no pun intended) where, from nowhere, the strange symphonic score suddenly slams POLKA, joyful and childish, about the locomotive of the title, which gives the impression that the f ilm whole was started to production! <br /> <br /> ree with other commentators on how, well ... "dead" everyone looks. It sometimes seems a little macabre. The motion capture technique is useful for allowing rollercoaster sequences to resemble those of Kings Island to appear convincing at a distance, but up close, "real" actors should have been used. Overall, good to watch for time watching TV, but not much here.
