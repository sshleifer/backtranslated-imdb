the hills have eyes is not a big film by all the efforts of the imagination. For one of the bad guys, it sounds almost normal, not what you'd expect crazy people to look like. For another, the rhythm is very slow sometimes and there are many scenes of the characters are repeated.by that, I mean that there are many things in the film, with many things that run aimlessly. The film did not have a clear direction. the plot of the film is far from original, even for its The chainsaw massacre in Texas took place a few years earlier and is a much more effective film, with respect to the horror. the film has few fears, and the deafening soundtrack served both to squeak and distract. Once I imagine that the music was used to hide the fact that there was not much going on in the film, even though it failed to achieve its intended purpose. when something finally happened promised the movie had been ruined by chaos and noise. I got through because I like to give the benefit of the doubt to the movie. Yes, there are yelling screams, and yes people are dying, but who cares too slowly to come up with any sort of reward, if you can call it that. my boyfriend liked it, so at least one of us has something to gain from it. the hills have eyes is not the worst movie we could have watched, but I doubt I'll see it again.This film was redone in 2006 and I will also have a review of this version.In any case, this film was painfully slow at times, while others were chaotic and repetitive. Unless you did not like looking at the dry, sometimes interrupted painting Someone running around your block screaming his head, stay tuned. away from this movie. A better bet would be the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973) 1.5 * out of 10 *, which is generous
