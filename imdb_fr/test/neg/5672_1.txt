Yes, we all know the strange fascination of Dan Schneider to do shows with young children and iCarly is no exception. See the girls move their toes and pull their tongues for the camera and wear tight clothes and bikini. Yes, we wonder if these shows were designed for teenagers or for an older and degenerate audience. Anyway, the series is not as good as that of Dan Schneiders, like the very superior Amanda Show & Drake and Josh. <br /> <br /> The show is about a brother and a sister (Carly and Spencer) who live alone. and having to fend for themselves while their father is in the army and their mother is strangely absent from their lives. Carly has a nasty friend named Sam and they run a very well-produced and award-winning web show called iCarly with their school friend Freddie. The episodes deal with their lives in and around the Web series and their salvation at school. <br /> <br /> Carly Shay is a young person on the Web who knows the world, a businesswoman and a producer portrayed by Miranda Cosgrove, a young actress. which relies on a very strong and fast conversation to spread his message and make strange grimaces. His brother Spencer is a rather petty, eccentric and eccentric performer by Jerry Trainor, who tries a bit hard to look like Jim Carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at the young male audience who would like that. kind of humor Joey Gladstone. Then there is Sam Puckett, a liar and unpleasant thief, who looks like a kid and needs an attitude adjustment played by Jeanette McCurdy who clearly wears hair extensions as you can see them disappear and then reappear from one scene to another. And finally, there is Freddie Benson on the web shows a nerdy cameraman and technical advisor, who has a big crush on Carly but who obviously will not end up with the one played by Nathan Kress. <br /> <br /> Other secondary characters come and go such as Freddies' mother, Carly's grandfather, boring teachers and many of their boring school friends to complete the casting. Most of the comedy is nasty, such as blowing Lewbert the Doorman like a gag, throwing a hot air balloon on a teacher and knocking over the table of a young scout selling biscuits. All adults are completely idiots, children know it and some of the main characters have no morals. Lying, cheating, stealing and using violence are acceptable in this children's show created and written by Dan Schneider, yes ... it's a children's show! What more can young viewers ask for ?? Well, with Dan Schneider, we can expect young girls to dress well in bikinis and do strange things, like shooting their tongues for the camera and eating bananas. <br /> <br /> Shows like this are exactly what the young crowd likes and I do not think it's worse than all the other garbage Nick shovels to his young crowd. There are always fans for everything that is seen on TV, at least it's a little better than most things seen on Nick like this horrible Naked Brothers show.
