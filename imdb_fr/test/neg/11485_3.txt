"The Shining" has a wit, a visual flair and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson. "Ausentes", however, has none of these things; although he borrows from his classical ancestor; namely, a man who passes the door and a woman running screaming while holding a huge kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's great psychological horror film, "Ausentes" is a work that resonates with a singular lack of genius. It's beautifully, comically awful; the movie Spice Girls looks like a vital work of art. "Ausentes" tells the story of a family moving to a gated community in the suburbs. Everything must be good with the world. They will live in peace and tranquility; they will quietly take their business away from these old streets of the city. But no. The character of Ariadna Gill, Julia, begins to be frightened by those things that insist that he works at night, by empty supermarkets and doors that close. and her husband, Samuel, played by Jordi Molla, spends from one moment to another of a man of family relaxed to a hazel with the wild eyes and always unshaven, injecting him a drug to hold it under the weight of his son. Molla, highly respected as an actor, is absolutely horrendous in this regard. Comic rather than threatening, he simply can not draw a threatening expression. He just passed for a ball of icy mud that drank a glass too much. So, is there anything to redeem this movie? No, the script is awkward, the plot non-existent and the distribution without merit. Completely without tension and full of moments of fear now, 'Ausentes' is an exercise to not do psychological thriller. It's ridiculous and exaggerated, but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious films of the past few years, it's definitely worth watching.
