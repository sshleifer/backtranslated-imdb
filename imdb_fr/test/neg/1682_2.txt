I attribute a score of six to the show because the show was actually a platform for Damon Wayans, just like the Cosby Show was for Bill Cosby. He was dealing with a lot of humor issues and I thought he was really suited to getting a laugh rather than letting the jokes come from the character. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and a perverse person. He is PHENOMENAL in the movies, but in the show, he was there for the film and although I like him, I thought that laughter was more important than likelihood. <br /> <br /> Jay Kyle I love her since House Party and enjoyed her in School Daze and Martin, it's a great role for her and she made a great choice by choosing this sitcom for the co -vedette. I also think that Jay and Michael were more equal in the series, but Jay was no longer the woman who fed her crazy husbands and followed her path of unorthodox discipline because she may have felt it was working <br /> <br /> Jr Simply stupid, his character should have been well developed and even he has his moments of greatness, we came back to the stupidity as if he learned nothing, which makes me crazy !!!!! !!! Not to mention that most situations (in the episodes I saw) seem to center around him <br /> <br /> Clear The pretty sister who went out with a Christian, I found the character of his little -I am more interesting than she was. (she'd better stick to the movies, the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but it's not stereotypical enough) <br /> <br /> Kady Lovable and the youngest girl. I think the writers have established his most character in the series besides the parents Franklin Franklin I LOVE this character and I think they derived it from Smart Guy (TJ Mowry ), which lasted only one season. They did an excellent job of casting for this little genius (the effort would have been made if Jr had been smart, but also showed the disadvantages.) <br /> <br /> All in all, this sitcom is a marvel and the is a tribute to the Cosby Show, it's well done, I love the show and I wish it stayed longer. I can not wait to see the final of the series
