I did not buy that, I did not rent it, it was on PPV and someone burned a copy and lent it to me, so at least I did not lose any money. For someone who did Darkness, the Unnamed, Devil's Backbone, it's a pretty lame movie. Looks like it has something to do with a group of girls who were in a convent at the time and who are now all grown up and who are chased and killed one by one by a nun coming out of the kitchen sink , the toilet and even manages to negotiate the revolving doors in a hotel. And what makes this nun so nasty and so nasty (and wet?) I do not know, it was so boring that at some point, about halfway through, I just had it arrested, ranged and watched. Was not even interested in knowing, really. Oh, of course, there are beautiful ladies to watch, but, are two of them lesbians? I suppose there is a picture on the bedside table of a girl's room and what self-respecting horror film would not be complete nowadays without a lesbian couple? Yeah whatever. 2 out of 10, if you want to see a horror movie that is worth trying, try "Desecration", "Dead Waters" or "The Convent" (and it's the one with Adrienne Barbeau, by the way, not the one with John Malkovich).
