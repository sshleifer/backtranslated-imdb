Although the film starts well, but after half an hour, it gets boring and stupid, while the plot talks about Karen's pregnancy (that's the name of the girl, right?). <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is really nerdy and the characters really stupid. <br /> <br /> I do not know who is more stupid, if the girl came back because she came back with her old boyfriend or boy for the way it was used for her. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my conclusion is this: it's certainly not the best comedy of the 80s, but another film like many others that have nothing special . they keep this pregnancy thing and they are definitely ruined, so final conclusion: I do not like it.
