Maybe I do not understand well. I mean the movie. It does not make me happy or anything to do. Maybe because of my mood. Anyway, this one is a simple family film with children for actors. Just admit that - all movies of this type can not pass the barrier of 4 out of 10, no matter who plays in the film (for example, Antonio Banderas was playing in this kind of movies ... two or three of them do not remember the exact number). I was bored. I fall asleep almost because the subject is so clich√© and the acting was so predictable. But I'm sure my child will love this movie when he grows up ... Hey, I'm not a monster, I found hilarious or good moments in the movie. The owls in the movie were so cute. The trick with the painted police car windows and the shots that the kid received at the head by a golf ball ...
