Bad, bad, movie, so bad that it's worth watching. As long as you watch this film knowing it is bad and you spend 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are tacky and the animals look fake and the acting is bad, but it's a lot of fun watching the faces of the actors as they try to look scared. If your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo dragon, would not you do a little something to try to save her? If she were eating, would not you fall on your knees crying? This guy sat on a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. How anti-climatic is it? Maybe he was supposed to be in shock or something. He joins his sister in the belly of the komodo - oh did not want to spoil him for you.
