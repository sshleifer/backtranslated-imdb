KOMODO has never defeated the beautiful Jill Hennessey as a psych (!), But KvC is not as bad as I expected for a SYFY string quickie. Just watch it while you're drunk, stoned or trying to fall asleep. The unimaginative title says it all: a group of actors, mostly unknown, converge on an island where a government project to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. The giant creatures that came in contact with the vegetables invaded the island and ate everyone. So now, the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of the presence of its inhabitants. The acting is wonderfully atrocious, especially a moustached general straight out of the TV series THE INCREDIBLE HULK, but it's typical of this type of shielded cable. CGI creatures are TV-quality, which means you know you're watching cartoon monsters. However, two of the girls in the group are very cute and are worth watching because they run here and there in their tight little outfits. You just want to eat them!
