I only saw this film late last night. I remember the hype of his release and to be honest, if I had seen it at the time, I might not have been so generous. I hate the hype, it can ruin a movie. I think the movie is silent about the characters and puts too much emphasis on Woody. He was good too - though he wondered if he was stoned all the time. It has never been too deep. Redford was dark but not too much and his character dropped me at the end. For me, it should have been more confrontational with Half - throw her out maybe or tell her that she was paid. After all, he would have investigated them before making his proposal - this is not shown in the film, but nobody in his supposed state would have made an offer to anyone. He was cruel to the point of breaking them and the last straw was home and yet Demi fell in love with him? The passages giving a glimpse of the relationship between Demi and Woody were the best part of the film. There was a deep depth that overshadowed the superficiality of John Gages's character. He could have been much stronger and, as others have mentioned, I think the movie card was Redford and they did not want to tarnish his "image". I say what hell Robert was old in this movie! The characters in Woody and Demi were na√Øve in a way, but I think it was very intentional to lure you to their fate and defend their decision. But the reality is that they lost the house of their dreams and where did they go? Las Vegas? to play what little they have left and then accept a proposal from an incredibly wealthy billionaire. I found their naivety when Redford seduced them a little too unrealistic. The film could have been a lot more and other actors could have made the difference, but having said that, it was very nice on TV - it was nice and me, if you do not think about it - also acceptable
