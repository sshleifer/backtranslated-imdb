After seeing Shootfighter 1 and the buckets of blood they shed, I was ready for another exciting open-handed heart massage and chiropractic massage in a cage. But nooooooo, it looked like the Barney version of the first movie, with this karate kid lamer. At least Bolo Yeung continues to play booty, although he has to do more movies like Bloodsport and Caddyshack.
