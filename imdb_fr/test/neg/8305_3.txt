Small budget, but scary enough to hold your interest for another start in Frankenstein's familiar story. This film is also known as Dame FRANKENSTEIN. The seductive Tanya Frankenstein (Sara Bay), who has just completed her medical studies, arrives at her father's property and discovers that he is always up to his old tricks. Baron Frankenstein (Joseph Cotten) is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to continue the family tradition by making herself in love. It's more like a strange melodrama than a horror movie. The main cast is composed of Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux. A rainy night could amplify the atmosphere. Another fun watch.
