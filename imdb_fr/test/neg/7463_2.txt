The attic starts well. This somewhat monotonous story is greatly helped by the two main actors. A semblance of character study is underway, but the film deteriorates rapidly when Carrie Snodgress's character buys a monkey. Not one of those cute little monkeys. She buys a real big chimpanzee !!! <br /> <br /> This conspiracy device suddenly kills the film. It's just not an option for a woman like Snodgress, who has trouble doing anything because of her domineering father, to buy a chimpanzee from one day to the next. I mean, come on! Forget that!
