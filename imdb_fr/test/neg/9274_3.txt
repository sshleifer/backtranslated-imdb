The film has a good story, the action is good in some parts, but not all. Some parts, I felt just as if the bad guys would not have taken a dose yet, because of my experience of practicing martial arts. Some actions are long, as always mainly for the boss, but for the less important, they were killed or hit by a few shots, but some were quite unrealistic or could have done a better job. <br /> <br /> The least important actors or stuntmen were the good choices for the movie, my girlfriend started having a crush on them, she started watching the movie more than she does her time with me. <br /> <br /> The film is good, that's all I can say.
