MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS For about four years I have been a big fan of Ali G. Sacha. Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and, in my opinion, his best creation is Borat, as funny as hell and shamelessly. in what he does and tells people. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie. I did not bother to pay to see this at the movies; I guess because I did not expect much, but when I recently started the DVD, I found it all sad. Ali's best part of removing the mickey from the others was largely missing and the scenario of a plot was rather horrible; hang all the car batteries together to blow a safe - REALLY !! ?? <br /> <br /> This movie shows that some things can take too long and do not translate on the big screen. The film also had that syrupy and sweet end that I'm entitled to expect from British movies. Where have all the good ideals of British cinema gone? That said, there were some very entertaining moments, such as the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's audience with SM the Q with the remark "Shaven Haven - RESPECT". <br /> <br /> So, in summary, I'm a Ali G and Borat's fan and I enjoyed several of his interviews (including Anita Roddick from The Body Shop), but this film is fell flat with me. If there is another movie, I hope it's a lot better than this lot of old guts. <br /> <br /> Weasel100 <br /> <br /> Canberra, Australia
