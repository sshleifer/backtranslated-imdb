"Quintet" is certainly not a film that most people would find amusing or even interesting in this respect. There is no development of stage, dialogue, actor or conspiracy to ignite a spark. The frozen world is one thing, but the confusing plot is something you really can not stand. The characters are not only three-dimensional, they are not even one-dimensional, there is no emotion and nothing makes sense. There is a world locked in the ice, where no one does important work, except playing Quintet, and the rules of the game are never left behind. Houses are not heated, even if there is electricity, but who and what is the product? There is wood, but there are no animals except dogs, so where do the clothes and shoes come from, since there is apparently no industry and everyone is dressed as in the 16th century in Europe, which contrasts strangely with the not so futuristic backdrop of the pavilion. The whole film seems stuck in Altman's imagination, and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with the audience. Desolation or despair have nothing to do with the unattractiveness of this film, the world of George Lucas's "THX1138" is not a brighter place and the characters are no longer fun, but the story has his way. In Quintet, there is no obvious path or even avoided, and in my opinion it does not even cause a reflection on the idea behind all this, like for example a similar film, "Zardoz" by John Boorman. It's not even in Altman's unique style, so it does not appeal to his fans either, and I'm one of them. All in all, Robert Altman had a dream and he woke up without telling anyone what it meant, not even for him.
