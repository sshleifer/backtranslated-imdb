Do not waste your time. One of those cool-looking boxes you pick up on Blockbuster with intuition, but do not even bother. You will not say, "It's so bad, it's good." Just, "it's bad." The greatest American hero is a writer who rents a cabin on an African island called Snake Island. Other tourists are on the boat that drops it, but they do not stay on the island. They stop there to drop the author. Then, the boat is blocked at this place and, as the Hollywood originality shows, the only radio of the island is extinguished. So they start walking around and see a group of snakes. Like hundreds of them, which became really annoying and you knew that the plot would go nowhere. It's not like there was never a main snake. Like a giant mutated snake or an extremely toxic king of all snakes. Instead, there is just a group of ham snakes and egger of all kinds of breeds. Their only goal was to escape the island ... instead of having to defeat the enemy. Because there were so many snakes, you knew they could not try to kill them all, and they did not try. I saw a similar movie in which a town was haunted by snakes and all the snakes led into a cave before exploding. At least, we have the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and that it was a normal end. In Snake Island (by the way, every character was shocked to see snakes on the island ... duhhhhh, it's NAMED Snake Island for a reason), there was no plan other than trying to make fill up on gas for this stupid boat. Oh, they never do gasoline in passing. They "just arrived" to find another boat on the already gassed island.
