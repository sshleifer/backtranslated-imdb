I'm glad I did not pay to see 'The Wog Boy'. <br /> <br /> I was sitting there, hoping for something original and / or funny to happen. <br /> <br /> It reminded me a lot of these predictable English comedies of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> I will not bother with a summary of the plot, I suggest you to do something else for 90 minutes <br /> <br />
