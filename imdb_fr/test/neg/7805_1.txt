I saw this film (unfortunately) because it was the only option at that time and because David Zucker was the director. I saw his previous "Naked Gun" (both parts), Airplane and Top Secret!, And I enjoyed, at least, I had fun and laughed. I'm not saying that the films I mentioned were masterpieces, but were OK. I do not remember any other stupid movie than this one. It's amazing how the Hollywood industry is in complete decay. If a studio is spending money to produce this dreadful image, it is not surprising that this type of story is more common these days. This clearly reflects a decadent civilization where stupid sex symbols and plots are produced to entertain ordinary people. I have nothing good to say about this movie. If you are thinking of renting or buying it, please do not waste your money or time, avoid it anyway. Even if you're a fan of one of the actors, it's not worth it. In fact, this could be a very good example of what an administrator should avoid. I will never see a Zucker movie again. (He plans to direct the fourth sequel to Scary movie, imagine that!). Pathetic. Terrible.
