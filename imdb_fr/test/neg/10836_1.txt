Killer Flood: The day the cursed broke: 1/10: Finally a film whose title is anti-spoiler. Even because of the poor standards of disaster films, I'm sorry to allow me to correct myself, even because of the low standards of movies designed for television disasters, it's really awful. Where do I start? <br /> <br /> The dam modeler may have already seen a picture of a dam, but I doubt it. Most of the dams, especially the larger ones that produce electricity, have oh, I do not know any power plant nearby, a few valves for the passage of water, even a high-voltage electric wire or two . <br /> <br /> The dam is also a bit understaffed. Two, count them, two employees occupy all the dam, the three shifts of work. And the employees would have apparently been imported from a World War II film mounted on clich√©s because they heroically and rather needlessly had long praise for death scenes accompanied by pictures of their floating grandson. Heck one of them managed to get shot by the dam himself in a way that defies description. <br /> <br /> The special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on photos of the city using a method that gives a sixties Godzilla movie the appearance of the matrix. A three-year drawing with a blue pencil on the film would have given better results. Since the disaster, the money shots are worthless, how is the rest of the film? <br /> <br /> Needless to say that the scenario and the actors play follow the special effects. It's not a rough diamond. It's rough. So is it a guilty pleasure? Killer Flood is horrible enough to arouse a few laughs and the movie itself has that incompetence that makes it a good cult classic, but disaster movies have to age like a good wine. (Avalanche, The Swarm, Meteor) It is also doubtful that Michelle Green hiding from the flood in a dumpster with a golden retriever is at the height of the great Henry Fonda who is skinned by raisins supposed to be killer bees . Come back with me in 2024.
