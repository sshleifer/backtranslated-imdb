Directed by Albert Pyun in his inimitably awful but strangely hypnotic style, "Crazy Six" is another crown jewel for the high-end hugo haas (jess franco?) of this decade. Overdirection "styled", incoherent plot, dead time in the middle of action sequences for eurodisco torch performances, all this seems to be a striking feature for our man Pyun. The most interesting is the way he always gets first rate actors, compared to Wynorski or some other video directors. Ice-T, Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, and the weird Burt Reynolds is not a bad cast, although they often look a little confused. Discover "Postmortem", "Mean Guns" and "Omega Doom" for more first-rate Pyun heckling!
