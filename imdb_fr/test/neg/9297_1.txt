The comedy? What's so funny about a hideous alcoholic who attends 6 sessions (at the moment I turn him off) of anonymous anonymous? Leave with a lamentable writing of grunts and mumbles and drunken sloulings. One editor mentioned Tea Leone's "insolent dialogue" - well, I managed to watch almost an hour of this boring film and I've never seen a fool before - In fact, my grandmother 80-year-old has more fun returns than Tea's character in this garbage. The tea has a stony face and shows less emotion than Keanu - in fact, one wonders if she too is not addicted to something - maybe her botox has a woody face? Save yourself from being bored by this movie.
