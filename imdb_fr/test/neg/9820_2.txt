I guess the rave reviews on this page are from people who have never read the book. Unfortunately for those of us who love the text, Hollywood has outdone itself by destroying this one. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure Where the woman's love came from, except that she had replaced the cat, or why our Rogue Male had acquired a family that was useful to Blighty - In fact, the vast majority of the book has been cut out and replaced with your usual cruddy love story. The ambiguity about the world leader who was in his sights was completely removed and our thief got a name (none of them appeared before the second book). <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 rather than a 1 simply because of wonderfully bad cockney accents. Joan Bennett surpasses Dick Van Dyke by Mary Poppins for several miles, which is a tiny way to save him. <br /> <br /> Oh well - the British should probably avoid that. Believe me :)
