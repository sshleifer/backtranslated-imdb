Even the Beatles did not know how to write songs that would please everyone, and although Walter Hill is not serious, he has nothing to envy to stimulating action movies. The 1990s came and the music and the cinema changed social platform, the emergence of the rapper turned movie star was in full swing, the acting was relegated to the background in the regional accent and the transparent action game of each. It was one of the many films on the ice that I saw as a child and that I liked, but I looked at them later and we went back. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firefighters who have a basic life until a flaming tenant about to go up in flames gives a card with gold implications. I give it to Walter to quickly and cleanly define the main characters and their location. But I blame everyone involved for achieving Lame-o performance. Ice-t and Cube must have been scorching at that time and, although I enjoyed their career as rappers, in my opinion, they fell flat in this movie. It's about ninety minutes of a guy who ridiculously turns his back on the other to the point of being locked up in several states of disbelief. Now it's a movie, it's not a documentary, so I will not waste my time telling all the stupid twists of this movie, but they were numerous and did not get anywhere. I felt when I looked at it that everyone on the set was confused and just playing at random. Two things still appeal to me: one concerns a scene with a needle and the other is Sadler's enormous 45 pistol. In the end, this film is like a pizza of dominoes. Yeah I'll eat it if I'm hungry and I do not want to cook, but I'm well aware that it tastes like shit. 3 stars, meh.
