Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotyped role as a mountain man (probably the Ozarks) who goes hunting with his favorite dog. However, the dog seems to drown when Hunnicutt succeeds him. It soon becomes clear that, despite the fact that Hunnicutt and his dog are wandering after leaving the water, they are dead in the water - no one reacts when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his death and the one of the dog. Yet, curiously, Hunnicutt is REALLY slow and it takes him a while to understand that they are talking about him! I think this was done as padding because there was really not enough material to fill the half hour slot. <br /> <br /> Later, during the "surprise surprise", he falls on Heaven less his conception of the place. He is invited, but since they do not allow dogs, he has other ideas! Overall, reasonably well done, but of dubious spiritual value! Without twists or irony, this episode is a little boring - not enough for "Twilight Zone-y" for my taste.
