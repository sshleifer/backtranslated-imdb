A hold-up film with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne ... it sounds good on paper? I guess it had to be done when a green light lit the production of this film but the final product is terrible! just seems to be hanging out. I could feel my life spinning and I was sure there was something better that I should have done ... any painting to look at drying somewhere maybe? I'm a big fan of Jean Reno, but what was he thinking when he signed up? There are so many other great action movies in the area ... go watch one and let this movie be better forgotten.
