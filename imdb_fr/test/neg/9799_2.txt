The Feast of Flesh begins at Miami Airport. Dan Carter's reporter (Harry Kerwin, credited production designer) phones his friend Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to inform him that he has just returned from South America, where he investigates Carl. Schuman (Doug Foster) and he was on a big story but while talking on the phone, he is stabbed in the back and killed. Schuman met with Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, who also produced the executive), recently out of a psychiatric facility, and discuss their gruesome plans together. The news of Cater's death came to Casey and he decides to go back to history and investigate. In fact, he asks his secretary Viginia Day (Marth Mischon) to conduct most of the investigation and report to him, damn whore. Virginia informs Casey that they have inside a person named Kristine (Heather Hughes) since Dr. Frederick rents his spare rooms to nurses. Kristine reports to Casey about Schuman and Dr. Frederick's youth restoration experiments involving human flesh and specially cultured worms. ... <br /> <br /> Co-written, co-produced and directed by Brad F. Grinter Flesh Feast is a pretty poor movie in every way. First, let's start with the scenario of Grinter & Thomas Casey, who was also responsible for cinematography (you get the impression that most of the actors and the team have more than one job), it is at terrible background. The characters are one-dimensional idiots and have no personality, I did not like anyone in this movie. For what it's worth, I like some of the ideas here, the flesh-eating maggots, the basement lab, the stolen corpses in a hospital, and that unforgettable "twist" that almost deserves to be in the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, the dialogue is so badly written, the rigid and artificial sound is wrong, I mean, there is a scene in which a nurse says she "will not let us out of the house", which is fine, other than the fact that she is talking EXTERIOR in the garden for someone. No thought has been put into history, no explanation having been given as to why flesh-eating maggots are able to restore youth. at that moment, what seems to me that those who wrote this had no idea! Even with an extremely short time of 68 minutes, Flesh Feast is very slow and boring, the poor quality of editing does not help the scenes and plans for too long. For example, there is a scene in which an ambulance stops in front of a hospital. Up to the doors, the guy goes out, goes to the back doors and opens them, and so on. etc. Do we really need to see all the details? There is also another sequence in which Dr. Frederick enters the room and puts on gloves, then removes them in the opposite room and puts in another pair! Personally, I think Grinter probably did not shoot enough film, so he extends each scene as much as possible to save time. I like this bizarre ending though, I really like it. Technically, the flesh feast is a complete crap, I'm not sure of the budget, but it must have been small, very small. Almost all of the film takes place in one house, Dr. Frederick's lab consists of a table, plastic beakers and test tubes, old-fashioned electronic medical equipment, and a strange screen with colors. fun (do not ask). The cinematography is mediocre, the music is nil and the whole film looks dubbed, badly doubled too. The operating elements are also disappointing, there are some shots of larvae but they are actually squirming a little, there is a brief scene where a corpse is sawing the leg and a dismembered corpse and hanging pretending OK hooks. The acting is horrible on everyone's part, and I mean really bad, which makes the dialogue even worse. Do yourself a favor and avoid Flesh Feast, yes, there are one or two unintentionally unintentional moments and this end is, although for the least unique, but most of the time it is a true amateur movie which quickly becomes painful to watch. I doubt that most people will get by in one sitting. I can tolerate just about anything, but I even considered turning it off. Certainly one to avoid, you'll be happy to have done it and if you really have to see it, do not say you're not warned!
