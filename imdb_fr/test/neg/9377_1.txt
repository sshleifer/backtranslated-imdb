It's the only movie I can think of where, once finished, I was seething with the waste of money and time that it took on myself and all those involved in it. No wonder Alan Moore refused to meddle with V for Vendetta (a phenomenal movie) after this debacle. <br /> <br /> It's not bad for entertainment, like Showgirls. It's bad in a way that makes you want to scratch your eyes. Draw holes the size of a planet. The worst script in memory. Horrible actor of decent actors. Pictures that should be great, but somehow flop. <br /> <br /> It could have been so good ...
