As a big fan of the three TV series, I was very interested to hear that LoG was on the big screen. In my most honest moments, however, I had doubts about the likely success of the concept and the writers' ability to maintain the high level of spirit, comedy and horror that permeates the original series. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my fears were not unfounded and the film was a huge disappointment. I can not understand the other comments on this site. It is obvious that people are entitled to their opinions, but the guys I watched with me all agree with me and they are just as fans as me. <br /> <br /> The cast of actors lacked conviction, but they are so good that even when they are not at their best, they are still very observable. The main problem was the plot - and the script. There was some laughter, but not enough, a few moments of disgust, but not enough. The worst was the feeling of emptiness after going out of the cinema. It's rarely uncommon for me to feel as uninspired by a film and as unmotivated as discussing it with other people. <br /> <br /> I'm writing this comment to warn other fans of the league - get a wide range of opinions on this movie before going to see it. If you like League, you may be able to convince yourself that they have not totally ruined their stay at the cinema. If you can not convince yourself, then you will have tainted in your mind the otherwise spotless genius that illustrates the television series. <br /> <br /> LoG at the cinema? More like newspaper. (or small brown fish).
