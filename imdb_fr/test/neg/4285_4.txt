4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> A somewhat incredible story with "shocks" like haunted house that really do not fit in the skin. <br /> <br /> Gary Oldham's performance is very erratic ... not so much the quality of the performance as the consistency. His character does not behave consistently. Sometimes calm / relaxed / methodical / thoughtful, sometimes violent / loud / almost crazy. It's just not credible. <br /> <br /> Do many 80s movies have a bad date? Will they be better in 20 years? <br /> <br />
