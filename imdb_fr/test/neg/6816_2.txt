"Dogmatic", as another reviewer has described, this film is an appropriate word. The director's idea was to present Bach without intrigue, acting, entertainment, theatricality, dialogue, narration or theater. Mission accomplished, Mr Straub. "Pretentious?" Yes. "Cinematic?" No way. It's anti-cinema. Nobody moves. Almost no one speaks. The camera retains static images for 10 to 12 minutes at a time: very occasionally, the camera switches unnecessarily. You can see the fingers of Gustav Leonhardt move on the keys. That's it. <br /> <br /> If you like the idea of ​​looking at the back of a harpsichordist's head for 7 minutes in a row while listening to Bach, this film is for you. I prefer to listen to Bach on my stereo with my eyes closed.
