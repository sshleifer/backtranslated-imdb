Tom and Jerry transport goods by plane to Africa. But as they are white, they fear not to be safe, so they put a black face to fit in. Once they wear it, they adopt the black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters. They hit the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft. Before reaching the mainland, they suffer the advances of an overly affectionate octopus and the more serious dangers of sharks, swordfish and whale. Once on earth, they are frightened by fantastic creatures and hide in a cave. Inside, it's even worse when they meet living skeletons with black faces. And at the exit of the cave, things are even worse than when they are discovered by cannibals. <br /> <br /> "Plane Dumb" is a particularly neglected effort by Van Beuren studios. An example: a lion, unknown to Tom and Jerry, enters the cave before them. But the animators must have forgotten, because the lion never appears again. Another example is the end which is not an end: it is just an arbitrary stop. <br /> <br /> According to a YouTube poster, the design "was originally intended to present the voices AND cartoons of a famous team of comedians" Negro "known as Miller & Lyles. But Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the end of the recording session and co-directors John Foster and George Rufle were forced to turn the animation into a "Tom & Jerry" story. "/> They should not have disturbs. Coarse animation and poorly executed gags make the film a loser from beginning to end.
