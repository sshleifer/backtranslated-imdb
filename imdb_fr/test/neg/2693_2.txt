I have been a lover of Shakespeare since childhood. I am also a Jew. Merchant of Venice is anti-Semitic, no matter how scholars and literature buffs try to reinterpret it. <br /> <br /> In the play, Shylock is portrayed as a demon and a cold heart and has no forgiveness. , no heat, no love except for money and cruel revenge, while Christians are kind and moral. His motivations in the room revolve around money (he plans his revenge from the beginning based on the damage done to his business as well as blind racial hatred), and not on noble ideals or an attack on pride. racial, as this movie wants. And this characterization is given to him by Shakespeare himself, not by other characters. As a final proof, the happy end is when the Jew loses his money and is forced to convert to Christianity. <br /> <br /> I recognize it and move on to something else. That's part of the story and I like Shakepeare despite that fact. Therefore, I expect a movie based on this game to play it directly. I would much rather see the work adapted for its rich language and unbleached story. <br /> <br /> But a lot of subtleties and playful characters of the bard are lost in this film. For example, in the last scene where men discover Portia's undercover work as a man who also took their rings, instead of the playful play of words and misunderstandings as the truth unfolds, he becomes a a mean game where two bitches play cruelly with their future husbands. <br /> <br /> All we have left are beautiful detailed sets, fragments of the rich language with a mediocre reinterpretation, a mediocre cast, an intense controversy scene. <br /> <br /> The truth is that I think it would be much easier to identify antisemitism in history and move on to something else if left alone. Despite all the hardships that those responsible for this film have removed from their hats, there is still a lot of hatred, only now can people find excuses and pretend that the representation of the Jews is no longer so bad. <br /> <br /> And finally, most actors are misclassified. Pacino is out of his league and is very uncomfortable with the language, not to mention his horribly false accent. Fiennes like Bassanio is without charm and clumsy with the tongue. Irons is reliable as always but does not do much with his role. Portia is a little OK but not very appreciable and covered with a bad makeup, just like the film.
