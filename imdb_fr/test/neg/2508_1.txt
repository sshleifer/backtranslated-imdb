this movie is incredibly horrible! everything was hogwash. you can not say anything good about this film, the actor, the scenario, the staging, the effects are all as bad as the others. even ed wood could have done a better job than that. I seriously recommended staying away from this movie unless you want to lose about 100 minutes of your life or whatever the length of the movie. I forget. This is the first time I write a comment on a movie on IMDb, but this film was just on television and I had to let the world know that this film sucked balls !!!!!!! !!!!! so if you have the slightest decency in you. go rent a much better bad movie like critters 3
