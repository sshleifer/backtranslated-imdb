"The Duke" is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy where an old duke (John Neville) dies and to avoid his great property and the immense wealth that will be removed after the death two devious aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie Heyman) ; he passes his duke to his dog. The "best friend" of the dog, an American named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper), whose parents die, becomes orphaned by the former duke because he is his great uncle. A young chef, Florian, arrives, with him and Charlotte, thus creating a romantic sub-plot which, in its way, serves as a basis for the main plot, namely the activities of Hubert, the "Duke" and his numerous activities and interests of love with other dogs. All this is overseen by James Doohan who plays the role of a determined butler trying to serve his former duke by doing his best to serve his new master, Hubert. Doohan plays the role of the older character who comforts and counsels the youngest as he examines and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. A beautiful comic performance mixed with dramatic elements ending the career of an influential and influential actor. <br /> <br /> Even if, from a technical point of view, I do not like this film, I only watched it during the discovery of the role of James Doohan. Although the plot is good, some elements of writing and directing must be obscured. Ignoring the absurdity of a "Duc Doggie", I personally do not really like the use of comic and scandalous jokes about "bad" characters because of their ridicule. The dependence on humor related to hygiene, as you wish, is much too apparent and the general stupidity of many characters does not attract me. The director, Phillip Spink, too often uses half-length shots with a layered voice or affecting the overall sound quality. In addition, the role play of Muirhead and Heyman, although gifted for dramatic and romantic sequences, is too short to meet the general requirements of the role. <br /> <br /> But, as a mature moviegoer, I find myself too critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh. I can admit that I found some fun elements and other elements touching, as well as a complicated scenario, but which has undeniable links. I do not recommend this movie to mature movie lovers, but I highly recommend it to dog lovers, families who want to enjoy a fun movie for their child and James Doohan fans who want to see "Scotty" in his role final.
