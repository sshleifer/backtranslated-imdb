First, how can a creative person believe in a film like this? I saw this film and, after a few hours, I scratched my head. What is the director trying to say? <br /> <br /> If it's a thriller, there's no chills, no action, no action. action except a chase sequence, there is no drama, and the vaunted love story never takes off. No passion, no emotion is there. <br /> <br /> In fact, I never expected marvels from the film, but after the exceptional opening of this film, I thought to give it a chance. I have no problem with Himesh Reshamiya, and I am not one to criticize him on every occasion. I came in with an open mind and came out with a closed mind. <br /> <br /> Do not blame Himesh Reshamiya, he's just a beginner actor. But the direction, the script, the writing, the makeup, everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Himesh is very steep and it would take a long time to cross the curve. He can do that kind of role. Hansika is just a kid, and it shows on the screen with her baby fat and the way she walks. <br /> <br /> The only actor who was good was Himesh's friend in the movie, I do not know his. name, but he looks promising. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk, not even good to watch for a while. <br /> <br /> ** We strongly recommend that you avoid this movie. . **
