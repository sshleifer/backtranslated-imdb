what ugly film, took me 3 times to finish it. What I disliked the most was the sense of infantile humor. jokes made by a 10 year old child. not funny. Boring enough, for example, when the detective can not make a place for himself at the bar, he shouts "she takes everything off" and then they all run "fast forward", a little mocking. so stupid. and also a guy sitting at the bar breaking fruit to solve his post-traumatic stress disorder. on the bar! and the bartender provides more and more fresh fruit. it's supposed to be funny? and I mean ... I like the good old movies of exploitation gores, and I've seen a lot of terrible movies, but his is just bad. and also the "gore" is not so exciting. does not bother you. I would not recommend it.
