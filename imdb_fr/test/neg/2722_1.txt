I am disgusted and dismayed by the positive reviews this film receives. Not only is it hokey, manipulative, and melodramatic. It's also a shameless offensive. The character of Radio 'Gooding Jr.' is paraded like a cute little pet, like a puppy so cute that you just want to take him home. This mentality is shameless. Radio is never treated as a human being, but as a means of manipulation to attract the sympathies of its audience. Even more atrocious are the many moments of the film, in which the radio is hit in the head / stumbles / falls / etc. These great comedy moments made the audience laugh just because "it's funny because the radio is delayed". It's shameless, I do not think the word "delayed" is at all an appropriate word to describe the mentally handicapped, but that seems to be the position taken by the film: "The radio is delayed, but it's not no problem, because he is cute and we like him ". Gooding's portrait seems more appropriate for a John Water film than for an inspiring family drama. To add insult to injury, the film is incompetent at all levels, Debra Winger is tasteless in the role of "stereotypical housewife" as the very reminder of her obnoxious monologues insights laugh to all who see the film. The Score of John Horner is a pure sap that always covers his score of a tired movie film. Ed Harris is decent in a role in which he could have slept, but manages to grab the public's attention throughout the film. In conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent human being, ignore this movie parody, read the book, but otherwise pass this film on an interesting character from American history.
