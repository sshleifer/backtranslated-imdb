If I remember the year 2006, one of the things I will remember most is the "Snakeamania" on the Internet for a film called Snakes on a plane. But, without my knowledge, there was a scam movie called DVD Snakes After seeing this, I feel at best like a movie B below normal. <br /> <br /> The plot: <br /> <br /> A husband and his wife get on a train to go to Los Angles, to get help from the uncle of the husbands who is a shaman. That's because the woman's family does not approve of her hurting her, so they cursed her that snakes will "become her". Thought with fourteen hours Drive to Los Angles and a group of passengers, including a former police officer from Narc and drug traffickers. Will they arrive in time before the snakes occupy it? <br /> <br /> View of the film: Firstly the effects: I must say that even if some scenes with smaller snakes look good, the main effects you have to wait eighty minutes to see! Are so sad that it completely kills all good memories of the movie (The film gives the impression that video games look like T2 next to that!) One of the things I noticed was that it There is no script credit on the film! and the directors make the film so anti-climatic that it ruins the whole film. Final view of the film: <br /> <br /> A sub-par B-movie, with an incredibly bad end.
