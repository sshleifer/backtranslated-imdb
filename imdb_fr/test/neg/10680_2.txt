As the main "character", Lillith Silver likes to emphasize - "you know everything about vampires". It is obvious that this statement was aimed at the actors and the technical team, who create an extremely bad image of everyone's favorite blood-sucking undead. According to the lost director, the vampires are all covered with a white foundation and piled in latex, like a piece of meat in a shrink wrap. With fangs resembling Bannana's and a bad case of asthma, our main character Lillith creates a wacky caricature of the "modern" vampire. <br /> <br /> The plot is a 9-year-old playstation collection for boys, written on a piece of paper, then mixed together to create this horrible story. Lillith, our pale protagonist, is a Vampire bounty hunter who makes a living by sweetening members of everyone's favorite cult, the Illuminati! Rather than incorporating the classic stealth-and-precision assassin method, Lillith slips through an open window and then sinks into the target's neck before shooting it blank with a handgun (which apparently , do not leave bullet holes). PC Plod is then tasked with solving the murders. He comes to the dismal and yet obvious conclusion that Lillith is actually a vampire. . Meanwhile, Lillith, who has a habit of punishing her boss, is upset when an old enemy kidnaps her and demands that a Ransom be delivered personally. As you can imagine, this is not going as planned. I will not let myself go to the pain of the following scenes however, so I will jump to the end. Lillith and her "nemesis" have a decisive battle. After winning, Lillith then discovers, with all the extravagance of someone who tells him he has cancer, that both are old lovers and that the entire plot was a kind of twisted game. Yes, that kick in the balls was the real end of the movie. To me, this concluding joke is the icing on the cake covered with latex and seals this movie in the vault "Never let's look at this". <br /> <br /> As far as cinematographic techniques are concerned, the film is content with not bothering to create a style. The director is trying to save his piece from the disaster by adding close-ups and a few multangular shots, but that's not the saving grace the film needs. <br /> <br /> You may be shouting "but it's a B movie, it's supposed to be shit!" I do not take pity, though. I have seen terrible B movies, such as evil dead 2, and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, and therefore, this shame can not hide behind an apology. The budget was low. This is evident from the lack of localization and good actors. Perhaps, however, if the director was more creative and spent less money on makeup and fake blood, he could have done something decent with this disgusting attempt. Shabby sex scenes are in no way beneficial and simply serve to give me some smiles to the obscene acting skills. Half of the budget must have been paid to women only for having the chance to get screwed by lesbians. If I had wanted to watch a vampire porn, I would have bought Muffy The Vampire Layer. <br /> <br /> The distribution is bad, the story is worse and the effects are extremely wrong. This film had potential, but its disgusting nuance and the embarrassing portrayal of a classic horror character served only for its loss. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh with some friends, I recommend you watch this mockery. If you're looking for a more serious action movie about vampires, try Blade or Underworld to quench your thirst for blood.
