In this overproduced musical drama, Julie Andrews satirically insists on her own image of nothingness, but if she approaches her role with aplomb, she is the only one to do it. Blake Edwards' film about a woman who is both a music hall artist and a German spy during the First World War does not know what tone to look for, and Rock Hudson has the ungrateful task of playing a second romantic violin. Musicals had become too popular in 1970 and elephantine productions like "Star!" and this movie really tarnished Andrews' reputation, leaving a lot of dead space in his catalog until "The Tamarind Seed" appeared. I always thought that Julie Andrews would have been a big bad guy or a crazy woman. her powerful voice could really attract attention, and she produces low notes that can be imposing or seductive. Husband / Director Edwards seems to be aware of this, but neither he nor Julie can work a lot of energy in this scenario. Screenwriter William Peter Blatty is not a good partner for Edwards, and no man has his heart in this material. Beatty's script offers Andrews a single fabulous sequence: a striptease. * 1/2 of ****
