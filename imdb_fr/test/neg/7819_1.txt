Ever wanted to see how much a movie could flow? Well, look no further! This film has everything! <br /> <br /> Jokes about racism, jokes for the disabled, jokes about being overweight, jokes about suicide, jokes about murder, jokes about drugs, jokes about animal consumption, jokes about dirt, old jokes about the old man, jokes about cancer, jokes jokes, shit, jokes on the face, jokes about the blood, jokes about rape, jokes about alcohol abuse, jokes about alcohol abuse , jokes about the anal eruption, a group of people pinging their coffee, jokes about nudity, see who can say the most sworn words in a scene of jokes, lesbian jokes, jokes about the abuse of girlfriends, and the list goes on and on! <br /> <br /> The worst thing is: none of this is funny! (It's not just anyone who finds most of these fun at first.) It seems that when it can not be worse, it pushes your expectations to a whole new background, because it always seems to find another one so that the spectator feels good. worst. There was a scene that almost made me vomit and almost completely depressed at the same time. I do not think I need to specify which, but again, I'm sure there are other scenes that will give people the same feeling. <br /> <br /> There was a moment at the end of the film that made sense and was a bit realistic when, suddenly, one of the characters of the scene ended up with the ugliest remains of a garbage bag and thrown several feet on the ground before having a bunch of beer bottles stuck in his head. All this probably when he deserved it the least. So, all the thought of a redemption of 1 point more was quickly considered. It's really a terrible movie. It's a school that needs to be studied and divided into two equal parts in a film school to teach students what not to do.
