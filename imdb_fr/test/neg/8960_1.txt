This film is awful, I'm sorry. I bought this to get Star Worms, and I was expecting it to be better after my disappointment with Star Worms. Oh, I'm kidding, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting is hogwash, not that it really exists, and the main character is a big stupid box that gets attacked by stuff, stuff or something. I can not really say. The special effects are so serious that you can not even see the dinosaurs at war, who do not go to war, but stand and somehow move their mouths, or whatever. The film is a headache. It is very obvious that the director is trying to establish a universe. Hahahahahahahaha ... Really, this movie is simply abominable, even by Troma standards. The only good thing I can say about this is that an intro from Lloyd Kaufman has been introduced, because it makes us once again look at something that is not fit for consumption.
