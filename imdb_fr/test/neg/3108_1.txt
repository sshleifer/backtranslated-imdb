Crazy Director .... Yeah, you have to be crazy to make a movie close. Rob Lowe was bad in his character, Ice-t is always bad and Burt Reynolds had nothing to do with the movie. Crazy Six is ​​an unknown movie, with famous actors ... it's pretty weird. A bad movie with good actors. Looks like the bad movie influenced their performance ... That's what happened! Crazy ..... I give it * and a half on *****
