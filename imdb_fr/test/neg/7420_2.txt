Developing films based on real events involving cryptozoology or the supernatural has always been a challenge for filmmakers and writers. You have to reconcile the reported stories, contradictory sources of information and Hollywood creativity to produce something that the public can discover. Unfortunately, for SASQUATCH, none of this seems to be happening. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a typical film noir when a search team lands on the plane, somewhere in the waterfalls. From there, the research team disappeared and, despite attempts by law enforcement and local relief workers, they are still missing. As one of the passengers walks, infrared-like images appear on the screen (like the Predator), which subtly suggests that the legendary Sasquatch is behind the fate of the passengers. <br /> <br /> Cue Harlan Knowles (Henriksen), CEO of BioComp Industries and father of one of the victims of the accident. Knowles sets up its own search and rescue team with the explicit mission of finding his daughter and the rest of the research team, as well as the valuable technology lost in the accident. <br /> <br /> After Knowles Custom Rescue The team is reunited, the whole film follows colorless characters, a dizzying cinematography and a completely original plot. I literally had to stop myself from falling asleep during this film that was trying to scare me. Henriksen is the only member of the cast that has won, which does not compensate for the lack of depth presented by all the other characters. The excessive sound effects were also annoying; Basically, I did not know if I was watching a movie about the Bigfoot or the grizzly bear. <br /> <br /> The plot was not very beautiful either. It was too underdeveloped, because the viewer is mainly subjected to a music of terror typical of everything that looks like the genre. Clearly, it was not necessary to be a genius to know who was undressing in the middle of the film or who would be the first unlucky soul to get hurt by Mr. Sasquatch. As for the positives, there are none, so I gave this movie a 2 out of 10.
