It's hard to believe that such a bad movie could actually come out. The dialogue was not natural. The relationship between the boy and his future father-in-law was particularly poor. I imagine you could say that they managed to create an embarrassing dialogue, but what was said seemed fake and artificial. The suspense was just not there. The music was about as bad as possible. The only reason I watched this movie was because I lived in the Death Valley area and was curious to know which places would be displayed on the screen. Fortunately, the film was on television so I did not lose money to praise this excuse for the movie! Honestly, I think most fans could develop a more captivating scenario than the one presented here. It's a pity that the time of a film crew was lost in such garbage! I guess the only positive thing I can say about the movie is that some of the landscapes were beautiful.
