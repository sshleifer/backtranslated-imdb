Ha ha - oh no - what about this movie? Yes, green eggs and ham make more sense than this movie. Where do we start? Many good things have already been said - so I will not divulge on the same territory. I think you already have the movie summary. I will not paraphrase the film. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with good. <br /> <br /> 1). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (like me), the first 29 minutes of this movie will be for you - it's one of those movies that illustrates the question you've always talked about during your long car rides when you were a child like (And if you had to choose a family member alive, another to die, or if you had to die by drowning or fire) This film is a very good concept - end result. <br /> <br /> 2) The wardrobe group did a good job of bringing us back to the 70s. In fact, how difficult is it to accomplish? ..... Ok, that's about all for good. Let's talk about evil. <br /> <br /> 1). This film looks like a 2-hour episode "Twilight Zone". It could easily be 90 minutes. It might have made the film tolerable. <br /> <br /> 2). Do you remember in the movie "From Dusk til Dawn?". The film started interestingly, then halfway through, it just took a degrading turn? Yes, the same thing here. I would venture to say that the authors started with a concept, so they did not know what to do with it. I had a deeper reflection on the provocation of Transformers 2. <br /> <br /> 3). Yes, we have the dilemma in the movie. We understand the philosophical nuances and the utilitarian approach - but the story has jumped too far, it has not explained in detail the current arc, and has taken a direction (forgive me) completely insulting. <br /> 4). The end did not make sense. Not at all. No. <br /> <br /> This film would be an excellent term for the College 101 philosophy. If you're not sleeping, if you're sick in bed, or if you've ever loved being hit in the face with a pie, and can view it for free online - by all means, go for it. <br /> <br /> If you have to pay something to see this movie, do not waste your time - you'd better watch old Howie Mandel standing on You Tube. You will get more philosophical stimulation by rearranging your sock drawer.
