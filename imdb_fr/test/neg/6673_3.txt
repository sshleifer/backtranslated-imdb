Czech cinematography travels through dark times ... this film is tangible proof. Slama obviously wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictional characters, characteristic of their stupidity. A young and healthy boy who does not want to work and prefers to live in a decaying hut with a ruthless alcoholic aunt. Because of Tonik's idiocy, which has just announced "Dad, I will not work at the factory" (I really want to know WHY); I understand the state of his "house", but I really can not digest this horrible mess. Sentimentality cramped everywhere. Why did not Monika escort her boy to work abroad? Young Czech couples do it very often. And take someone else's children to live in a devastated barn ... it's too much. <br /> <br /> An irresponsible mother (badly de Geislerov√°), a naive and stupid boy (Tonik), a stupid and confused girl (Monika) ... Yes, someone has already said - a drama badly directed and badly played. Actors such as Martin Huba, Bolek Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simona Stasova did their best, but unfortunately could not save the whole play.
