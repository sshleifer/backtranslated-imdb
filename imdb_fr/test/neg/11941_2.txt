Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart play the lead role in a "romantic" drama featuring a suspended conductor played by Zeta-Jones, who ends up wearing for her niece when her sister is killed in a car accident. While taking care of the family problems, she is replaced by Eckhart. <br /> <br /> A cheeky narrative of maudlin, without any chemistry between the threads (she is a dead fish and he is fine, but not much). Looking at that, I was wondering why anyone would want to see this because the character of Zeta-Jones is so unfriendly. Come on, she's so obsessed with cooking and what she does best is cooking for her therapist or talking about food. Ugh. I will not use any of the many word games that come to my mind. I could not finish it.
