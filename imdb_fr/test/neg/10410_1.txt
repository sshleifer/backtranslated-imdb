I hope you are joking? The music was so strong in this show that I often could not even hear the dialogue. And the music was nothing great. Does anyone know what Jake's mother said when he walked in the door ??? And the cloud of mushrooms seemed very close to having so little instant devastation. Anyone who studies the effects of nuclear fallout before writing it. I felt like a group of sit-com actors sent on the spot and did not know what to do with a dramatic dialogue. And what does a Kansas teenager know about shopping in Soho ... could not we have had a better line here? I was bored to tears and I was awake only by the roar of the over-mixed way of loud music.
