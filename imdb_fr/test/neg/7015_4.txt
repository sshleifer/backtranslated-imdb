In 1967, I saw an exceptional musical at the Wintergarden in New York, where Angela Lansbury played the role of Mame. But did Hollywood give him the lead? No Lucille Ball as great as Lucy received the role. She killed the movie. What a mistake There was no chemistry like there was on the Bea Arthur and Angela scene what double when they sang .. It's a pity that a producer does not put these two together even today
