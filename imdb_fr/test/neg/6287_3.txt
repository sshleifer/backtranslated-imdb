Poor old Robert Taylor. Apart from THE FEDS, nothing went to him - this almost shocking is a 90 minute time waster and nothing more. It's one of those crime crime movies with the main character narrative all the way through - which is usually reserved for comedies nowadays, but this film is taken too seriously! Too bad Australian films, especially in the 2000-01 period, have been of exceptionally high quality overall, but I guess we have to miss a few. Why even make a film like this, it will obviously not be good?
