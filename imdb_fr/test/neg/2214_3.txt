It's pretty much one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. It may not be the worst candidate in the world, but if you have not seen so many bad movies, it could easily make your Top Ten Worst List. When you consider what was achieved in 1933 with the original "King Kong", you must wonder why someone would sink so low that it would produce this debacle. Then, going a step further and realizing that the quantum leap into "Star Wars" the following year reached a new level in science fiction animation, this offer will make you laugh and cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Now, let me ask you, what does the professor (Peter Cushing) have to bring an umbrella as the centerpiece of underground research equipment for the crossing to heart of the Earth? OK, so it was useful to repel the parrot / tyrannosaurus (parrotosaurus?) At first, but go. In one way or another, I do not think that's what Edgar Rice Burrough had in mind when he wrote his stories about Pellucidar. He probably did not think of Caroline Munro as Princess Dia, probably the only redeeming factor in the whole trip. <br /> <br /> At least one pseudo-scientific explanation kicked me. of; I am always looking for a movie in this genre. Thus the sky in the heart of the earth was really the underside of the earth's crust, explaining that pinkish ethereal glow. But try it as it should, the story could not find anything interesting about Hoojah the Sly or Jubal the Ugly One, let alone these wacky mid-man, half-pterodactyl creatures. . To paraphrase the good teacher - "You can not hypnotize me, I'm attentive!"
