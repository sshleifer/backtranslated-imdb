The production values ​​in this video are so low that they are impossible to watch. The performance took second place after the incredibly creative hijinks of the studio, with thirty special effects per minute. It is filmed through a cloud of smoke, lasting one to two seconds per shot and frequently, background projectors shine directly into the camera. The lighting was terrible for the shoot. There are constantly zoom in and out with a complete lack of visual continuity. There may be good dance available to the public, but the audience will never know it.
