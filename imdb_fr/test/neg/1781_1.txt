Even by the standards of most B-movies, this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen. The graphics are so mediocre that a man in a monster costume looks more realistic. the effects of seawater are particularly laughable, including the scene where they embark in the mini-submarine, and the "water" seems to be frozen on the spot. The problems with this film are so numerous that I will stop here with the details. Needless to say, I'm not kidding when I say that even Uwe Toilet Boll himself could do a better job. Avoid this movie at all costs, because there are other category B movies that, although they are horrible, are at least a good way to pass the time.
