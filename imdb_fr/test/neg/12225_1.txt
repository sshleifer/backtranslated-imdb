This is the worst movie I have ever seen. If I did not look at it for free, I would never have finished it. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. It seems like it's supposed to be a film in the vein of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a terrible movie, but 10 times better than this one), but failed miserably. The only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick. A guy falls, someone gets hit by a bus, etc. No idea is smart, it's the worst premise for a movie. The plot (or lack thereof) is completely delayed. The plot seems to be focused on the coach and his family, but there are so many other things in the movie that it's completely ridiculous. Terrible and terrible film.
