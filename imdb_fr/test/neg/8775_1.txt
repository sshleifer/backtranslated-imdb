Whatever the goal of the producer is, he has completely missed The Lone Ranger is not a camp, but the "icon" of benefactors worldwide. And it's a total violation of the spirit of the character that the only real Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, was banned from wearing his mask during his public appearances at the release of this film. <br /> <br /> Whelp, long story In short, the only saving advantage of this crude (and poorly made) distortion is that during that year, I had the honor of meeting Mr. Clayton Moore in Columbus as part of a tour resulting from the bad press caused by Mr. Moore's treatment. . It goes without saying that the character, integrity and presence of Mr. Moore far surpassed the film. <br /> <br /> Some things can not be done better. There is only one Langer Ranger.
