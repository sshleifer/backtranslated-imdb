While I watched the MST3K version of this film, but it is not really serious, at least compared to others who deserve my cinematographic hatred. <br /> <br /> The story is centered on a troubled girl wrongly sent to a "school reform" called Girls' Town. Along the way, races, redemption and (involuntary) madness occur. The story and the game are a little flat, just like the action. However, the whole thing is really fun to a certain extent if you are absolutely bored. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is just a 50s movie, but far from the worst movie of all time, with some bright spots in the movie (the Ave Maria sequence was good for me). <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to watch the MST3K version, you will not be disappointed. In itself, not so much, but I can think of worse methods of torture ("Spiker", that tempts you?).
