Follow these steps: Get a copy of this movie and a friend. Bet $ 10 to the friend that he can not sit still during this movie. They can not look away or be distracted by anything. Now watch your friend. Win or lose, you get 10 dollars of entertainment. <br /> <br /> It annoys me endlessly when people see a movie and do not hesitate to give one out of 10, or summarize their thoughts with "it sucks". (And when asked "Why?", They respond, "Just because." Arrgh.) That's why this movie exists. His only goal is that I say, "That's it, it's a horrible movie, it's 1 in 10!" <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely horrendous. <br /> <br /> While the recent trend of movie parodies has forced them to become more and more formulated, this film is missing in every respect. It's not funny. It's not funny. And for some of the parodies, it's completely inaccurate! Horrible actor. Dialogue little funny. A story without spirit. Terrible "special effects". One NAIL gag after another. And to make matters worse, there is not even free nudity that makes it stealthily valuable. <br /> <br /> This movie jumps over the idiot, stumbles over the idiot, and lands the first face to the moron. Even me, who loves a good movie "check your brains at the door", I found myself physically restless looking at this. This film is not even a "hard ticket for Hawaii" so terrible that it's bad ... IT'S JUST BAD. <br /> <br /> NOTE: In fact, I challenged a friend to look at this as described above. Not only could he not cross the race, but he had a headache and needed a few minutes later because he felt a little sick. A true story. <br /> <br /> I could not accent this note ... a resounding 1 out of 10!
