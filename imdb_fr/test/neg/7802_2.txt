Although The Twilight Zone was a magnificent sight, it was also very uneven - with some awesome episodes, ugly and a lot in between. Do not believe the unconditional - there were stinky and it was certainly one of them. <br /> <br /> In a plot that is obviously meant to be an attack on Fidel Castro, a close lookalike (Peter Falk (with lots of makeup and a beard) gets a magic mirror that allows him to realize all enemies in order to liquidate them, although I think that Castro is a thug and a dictator (and that tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will testify), it is amazing how much this kind of preached episode makes viewers laugh at US efforts to marginalize the scourge and Castro looks good !! Think about it - Serling and his company wanted to hurt Castro, but on the contrary appeared to be simply obvious, preached and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's really bad - almost ridiculously bad today.
