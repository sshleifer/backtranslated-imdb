Since I do not have a TV and I have never heard of this mini-series, I did not know what to expect from The Second Coming and I hired him only on the strength of his synopsis, which seemed interesting. <Br /> <br /> Dear God! (Any word games wanted.) If anyone had told me that it had been written by a class of thirteen-year-olds who had been entrusted with the project of turning the second entry into a play at school I would not have been surprised <br /> <Why, oh why did they decide to portray Jesus Christ II as what comes back to a learned idiot? Is there anything in the gospels that suggests this? Well, an ordinary guy, but a big north moron. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Apparently, all that Jesus did to impress people was his miracles, because according to this statement, his preaching would never have impressed anyone. Certainly, without the nightfall, Mr. Jesus Eccleston would have skated without a canoe, a paddle or any other type of follower. <br /> <br /> And the strange little gay controversies set up willy-nilly without rhyme or reason. Other than, of course, Russell hailing his QAF fan base. Jesus goes to the pub to recruit "disciples" (losers of the North more gormless and, of course, the reserve of the gay writer - the woman harpy, crap, crap, snarling). The rights of homosexuals are of no use to him, almost as if Russell thought he "owed the guys to put Jesus in the limelight." <br /> <br /> I can not really see the real Jesus coming out with "Well, I have nothing against that personally, man." Only someone in the middle class and woolly could imagine that Jesus was as wet as that. <br /> <br /> And do not throw me in the end. "Please come in and eat rat poison, because if God dies, the only way to stay truly free is to do it." <br /> <br /> It was like a drawing by Eddie Izzard of God as Bill Gates. "Hello, I'm Bill Gates, and now you've just made me understand that my global domination restricts your style, I'll give you everything, my clients." And eat the rat poison, of course. <br /> <br /> I am often confused by the ratings given on IMDb, but the high rating given to it takes the cookie. <br /> <br /> Never pay attention to Jesus for the new millennium - it's Jesus for brainless MTV boys. <br /> <br /> God really helps us.
