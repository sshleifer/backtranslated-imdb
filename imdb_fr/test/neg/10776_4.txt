I seem to disagree with a lot of people here. but I really did not find this film as brilliant as the critics I read. It was undoubtedly a touching story and the bottom of the score offered the possibility of an epic. but the movie was disappointing. especially for the neon that saw 'gadar'. Despite the main role played by Sunny Deol and the incessant songs, I must say that the gadar is the best of both. the story is almost the same. score did not succeed in creating a depth in his characters as well as in the scenes supposed to have an impact. looking at kristin kruek's accent and small image, which in itself was not an easy job. the characters just did not seem too real. not that I criticize the act of one of the principal. it just did not work. the atmosphere was well prepared, but the film was really lacking substance. not that I'm a fan of rambo, but some cudists have seen the film, or have developed characters. it seemed like a rush to the end. and the end only added to the dissatisfaction of viewers. <br /> <br /> Not to say that, I have to say it was at least a good effort on the part of the director. and if you have not seen gadar, then you even love him.
