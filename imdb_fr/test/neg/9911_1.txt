This film is something horrible. I laugh all the time. I had to stop in some scenes because my mother thought it was not polite to laugh when people died, but in this film, even death looks ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked by a single tornado. <br /> <br /> The explosions of cars thrown at the buildings by the forces of the wind resemble those of the old-school R-Type game called "Scroller". The dialogues are very bad and I'm interested to see how they managed to persuade some actors to play in this movie. It's just amazing how such a bad movie can go on television. <br /> <br /> The only real reason to watch this movie is to have fun with nonsense and nonsense.
