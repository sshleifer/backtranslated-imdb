"TNT Jackson" is not completely unassailable. But either the version I saw on DVD was mounted with a weeder, or the scenario itself is the lowest level of sausage Grind-house / Blaxploitation. Or maybe both. <br /> <br /> Jeanne Bell is supposed to be a playmate at some point in her career, and the movie makes the most of the connection by displaying her breasts at least twice as much as was really needed ( including a hilarious topless fight scene which, I'm sure, had to be funny). I will admit that they are very kind. Despite everything, she has a medium appearance and does not have the charisma of a Foxy Brown, or even a Cleopatra Jones. She did have her acting moments in the movie, but it would have been nice if the director had pushed her a bit harder or if the screenplay had given her a chance to do more than emotional "attitude" and to hit others. Speaking of kicks, the fight scenes (the other reason to watch a movie like this) are pretty badly done. There is no real choreography to talk about here, just people who pose and stick their hands and feet in the direction of their opponents. A minor exception is a good time with an opponent equipped with butterfly folding knives; another one is a near-late sequence where a clear double for Bell (and maybe for Stan Shaw) jumps around and performs some decent scans and preparatory work of a minute or two before Bell / "Jackson "does not punch the liver of his enemy, Shaw collapses and the scenario just stops. (Once again, I'll admit it's been part of Shaw Brother's tradition since the beginning of time.) <br /> <br /> There are a few supporting actors who are actually better than the movie deserves ( I'm thinking of "Joe" and the guy playing the right hand of the drug lord). There's a pretty funk-like halfway sound that complements the on-screen action and adds a star to the notation itself. There is a semi-doubtful sex scene that manages to be effective almost in spite of itself. <br /> <br /> This is strictly reserved for fans of blaxploitation. I saw it out of pure curiosity and I'm not sorry for taking the time. But I can not imagine wanting to take the time to see him again unless I decide to write a thesis on the intersections of pop culture between "Kung Fu Theater" and "Foxy Brown".
