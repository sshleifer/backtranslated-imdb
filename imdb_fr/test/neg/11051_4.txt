By Jove, what an unholy mess! Vengeance, incestuous love, mechanical games, fighting, incessant and totally useless violence, primitive "primitive" music striking the amazed victims, great "surprises" (which tend to be as "revealing" as the title of The National Enquirer). Add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. The undeserved popularity of this film strongly indicates that the very low-level pop subculture has not only succeeded over the last few decades, but has also been able to impose a dominant taste on the impotent audience. (For much more in-depth information about human suffering under mental illness, without the vulgar excesses of "Oldboy", I recommend an older Dutch / French movie, "The Vanishing".) <br /> Well, do not believe there is absolutely nothing good to say about this film. In fact there is. The (in) famous scene in which the hero (is in fact a "hero", an abject father who sleeps with his daughter and then tries to get forgotten rather than redemption?) Eats a live octopus that benefits greatly from the living presence of the best actors in the entire cast: the octopus itself. Too bad that the poor beast, having been eaten, can survive his one and only act to obtain another worthless diploma for the "best actor" of the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Which festival, by the way, between Moore's nonsense propaganda and this epitome of worthless quirks, albeit a little exotic, has become a festival of naive and ridiculous . <br /> <br /> Transit of Sic gloria mundi!
