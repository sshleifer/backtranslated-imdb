I note movies on this site all the time, but normally I do not write comments. However, in this case, I felt obliged to warn others! This movie is bad! It's probably one of a dozen movies I've rated as "1 (awful)". I know people say it all the time, but it was really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Anyway, it is easily at the bottom of the rankings. <br /> <br /> As far as horror films are concerned, my standards are very low. I will forget all kinds of bad quality movies for a good fright. But this film is embarrassing. Looks like someone bought a video camera at Sears and decided to make a movie with his friends. The fact that the name of each member of the team appears in the list of actors proves this theory, I think. This film has lower production standards than the average high school game. It's actually a bit shocking to see a movie that looks so bad on DVD. The special effects are sometimes effective, but remain at best amateurs. The best thing to say about the actors is that at least they remember that they do not have to watch the camera most of the time. I can not say with certainty if they have trouble remembering their replicas or inventing them as they go along. Any attempt at humor is lame. This film is a colossal waste of time.
