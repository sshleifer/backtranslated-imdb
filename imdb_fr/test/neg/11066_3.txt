Monday, October 02, 2006 So I ended up with my father, as always. We ordered Japanese takeaway, turned off the lights and pushed the game. I'm a big fan of horror movies. However, The Cavern, released on DVD last October, was certainly disappointing. It seemed promising and met all the requirements of a horror cinema machine: drawn by starting with an antagonist present character, a sex scene that can not be omitted, and a too familiar pre-ghost the idiot boyfriend). Then finally, when everything was implemented, I was ready for a real bloody action. The director, I admit, was enthusiastic. Of course, you would have to spend 81 minutes with people running in a space about 10 feet wide. It all starts when university "spelunkers" gather for another dive into a cave. They all seem to be seasoned professionals, very serious and witty about the whole experience of the cave. This time, they bring a newcomer, a boring photographer too blinded by his National Geographic cover to understand all the dangers of cave diving. By descending to the bottom of what they call "Hell Pit", they quickly realize that they are not alone in the abyss of death. If you're naive enough to ignore my advice and avoid wasting time, I'll politely leave the treats aside. Although the atmosphere and background music are spooky; and there was certainly a lot of blood and coolness, when the moments that approached to witness a real dismemberment were more like watching porn without the full content. The camera work was deliberately dark and incomplete. I guess the director used it for an effect. I guess what I like most about the movie is moving characters. They deserved Acadamy awards for these scenes of touching quarrels. I almost shed a tear when they finally "had" it ... A tear of joy! If you like dry horror, soft porn and you hate Braveheart. So this is the good movie for your next Saturday night.
