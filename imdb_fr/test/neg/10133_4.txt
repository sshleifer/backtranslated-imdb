Describing this film is a difficult task. On the one hand, it's an extraordinary vampire spookfest, complemented by cobwebs, disturbing music, a hypnotic medallion and, of course, a coffin with a crisp cover. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the most stupid scenarios on this side of Edward D. Wood, produced by the same people who gave us "The Bloody Vampire", "Invasion of the Vampires "and the predecessor of this film, the modest title" The Vampire, "The film remains stuck to the lack of logic that characterizes the other films. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, this movie is a sequel to "The Vampire", which I have never seen. But no matter ... it's easy to imagine what happened. Dr. Enrique, played by Abel "The Brainiac" Salazar, is confused when Dr. Marion, well-intentioned but misguided, brings back the staked body of his vampiric enemy, Count Karol de Lavud (I guess there is a rule must be leaders of some sort). Dr. Marion complains that all the important doctors in history have had to resort to some kind of burglary to advance their medical studies and he hopes to use the vampire's corpse to study phenomena such as the lack of normal reflection of the vampire how much he holds a mirror in front of the vampire and instead of any reflection, we see the skeleton of the vampire. ???). <br /> <br /> Enrique is not happy, and seems determined to put the events of the first film as pure fantasy and superstition. "This man was not a vampire ... I admit that he liked to drink a little blood, but that's all!" he declares. The fragile Martha, a part-time nurse and showgirl (!) Who happens to be Enrique's object of affection, is also a source of confusion. Martha narrowly escaped the clutches of De Lavud in the first film and apparently Enrique spent a lot of time "healing her mind" and making her believe that all she had gone through was not real. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you were the scriptwriter of this movie, you would need some way to find somebody stupid enough to shoot the vampire stake, right? Well, what about the greedy scammer who helped Marion steal the coffin? After seeing Lavud's body, he glances at the expensive brooch the count is wearing, and comes back easily to steal it when the doctors do not look at him. But damn ... he can not remove the pin because of the stake, so ... you guessed it. De Lavud is at liberty again, this time with the sleazy con as his human henchman. <br /> <br /> OK, so of course the vampire is looking for Martha again, and in the meantime, the doctors are really disoriented. . At first, they are determined to prove that there is no true vampire, and then at the end of the film, they try to get the police to publish a bulletin of all points for "a dead man, but always desire. ! ". <br /> <br /> You can probably imagine the rest of the plot from this point, but the filmmakers throw some nice twists. One of the sets of the film is a museum of spooky wax (are there other types of films of this type?), With a torture chamber fully equipped ... with real torture equipment and execution. The film has a very keen sense of style, and not just in campy cobwebs. In a frightening sequence, de Lavud pursues a victim in a seemingly endless series of streets and alleyways, following their progression alongside vague buildings without doors while illuminating the scene as a German Expressionist nightmare ("Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" "seems an influence). <br /> <br /> But the rest of the film is juvenile, especially in its heyday. The special effects are pretty rudimentary, even for the year they were made, and the decisive fight with Lavud in the form of bats is quite laughable ... but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that Martha would faint and collapse directly. above a guillotine, positioned so that its head is perfectly placed to be sliced ​​by the blade, which may fall because the rope suddenly began to unravel RIGHT AT THIS VERY MINUTE! What an unfortunate coincidence! To make matters worse, he cuts the frayed rope to scenes of Enrique trying to dodge the rubber bat, essentially motionless and waving his arms. It's definitely an Ed Wood moment if it is, especially when Martha seems to pull herself together and stand up goggy as the blade fades. Phew! What a relief! In fantasy terms, "The Vampire Coffin" does not have the madness factor of "The Bloody Vampire" or "The Invasion of the Vampires", but fans of this type of old horror movies will appreciate atmospheric photography , and the fact that the director manages to get real thrills of this material that must "count" for something (haw haw).
