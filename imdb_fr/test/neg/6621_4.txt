Before sitting down and watching this movie on HBO, I did not expect a few bursts of laughter here and there and, together, a stupid and banal plot. Well, that's exactly what I shot, except that I was a little satisfied at the end of the film. I did not expect that, I thought I would have an hour and a half to lose. Well, it was, but it was worth it. The whole plot was very stupid, cheap acting, and some of the lines were very, very stupid. Otherwise, there were always fun moments, even if they are not numerous. <br /> <br /> In total, if you rent this, do not do it. Watch it on TV. I gave him a 4, I was generous because it made me laugh, but it was still pretty stupid.
