The subjects presented are very interesting. suburban culture, urban sprawl, public transport, depletion of oil and gas reserves, energy dependence, alternative energy sources, etc. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is a pure and shameless propaganda. A point of view is presented, then hammered repeatedly. You see the same handful of "experts" arguing their arguments over and over. The supposed "narrator" begins to sound like a journalist, but in the end, he even preaches the dogma of the film. <br /> <br /> The dark side of the film is not so much the dark message about oil. exhaustion, but the feeling that people in the movie are actually a vow for a post-petroleum company and all that entails. They paint the picture of a utopian society in which we all find the model of local autonomous village; walk to work, shop on the spot, grow our own food and generally live the idyllic lifestyle of the 19th century. For them, the post-oil society would appear as a great vision of a better world. This would certainly mean the end of globalization and, better still, Walmart's. I will give them some credit for applying real mathematics by exposing the weaknesses of several over-vaunted alternative energy sources, including ethanol and hydrogen. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 stars because I enjoyed the old movie and the principle.
