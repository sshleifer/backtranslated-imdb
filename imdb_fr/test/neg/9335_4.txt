It was only when I looked in the "Trivia" section that I discovered that the original producer / star of this film, Tyrone Power, died during its production. This probably explains why everyone on the screen seems to think of something else, whose symptom appears very early in a scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic. Do you know when you painted a wall until you were bored completely? Well, that's the kind of expression the fighters have on their faces when they swap their swords in an extremely unconvincing way. <br /> <br /> The plot tells that the King of Israel, Soloman, would have an affair with the Queen of Sheeba and his people not be happy about it. You can not really blame them because there are not many more beautiful things in the world than these Israeli motives, although the Israeli women here all look like Cherie Blair! Today, Israel is also very cosmopolitan: the majority of Israelis were born outside the country, but would that have been true a few thousand years ago, where everyone speaks with European and American accents? <br /> <br /> After many discussions and dance sequence that must be seen to be believed (And no, it is not praise), we have a climax where the Israelis, largely overwhelmed by number, have to defend themselves against a massed Egyptian army that can not read a map otherwise it would have known that there was canyon in front of them. That's what I do not understand. Even if, blinded by the sun, the Egyptians spend ten minutes loading the Israelis without ever realizing that they are heading for a gaping ravine! Is not that a little illogical? It is also a revealing error since the horses, the tanks and the men who fall in the canyon are obviously tiny figurines. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, the film ends when Soloman kills his treacherous brother and praises God for his victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon or God when you have an idiotic foe who can not see a ravine in front of him or waving a sword as if he is painting a wall?
