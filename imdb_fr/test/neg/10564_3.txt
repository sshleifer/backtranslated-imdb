OK, when I say "wow," I mean, "Jesus, help me please." I have an old VHS copy that was printed before Troma got a copy of the title. The film is about an alien crash landing on Earth to terrorize us with a gun that makes people fall into oblivion. BE CAREFUL!!! And by that, I mean beware of these special effects. There are an incredible number of errors. The acting is awful, but I would say that the only one who is going to work is the sheriff. The film itself is really grainy and poorly lit. In a particular scene, it's daylight outside and the photo then shows the Night Beast shooting his gun with the night behind him. Then he shows the day again. * Shake your head * I usually like low-budget horror movies, but I had to force myself to finish because I never watch a movie without finishing it. The only realization of this film is an alien who is not stereotyped. So, for that, and ONLY for that ... I give it a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you've had a bad day. You will be even more depressed by the failed attempt of this film.
