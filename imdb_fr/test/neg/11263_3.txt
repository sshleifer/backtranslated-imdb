It's a bad movie. No one can deny it as much as I would like. Tommy Lee Jones is about as talented as possible with the scenario they gave him, and he had some decent action sequences that seemed really out of place because of their acceptable quality. <br /> <br /> Somewhere Someone thought that all the flaws of the scenario could be offset by the hiring of all the players in the industry, unfortunately, even really talented actors like Goodman, Beatty, Sarsgaard, Gammon, Steenburgen, MacDonald and Pruitt Taylor Vince and let us not forget that Mr. Jones himself can not repair the wooden dialogue, and a progression of the plot that has absolutely nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> In fact, at one point, I looked up, sure the movie was running since the last few hours, I realized that I had spent 51 minutes. <br /> <br /> The most painful point of the movie was perhaps the secondary plot about the ghosts of Confederate soldiers that seems to not help narrating. Other than slightly hinder the confusion of business in the end with the image. * If you have not seen this movie ignore this past statement that may seem tempting and know that this is not the case, you will not understand it better after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie is perhaps a continuation of the movie "Heaven's Prisoners" with Alec Baldwin in the same role that Tommy Lee Jones played in this movie. Maybe I'll have to watch the movie now, first to see if it's as bad as in In the Electric Mist, and then because I can not seem to understand (no matter how hard I try) to break my love for Alec Baldwin.
