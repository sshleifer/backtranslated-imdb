The first time I watched this movie, I was ten years old. I thought it was bad then, and at that age I had no cinematic taste. I watched this movie on Cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded why I hated the movie in the first place. Madonna's character, Nikki, is annoying and obnoxious. It is impossible for the main character to fall in love with her. The jokes were lame and the dialogue was worse than a soap opera !! I'm glad I did not see this movie at the theater or rent it. I feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching with me! Madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role, she is described as an idiot.
