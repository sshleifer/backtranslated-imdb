Early talkie is based on a popular play. A murder was committed and a group of people hired a media outlet to conduct a session to see who the murderer is. While the lights are off, there is ANOTHER murder ... so there is someone in this room. <br /> <br /> What follows is an obvious mystery of murder. Most actors overestimate themselves to a ridiculous degree. They act as if they were on stage (where you had to exaggerate things) and it looks ridiculous on the screen. The most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before "Dracula") who really exaggerates as a police inspector. The static instructions of Tod Browning (who has always been overrated) do not help at all. <br /> <br /> Reserved for complete Browning and Lugosi players. I give him a 3.
