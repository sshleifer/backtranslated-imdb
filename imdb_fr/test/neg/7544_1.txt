Yes, this must be one of the most lamentable movies I have ever seen. It's totally tasteless, without style, the story is so thin that you can watch TV through, and the whole movie has so many holes that you could drive a tanker there. <br /> <br /> Of course, I enjoy a good movie series as much as most homo white sapiens. But it must be the worst I've seen. In fact, so many things are missing that make a movie B. interesting. <br /> <br /> The whole film is based on charming artifacts such as sneaking characters, various bodily functions and the total lack of reason for anything on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny. In fact, it's the opposite. I found it even boring sometimes because of its extreme predictability. <br /> <br /> I can not find anything good to say about this movie. It was a waste of time watching the video and I hope others will not make the same mistake. If you pay too, you should have a serious brain.
