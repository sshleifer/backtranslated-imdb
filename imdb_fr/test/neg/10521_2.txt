This stinker is in a mystifying and frequent rotation on a channel here, and I found myself watching again and again in horror. The scenario looks like something you could find with friends for several drinks in excess, and the values ​​of the production match perfectly. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be a children's movie, but has a grotesque (and poorly explained) kidnapping. scene; the star dog has a lack of star quality matched only by other actors; and he usually seems to have filmed himself in someone's backyard (the culminating football game has no more than three dozen extras cheering sadly in the background). <br /> <br /> Everything ends even with a budget run voiceover sequence when the story, to his great relief, simply stops. The best students here must be either the producers or the majority of football's extras!
