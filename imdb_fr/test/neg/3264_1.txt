Why was this film ever shot? They tarnished the original Caddyshack with this shit. I could only watch half and I did not laugh once. At least I did not pay to see it because it was on TV. but I will not return at this hour of my life spent watching this terrible disorder. There was not an original star apart from the first except for Chevy Chase and he probably regretted making this movie. Jackie Mason was supposed to be outrageous, funny jester as Rodney Dangerfield was in the first but Jackie Mason was not funny at all.Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield.If you want to laugh, look at the first Caddyshack.If you like terrible movies, then this is your movie. This film stinks like a barnyard in July. Avoid at all costs.
