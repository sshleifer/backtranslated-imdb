The action-free movie has two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) opposed to two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the least charismatic action of the 80s, the small role of Roundtree is very different from that of "Shaft", and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role to his career, that of attending next to his laughable turn in "The Toolbox". Assassinations "(this man was a respected actor once, now he starts to wear flowers in his hair and complain about people bleeding on his carpet.) Only Stack Pierce acts with a certain dignity. Do not worry, most of them are too bad to offend anyone. (* 1/2)
