Do not take this film seriously, praise it for people who want to play Mystery Science 3000 and you'll surely laugh at your butts. The bad guys are not so scary, it's funny, it's like a 7th-grade guy with a sickle in a scarecrow. The acting is hilarious. I like the occasional torture with a bad horror movie and it really made me laugh. I recommend it on this basis. Of course, recreational drugs will enhance the experience. Oh, there is a nude group swimming scene, which will allow star dust on the 5-star system. The symbolic black male is seriously injured, but continues to joke and uses the injured part of the body quite easily. Enjoy this complete and complete shame of the movies.
