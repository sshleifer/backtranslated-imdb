It's absolutely awful. It's everywhere and nowhere and has no point. I never understood what's good with Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is so much above this drivel that she must have been personal friends with people involved because she would not have been able to read part of this so-called "script" and think, "Yeah I want to do that!" In most movies, I can find at least one or two exchangeable or fun things. There is none of that in this. It's extremely stupid. There is really no other word to describe that. It may be the biggest waste of money in filmmaking I've seen in a long time. Skip this at all costs, you'll be glad you did.
