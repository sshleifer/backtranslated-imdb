During his two hours of racing, Crash illustrates the emotional anguish of his group of a dozen characters face forms of racism sometimes flagrant and sometimes latent underlying the American society. This and the emotional anguish of one of his audience sitting near the front and desperately trying to make sense of what has become of movies nowadays. <br /> <br /> The time we live in has become so complicated. Not only do we reject modernism, but even post-modernism ideas waving an unenthusiastic flag are still repressed by what, post-modernism, which aims to destroy all these ideas, not at all thanks to the great destructivist. ideas of these great "thinkers". But I go astray. It has nothing to do with the subject of the film, but rather with the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, it seems difficult to make a living in a Hollywood that has to respond to a market So, all this makes cynicism become more than a motto in life. It's part of everything we do and everything we think about, whether we like it or not. And a new studio product is born! Independent films, once energetic and idealistic in their provocative experimentalism, now seem as categorical as Hollywood films for sale in the independent film markets. An independent film must be sold to Sundance before becoming "acclaimed". And so nothing is simpler. Even what constitutes a good movie becomes so murky. Whereas in the past, filmmakers simply wanted to entertain people and tell a good story - and in these seemingly simplistic attempts to create the greatest films - filmmakers now have to make movies that are good first and foremost; the movies have to make you think, make sense, be provocative, ask questions, yadda yadda yadda. All this amounts to a subversion of the Hollywood film system, but this subversion seems strangely similar to the similarity of the Hollywood film formulas, the innumerable ways of differing to be essentially the same product. <br /> <br /> And I have not even started the movie yet. I may have become too difficult on the movies I see nowadays. Maybe it's because of my overriding need to be entertained, rather than being, for example, questioned while watching a movie. But damn, this movie is a big load of shit. And I'm repelled by this film, not just because it follows the guide How to make a good movie A good movie 101 of the characters-T states eloquent lines and is so spiritual that they are endowed with the speech of God; it raises questions about racism and life faced with racism in America; there are "touching" moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about others; not to mention the fact that once you hear the ambient / new age music of women singing in large registers in foreign languages, you know that you have all the aforementioned traits. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned point, which raises questions about urgent issues like racism, is pissing me off. Like all post-post-post-post movies, not all films on offer should contain a message about this problem. Because, oh, our audiences are far too smart for that these days in this post-post-post-post world. Our audience wants us to think about them, does not want us to ask things so simplistically (and then, they'll fall into the existentialist shit and say) that's because life itself is not simplistic . Hahaha. What other usual exercise do we have here? The public must therefore think about problems rather than make them known. Okay, okay, okay. The film makes it a point of honor to hammer the public with these non-messages and as they are not exactly a message, they are so resolutely subtle and subtle, it's good no? We are struck again and again with this well-written subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose. And as if the irony was not stiff enough, we have the character of Ludicrous, the only character who seems not to take seriously all these discussions about racism, being "converted" into one of those characters in the irritating sense where he finally learns something, give meaningful looks and breaks where the audience is supposed to "learn something about himself". Well yes. How I wanted to see an incredibly racist movie just after this man. <br /> <br /> To put an end to this bullshit, I guess I would not have cared if the movie had not been so swollen. personal importance. The anguish that formed the whole film was more like a white boy's complaint than Spike Lee-ish's anger. So it's Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the guy who wants to brandish flags of humanism when the only thing they do not realize is the flag they wave, it's their underwear. holes. Moreover, it has become so trendy in the post-post-post world to be completely subtle about it. Nothing is simple any longer. In his best efforts to be really good, provocative and ultimately human, he has become neither, in my humble opinion, just another bullshit independent of an independent director who wants to make a name for himself. as a credible independent filmmaker. At least, Hollywood is simpler and sincere in its handling.
