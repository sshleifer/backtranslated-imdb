For the record, I hate parodic movies. With the exception of Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE! because they are classics and make fun of the clich√©s, not the movies themselves. I think parodic films are the bottom of the barrel for comedy and film. I especially hate the things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the "geniuses" behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE and MEET THE SPARTANS. <br /> <br /> I decided to take a look at The Comebacks. Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with production, I was as objective as possible. It was like one of their movies. It was basically all sports films melted with lame jokes in kindergarten and disturbing images of physical injuries meant to make me laugh and that failed. <br /> <br /> Only a tall man laughed at these jokes. Toilet bowl? Who wrote this? an 11 years old? I was surprised to see that it was the creation of the producers of WEDDING CRASHERS, which was actually quite decent. But there, the kind of parody was about as funny as an orphanage on fire. The only reason I gave these two stars (which she clearly deserved) was that Friedberg & Seltzer had nothing to do with it.
