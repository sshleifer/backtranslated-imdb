I'm sorry guys, anyone who thought this movie could be great, I'm afraid you're disappointed. <br /> <br /> The norm, the movie you want to stage is completely ruined by a very simple plot. So simple, that the film does not evolve until the end. I wondered if the plot was not about the action but the main character (played by Mickey Rourke), but I found that the character was inconsistent - whether it was a professional killer or a brother haunted by guilt. But the two do not go together, because the kid is trying to guide the pose into dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself. Now, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a fine actor, but he played his character a bit unnatural. I did not believe his role, it seemed that the director had tried to remove him a personality that he could not provide. And he did not have to, because his less crazy demeanor was pretty terrifying. The only person whose game was great was Diane Lane. If it is not her, I would give a star to this movie. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I expected to see a well-played movie and an interesting plot. And I completely ruined my expectations.
