This film was boring. Very similar to Underworld, but even less interesting. It's not really a werewolf movie or a horror movie. The main couple was boring. I did not care about Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little character development that I did not care about any character in the movie. The plot was thin as paper. The transformations were practically nil. I liked the wolves themselves, I might have done better a documentary about the wolf. I would not recommend this movie. I did not find it amusing or interesting. It's hanging around and everyone is boring. This film could win a prize for how not to make a werewolf movie.
