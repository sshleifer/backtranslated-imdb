I was lucky enough to grow up surfing in San Diego (it's not the biggest waves in the world, but it was a childhood childhood, I'll tell you) and I saw a lot of surfing movies in my life. After watching NORTH SHORE for the first time just now, all I can say is THANK YOU TO GOD that I have never seen this as a child. If I had seen that and if I had mistakenly thought that it was a realistic portrait of the surf scene, I would sell my board and commit myself totally, I do not know, to accounting or whatever. something like that <br /> <br /> Seriously, this The film has so much in common with the real surf that TOP GUN was a real military life. The acting is terrible, the music is worse, the cinematography is at best uncertain and OH MY GOD, what was Laird Hanilton thinking ?! SENSATIONAL!!! DO NOT SEE THIS FILM !!! It sucks !!! If you want a REAL surf, see GIANTS RIDING. Hell, look at SURF'S UP instead. Seriously. Sucks. Bad Sucks. Suck really bad. Brah. ;) <br /> <br /> PS: I had to change my summer from "WTF ?!" wtf because, apparently, we are supposed to whisper on this site. NO YELLING !!! (Shhh!); D
