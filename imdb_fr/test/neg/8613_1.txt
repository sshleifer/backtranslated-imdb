Well, I watch tons of movies and this one is really bad ... BIG TIME. I'm sure we're all fed up with the low-budget stratagem to make vampire movies using "martial arts teacher" type movies. I'm also so tired that the guy knows a certain fighting technique and can then make his way through a boring movie. I forced myself to watch it and one of the main reasons was that the main actress is quite pretty (Ha-Ha). I hope this has helped you a bit and if you have the time and want to give your brain some rest Look at it !!! Hope that one day, this type of film will not be published, but then, where will all the actors of the small budget :-) <br /> <br /> The film also contains a lot of Bloops but I leave you the care to find because it adds a bit of fun by looking and also if you are a little perfectionist, it will bother you ;-) Cheers !!
