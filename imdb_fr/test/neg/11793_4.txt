I realize why people hate this movie. And, I hated Blair Witch Project, so go understand? It's about as staged as that and yes, they insult your intelligence by trying to give it a real appearance. I really liked the story of Madame Lalaurie, although it is more than likely invented. But the main reason I like this movie is wrong or not, when the ghosts start to attack and kidnap them, I get chipped-bumps every time and I have to look behind me, it seems to me that something is there. but more than half of the drivelism that is horrifying in today's cinemas and DVDs does not give me goosebumps, making it a scary delicacy. Not for everybody. 13 reviews There are no gore. And the females are very annoying! You will want ghosts to remove them and experiment them before everything is said and done. ** out of *****.
