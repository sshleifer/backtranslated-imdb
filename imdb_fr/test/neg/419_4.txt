I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. I had hoped to enjoy a movie that I thought was different from the book. There were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes to the DiVinci Code. I went to see the DiVinci code with the same thought process and I managed to enjoy the movie, despite the changes to the book. It was always nice, action-packed, and the process of deciphering symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately, angels and demons have disappointed at almost every level. Throughout the film, symbols are found and understood quickly without any interest to the viewer. They are so much faster than the various Immuminati symbols that we have not had the chance to see them and appreciate how they work. The last symbol of the Illuminati, which was the most interesting and the most creative of the book, has been replaced by the symbol of crossed keys. In my opinion, it was a missed opportunity to focus and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is why the character of Langdon. Overall, this film is a very bad interpretation of the book and does not succeed in becoming an action / thriller movie. 4 out of 10
