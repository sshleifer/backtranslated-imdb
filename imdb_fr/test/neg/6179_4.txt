So, as far as I know, this episode tries to make people understand how bad the real-life bad guys are, and that's just as scary as the paranormal. The "paranormal" images associated with the villain, Donnie, are purely symbolic. It is actually a normal human being. <br /> <br /> The problem is that I just do not buy it. Donnie is just not more scary than the paranormal. He's not even so scary at all. As a guy who seems confused and bizarre rather than malicious, who loves dead girls and hair, and who has just become a murderer, he is far less disturbing than most of the well-known serial killers of real life (by example: it is like a very diluted version of Ed Gein). That's why Scully's horror of seeing only bodies with cut hair and nails (something that is not much different from a normal personal hygiene routine), even before someone has been killed or wounded, is completely devoid of character. She sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly flinches. <br /> <br /> So, as Comic Book Guy says ... "The worst episode of my life!"
