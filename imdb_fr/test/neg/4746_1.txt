If only I had read Alex Sander's review here rather than looking at the score of more than 6 among a selective selection of ignorant viewers, I would not have seen this desecration. Alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well done horror / science fiction. Predator was a big science fiction / action mess. I really have to blame myself when I saw "Alien versus Predator". It also has an average of over 6-star movie connoisseurs frequenting this site. <br /> <br /> STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE A FEAR OF THIS EVOLVED PLOT SUSPENDS ALREADY SUSPENDED TO BE IN RUIN FOR YOU. <Br/> <br /> From the beginning, this movie was ridiculous. No explanation was given for the ship invaded by Predator, overtaken by Aliens. OK, so maybe they were going to throw aliens back on Earth to chase them away and something was wrong, but how did that lead to an Alien / Predator hybrid and why the rest of the did not the crew realize earlier despite its advanced technology? The beginning was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film, because we had an idea of ​​who was who or who and what and maybe why. From there, it becomes really ridiculous. I always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the screen door before entering and retrieve it at the exit. I could not here. <br /> <br /> A father and his son hunt in the woods. The crash of the damaged ship lands at (according to the view shown), I would calculate at least 10 miles in a thick wood. The man and the boy are alone, find the ship and hug the face. Even at this stage, you feel very little for them mainly because the hugged faces are almost comical rather than terrifying in their movements and actions and that the father looks like such an irresponsible and stupid muppet. </ P> </ p> </ p> </ p> The thriller type scenario is presented with a former prisoner who returns to the city near the accident site to meet his friend, a friend, a little moved and now dull, in the bus. When I say presented, I mean a weak attempt with crappy actors and no feeling is played. A slasher / horror element is then presented to a sexy girl and the so-called nerdy or rather junk cute guy who gets beaten by the overly protective, insane and mean guy of Jock (American sportsman not a Scot). Oh, the cute / not cute boy is also the brother of the ex-prisoner. Yes, they are intelligent these guiding brothers whose name I will search for in order to avoid any other mistake. Then a modern role reversal, such a boring PC attempt, the introduction of the Ripley supporting character is accompanied by a female soldier who returns home with her husband and child. <br /> <br /> Guess what then? I will not tell you more about the plot (in case you are so far away and you are not the brightest star in the Alien-Ridden universe). (Smiles sadly for himself in the face of the disappearance of the narrative in the vast majority of recent films). <br /> <br /> The predator is stupid for the reasons given by the previous poster whose message I read too late. The extraterrestrials are boring. The Predator-Alien is ridiculous. The action is sometimes abusive, gratuitous, unreasonable. The hospital scene with pregnant women?!?! Oh, I was shocked. Shocked at how much people are getting what? A fear? A shock? To tickle the perverts? What? If you really want to shock, titillate and frighten people who are not pregnant or who do not expect a father or have no soul, why not just ask Alien / Predator to flirt with women and teenage girls delicious instead of killing them? The characters have no depth and intrigue either. It's filmed and badly rhythmic. They are disinterested people who act, not that I can blame them. It also tarnishes two rather interesting and interesting sets of science fiction characters. This film was bad and if you like the game, I really have to worry about you. If you have not seen it well, make your own decision. <br /> <br /> PS Did I even mention how the trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds, while amateur civilians survive?
