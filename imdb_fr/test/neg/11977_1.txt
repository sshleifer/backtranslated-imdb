It was a shame for the game. FarCry, I had a lot of expectations, but all of this resulted in a nightmare. In addition to the unpleasant visual effects, the plot, even the humor used in the film, was an absolute flop. The film is not worth seeing. The funniest part was when the girl came to kiss Jack to give him the key of the headlines. Guess, she still has the keys for handcuffs. I hope a good director will make a remake of this fantastic game in a movie someday. And me, they will invest money to get the good visual effects and the right decorations, as well as for ACTING. But until then, do not waste time watching this movie because it will certainly make you mad, especially if you are a FarCry lover.
