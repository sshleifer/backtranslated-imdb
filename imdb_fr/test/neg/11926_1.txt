From the beginning (or down there) with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace. <br /> <br /> The principle seemed cool, some ads seemed semi-promising, but alas, the whole movie was about 30 seconds If you want an amateur writing, second-rate effects, ridiculous costumes and total sleepiness , look at him. The plot is a sci-fi recycled fodder. Too bad, because on entering, I thought it would be bad, but I kept hope. It may be the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> Result - Do not look at it. <br /> <br /> Unless of course you do not like any of the 3 movies above.
