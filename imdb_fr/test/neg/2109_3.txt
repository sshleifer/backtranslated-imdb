The film starts in Mexico where a girl has been cursed, she spits on green jello snakes and her friend tries all those crazy spells to lift the spell. He's just singing a horrible language that does not matter, so they decide to cross the border, get on the train to get to LA to see his uncle to lift the curse. Comic Hilarity follows. This movie has the same snakes again and again! He has snakes and garden pythons that will never bite. They all make the sound of rattlesnakes, which makes no sense. All the movie has fun lines, weak effects, but the most important is a great ending that leaves you as WHAM BAM WHAT HAS UP TO HECK !!!!! The whole movie is about a 1, but the end is a 10, so according to my wildest calculations, it gives a total of 3. When blockbuster has nothing to do, grab it for a crazy entertainment!
