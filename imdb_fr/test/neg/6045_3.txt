I had seen this movie a few days before Halloween 2004. I had noticed it around lunch time and it was an interesting description in my menu box so I decided to watch it. Seriously, only a movie is only suitable for television late at night ... you know, after Conan but before the infomercials, a kind of agreement. <br /> <br /> Although this film has very little to do with the paintings, it has a lot to do with spiders, refer to my section if you need a reminder. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the story is absolutely fascinating. A hidden nuclear generator, a scientist and a credible portal ... That would have been a good start for a cool fantasy, but then it fell after 15 to 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The distribution is mediocre and without memorable. performance, poor quality queen who had her breasts amplified ... since spiders do not wear breasts. As well as mediocre sound effects. A low-budget movie obvious that the cast has tried. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> 4 electricians fall on a hidden nuclear generator while they were stationed. They fiddle with the buttons and open a portal. 2 workers fall on the portal and it closes ... struggling to understand what is happening, the party still in our world is asking for help while the other party observes their environment. <br /> <br /> The help does not arrive then they open the portal and meet in a parallel dimension. They meet a race of human spiders baptized soldiers. After a death and a hunt, they are saved by the survivors. <br /> <br /> Now, it gets boring ... they hide, talk a little, try to build another portal, then attack the hive. After losing 2 other electricians, they open the gate and avoid returning to our world ... 200 million years ago. <br /> <br /> That sounds interesting, right?
