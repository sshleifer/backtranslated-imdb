****** Spoilers inside ******* What a dull banquet, predictable, not scary. The film had no character development: I did not feel any empathy with any of the characters (except perhaps the little boy), and I did not care what had happened to them. The movie had so many snapshots, or stolen items from other horror movies. <br /> <br /> The movie was so predictable. Many times I thought, "Let me guess. Yeah, I was right. Even in the opening scene, I predicted that the "attack" on the family had been perpetrated by a man, probably the father (because only the wife and children had been attacked). Indeed, that's what happened (of course, you have to wait 79 minutes to find out). And, of course, another "naughty" scenario. Why was he mean and killing his family? Because it's a man, duh! <br /> <br /> As someone else has said, this movie can scare a person under 13 or a movie from the 1970s, but it is far from a film by today's standards. AND, like so many other horror movies, a lot of fears were "fake". Scary music, scary music, scary music and ..... A crow suddenly flies to the window! Wow, scary! <br /> <br /> How did the old bank man manage, on a few occasions, to cross a wasteland without the father seeing him? I thought the old man was a ghost. No, just a crappy movie. <br /> <br /> I rated this film as a 2 out of 10 because it held my attention enough to stay in the center of the discussion.
