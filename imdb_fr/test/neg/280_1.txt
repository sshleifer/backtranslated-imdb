Ocean's 12 starts on boring and worsens from there. As a celebrity rewards showcase, each main actor is featured in short 60-second scenarios that seem to no longer have the sign "applaud now" flashing. The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed, poorly mounted and sometimes unrelated to history and confusing. Speaking of the story, there is one, a bit, but it is barely visible for all shots and cameos "look at me". Only Matt Damon really seemed to "play" during this movie ... the rest of the cast seemed to be there only to participate in a rat-pack-wanna-be session. As far as the flight, the action, the drama ..., it was put in the last 8-10 minutes of the film and was pathetic and anticlimactic. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!
