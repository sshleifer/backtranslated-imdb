This film made me laugh so much. It was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. So amazing and the worst conspiracy of all time. The game was bad too. I do not understand why so many actors and popular Bollywood actresses have decided to make this film. The script must have been a kind of joke. The visual effects of this film were extremely painful to watch. I think a kindergarten child could have done a better job with the visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job with a plot. <br /> <br /> The plot has many attempts to copy major Hollywood movies. like The Terminator but it fails miserably. I'm laughing to see this movie. A total disaster in the history of Indian cinema!
