I hate firearms and have never murdered anyone, but when even half of the events taking place in "Shuttle" happen to you or to people close to you and you find a gun, you shoot at your attacker. THRICE. FIVE TIMES. All that makes the pulse stop on them and increases on you. I think even God would say, "Good call." In a movie type 'Hostel', but more realistic ?? as it could really happen to anyone, well, if you are a pretty young woman, is that ?? "Shuttle" was a decent film, although long. Some good shocks (always call AAA even to change the tire), a simple surprise but most of the time, we could see things to come. And aside from the typical "tie up" instead of the aforementioned shootout, the most annoying part was the revelation of the closing of a best friend to another. Beyond these, it's nice for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting women traveling alone from Mexico (wow, that's original) and one who lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport too late. And after a scene in prefigured sign language, they enter a shuttle "too beautiful to be true" at half price. Clich√©s jocks, previously introduced, make their way in the shuttle to join what seems to be the doubled Alan Ruck in "Speed". From there, it's obvious what's going on (I said it was love at first sight for a "youth hostel"), but I did not find too much horror, but nothing spectacular. Although this would have served the public better with about 15 to 20 minutes of removal, I would recommend it if you have almost 2 hours to kill and you are in a disgusting horror.
