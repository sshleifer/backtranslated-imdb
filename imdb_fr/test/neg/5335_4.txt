Maureen O'Hara is always beautiful and attractive. Here she plays a terminally ill actress. We do not know with what. It is a bit precursor to "Love Story" in this regard. <br /> <br /> William Bendix is ​​good, as are most actors. John Payne is supposed to be in mourning but he seems sleepy. The girl who plays the child that he and O'Hara adopt does his best with an invented tree feature: of course! Adopt an orphan. She will live after the death of your wife. It is a soft film but that does not seem sincere. I hoped to be moved. I was, by the sweet performance of O'Hara. But I do not like to feel manipulated.
