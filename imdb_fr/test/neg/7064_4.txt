This is the inexpensive biography of a black-and-white minstrel star, a certain Dixie Boy Johnson. I do not know if this person really existed, but given the list of actors, some "Lee Lasses White" and Roscoe Karns also playing this character, I guess this man has existed and it is about 'a whitewashed film (sorry pun) version of his career. The plot, as it is, follows Dixie Boy's up and down career to depression upon the death of his beloved wife, her abandonment of the girl to friends, her return to the age of 16 years and the beginning of reconciliation. Another forgotten man, Benny Fields, plays Dixie Boy. The man has a beautiful baritone voice, but has no talent to play and is a boring piece on the screen. Gladys George does his best to animate the works in vain. Judy Clark makes the best imitation of Betty Hutton I've ever seen, although I think she thought she was herself. The score full of many musical numbers for its short 70 minutes earned him a well deserved Oscar. Well worth a look.
