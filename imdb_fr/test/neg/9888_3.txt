I think the best way to revise this title is to split it into pros and cons. <br /> <br /> PROS: they turn into wolves rather than monsters of plastic / cartoony. ~ the wolves' chase through the forest ~ Hard-Fi's "Cash Machine" being played <br /> <br /> CONT: ~ some parts of the script make you shudder (for example the terrible part where the woman escapes the 'Fortunate Five' boys, and about half an hour ago 'Dear cousin' and a round robin of 'Yes, see, we know Gabriel's law') ~ The dive transformation is ridiculous ~ the obvious and ridiculous end ~ Aiden is told thousands of times to leave, then we say "if you cared about me, you would have left me" ~ the obvious characters ~ the useless journey ~ the totally useless cutting of the arm by Aiden ~ Gabriel's cringey speeches <br /> <br /> You see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I love movies about werewolves and I've tried to look at this a few times to see if I'd like it better, but it just makes it worse. I think I'll just read the book and see how I get along. <br /> <br /> Do not bother, unless you have a 12-year-old brother or sister immersed in scary things. Anyone over this age can suffer and want to recover his hour and a half.
