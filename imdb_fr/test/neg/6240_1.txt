How can two big actors impose on movie buffs such junk? My only conclusion is that they and their director think that NO movie in which they play MUST be seen and applauded, <br /> <br /> Now let's move on to the movie - probably the worst "thriller" that I have seen. The actors showed a minimal emotion; the plot was reasonable for a 1/2 hour slot (not 91 minutes). The FBI agent was almost a silly parody - his partner was said to be mute and did not say a word. To paraphrase Robert Redford, the villain was a meaningless crap! The film was long and meaningless - the only question was whether the hero would die or not. A really strange part of the story: the family waiting seemed to last at least several days; the hero and the anti-hero seemed to take only one day. <br /> <br /> In the end, a waste of time
