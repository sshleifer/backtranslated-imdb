This film has worked with some of the most predictable stories and shallow characters ever seen. The writer of course bought the manual "How to write a film about a space disaster" and followed it while playing it. In particular, the stereotypical use of astronauts speaking in the space of their loved ones, staging a courageous show in the face of disaster, has been done time and time again. <br /> <br /> Max Q seems to have been written in the hope that producers would spend $ 50 million on the project. But, judging by the last half of the film, which contained many lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only raise $ 50,000. To learn that the film was nominated for a "Visual Special Effects", Emmy absolutely swallowed me up. <br /> <br /> I think a handful of high school students who got a pass in media studies could have had more credible effects. ! <br /> <br /> And the holes in the plot are too numerous to mention. But I will choose one as an example. Now, I'm not an expert at NASA, but it's quite unlikely that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator will suddenly have a strong position in the control room as the program begins to take shape. It is certain that the program manager will call on a more experienced person at Mission Control than a twenty-nine-year-old who was not in the control room before. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves from this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to save something from this scenario in the wreckage of the train. <br /> <br /> I give this film 2 out of 10, with the work above the average of Bill Campbell in the lead role. by saving it from a lower mark.
