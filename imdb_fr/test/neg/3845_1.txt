It was the worst movie I have ever seen. I must admit I did not look at it from start to finish because cleaning the toilet was more fun. <br /> <br /> The "star" was the most unpleasant character I've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, scary and obnoxious are far too complementary. <br /> <br /> It's painful to watch, there is no acting, especially not from the star who behaves like a mentally spoiled person unleashes black actors open-mouthed. <br /> <br /> As horrible as it may seem to look at one of those who can not silence black actors, watching one of Puerto Rican is even worse. <br /> <br /> The name of the film is descriptive, it is the parasite. This film is a must.
