I really wanted to love this movie, and not just because he had Aaron Eckhart, but I thought it would be a good idea, because I like watching movies and shows that revolve around the chefs. The cinematography was good, but in addition to turning around the leaders, everything else is clich√©. Oh and Little Miss Sunshine was very irritating in this movie, although Abigail Breslin seems to be a bit irritating in all the movies in which she plays because she plays a lot of roles in which she whispers. There are good cooking recipes, but the food did not really play an important role in the movie, which was a big disappointment for me. This film had good potential, the actors were great but they had very little to work. I like a good light romantic comedy but it's just bland. And longer than expected, it seemed much longer than it is. This is not a terrible movie, you will not miss anything by not watching this movie. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 10
