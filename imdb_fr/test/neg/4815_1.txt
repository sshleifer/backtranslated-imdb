No stupid brain that the cartoon "Bullwinkle" has mocked a quarter of a century ago, NO DEAD HEROES proves that it is possible to scam a good movie (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) without copying a single shine of quality object of your booty. The acting is barely on the scale of access to cable TV, the plot is less nuanced than an old comic "Sgt. Rock" and only the mustache type "villain" Boris J Badanov is missing from the Commies. This film achieves the insane feat of being too bad, too stupid for anyone with the opposite thumbs to enjoy it.
