Herman made his northern drama with Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the formula fails in this ropey, flat, and artificial story of two delinquent teenagers trying to get season tickets to see Newcastle. <br /> <br /> Truancy, minor smoking and drinking, minor sex, teen abortion, bullying at school, drug addiction, substance abuse, depression, child abuse, sexual abuse of children, robbery display, burglary, auto theft, violent aggression and armed robbery, are appearing here. None of these questions are explored, they simply serve to move the story from one improbable situation to another. The film is not as well observed as Trainspotting, nor as poignant as The Full Monty, nor as representative of the time as Wonderland (which he shamelessly steals music in a manner that is too manipulative). I think none of the filmmakers come from Newcastle and certainly never experienced the social problems that the film refers to. I am all for the entertainment and the track record of Herman shows that he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughter and tears. Quite simply, it is incredibly short here. <br /> <br /> The film has a beautiful ending, but there are far too many flat and banal moments in which to sit down to get there. Nicely shot, not very well played, and finally fails on three crucial points: script, script, script.
