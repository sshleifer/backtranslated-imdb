So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie. I stumbled upon it and rented it because it was a movie I had not seen or even heard of. <br /> <br /> Now, I like slashers in general, but it's simply abominable, not even funny. In addition to being ultra ultra cheap and containing all the slasher film and drama, he has the most incompetent and inept direction I have ever seen. Now, sometimes, the traits mentioned above may be present in a movie and a little fun can still be obtained, but not here. Painful example of homemade horror.
