Oh again another Seagal movie. In no less than a few months arrive to populate the shelves of the video store. As bad as submerged? No, but that does not mean a lot. Like the perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to resign but is looking for a last job before being dubbed by his boss. He lands in prison and befriends a gangster who helps him to get a refund. <br /> <It's nice to see that Seagal does not play an agent, a cop or what he usually plays. We actually get a location in the United States in Las Vegas, it seems. Then a territory of Eastern Europe as usual. Don Fauntleroy does his job well. <br /> <br /> However, most action and fight scenes with Stevie are clearly doubles. Scenes from other movies, lack of realism and logic in even the smallest of situations. Seagal and Treech form a rather inspiring team (unintentional) bursts out laughing for a minute.Suffering the rest. <br /> <br /> Several remarkable faces turn to him ... asleep Nick Mancuso comes in sleepwalking mode to take a check. More rappers.Please? At this point, action scenes and intrigues are more predictable and generically recycled than ever before. It's an obsolete scene that Seagal needs to go out or hang up. He should have gone out a long time ago.
