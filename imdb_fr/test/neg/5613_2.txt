This film was made because the concept translates well into a two-sentence summary that can be used to attract investors. That is, the premise is interesting and salable. I mean, I rented it on the basis of the synopsis. The problem is that there is nothing beyond the initial concept. There is no coherent plot, no full characters, no real comedy, no interesting backgrounds, no surprises and no good performances (except Jon Herder, he does something with very little). It's as if people who lit this product in green never read the script but only the synopsis. And if there were enough people like me, it might have even made money. <br /> <br /> For the potential viewer: do not waste your time, nothing funny or interesting to see here. To the creators of the film: hey, you made your film, so what if it's not so great? Most people never see each other or see their work on screen.
