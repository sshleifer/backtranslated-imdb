I remember when they made a big deal about it when he came out. They showed clips every week on WWF television and everyone was excited. He made his debut opening weekend at number two behind Indiana Jones and the last crusade. Then he took a nose. Critics hated this movie. I do not remember seeing a good review. Everyone agreed that it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I did not know what they meant at the time, but now I've been doing it since the movie refers to gay bars, women slapped very violently and almost violently, as well as looking for toilets disgusting with overflowing urinals lol. When I was younger, I did not care about that. It was Hulkamania, brother !!! <br /> <br /> Now, I find it pretty bad, but still fun to watch from time to time when associated with Bodyslam (who has a better screenplay). First of all, Hulk Hogan's acting skills are just not great. he is a dimension like the character he plays in the wrestling ring. And in reality, Rip and Hulk are not so far apart. Kurt Fuller is a good actor, but he does not know how to play the bad guy. He is best in comedy and nervous dramatic characters. He's just not credible like Brell. The characters of Randy, the brother of Rip and Charlie the coach (in his incredible fight as a coach accompanying a wrestler to the lol) are the ones who suffer the most. Tiny Lister plays Zeus as he is supposed to be played, so there is no problem there. Joan Severence is passable and for all softcore dogs, she has a lingerie scene lol. In the end, you realize, what is the purpose? <br /> <br /> For this one (as for other wrestling movies or movies in which wrestlers are the main star), turn off your brain. You will appreciate it more if you do it.
