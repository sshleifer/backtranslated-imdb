no really, I'm not kidding here, people, and I can not believe how many people here have given really positive reviews! oh, wait, this is the IMDB comment section, stupid me. It is interesting to note that on this date, there were not enough votes to give this film a rating out of ten, but there are dozens of comments that praise the film. what does it mean, I wonder? Anyway, the script is terrible. the characters change their personality, motivation and actions each scene so that the film continues to rotate at a pace that vaguely resembles a rhythm. it was not even stupid behavior, it was there too, but the pure idiocy of the script transcended any idiocy of the characters displayed. for example: karl disobeys an order because there are two corpses in the desert and "the killer is somewhere here". It forces everyone to travel 40 km to find the killer, disobey orders and dismiss everyone. when the hero sees something nasty in the dark and warns karl, karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there is nothing there, they all go home. next scene, he refuses to let him down and has to hunt down anything. it's just a joke. yes, the monster is very impressive, but the shit that humans say about him is simply trying to undo its interesting aspects, and the times of predator and alien were very tedious. and the end ... the end!?!?! Jesus .... the worst movie I saw the year, and I saw bugter!
