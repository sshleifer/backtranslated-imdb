A handful of college nubile nuns choose to camp with a teacher. A giant druid wants to sacrifice them to prevent the apocalypse of the year 2000, they must also face bikers, an Indian and a monster like Loch Ness. To watch for only 3 reasons, George 'Buck' Flower (a must in movie B) is under the hand of a tramp and the other 2 are part of the beautiful Savannah (in one of his 3 non porn roles). Both have very small roles. Too bad, the rest of the movie is horribly bad. <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> Extras DVD Retromedia: Original Trailer <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 4 pairs of tits, 2 asses
