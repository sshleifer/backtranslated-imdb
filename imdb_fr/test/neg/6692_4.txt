The strawberry blond has a very good scenario, but I only wish that Errol Flynn is in place of James Cagney, he is not the person for the role. I think Olivia did a great job. This film is also a dream day, so hard to follow. I do not like the attitude of the male character; the way Cagney presented it was right next door. I give him a 3 for acting by male lead character. (If you like hard men who like to fight all the time and argue, this is your movie). The strawberry blonde would have been better if the main character had a more positive attitude and changed the script so that he would be happy with Oliva. <br /> <br /> This film highlights that money does not bring happiness, the right of women jokes. Clear and simple not the best movie, but everyone must decide for themselves.
