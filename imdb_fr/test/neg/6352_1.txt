I bought this movie for a dollar and thought I could never be wrong, my big mistake was to watch it. I enjoyed Ice-T's RPG and rap that gave a lot of class to this movie about Los Angeles and the world of pimps. There is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a training ring and has a career, but because of mental problems since childhood and the murder of this other boxer, he retires. He is hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls who work for him in their trade and make sure they are not beaten. This boxer falls in love with the boss's girlfriend and all sorts of problems start. It's fun and it becomes a big comedy that laughs.
