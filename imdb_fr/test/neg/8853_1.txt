Kairo, or Pulse, an English-speaking audience, takes place in Tokyo. Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso), Sales Representative at Sunny Plant, decides to visit her friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to inquire about a computer disc he is working on. when she arrives at his place, he gives him the disc but commits suicide rather unconsciously before her. Meanwhile, a student by the name of Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) has recently connected to the Internet and continues to receive messages and phantasmagorical images on his monitor. So he asks the aspiring computer Harue Karasawa (Koyuki) what's going on, she does not really know but it seems that the place where spirits go when they die is full and they need a place to go and where the Earth is one place as well as another, is not it? These spirits do not like to share, so they make people kill themselves or turn them to ashes or something, I do not really know because the movies are a bit messy ... <br> /> <br /> This Japanese production was written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa. From the start, I must say that I hated Kairo, I hated everything that was happening. This proves without a shadow of a doubt that Asian cinema can produce something as crappy as any American filmmaker. The scenario is a huge jumble, the thing simply does not make sense with scenes that seem to come from a different movie, sequences that have no logical meaning or that are not explained in any way. Kairo is also the most boring movie. I sat there this year. After two hours of work, it's a real chore, I really wanted to move quickly, but I'm just so nothing else, so I held it to the end and, frankly, I regretted not did it. There are so many problems with Kairo, I suppose the filmmakers were aiming for a surreal, ambiguous and deliberately incoherent feeling, but these are traits that I despise in a film if they are not done correctly. Then there is the whole problem of the Internet which I just could not identify, I use the Internet all day and it's not at all scary for me. Then there is the fact that Kairo as a film brings no entertainment value to me. I may be a Neanderthal, but I like the movies I watch to entertain myself, I have a meaning and do not bother to death. <Br /> <br /> The director Kurosawa has made the ultimate cure for insomnia as far as I'm concerned. If you have trouble sleeping, stick it in the DVD and stay deeply asleep within 10 minutes, I guarantee it. I did not think that Kairo was in the least scary, all the Internet was laughable. For the scary thing, you should see some of the penis enlargement pop-up ads I receive, now it's scary! I hate this movie, I hate this movie, I'm sorry, I just have to emphasize this baseline again, twice. Forget any action, tension or bloody because there is none. If you have a very nervous disposition, there may be some scenes that could disturb you, otherwise it's a friendly thing for kids, rated PG. Urgh. <br /> <br /> The film looks so dull and boring that it's wrong, the camera stays still for very long shots and when it moves, it moves very slowly, that's all the style of a Mexican soap opera. Since Kairo is subtitled, it's hard to judge the original performances, so I'm not going to worry, it's hard to take care of someone who does not even speak the same language and who does not know what he says. <br /> <br /> Kairo is shit, I hated it, it's as simple and straightforward as that. The fact that it is an Asian movie does not automatically make it good and that the clutter of a story, the intrigues of the plot, the fact that it makes no sense and that it is an absolute annoyance means that Kairo would be rightly ripped by American Production. The worst movie I have seen this year by far. Kairo got a remake in Hollywood under the name of Pulse (2006).
