An American werewolf in London has had some fun roles, but this one is not so good. Computer werewolves are simply awful: the perspective is completely different, it's like seeing them through a deforming mirror. Writers walk in the throats of many of their gags. An American says to a Parisian woman: "Is there a coffee here?" Instead of sticking to that, they must sigh the girl and answer him: "It's Paris".
