In all episodes, I have never seen real action or drama or comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot is so repetitive. <br /> <br /> **** Someone gets something old, then someone else tells them a little about it and how much it's worth and who did it and where it's from come and how much it could sell and if there was work to be done. <br /> <br /> Sowhile I watched about 30 of these, I realized ... there is no drama .... no one ever loses a limb or life or divorced or was hit by a car or plane. <br /> <br /> There are no car chases or explosions - not even a horse race with old cars. <br /> <br /> All these rifles and swords and nobody goes into a violent slaughter ... what gives? No pshycos, no ax killings, no old English in cursed armor ... just yap yap yap ... you have an old tea service that came from Germany in 1602 - blah blah blah. .. <br /> <br /> I'm still waiting for someone with a time machine to go on screen and ask questions about it, but no ... it will never happen and the only thing that happens is that some clogged An Englishman or a woman tells bullshit about something old sold in Boston or China under the Ming Dynasty - a big EFFIN contract. <br /> <br /> Can anyone ever kidnap one of the sons and keep them for ransom? Is there no extraterrestrial spaceship that will erase all the ground? Who the hell has written this story as a series and expects us to stay awake? It's about as entertaining as watching paint dry - only with comments. <br /> <br /> There is no sex, there is no comedy or romance, no action, no suspense, no action, no drama, no mystery and no 'martial art. <br /> <br /> This show is bad! What happened to models dressed in thongs and spitting lasers with a futuristic weapon? Antiques Roadshow - Take a blanket and a pillow instead and go to sleep ...
