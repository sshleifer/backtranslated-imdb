I rented this movie with the impression that it was "Scarecrow 3: Dark Harvest", thinking it was a continuation of the Scarecrow Slayer series (another series of extremely laughable movies and awful). I was not disappointed though. It was as terrible, if not worse, than I expected. I laughed during the whole movie. This film is worth being praised for this film that deserves to be praised. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be praised. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a pathetic reading. </ P> <p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p>
