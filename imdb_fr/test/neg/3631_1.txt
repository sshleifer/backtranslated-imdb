I first watched this show hoping for some laughs, a good acting and a good script. Unfortunately, I do not have any of these things. <br /> <br /> First of all, this show is completely unrealistic. How can someone go to a very trendy boarding school, very well located and barely governed by rules? Plus a sushi bar. A sushi bar. No school has a sushi bar. And what's going on with the huge ultra-trendy and ultra-trendy dorms? It does not happen in boarding schools! Everyone in this show seems to be perfect. Zoey looks perfect, has perfect friends, never has to do homework and is very popular. It looks more like a villain for me! I hate the way they use so many cliques in this show, Example: Dana the skater chick. She is completely ignorant and wears "edgy" clothes. The jokes are too old! I would not watch this show if I was you, this is one of the most horrible shows I've ever seen and I hope it will be canceled soon! Note: 1/10
