My tolerance for sneaky leadership was upset by some choices of what could be really a good waste of time. <br /> <br /> When the "romantic" intervals were likely to get me out of the story and in "How-and-Why-the-film-producer-at-this /?" fashion, you must understand that something is missing in there; restraint and good taste, I think. <br /> <br /> Brian Brown is a capable and empathic actor - usually. I think he did not like the project or the people, and it shows. I do not remember anything the other guy did. I can not even imagine his face. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it does not have to be good to be entertaining; some of the vignettes and twists are fun and even ingenious. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie ($ 2.00 purchase at the film rental company) against the opinion of the screenwriter; I understand he was tempted to remove his name from the credits. Pride, I bet.
