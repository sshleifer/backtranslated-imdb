My wife rented this movie and could never see it. If I ever want to torture her, I'll have her watch this movie. I watched a lot of movies with my 4 years old and I can take almost anything. Barney is refreshing after a Quigley shot. <br /> <br /> The plot, the dialogue, the cinematography and the acting were a bit higher (or equal to) to a cheap porn movie. I feel cheated with $ 3.69 that we paid to rent it, then 90 minutes of my life, I will never come back. I will say that my 4 year old loved it, luckily it was a rental that we had to return right away. <br /> <br /> I just hope that the career of the youngest actor will not be spoiled for being in this movie.
