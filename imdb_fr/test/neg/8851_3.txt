I saw this film because every critic I read said it was one of the scariest films of the new millennium. I really do not understand what all this hype is about. On the one hand, the dialogue in this movie was ridiculously bad ("What if something strange happened?" ... what ????). The acting did not blow me either. It could have been because the script barely gave the actors something to work on .... the characters are purely two-dimensional for me and I did not make fun of them at all. Another thing is that the movie is extremely boring. Extremely. Of course, there are some jolts here and there, but for the 112-minute movie, he certainly did not use his time wisely. Most of the movie contains characters that talk about things that have little to do with intrigue. What was the purpose of this? <br /> <br /> To top it off, the film does not make sense. Yes, I think I understand the intentions of the ghosts, but I am not able to integrate them with the events that occurred in the film. In addition, much of the film is played in small vignettes, which makes the story difficult to follow sometimes. And do not even start me with the end. What exactly happened there? <br /> <br /> I can thank Kurosawa for putting really scary pictures throughout the movie. There are very phantasmagorical images of ghosts and other disturbing images. If they thought more about these images and developed them, it would have made the movie much stronger. But they did not do it and elaborated more on the social commentary, which was interesting, but again, portrayed in an extremely boring way. Yes, it's a message movie. Ok, fun. I'm just going to get the message from my criticism here in the open: find a better way to spend your free time than to watch this.
