Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to be trying to take the 1999 theatrical version out of the blue (by squarely copying some of the ideas), but softened things a bit to bring it into line with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather dull and schizophrenic production. And, like all other versions of Mansfield Park, the character of Fanny Price is nowhere else. Instead, there is a strangely childish, bleached blond woman who never really develops as a character. At least in the 1999 film, the character they call "Fanny Price" is firmly established as a rebellious tomboy too smart for his own good. This "Fanny Price" is a complete enigma. One day, I would really like to see a staging of Mansfield Park that actually includes a representation of Fanny's character, as written by Jane Austen. A sweet, kind and compassionate girl with a shy personality and a fragile constitution. She is reserved in a manner and painfully honest, but also strong in her convictions, infallibly loyal, extremely intelligent and remarkably clever. At the end of flowering, it is only at age 18 that she finally begins to make the transition from a clumsy teenager to a young woman possessed. And she wants nothing more in life than to be really useful to those she loves most. This is a wonderfully complex character that I hope to see one day faithfully.
