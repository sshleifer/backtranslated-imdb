Huge disappointment. CLASH BY NIGHT has a lot to say and to tell and the dialogue does not resonate as true from these characters. It's melodrama at its peak. The acting is really excessive and very unreal. Only MARILYN MONROE and KEITH ANDES as auxiliary players give this movie any zip file. Wish they had more to do. I am someone who looks at the details in the movies. Two big questions ... 1 Who watches the baby all day when Stanwyck and Ryan are together and Douglas is working, then breaks a fight in a bar with his father? 2. When Stanwyck packs up to leave the city, why do we see her packing at her brothers' house where she has not lived for at least two years? Moreover, when everyone goes to the theatrical projection room, who is still taking care of the baby? These details really annoy me and push me to give the movies a note much lower. Who were the writers, directors and all the others connected to the film's thinking? Nuf 'said.
