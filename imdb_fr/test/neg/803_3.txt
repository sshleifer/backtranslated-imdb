Without being really the worst sci-fi movie ever, or the worst I've seen, 'Time Under Fire' is still way below average. The locals and the first 10 to 15 minutes are not so bad, it starts as a story of X-Files, combining Bermuda's triangular mysteries and time travel. Soon, elements of other genres (too many) mix, but the story never takes off beyond the interest of a television series. Soon, "Time Under Fire" quickly degenerates into a series of clich√©s, mixing not only too many genres, but also unable to create something memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers to remember the film up to tomorrow. Acting is bad, and the rhetoric lines of the script do not help.
