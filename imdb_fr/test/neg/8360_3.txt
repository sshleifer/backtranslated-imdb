In the real world of the arts, Elizabeth Wurtzel is the queen of the sexy drama that every guy wants to do, but no guy wants to wake up. Christina Ricci, her on-screen representative, is the ugly girl who longs to have an artistic life and desperately needs everything, but none will touch her. Therefore, in Prozac Nation, the 2001 unreleased film of Wurtzel's bestseller of the same name, published in 1990, presents immediate problems. OK, the problems begin before Ricci's mistake, which has the emotional impact of a thimble - is it any wonder that his best game was by far in both Addams family movies? First, she looks odd, with big eyes and a bulging forehead, which makes her look like the 2001 Starchild fetus: an odyssey of space. Secondly, she always plays with children. Third, the way the movies try to make it seem like every guy would be attracted to it. In a scene from the movie, her buddies Ruby (Michelle Williams) and Liz are walking around in Harvard, and all the guys' languages ​​are scrambling to Ricci, not the super-cute and sexy Williams. Hello ??. Reality check time ?? This material implored the Andy Warhol treatment. Here is his version of the film. A five-minute shot of a hypodermic needle. A five-minute shot of Wurtzel's hairy pudenda. A five-minute photo of her sleeping naked and smashed on the bed. She gets up, gives the middle finger to the audience. Credits. You see, less than twenty minutes to distil Wurtzel's entire life. And, yeah, Warhol's movie would not have been shot by Ricci. Even Michelle Williams would have been better, and after seeing Ricci's pale breast, I would take whatever Williams or any other baby had to offer me in a cinematic way. Ricci is almost the kiss of death for a movie, and his work remains a mystery. Think of her performances in mediocre films with bad movies such as Monster, Sleepy Hollow and Anything Else by Woody Allen, also with Jason Biggs, and now imagine another actress in her role. The movies could immediately look better, even great. She is the feminine counterpart of milquetoastist wooden actors, such as Tom Cruise and Leonardo Dicaprio.
