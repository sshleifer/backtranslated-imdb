This "film" and I say it lightly, is only pure basket. I'm sorry for the people who actually wasted their money to see that in movie theaters. I saw a friend's movie and I regret it ever since. <br /> <br /> As a black woman, I am extremely embarrassed to have seen this. More than that, I am extremely horrified to see that people of other races have been able to see it too and might think that it is the behavior of black people in general. It is full of stereotypes against all nationalities and genders, grossly vulgar jokes and lame one-liners blown by well-known African-American comedians who should have known each other better after reading this scenario! I must also mention the many rappers and hip-hop singers / rappers who populate the film as if it were a very long video clip - they had absolutely no place in the film. I guess they were the "Jiving & Singing Minstrels?" HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> The "writers", the producers and all those who had the stupidity to finance this "film" should all be shot or locked in a room and forced to watch this crap without stopping until the end of their days. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!! It's time lost in your life that you will never recover.
