This documentary on the glorified discovery chain, both biblical study and treasure hunt, all hijacked, may well have resided in his debut on television, but it falls flat like a feature film. From the first glance of its cover to the cheesy look, one can question the integrity of this serious subject, shown on the case before relegating the search for Jesus' tomb to a generic action font that looks like more to a national treasure or to a grave advocate than an enlightened debate and review of the historic burial place should. This is the sneaky way in which the whole process unfolds. <br /> <br /> Child more curious than researcher worthy, the explorations of Simcha Jacobovici seem rather complacent while his researches seem manipulative. Despite all the fascinating revelations that this filmmaker is trying to convey to his viewers, with the help of supposed evidence, a flood of repetitive statements reiterating the same research and discovery proves time and time again that The Lost Tomb of Jesus has very little information in support of exaggerated, though seductive, statements. . This is a very frustrating attempt to hit the audience with the same little factual evidence to support the authenticity of this grave, which ironically removes it. While relentlessly linking several of these mini coffins together to support the theory of Jesus of Nazareth, this research gives up a complete approach to pursue permanently the singular obsession of this romanticized archaeologist. There may be impressive factual data that helps to clarify many traditional dogmatic beliefs held by Christians, but the dark nature of this project has made it appear as a mere piece of exploitation, funded at a time when the Da Vinci Code was everything. rabies. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cheese cover art was just right. In spite of my taste for documentary form, The Lost Tomb of Jesus takes an always interesting subject and transforms it into a geriatric adventure hunt that is not varied, substituting any relevance and sacredness for the non-inspired motivations of this team. . At the moment when these tomb robbers have finished their explorations, having to reluctantly stop the research because of the demands of society, the spectators have the impression that the director insisted on forging this mystery, whether it is there or not. There are some really powerful moments in which the rooms of history parade without pretension in this documentary, but all decodings, explorations and theories of the world still leave this piece of ill-conceived vanity in a disturbing emptiness of apathetic answer.
