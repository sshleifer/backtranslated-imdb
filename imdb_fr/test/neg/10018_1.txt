The best thing about "The Prey" is the slogan ... "It's not human and it has an ax"! The film itself is a padded stinkaroo ... innumerable images of insects and animals make the audience want to die! No slasher fan will like this garbage ..... Look again at "Friday the 13th" and burn any copy of this movie! <br /> <br /> It's also one of the 25 worst films ever made!
