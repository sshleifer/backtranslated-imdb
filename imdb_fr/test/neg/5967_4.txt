I saw the film in original Italian. It must be said that the play of the actors and the interpretation are the most polluted by the tendency generated by the television to speak in a very stifled voice, without moving the lips, nor to stretch your tone, as the productions "C 'show it is real life "and" let's-raise-our-public-with-some-tears "-screen-writing. The late Massimo Girotti dominates the other characters for his intensity, his clarity of expression and his intellectual honesty. The film has good allusions, but (as in another comment before mine), it lacks a central point and dribble in many intrigues of lesser importance, another trend from television productions well known to the Italians. A few drops of style could be spared by the public, such as pastry (charm and aesthetics of cooking and sensual load of sweets, see Chocolate, breakfast Babette, Vatel, etc.). Ozpetek learned the Italian melody in the early 2000s and continues to hum ... I'll give him one last chance, though ...
