I must admit that despite all the media promotions and being nominated for Oscar, my expectations of the film were not so great before watching it. And I really found what I expected; a film trying to be friendly to both conservatives and liberals in Turkey, trying to be authentic to foreign audiences and quite funny for everyone. But we must understand that it is not possible to be advantageous for everyone. The film remains as an average for all. <br /> <br /> The whole film tells a story that took place within 24 hours. To integrate the news into the film in its entirety, certain scenes are added without any connection to the main story. These are mainly scenes of ice cream sales to eccentric local inhabitants (shepherds, old women, etc.), and each of these sales scenes is tempted to interest viewers in sketches with comic dialogues. The subject is mentioned as a universal problem: the struggle of a local producer-trader against holding companies and monopoly, but it was the interesting subject of twenty years ago. Most readers will remember Ferhan Sensoy's "Supermarket Hero vs. Supermarket" in the 1980s. It was the right story at the right time. Shortly after, the story is not strong enough and is worth a movie like now. <br /> <br /> Except for some gibbers because of the local accent, the distribution performance is so successful. Turan Ozdemir plays the main role with excessive body language, but he succeeds anyway anyway. <br /> <br /> By cons, despite a limited budget, the appreciable efforts of the director and the players obviously give a good mood to the film. But that does not give a movie well enough to be compared with the Italian neo-realists or deserves to be nominated for the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Note: In real life, the ice cream seller normally stops his own production. and be the reseller of one of the competitors of the brand Manda.
