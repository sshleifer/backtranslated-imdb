"Clubbed" is yet another "go-that-do?" It's a British entry for fisticuffs and will be sure to entertain gamblers who do not expect to be entertained moderately for an hour and a half after a few beers. However, for those looking for intelligent entertainment and quality, it is better to avoid them. <br /> <br /> There are so many false names in this appalling scenario that even an actor of Colin Salmon's caliber looks completely stupid. The action takes place in the 1980s, but you never know why, especially when they have not managed to get a convincing impression during this decade - it takes more than a few soulful records from the 80s on the soundtrack , the occasional zoot suit and a handful of 30-year-old cars. We then see central characters study texts such as Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" and talk about how violence should be a last resort, while the same characters seem too willing to start beating. with all the thoughtless, testosterone-driven abandonment of a group of characters fighting over a bag of chips. <br /> <br /> The development of the character does not exist in "Clubbed". Neither irony, subtlety or pathos. This is a film reminiscent of Guy Richie's early gangster films, which, despite their flaws, certainly had a lot more wit, a better editing, a brighter dialogue and more emotional punch than this little soft saga. In any case, they are 10 years old - is not it time to move on to try to imitate them?
