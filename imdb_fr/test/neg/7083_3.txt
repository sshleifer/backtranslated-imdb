Scarlet Dawn presents Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as a Russian baron brutally displaced by the forces of the Russian Revolution and must now fend for himself in a world not so hospitable towards the old aristocrats. It is also not suitable for any type of real work. <br /> <br /> Doug could have been caught by the Reds but his former boss, Nancy Carroll, did not betray him. Nancy has a big crush on Doug and they get married once in exile in Istanbul, which is mentioned throughout the film under his old Christian name, Constantinople. They get married and settle down with Doug now reduced to doing the dishes. <br /> <br /> But Fairbanks' former mistress, Lilyan Tashman, who always plays bad girls in the movies, points it out and offers her to resume her style. He was once used to committing a scam against American father and daughter, American tourists Guy Kibbee and Sheila Terry. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing that this movie has an incredibly short duration of only 57 minutes, usually those given to B westerns, because it's both tedious and melodramatic. The end is rather incredible. Doug knew he was participating in a special Thanksgiving event and that he really had a tendency to hide the flaws of an incredible story. <br /> <br /> What I did not understand was that Fairbanks had been trained in the military profession. to just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new Soviet Union? It made no sense to me. <br /> <br /> I would only see him if I was a regular fan of the main players.
