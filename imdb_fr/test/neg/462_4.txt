The filmmakers apparently had enough money to afford decent makeup effects, but not enough for a creature able to move and attack convincingly. We never have the opportunity to see the "monster" move from one place to another - whenever this happens (supposedly), the camera focuses on the "terrified" reactions of humans who are proximity. And when a man is attacked by this, he just seems to hold an inanimate object against himself so that he does not fall to the ground. This is still not the worst scam "Alien" (the two films of "Xtro" are even worse, for example); In fact, it's quite entertaining if you have 68 minutes (!!) to spend. (* 1/2)
