I like vampire movies, I like B movies, I love vampire movies, but this one has almost nothing. Some of the actors are horrible, especially by men. The story is not particularly interesting. With a relatively short time of 88 minutes, it still seems too long and you will find yourself a little faster. There are a lot of kung fu vampire attacks. It looks cool? It's not when it's done on a small budget. This is repeated very quickly. There is a little blood and blood, nothing that can excite. There are good sons where you can see the sons. There are good landscapes filmed in Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> Not worth the rental
