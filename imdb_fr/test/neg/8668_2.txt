I read a lot of Jane Austen in my day and I approve of several film / television adaptations, but this is not necessary. <br /> <br /> The rating is a 2 because I would not say it's awful so boring that you'll feel like you've lost 90 minutes of your life. A boring scenario with an even duller acting game. I've heard that Billie Piper is in Dr Who (not a fan, so I can not confirm it) but in that, she's afraid. There is absolutely no chemistry between the drivers. It's Austen, it's supposed to be a romance! <br /> <br /> Do not let this discourage you from Austen or historical dramas. There are many better programs to see.
