Wesley Snipes' latest film, presented directly to the video, is a complex mess reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The script is horribly written, does not take into account the small budget in question and tries to be too intelligent for its own good. Unfortunately, Snipes has fallen into the trap of having an ADR voice that does most of its dialogue and a complete narrative that occasionally passes through points of the movie. It's sad to see a guy from Wesley Snipes' talent make garbage like this movie and produce a tired and clearly bored performance, barely bothered to produce his own dialogue. It's kind of a joke with Steven Seagal, the fact that he does not talk, but that's not what I expected from Snipes. Maybe it's due to the producer, Andrew Stevens, who has already worked with Seagal, or the director, Po-Chi Leong, head of the appalling film Out Of Reach of Seagal. <br /> <br /> The plot involves government officials, terrorists coaching football teams, records with incriminating evidence and a large piece of money missing. Oh and biological weapons. Now, I do not know how they are connected, but what I can tell you is that the diabolical script is quite difficult to understand and, like many of these movies on digital TV, it likes to include a twist too much . The plot is also told without interest, playing his cards with people with shady faces in dark offices and alleys, and so on. It's kind of "let us sit and give some plot points to the sad bastards watching this movie!" The rhythm of the film as such suffers because despite the sluggish performance and scenario, the film has beautiful scenes of action. To illustrate how a digital TV movie has been able to stage a changing storyline, I present the debut feature of Dolph Lundgren, the defender. This film has had its share of twists and complexities, but the film has a last hour of action almost entirely, with Dolph under siege by terrorists. The plot points are told in the context of the action, in motion, while avoiding death. The film does not stop to tell us what's going on, it does not break the rhythm. As such, even if the plot was a little complicated, it was easier to forgive because the action never stopped. The Detonator, like so many of these films, stops everything to give us a complicated glimpse of who is bad or who is not, before inevitably going to the latter. These films can often suffer from rhythm problems. <br /> <br /> Snipes himself, as I mentioned, is pretty bland here. At first, he plays a character from the camp while under cover with arms dealers. At first, it seemed like he was having fun, but unfortunately, the rest of the movie sees him, and his occasional voice, double asleep through the role. Snipes only come alive when called to kick ass. However, there is a nice action here, with fast and crisp martial arts and well-executed shootings. The film also features a decent car chase. Silvia Colloca is a co-star and she is not really an actress, but she is beautiful, with a costume that screams "look at my cleavage!" The rest of the cast struggles with clich√© and uninteresting roles. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Snipes has better projects in preparation from now on. He has another team with Mario Van Peebles, called Hard Luck, then he will make Chasing The Dragon, director Chris Nahon, who directed Jet Li's Kiss Of The Dragon. Finally, Snipes is apparently doing Toussaint, a drama biography directed by Danny Glover. The future is suddenly brighter for Snipes, but let's remember that he was extremely well paid for his digital TV movies, about $ 7 million per movie or more. It is also amusing to note that Dolph Lundgren, god of digital television, makes the best films, goes himself with the pleasant Defender and the Russian specialist extremely violent and well done, and in addition, he realizes them with a fraction of the budget of these diabolical offers of Wesley and Steven Seagal produce. * 1/2
