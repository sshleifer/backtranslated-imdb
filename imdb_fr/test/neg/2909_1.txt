And I can be generous. The overwhelming majority of the film consists of looping videos ... the overwhelming monster, two women doing exercise, the overwhelming monster again, a group of people in the pool, the frightening monster again, despite the fact that he was injured ... you get the picture. I refrained from shouting repeatedly: "GET ON WITH IT IT ALREADY". <br /> <br /> And that does not help that the images they used were poorly produced. The sound is disconcerting with the image. And in the scene where they tried to become "artistic" with lighting and camera techniques, the lighting guy, holding the flashlight that provides the only lighting of the scene, is clearly visible on the Photo. <br /> <br /> My hope is that the production was the victim of a horrible disaster, during which the original audio track and most of the footage was destroyed, but they decided to broadcast it anyway , assembled from the editing room, in memory of the heroic team members who gave their lives trying to save the * real * movie - the one with intrigue and interesting dialogue. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of this and I am forced to conclude that, in the immortal words of Joel and the Bots, they simply did not care. <br /> <br />
