I remember reading that Darwin had a crucial experience in the Galapagos Islands, seeing the wide range of animal life in this country, and trainee wrote his theory of evolution. Not according to this film, it was inspired by the British campaign. OK, and as John Cleese-Right would say. Nor did I think that Darwin was a man suffering from deep personal conflict and a person who was suffering from dark reveries and flocks of anguish. According to this movie he was. It is unfortunate that he apparently lost one of his daughters, but I do not think that the loss of a family member would have had a significant impact on the scientific abilities of the man. Well, not according to ... you get the picture. I think there is nothing worse than when science is turned into a fable, and to a certain extent, this film tries to demystify the theory of evolution by saying that it comes from an emotionally unstable man which is just rude to me. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific research, calm and calm, and always thought logically. This film seeks to dramatize lucid scientific exploration without drama. It's like a Canterbury tale. I would not recommend it.
