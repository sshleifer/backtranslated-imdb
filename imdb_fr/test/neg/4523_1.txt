I have never seen the TV series or the previous movies. That's probably why I did not like it very much. It's boring and not funny, sums it up nicely. <br /> <br /> Given the budget that the film seemed to have, it is embarrassing not to be able to do a job even passable. <br /> <br /> We went to the movies without exception "and hoping to see a movie a bit funny that would not be too stressful for the mind. My friend fell asleep midway through the film and I spent the next two hours hoping the film would finally resume. A hope, who died with the final credits.
