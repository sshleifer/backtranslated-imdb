The director Lo Wei was known for reading race diaries and napping on the set - he tells us something about his "approach to film making, huh?" The reviews I read fall into two categories: 1 it's a movie so bad it's funny, or 2) it's such a bad movie that it's boring. <br /> <br /> Let's move on to the point we all agree on - this film is really bad. <br /> <br /> I vote for category 2. The story is almost incomprehensibly complex and it is even more torn and distorted by the remarkably mediocre work and editing of the camera. Lo Wei was so in love with this scene that he slows the frame so look at it long, whether we want it or not. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lo Wei was upset the day (or both) where this film was shot - he just wanted to hurt everyone, all the actors, all my of. <br /> <br /> Spare the agony.
