I watched this because of the description and the cover and again, I was deceived. I'm getting tired of all these stupid new DVD horror movies. Once in a blue moon, everything will be fine. It started with a confusing scene, then 30 years jumped and showed a couple a night during a storm, which was OK because I like storms and it put a good mood. Then it turned into a cool road trip where they ended up having dinner with some strange people. The rest became weird and then confused. I watched until the end, but I was even more confused when it ended so badly. I had high hopes for this film but it was more science fiction than the horror it should have been for television.
