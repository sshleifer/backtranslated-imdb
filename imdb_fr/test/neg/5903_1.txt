This film could have been so much better. It's a beautiful story that unfolds in very difficult times, yet it has been so poorly executed. The main actors have in the past done a great job and, in most cases, they have done an adequate job in this movie. Even if sometimes their dialogue seems frozen and forced. The staging could have been more concise. The bulk of the criticism should go to writers, who have taken a good story and made it tedious. In short, there are thousands of MUCH better ways to spend 2 hours.
