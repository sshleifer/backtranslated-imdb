A real gothic classic of the horror basket! <br /> <br /> Uh, actually, it's a horrible movie. The best thing about it: the naked erect nipples of Rosalba Neri. Extremely breathable material. <br /> <br /> Of course, Rosalba Neri is a valuable woman. I never even heard of her before this movie, but she's a lady who looks great. But honestly, it's her nipples that did it for me, in this very last scene, before the film ends abruptly, all naked and erected ... Nipples dream, dude. Sorry, I get carried away a little here ... <br /> <br /> Basically, I got what I expected from LADY FRANKENSTEIN: It's a shabby and horrible movie with a big stupid monster and ugly, Frankenstein, and a couple of naked breasts. And there is a castle in it. So, I was not really disappointed or anything. That just dragged too much to some places (the creature's first resurrection lasted for centuries, dad Frankenstein experimenting, talking and trying more). There was, however, a funny and foolish tribute to the original Frankenstein: instead of throwing a little girl into a lake, Franky, a Mongoloid, picked up a naked chick and threw her into a river. Made me laugh. <br /> <br /> Some of my friends have been a bit too excited about this movie. I was expecting a bit too much. But the erect nipples of Rosalba were worth it ... (shit, I really have to stop mentioning her nipples). I think I'll just finish this user comment now.
