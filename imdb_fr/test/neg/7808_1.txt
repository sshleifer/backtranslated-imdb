This film pissed me off because of its stupidity that I felt the need to create an account on IMDb to share my opinion with you. I loved Ashton Kutcher in "A bit like love" and that's why I always wanted to see this movie despite its current rating of 4.2. He is greatly overestimated. I was hoping that an actor (any of them) would judge the script and would not agree to participate in a production of such a low quality as now. It is very disappointing. The theme of the home session was much better used in "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo". What does not make sense here: the owner of the house leaves his precious pet to someone who knows nothing to take care of it. Second, the rule is to leave no one in the house, but the babysitter does not follow this simple rule. The door is not closed ?! Etc ..
