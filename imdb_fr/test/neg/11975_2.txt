Normally, I like to find old westerns (and some less old) that I did not see, to animate the evening. It's a great way to sit back, relax and escape politics and global problems for a few hours. But that should not be the case with this version of The Magnificent Seven. The cast and screenplay of this series closely follow the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment; a good old revisionist story, where the "wicked" must all be white, male, confederate (in this case) and preferably Christian (if that can somehow be included in the script). It's sad, really. The best movies of the moment are and always have been simply to tell a good story on the big screen, not to convey someone's political ideology.
