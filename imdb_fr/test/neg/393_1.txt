I have a word: focus. <br /> <br /> Good. <br /> <br /> IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. Okay. Discuss points of focus. I do not know about the rest of you, but during my first year of film school, they taught us a lot of useless crap, like "you'll all be famous avant-garde filmmakers one day" - but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called FOCUSING the lens! it was amazing! you give a little twist and wham! everything is clear as a bell. the person who fired on what Alice found must learn a few things about the finer points of focus. lighting too. this film is not only completely fuzzy, it is also lit up like the corner of someone's basement. <br /> <br /> do not even throw me on stimulation or intrigue. they could have cut about ten seconds between the beginning and the end of each shot. <br /> <br /> but who cares about that? there is not enough curiosity in this film to make up for the total lack of consideration for the movie's best friends - FOCUS and LIGHTING. <br /> <br /> The words are wise.
