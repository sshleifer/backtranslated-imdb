The only reason a hundred people watched this movie was that they belonged to the team, were friends with the team, or were obsessed fans of Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamas. Personally, I'm the "cult of Lance", so I was disappointed to see that, even if she was the star, she only appears by name. Playing in Newcastle, the rich criminal, Lance is a joy to watch, but all his time spent on the screen is relegated to the beginning of the film. Newcastle is holding a 747 hold-up that includes Ketchum (Lamas) and a group of forgettable characters. The biggest shock for this viewer was that the pre-party scenes were not so bad. With the exception of Aviva Gale, who looks a little odious and somewhat confused, who associates each line with the finesse of an actress, the acting is decent, and none of these lines really makes me squeak. teeth. > But once the flight is done, the movie falls asleep. Not only is their shot the most ridiculous thing ever recorded in a movie, but it's dragged on too long. It's not a very deep film, and you have to fill in your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring that I almost sunk in the head at two o'clock in the afternoon. It's particularly difficult to get through a particular sequence in which we watch all the characters perform the same task over and over again. The name of the film is "Rapid Exchange", but the exchange is far from fast - it is too long and swollen to the extreme. It might have worked if one of the characters had real personalities, but hey, there's only so much you can ask for a movie that's directly on Showtime Extreme. <br /> Luckily, there were a lot of laughs, intentional and unintentional (Lorenzo Lamas is apparently a master of disguise, which makes two or three incredibly bizarre scenarios), and Lance returns to the end of the film, even if is only for a brief period. It's a bad movie, and I probably did not have to tell you that myself, but it's far from the worst thing I've ever seen. I would not put it too high on Henriksen's film list, since it is in real gems with more time on the screen, and anyway the film loses a lot of speed once the robbery started, but the the best thing I can say for Rapid Exchange is that the last two movies I watched before were the mainstream Hostage and the pretentious Crash - and it was better than both.
