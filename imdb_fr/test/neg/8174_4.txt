OK, here's the short film ... This film is full of nerdy dialogues, superb actors and an exhausting screenplay. <br /> <br /> There are moments that are meant to be very dramatic but that simply come from humor because of the written and poorly written lines. I could not help but laugh at times that were supposed to be very serious. The bright spot in this film is the circus. Seeing the circus at its peak was certainly a treat. <br /> <br /> Some moments are also successful. But then he returned to the territory of movie B. I was tempted to stop watching him several times. <br /> <br /> I certainly do not know how he won the best picture, though. It must have been a slow year!
