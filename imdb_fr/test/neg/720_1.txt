This was an interesting adaptation of William Shakespeare's latest solo piece, but IMHO, a terrible one. Jarman tries to change the personality of the characters. He makes Miranda look crazy after being stuck on the island for so long. Prospero is no different - a mixture of madness and self-pity on his part. I could not imagine that Shakespeare thinks his characters look like the way Jarman describes them. <br /> <br /> Caliban's appearance is perhaps the only thing he was entitled to, but again, I felt Caliban was a deformed, tormented monster, but turns out to be an insane hiker, a northerner who stammers continually, not as I would have imagined. Ferdinand makes a brief appearance, naked most of the time and silent. <br /> <br /> In fact, to the point where I stopped looking at this horrible adaptation, there had been so many cut lines in the room. I think Jarman was trying to rewrite Shakespeare and include his own scenes almost all the time. So much text is cut out in the first part, which makes it not a play of Shakespeare, but a load of melodramatic and absurd waste of the 70s. <br /> <br /> An attempt at a more realistic interpretation of this piece at the end, but the game was never realistic and it was never designed as the text showed.
