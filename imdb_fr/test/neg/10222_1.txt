Now I'm a big fan of animation - adore Svankmeyer and usually I'm used to all stop motion apps; Then I arrived on IMDb and took a break - I'm still really suspicious of movies with a bimodal cast of votes on IMDb. Here we have another group - about ten shillings (anyone) and then very low. I am also wary of 10 with the word "visionary" in them. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are visionaries, but this character is not one of them. Despite my doubts, I have seen this film and I have to side with them. The stop motion animation was ok but the intrigues were mundane and, overall, it seemed like amateurishness. Give yourself the real deal, buy some Svankmeyer and leave it on the shelf as well.
