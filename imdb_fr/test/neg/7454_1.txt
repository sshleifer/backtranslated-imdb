It's by far the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie. My uncle's home movies have more talent than this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> The plot summarizes the fact that these boxers are playing a sick survival game with a man and his private army on an island. The man has a very cheap paper mache hand. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious in this movie. There are scene changes to the hat drop. For example, for at least 30 seconds, we see a guy humming a song that adds nothing to the movie. This is the worst dialogue I have ever heard of in my life. I do not think this movie could be worse than it already is. I would describe this as a desire to be a Norris action film that went wrong. And I hate Chuck Norris.
