wow ... I just watched this movie ... Americans have this stereotypical view of Hindi movies such as, ALL Indian movies have dances, songs and a love story ... It's pathetic to what He is far from the truth. This film simply exposes the Western stereotyped vision of Hindi films. Horrible game, horrible director, horrible cinematography. And all this by a Hollywood director. Most of today's Indian movies are much more content-oriented, realistic, touching and meaningful than this piece of shit. Indian cinema (not just Hindi) also covers a variety of different subjects. Like most other Hollywood movies nowadays, this shows a very stereotypical view of another country, where the truth is thrown to the window. This is a highly unspecified movie. Look rather good Hindi movies like Black Friday, eklavya, omkara, khakee, awarapan, gangster, gift, zakhm, dor, sholay, mother india, lagaan ... These movies are what the real Indian cinema is.
