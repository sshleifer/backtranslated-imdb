By and large, the first two films of Critters were already silly but in a fun and entertaining way. This movie is much more a movie B, it's silly but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This is the first sequel that does not really follow the plot of the first two films. Basically, all the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time (well, nothing like that, because the bounty hunter of this movie comes way too late) and the budget for that- This has again been reduced. To save even more on costs, the film was shot immediately with Part 4, which I will imagine will be just as serious, because it follows directly this film and was made by the same people as this one. <Br /> <br /> This is a typical B movie, which has neither originality nor entertainment. This makes "Critters 3" a true redundant suite, you can easily do without it. Certainly, things could have been much worse for this movie, but it's just not a good thing either. The film falls flat like a science fiction / horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> As strange as it is to notice how suddenly the Critters have changed in this one. They are about twice their usual size this time, without giving any explanation. They look even more like Gremlins than in the previous movie. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting only because It was the first feature film by Leonardo DiCaprio. He was about 17 years old in this movie and, of course, he looked like a baby as he still does now. I like to watch these well-known actors in their leading roles. It's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course, DiCaprio only got better, but he was already delivering his sentences in the same way as in recent times. <br /> <br /> Really a movie too stupid and lame. <br /> <br /> 4 / ten
