What pain! Pain in the form that she promised in her central idea, but she never fully recognized it and continues to make you suffer a lot. I would not say that this horror film shot directly at South Africa, Canada and the UK is horrible, but it is too bland, predictable and very memorable about it. This is a guarantee that you will forget it soon after watching it. I tried to watch it last night, but I had to finish it in the morning because I could not keep my eyes open. Even then, I could not remember where I got up, which allowed me to watch again from the beginning. The only thing that struck a chord was Andreas Poulsson's strong cinematography of the vast and deserted places of the desert. A beautiful, chic shine creates a striking visual sense, which can not save the film from that feeling of general emptiness. Everything else is below average and comes off almost. Like the grueling revelation of the beast. Huh. The special effects of the computer-threatening monster are tolerable, and there are some macabre bursts of bare flesh and bones. But there is too little, because we do not hide the fact that the script cliche wants to think about the generic character conflict to create tension and uncertainty. It would be nice if the withered scenario was more than just a superficial fluff, because it never generated a powerful and lasting suspense, but made it uninteresting. The main characters are superficial and the token support falls in the basket provided for this purpose. It's your stereotypical group. The performances of Scott Bairstow and Warrick Grier are colorless, and the beautiful Rachel Shelley tries, but looks rather tired.
