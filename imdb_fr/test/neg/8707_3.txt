If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see an Exodus Exact Biblical performance (or Torah), you will be disappointed by this movie. In typical Hollywood fashion, people who are not even in the Bible have been "created" to support characters and play an important role in the film. The role of Jethro has completely changed and he becomes only an unsecured father-in-law instead of a shepherd priest who has given excellent advice to Moses. God is largely removed from the film and the viewers have the impression that Moses had to fend for himself. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> This film is a typical humanistic twist of Biblical things and tries to entrust to Moses the burden of responsibility to try to understand what God wants and should do. Those who are familiar with Exodus's book will not only see inconsistencies in the film, but also blatant changes to events. More importantly, they will see an almost total absence of God's dialogue with Moses, which determines all that Moses does after the burning bush. Far from being alone as described in the film, Moses is guided by God with a detailed and direct communication. <br /> <br /> Even Hallmark apparently can not recognize the direct role of God and, without his words to Moses, many events make no sense. To compensate, Hallmark has actually changed some things. For example, after the golden calf, God hits people and they have to look at the symbol of a snake to live. Hallmark creates a civil war instead and the Israelites take sides and then slaughter each other. The side of Moses prevails of course. <br /> <br /> This film may be of little value to unbelievers, as it may lead them to seek answers, but believers should stay away. Twisted events and changes make it a danger for those who do not know their Bible. Read Exodus for yourself, there is no substitute.
