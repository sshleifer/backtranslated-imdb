This 1988 film was recently aired on a cable channel. We wanted to see another movie, which was supposed to start, but because a confusion, Rent-a-Cop, was shown in this time slot. Never having seen it when it was marketed, we tried our luck. Bad decision. <br /> <br /> One wonders what attracted the people behind the image to go ahead with "Rent-a-Cop", or how they sold it to the studio behind the cast. It seems that this film has gone awry a lot of time. This film adds nothing new to its genre. This is totally predictable, because once the basic principle is shown, we know how it will end. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays a wooden church. This actor can do better, but who knows what was going on behind the scenes, or maybe what Jerry London gave him, had the opposite effect. Mr. Reynolds has an expression throughout the film. He simply does not record any emotion. <br /> <br /> Lisa Minnelli, the prostitute who witnessed the original massacre at the Chicago hotel, makes no sense. The romance between Della and Church seems wrong from the beginning. She and Mr. Reynolds play one-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this turkey.
