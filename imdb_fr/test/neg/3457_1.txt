The representation of Ichabod Crane's character was so terribly irreproachable that my wife and I were hoping that the rider (or some other character) would not only cut Crane's head, but would do it slowly and painfully. <br /> <br /> In fact, this guy from Brent Carver played hard - as if he was on Broadway. And he was such an implacable idiot that we had no sympathy for him. <br /> <br /> I could go on with specific criticisms of how this film failed, but I prefer not to devote any energy to it. <br /> <br /> Skip it and opt for Johnny Depp's version. Either that, or praise the haunted pumpkin of Sleepy Hollow (animated). It's good enough - entertaining for kids and adults. <br /> <br /> Better yet, read Washington Irving's original story.
