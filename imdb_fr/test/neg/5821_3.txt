I saw this film at our Crossroads Film Festival and I was anxious to see it because it was filmed in a mississippi and starring Karen Black. I was seriously disappointed by the clumsy scenario that never flowed and by the apparent lack of effort of the actors and the director to understand anything of the culture they tried to portray. How did Lee and Griffon become so deep friends in five minutes? Which of the two had screwed up the girl under the tree? It was not clear. And, there seems to be a law in Hollywood about southern accents, and you never hear anything that comes off the sounds of the south. Despite the terrible, "it must be like that, just soften the approach" r "" to dialogue, so many times the actors come out completely. Aleksa sounded particularly like a difficult New York street during "emotional" scenes, and no one sounded like a mississippian at all. The character of Walt Goggins was supposed to come from the city of Morgan. Louisiana, however, does not sound like the mix of this city with the accents of New Orleans and Cajuns. The other annoying point seemed to be an incentive on the part of the writer to make us feel that every man had to have homosexual impulses in him. Before I start a fire storm here and I'm accused of homophobia, I liked many movies about gay love topics, including "punks", "when love comes" and "b monkey" ". But it seemed like a man's wish for all young men. Well, Tennessee Williams has already covered this field and done a much better job. So I wonder if the Coen brothers can get an unforgettable regional accents and culture in movies in Minnesota and Mississippi, why could not anyone else? What a waste of time.
