If you come in this movie to learn something about depression, forget it: you will not know anything except how not to write a script on the subject. I understand that the intention was to show how a severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen in a Hollywood feature film ... is not an easy task. Christina Ricci, as Elizabeth spends the entire movie screaming, viciously insulting someone, bursting into tears or a combination of all three (the only exceptions being silent sulkings at the beginning and end). There is not the slightest hint of what she might look like WITHOUT depression ... not the slightest glimmer of other aspects of her personality ... she screams just. At one point, her roommate said to her, "Lizzie, you're such a fun person to be around when you're not depressed," and my reaction was, "She IS?" It seemed odd that the authors included this comment without giving us examples, but this script is a lesson of incompetence. It has no discernible structure or flow; instead, it consists of a series of clumsy scenes chained with screaming Lizzie, and then ends. Character development? No ... Scenes from his daily life, that is, going to class, could this be important details? No ... Shouting at maximum volume? CHECK. It's not enough, I'm scared. 1/10.
