I can not forget how terrible this movie was. My eyes want to come out of my head and my ears are gushing from the blood of the horrible and horrible soundtrack. There are four children and a dog running away from the hospital, then stealing two cars and a bus. Nobody gives them any punishment or anything to fix them. The acting is so horrible that it looks like a video instruction for a social studies course. I can not think of something that I like about this movie. Nothing. Even the kid who loses his dog made me want to throw up. He retrieves his dog without the lady even seeing the dog out the door. Maybe the dog was trying to escape from this movie. Then there is horse manure throughout the mixture. It was a torture watching this movie. Then, at the end, the elder says that staying together is not a crime and takes him in his arms and loves him. Stealing gas is a crime. Stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he should have gone to a juvenile room or something. Avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.
