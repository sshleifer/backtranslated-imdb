I sit here watching the movie, Tango and Cash. IT led to a discussion of other great movies from the late 80s. The ridiculous connection between Tunrer and Hooch, K9 appeared. <br /> <br /> Of course, I have never seen K9PI and if I still enjoy my life, I will never do it. Joshua cites this as his film of the year. Sensational. Sensational. I am quite surprised that this film exists. But much more than that, the fact that Joshua likes this movement disturbs me deeply. I think Joshua is an interesting guy <br /> <br /> K9 <br /> <br /> K9
