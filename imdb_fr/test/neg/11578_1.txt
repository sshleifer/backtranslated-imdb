I am watching this movie and I have no hesitation to watch it now. The acting is ridiculous. Half of the cast must be made up of retired porn actors. To get you started porn, you can imagine the quality of the game. <br /> <br /> The graphics do not look like anything I've ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more credibility. They can not even afford rockets for the weapons they fire under the pathetic pretense of monsters. I should also note how impressed I am with the number of bullets their guns can hold. <br /> <br /> If I were asked to summarize the film, I would say that someone scrambled a group of blind people at the county fair, slapped them on an island, added unnecessarily intense music and a The video is mounted at the age of 6 years. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not give an explanation as to why this film was published, recorded on DVD and costs $ 6 a day at my local video store. If anything gives me the benefit of knowing that I am a lot smarter than all the parties involved in this movie. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie with great intensity. Why? I wish I knew the captain, I would like to know ...
