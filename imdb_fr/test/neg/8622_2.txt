Most American remakes of European films are quite mediocre, but this is unique. In fact, it could even be the worst film (Sandra Bullock) ever made. I think I might have said it was another innocent and innocent thriller in Hollywood if I had not seen the Dutch original, SPOORLOOS. The modified ending here is pretty stupid (and executed with a particular ineptitude), but a much worse crime than that is to remove all the intelligence and depth of character that characterized the original as a classic. The real horror here is that the same man who led SPOORLOOS is responsible for this atrocity. Will the real George Sluizer get up?
