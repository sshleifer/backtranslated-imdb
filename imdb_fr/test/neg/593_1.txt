I'm completely into this type of scenario but once the movie started, I honestly said aloud: "I just rented a Christian two-dollar budget". The only thing I could appreciate in this film is that there is a story of descent, but it is terribly executed. Horrible actors, horrible direction and production. <br /> <br /> The director and producer must watch the cube before trying to make a film in one piece. There was absolutely nothing that made you so intriguing that you did not notice that you were in the same room throughout the movie. Horrible! The two main actresses were very easy to watch and you could say that it was the director who counted to hold your attention. But these two people and their biography can talk about it, are horrible in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this. Unless you are blind, because it could give you a few stars if you only listened to it.
