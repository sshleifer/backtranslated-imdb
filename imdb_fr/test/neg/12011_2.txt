"Problem Child" was a good movie, but did it really deserve a sequel? I do not think that was the case. Gilbert Gottfried was the only asset of the original film and he was not even good in this sequel. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand why this movie was so bad. For starters, it was just not funny. Even when I saw this at the age of nine, I had no sympathy for Junior (Michael Oliver). His character appeared to me as a whiner, a hatred of himself and perhaps the most important, a rebel without any clue. He seemed to hate all the women his father Ben (John Ritter) dated for the sole purpose of hating them. Nor does it send a good message to the children of divorced parents (who currently make up more than half of the children in the United States) when the woman Ben decides to (almost) marry is a vindictive Southern aristocrat who hates children. As he is. <br /> <br /> And as cool as I thought it was to see Laraine Newman, SNL's original casting comrade, come back to the big screen, she could not even record that movie. I also found it odd that she is a white southern debutant named Lawanda. It's more like an African American woman's name. But of course, it has nothing to do with why I do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the film did not work because you had antagonists that you were supposed to hate, as well as protagonists you were not supposed to hate. The character of John Ritter was supposed to be a good parent who was desperately trying to teach his child harm without complying with authoritative parental authority. Instead, he became not only a weak parent, but also a man who was desperate to find a woman in a few days, no matter how well he knew this woman. Did I mention that it sends the wrong message to children of divorced parents? <br /> <br /> In summary, the rest of the problems that occurred with this film include Amy Yasbeck, a useless and unexplained return to play a totally different character, this girl who was even more unpleasant than Junior, completely disconcerted for the humor of the toilets and homophobic humor even more outrageous and outdated (involving dogs who caught dogs). The movie was just a mess, and really does not deserve a DVD release if it has not yet received one. It should just rot on VHS with all the other bad, forgettable comedies of the 90s.
