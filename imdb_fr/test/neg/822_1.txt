Do not tell me this movie was funny or a bit funny. It was a complete disaster and one of the worst films I have ever seen. Ali G is only funny on Ali G Show Channel 4. After watching his performance, all I can say is that it is not made for movies. With a Daft script, or more like no script, nothing will entertain you. Filled with boring and unrealistic characters, this film is a complete waste. At the end of the film, Ali G delivers a speech. He mentions, if you hate this movie, tell people it was good. Even the speech could not save the movie, he probably knew it would be a whore. I would give it a 0/10, but the starting minimum is 1. Overall, do not even waste your time on this waste.
