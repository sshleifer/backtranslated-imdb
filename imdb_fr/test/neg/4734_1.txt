It's the worst film I've ever seen, and that takes the price of the rotten film of 2007 (which I did), anyway, this film misses all the ingredients of a good movie, it's to say that the actors had a bad performance, the story is just shit. I'm really, really disappointed that they could have done better than this junk. I just lost my time and money on this movie. I wish the production company can give back my money. Anyway, I was expecting a lot of this movie and I'm disappointed. I do not recommend anyone to watch this. So, if you want to waste your money on something, do it on something other than this piece of junk.
