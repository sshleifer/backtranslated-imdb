You can always tell if I'm watching a movie based on the number of times I cross my legs, change position, make a slight rustle, etc., etc. The least = the best. I moved so many times in the film that I managed to flip the giant popcorn pot of my friends and get a huge workout to strengthen the thigh. <br /> <br /> Sobieski, a young actress who has occasionally played in "Soldier's The Girl Never Cry" has given some promise for her musical talents, played badly in a badly written part. Depressing number one. Number two: Chris Klein was in it. Done number three depressing: Chris Klein had lines. Number four: Chris Klein played a valedictorian. Woah. The dunces of rich families unite! Even worse, he is really trying to act, but only succeeds in looking like a mentally handicapped suractor in a more and more sinuous independent version of a film by Cecille B. DeMille. Return to your American pies. <br /> <br /> This film was terrible in almost every sense of the word, except for the slightly engaging performance of Josh Hartnett as LeeLee's stiff boyfriend, Jasper. Fortunately, he refrains from trying to have too many "moments", unlike all the other characters. Of course, that's why he's so much better than others and he's showing courage. If you love Josh or are thinking of throwing a kid who knows a few things, he is your man. <br /> <br /> Hartnett is a shrewd actor, but the rest does not need to keep talking. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10 (for poor Hartnett in this terrible film) <br /> <br />
