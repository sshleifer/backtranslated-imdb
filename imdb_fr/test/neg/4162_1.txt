If you are a crazy person who thinks it's "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother, put her pregnant and give her back when she had an abortion AND do not tell her that she is related to you, so you would like this movie. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that the guy is married and has a son at home, it makes it even more disgusting and deplorable that he does not have the consciousness what he's doing He can not to do his job properly, his family, or Maria. He is a loser. This film is not romantic or positive - it is mean and incestuous. <br /> <br /> He walks slowly and leads nowhere during the first half of the film. I could not even finish looking at this pathetic excuse for a "romance". I'm glad we did not waste our money on movies with this one. 0/10
