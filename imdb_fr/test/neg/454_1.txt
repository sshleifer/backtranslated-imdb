From the weeks and weeks of promotion for that, ABC's "The One" was supposed to be "The Real World" and "American Idol". We had to watch these singers play, compete and see how they lived together in a house. The drama! Voltage! <br /> <br /> Where do we start with this atrocity? Let's start with the "judges" known as "Music Experts" in this program. "Experts" implies that they have expertise. Andre Harrell had at least one pedigree. He has been responsible for Motown Records for a while. The other two ... eh. Kate Hudson's uncle, who could have been labeled Mr. Weird Beard. He dyed his facial hair in three distinctly different fluorescent colors. I wonder how scary it would have been with a black light! And Paula Abdul wannabe, who did something that I did not think I could do: she was even more gushing and nauseating than Paula! She then over-corrected and became severely critical after the first episode. The farce of "critics" that these three were proposing was a joke and an insult, not only for the search process of the best singer, but for the public who are now quite aware, having already done so many times on Fox. <Br/> <br /> There was the host. George Stroumboulopoulos was not Ryan Seacrest. In fact, it was as drab as possible. He actually sucked the little energy contained in the program, dry. The way he got this job was the second biggest mystery of the series. <br /> <br /> The first was how did they choose the 11 competitors for this program? It was literally a talent show without talent. OKAY. It may be an exaggeration. And then, the performers must all be relatively close to each other, because if they were not, there would be no "competition". If only one person was "good", there would be no "suspense". So, I understand that they must all be comparable. But they should all have had some chops! In addition, the judges ran a "Singing Academy" and the program was part of "Fame". Clearly, these artists desperately needed these lessons. But you need extremely talented people to teach those with little talent. And that was certainly not what was happening here. <br /> <br /> It seemed that during the casting of the show, the priority was given to the elements "homelife", because all the players were very attractive to watch. parts how they vocalized. But the footage filmed in their house was so chopped up that you could not get into the stories that were starting to happen, so the show did not capture the events there either. <br /> <br /> "The One" had an incredible, incredible and fatal design flaw built into the results that made it quite ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The public called in his votes to know who he liked best, as on "AI". But then, after the revelation of the public vote, the last three candidates were forced to sing one last song. The "music experts", on the basis of this performance, chose one in three to save for the following week. And THEN, the candidates who were safe were able to vote for those they wanted to keep among the last two, returning the remaining candidate home. <br /> <br /> The "design flaw" is that candidates have the last word. I mean, if you participated in a music contest and wanted to go as far as possible, would you vote to KEEP the best singer or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival? Any CBS Survivor viewer could answer this question! And that's exactly what happened in the program. The person with the best potential was lost, and the candidates rejected "the one" who had no talent! On top of that, the competitor who has just been saved from the bottom by the "experts" has also been allowed to vote against the other two! It was a complete joke! <br /> <br /> Maybe if they let the candidates vote first, at least the "experts" would save the pain of two evils to finish. But that only confirms how much this program was not ready to be broadcast, how unsatisfactory the process as a whole, and how badly the producers had been guided in their attempt.
