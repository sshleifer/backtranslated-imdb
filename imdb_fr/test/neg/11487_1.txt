It will be difficult to fill 10 lines ... But I will try (to prevent others from making the same mistake as me: watch this movie (horrible and boring). <br /> <br /> I love Patrick swayze - he did an excellent performance in movies like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North & South (TV series), but in this movie ..... ARGH .... This movie is so booooooring, the game of actors is awful - the scenario is nil - finally .. I can not even find A good thing, nothing, absolutely NOTHING I was watching it with 2 other friends and we all agreed it was one of the most boring that we have never seen, and the fact that it lasts more than 3 hours (that we did not know) - when part 1 was over and he said "to continue", we almost shouted "nooooooooooooooo, must -we watch 90 minutes more of this movie !!!! "<br /> <br /> It's painful to see this movie: at no time do you have the impression that the actors are Russian, the action scenes are extremely bad. The ONLY good scene is when the truck explodes at the beginning of the movie! The rest is CRAP! Go clean your toilet instead of watching this movie (and do not run crying if you see this movie - you were pre-warned!) Personally, I would recommend Patrick Swayze to call his agent and call him back to this movie - its so bad.
