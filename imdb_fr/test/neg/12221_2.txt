I did not care about that, it sounded too artificial for a documentary. In addition, the filmmakers seemed to point me to certain characters, and yet I felt completely indifferent to the protagonist because of what they had chosen to show me of him. <br /> <br /> This film disappointed me, because the story and the characters were interesting, but the film fell flat because of a quick editing that did not leave the viewer time to understand each scene. The evolution of history was passed over in silence instead of showing men underpants or other things incidental to the story they told. <br /> <br /> I recommend you do not read this one and read it. on this story.
