I wish I could use the time machine to go back to when I planned to see this film and do other projects. I attended a free screening of A Sound of Thunder, so I can not complain about the price, but I would like to be able to get my 103 minutes back. The acting was mediocre and the effects deplorable. People should not make dinosaur movies if they can not afford to give prehistoric creatures an appearance as good or better than Jurassic Park. Spielberg spoiled us. Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the only saving grace of the film. I noticed that women under 18 gave the best rating to the movie, and the only explanation is that they missed Burns all the time. The whole 103 minutes. This film should have been finished in about 80 minutes. He just dragged on again and again. Do not waste your time or money on this far-fetched movie.
