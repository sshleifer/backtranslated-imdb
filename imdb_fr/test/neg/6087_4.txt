How much do I like this movie? Now, I'm not a fan of bad movies, but I like a film so bad that it's good. This is one of those. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a good behind, looks fabulous on the screen and definitely does not hurt his debut acting (I think). Billy Zane is suitably naughty and moody, although I still feel that there is something more in him. I felt it in Titanic, the look on his face when La Winslet spat for example on him, totally broken, shocked and shot ... fierce! Kelly Brook is a pretty face ... not seriously, I think that's it! It's worth seeing this: seeing a very hot guy, big Brook bracers, Billy's mean grunts, laughing at dialogues, admiring the scenery and the madness of this whole thing ... I'm going to watch it again now - yes I bought it !!!
