This could have been a major role for Valeria Golino, but the film instead decided to turn his attention to another area. The film is about a woman named Grazia (Golino), married to a fisherman and mother of three children. She is free-spirited and subject to explosions. The rest of the village and his family decided to send him to Milan and to see a doctor. The story takes place on the island of Lampedusa off Sicily and shows everyday life there with teenage boys in rival gangs and simply trying to find something to do on the sun-baked rock. Grazia's eldest son, Pasquale (Francesco Casisa), loves him and always tries to protect her during her fits of depression. The girl Marinella (Veronica D'Agostino) is a blooming girl who is enthusiastic about a local policeman and the youngest son, Filippo (Filippo Pucillo), is very impertinent and makes fun of the police officer's accent. Upon learning that she must be sent to Milan, Grazia escapes and Pasquale helps her by hiding her in a cave while everyone searches for her. This film could have had more impact if he had been able to focus his attention on Grazia. We see angry outbursts and irrational behavior on his part, but they do not follow those scenes. Nothing comes out. The film has a beautiful image and is beautifully photographed, so thank the director Emanuele Crialese for that, but the story must focus on something more substantial. The film does a good job showing us how life is on this island and what is happening in the lives of the three growing up children. According to their speculations, the character of Golino suggests that it is a creature resembling a mermaid and that is why she has difficulty living on dry land. I also have the impression that the island itself expects its people to behave in a certain way. Otherwise, you may be subject to the harsh realities of its rules. All speculation but I think the attention of the film could have stayed with the character of Grazia. After she hid in the cave, she really has nothing to do. In a sense, the character becomes stagnant. I wish that Golino has more to do because I have always loved it and it is still on the screen, you can not take it off your eyes. She is a bundle of fury, passion and raw energy! What a shame, Crialese did not write a more complete role for her. When the film ends, you feel empty of an incomplete story.
