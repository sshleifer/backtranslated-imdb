I rented this movie at the local video store one day, you know, the kind of movie with box pictures that just tends to go out and tells you to "rent me". Well, if you see that dull movie in your video store, go for it. Fight envy, rent a porn because this movie is BOoooooorrrring. In spite of its interesting opening, the film turns into repetitive murders and a hard stumbling thing, dealing with the usual problems (wife, boss bastard, etc.). Wondering if the fast forward function on your VCR works? Rent this movie and put your concerns to the test.
