I did not quite get Barnens O ?? it's one of the strangest I've watched. The soundtrack was pretty unusual too ?? written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre - this makes the film stranger than it was. I have to admit that I was almost going to change it and look at another one instead, sometimes the movie seemed completely silly or boring to me? or confusing. There are a lot of sexual references in this film ?? through them too, they are a little messy. Probably the only sentence I will remember is, "When you're alone, can you control things?" and "I'll show them" - or something like that. The boy in this movie was obsessed with the idea of ​​not growing up ?? "The last summer as a child" he thought once ?? and he certainly lived to the fullest. So, if you have a few hours to spare, can you watch this movie? but you will not miss much if you do not do it.
