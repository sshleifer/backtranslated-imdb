Well, I read the other reviews. I did not think it sounded good, but I still decided to record it. Maybe not so smart to read all the bad reviews before watching this movie, because of course, I would still notice strange things. Excessive use of fade, some strange camera angles and cross-talk for different conversations with the same people at different times! But noticing everything I thought: Well, it would probably be really boring if everything went in chronological order. The conversations are not so exciting, but rather mandatory. And the constant shift to black after very short scenes really gives the impression that the story is moving quickly, which is interesting. Skip the boring bits. At the end of the film, it gets a little exciting too. Will they survive? <br /> <br /> So I liked this movie? Not really. The director had some interesting ideas on how to keep the audience bored while trying to present the characters. But he's doing too much. It becomes annoying and sometimes confusing. It was apparently only the second film he was making, so maybe he'll learn and make some great movies in the future. And if you're sitting (in the future) reading this, you wonder if the now-famous director's second film is worth watching. Well, if it's good in the future, of course, watch this shit and ask yourself how he could make a third one. Otherwise, this movie is not worth watching, unless you're very interested in making a movie and want to see how you can turn the boring introductory introductory scenes into something visible.
