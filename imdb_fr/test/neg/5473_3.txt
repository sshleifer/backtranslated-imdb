Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing united in a horror movie; it always sounds like a great plan. Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation, who had already played together in such extraordinary films as "The Flesh and the Fiends" and "From Beyond the Grave", united in a satanic exploitation film dating from the midst of 70s. How can this possibly go wrong? Well, unfortunately, it's possible. To my deepest regret, "Land of the Minotaur" can not even be described as mediocre, and this despite the cast, the exotic scenery, the seductive title and the potentially remarkable potential. In a small remote area of ​​Greece, especially near an archaeological site, many tourists disappear because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile disciples continue to feed them with a fire-breathing Minotaur statue. Cushing, who never seemed more bored and indifferent to the role he had played before, owns a gigantic medieval castle and, apparently, in Greek, it also means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caves. This is of course very handy if your favorite hobby is the removal of random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends disappear so mysteriously in the same area, Father Roch, a priest from several cities before, decides to investigate. "Land of the Minotaur" is a boring and extremely slow horror effort that never really undertakes major trials to generate a satanic atmosphere and does not care to develop all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivial details. The titular Minotaur, for example, is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with a bull's head and a person's body, but for some inexplicable reason, the script never deepens its meaning. Instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and inappropriate loud music modified by experimental noises. Donald Pleasance is the only reason to think to give a chance to this major disappointment of a film. His impolitic, authoritarian and old-fashioned priesthood, which criticizes everything that represents modern youth, is as powerful and reliable as ever.
