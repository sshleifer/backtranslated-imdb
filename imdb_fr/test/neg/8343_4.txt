This film is ok, silly enough and to be taken lightly. But what I do not support are the many heroes and the commentary ILLEGALY SENTIMENTAL of this boy towards the end: "Look, they are all alike". Did it not go far beyond the standards of good taste? I thought it was disgusting, just like the heroic and unselfish acts of some characters in this movie. I'm not saying that it will not happen like that, but zooming in on all this bravery like that hurts my stomach.
