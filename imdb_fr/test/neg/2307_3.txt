Film based on the hit novel by Jacqueline Susann. This is Robin Stone (John Phillip Law), a ruthless TV host who is making his way to the top. He details his love life focusing on Amanda (Jodi Wexler) and Judith (Dyan Cannon). It also shows his total inability to commit to anyone and to sleep with a woman he may have. <br /> <br /> The novel is not a work of art (it's not even good literature) but it's fast, silly, trashy. But this film gives the impression that "Gone With the Wind"! This is an example of a manual on how not to make a movie adaptation. First, they condense the novel terribly. In the book, Stone's inability to engage is dealt with and she explains why. Here, it's high ... and ignored. There is also a really revolting scene in which a woman is brutally beaten. It's in the book - but there is a reason totally excluded from the film. And the book was about three women - not two. Do not even get me started on homophobia. <br /> <br /> The adaptation apart from the acting is quite terrible. The law is just awful like Stone - VERY woody and boring - you seriously wonder why all these women are after him. To be fair to Law - another actor had been chosen but had a very serious accident before shooting started and Law intervened at the last minute. Wexler is terrible like Amanda; Maureen Arthur is really incredibly bad as Ethel Evans; Shecky Greene is unbearable like Christie Lane. Only three performances stand out: David Hemmings (have a great time) portrays him as a gay photographer; Cannon is actually very good and Robert Ryan is just great. In addition, Dionne Warwick sings the catchy catchy song ("he passes"). <br /> <br /> It's bad, but I've watched everything and it's a lot of fun. I give it a 3. <br /> <br /> Also Jacqueline Susann has a cameo as news anchor.
