I like to consider myself a bad connoisseur of cinema. I like to think that most movies I call movies are the worst I can handle. <br /> <br /> But ... there are exceptions. I only remember three movies that I was unfortunate enough to see that I used the fast forward button for the big pieces of the story several times. These movies are The Mighty Gorga, The Night of the Seagulls, and this little shit, Deep Blood. <br /> <br /> In the world of jaw scams, this falls off the scale. Deep Blood does not have the realistic scenario of the original Crocodile, nor the incredible effects of The Sea Serpent, nor the commentary of Tintorera. No, instead, we are treated with a handful of teens from any random sitcom in the public access to the 80s, who are fighting against the bully and the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shark attacks are materialized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors struggling in the water, sometimes with a bit of what appears to be orange-thrown paint thrown into the water. water. Not a minute of original shark sequences exist in this celluloid dump. <br /> <br /> Normally, myself, or someone like me, would read a lamentable comment like this and say "cool, I have to find a copy of this!" It's the same thought I had when I read another viewer's review on this very site. As I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Then ... from one bad moviegoer to another ... let this dust accumulate on the board ... grab deeper from the depths of the depths or The big alligator to satisfy your need for something bad that happens hides in the water.
