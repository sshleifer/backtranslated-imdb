Black-and-white satire of a Madison Avenue advertising agency supported by blacks. They are led by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who is determined to make a difference. However, it is even worse than its white predecessors. It's about as original as it is. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it was considered daring and shocking in 1969, but it just seems ridiculous today. The jokes are either insignificant (the president is a dwarf, how funny is that?), Cruel or obvious, and the film is full of inimitable characters. It's done in a very experimental way, which makes it even more difficult to take ... or understand. The film becomes more and more weird and surreal. The end comes out of nowhere. To make matters worse, with the sole exception of Johnson, ALL the acting is bad. Antonio Fargas (accustomed to this type of film) is particularly annoying as an Arab. This gives three stars because commercial parodies (made in bright colors) are fun and there is a good rare line here and there. I heard it was a cult classic but it's more interesting than good. Ignore it ... unless you're part of experimental movies from the 1960s.
