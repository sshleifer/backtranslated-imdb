The first movie I saw of these people was "Children of the Grave" and when I heard that it was going to come out, I thought it would be good to watch it especially because Waverly is a real place that would have been haunted. This documentary / film was AWFUL! There were too many fake comments from producers, directors, cameramen ... they needed to keep their faces out of this movie. Rumor has it that Waverly would have been haunted for a long time, but if anyone who doubts this film is watching this movie, he will surely begin to believe that every story about this place is as false as this documentary. The paranormal evidence was horrible and almost non-existent. I heard better high school TEVs with tape recorders in a bathroom! They were trying too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary. Not the stories, not the blur too dark to see anything videos, not the pictures, not the recordings! Children of the Grave was also bad, but at least he had some substance and a creep factor. The only reason I give this a 3 is because the historical part of the show was very good and informative. To know more about the hospital's creation, its daily life and its end was the only thing worth finding in this two-hour shit.
