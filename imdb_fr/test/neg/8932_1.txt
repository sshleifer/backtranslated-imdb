I only wish there is a note lower than F to give it! I notice this not even as an ordinary film, but as a T & A movie, and it's the worst, worst, most lousy, and most horrible film I've ever seen. The music is all terrible, not to mention the fact that there is not even any nudity for T & A to know.it is a male cheerleader and the viewer is forced to attend many painful scenes from him applauding. it's the worst of the bad cinema for teens of the 80s.
