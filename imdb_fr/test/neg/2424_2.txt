This film, like so many others (Remember the Titans, Miracle), follows the basic formula of the sports film: there is a guy, it's a con. Jerk hurts. Jerk must respect the rules of someone else. Someone else's rules change, Jerk, Jerk gets good. Insert the tragedy (death, drugs, riots, etc.). Tragedy provokes Jerk, makes him totally change. Jerk must now play the championship game. Many close ups about sweaty players and bullets. Jerk wins. Quote from the coach or news or something that explains the title. Credits. Have not you been touched? These films can now be used to unravel the morons of society. Anyone who pays to see this in theaters must be slapped.
