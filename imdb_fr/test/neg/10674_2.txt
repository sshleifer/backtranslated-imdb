Well, some people might see that and watch a bisexual vampire murderer dressed in rubber and pvc kicking asses. If that's what you want and you wear a coat, cringe and think the name Lilith Silver is cool, you'll see a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> If, like most people, an assassin dressed in shimmering rubber and crunchy with a huge cleavage, a thick makeup and sharp fangs makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies that you will see. I laughed so much that I almost cried. The ridiculous game, the dialogues and the plots help make this movie a better parody than Dracula, Dead and Loving It could be ... hilarious scene. Even the stuck-up lesbian scene is funny (how * did she * get her boots off so quickly?) They were laced up to * here * ...) <br /> <br /> Do not see it if you like good movies. See if you like terrible movies and want to laugh until you drop ... It's not good, it's just bad.
