Okay. I really tried to tap into the (supposedly) silly and surrealistic humor that this film proposes. I am told that the Japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one shipped to America (see you!) And has fewer political references. Apart from all that, I found this sexual / political farce just as boring and useless as standard porn. The central female thread is pleasing to the eyes and could actually act. I'd love to see her in a non-pink movie where she could actually play her muscles (and no, not the ones you're thinking about). It is obvious that Japan can (and produces) as much shit as other countries. I could not recommend it to anyone, with the distant possibility of someone who has a Jones for Asian porn. Go see a real Japanese movie.
