Let's see. This movie has a lot for different people. For Finns, as the comments show, it can be right or awful or boring. For other people, it may be different. First of all: if you do not speak Finnish (me), you will understand half of what happens, because the subtitles are awful and even the title is not translated correctly ("Paha maa" would probably be idiomatically translated by Badlands in British English.)). <br /> <br /> Why did not I like? Because it's a Tarantino-style film: it simply takes a very hard reality and sends it back to you, as brutally as possible. However, I am not an American so I am not particularly interested in this procedure because it only shows that the director really has nothing new to say. Technical feats (the work of the camera is brilliant), script (not so original) does not save this movie from the bottom where it belongs. If you want to see a Finnish film, opt for one of the Kaurism√§ki brothers' films, which combines talent and directorial talent, with very good actresses and actors. <br /> <br /> This director should review his intentions and priorities: none was intelligible, and so this film failed. By not looking at it, you will not miss much.
