WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE FIELD SPOILERS AS IT WAS POSSIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> OK, if you have not yet understood the plot, I'll give it to you. Two couples go to a campsite, but a masked killer clown appears and causes all sorts of chaos. <br /> <br /> It's time for me to give advice to these couples. <br /> <br /> 1. Never go to the camp nicknamed Camp Blood by the locals. 2. Do not lie down or go out in front of the killer. 3. Do not run after the murderer if he runs away. 4. Do not shout blasphemy at the killer. 5. Make sure your cell phone is working before you go camping. 6. Everyone must bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it at all times. 7. Wear loose and comfortable clothes and bring a good pair of running shoes. No tight and restrictive clothes, no high heels or sandals. 8. Wear glasses or contact lenses if you need them so you do not stab the wrong person. 9. Always carry the keys of your car on you. 10. Turn off a campfire when you go to bed. 11. Watch your steps. If you stumble over something, you will break a bone. 12. Check the rear seat for uninvited assumptions. 13. If the killer has stuck you, engage at least one fight. <br /> <br /> And guess what? At least one, but usually the four main characters break all these rules of common sense. They are the most stupid characters of all time for a movie. <br /> <br /> Now, for a few brief remarks. This slasher film had a very tight budget. So low, four of the seven or eight actors play more than one role. The acting, writing, direction, sound, lighting, camera work, drawing, editing, etc. are all at the bottom of the line. But like the classic movie JACK O, it works to such an extent that it's so much fun and fun. So praise this and have fun. My rating: 5 out of 10
