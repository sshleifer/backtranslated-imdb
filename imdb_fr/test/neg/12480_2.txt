Lucio Fulci was famous for his splashed Italian films, mostly his undead movies such as Zombie or The Beyond. Here, he has directed a kind of black comedy, but there is only one problem: his nausea. I say that knowing that I like City of the Walking Dead (which is as rude but not like that). A compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by making love to ugly and deformed rich women, then murdering them and stealing their money. The film gives this shot a look so simple. I guess women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their money in person. After the eleventh murder, I began to suspect what I always heard about Fulci: he hated women. He must have. In any case, this movie stinks, it's not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with movies of giallo and supernatural zombies. Avoid this movie at all costs.
