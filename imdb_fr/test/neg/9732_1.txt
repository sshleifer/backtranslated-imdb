It seems that every time a mainstream production company wants to make a teen movie, it focuses on one thing: sex. Do not get me wrong, I'm not prudish, but the fact that these people seem to think that removing my stones is all that interests me is very shocking. Take The Convenant, a film that relies heavily on you to find the main characters attractive, thinking that he can escape without a plot and / or without a script written by a six-year-old. It's essentially The Craft with (so-called) hot men. And yes, that's all. It bored me to tears. Even my friend, who usually makes shit movies, hated him. It's incredibly bad, because it can be funny. I would have laughed if the other movie women did not seem to enjoy it. They were accompanied by some fussy looking dudes who huddled together and died when the boy-to-boy kiss (really cliche) came in late. Watching them squirm was really the highlight of the movie. I do not think Hollywood movies will produce good movies for teens (or, in fact, for anyone), so I think I'll give up. Unless you're a teenager who loves Pussycat Dolls, think Paris Hilton is "sexy" and watch MTV, it's like some sort of wasteland. Life is hard when you're fifteen and you love house art. :( P.S. Someone should have told the director that not all teenage girls would be members of boys groups "totally HAWT LOL !!! 111 !!"
