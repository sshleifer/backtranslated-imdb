"Garden State" is another of these "independent" type images that supposedly skimp on the values ​​of production in order to give the audience a true human drama true to reality. Curiously, the production is very good, as well as the performances (also quite large actors). The scenario is missing in Zach Braff's screenplay, which seems to come mainly from situations drawn from other films. <br /> <br /> When you're as young as Braff, you have not really lived enough to use the experience as a movie feed. Braff's experience seems to be watching movies, then rehearsing the same commonplace clichés in his own movie. In Garden State, he plays Andrew Largeman, a half-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown of New Jersey to bury his mother, who committed suicide after many years in a wheelchair. He seems to have no feelings about it. he has no relationship with his father, who accuses him of causing his mother to paralyze in an abnormal accident at the age of six and has no heartbreak to lose his mother (in fact, he attends at a party just after the burial one of his friends, who works as a gravedigger at the cemetery). All this makes you think of "Beautiful Girls", also referring to a guy who returns to his hometown to "find" and hang out with his old friends, with a small "ordinary people" thrown next. <br /> <br /> It's really a miracle that Braff can do anything in his life, given his useless father and friends (I'm surprised he did not commit suicide), who still live their "life" as if they were still in high school, partying with dumb bimbos, drinking and drugging, etc. None of them even recognize him from his television role as a "backward quarterback" (the character of Natalie Portman, the most conscious person in the movie, does, and say things like, "Hey, I'm remember you since the junior year. "These guys are losers, watching TV would be a cultural advancement for them, even a friend, who made millions of dollars inventing a silent velcro, has no reason to live because its frame of reference is high school and the party and you do not need a lot of money to party like a high school sophomore. <br /> <br /> Braff, was revealed, is heavily medicated, which prevents "feeling" and dealing with anything, really, as an adult would have.He then meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a kind of lost girl, who gives a pet funeral and lives with his mother as a 10-year-old girl in a bedroom that looks like an enlarged pink dollhouse. Anyway, they fall in love and Braff learns to "feel" again. The pictures are fast and furious. Braff argues at length with his cold and distant father and tells him what he is and the name of the game. In one scene, Braff and Portman are in the billionaire's house, playing in front of a giant fireplace, and the game is so routine, so ordinary, I swear, I swear I was pretty much expecting someone to walk. throw a sled in the fire. In another movie, Braff visits a doctor (Ron Liebman) to fill his junk, and Liebman tells him (in the worst line of the movie) "The body can play tricks on you. my ex-best friend in my wife's bag, and I did not have an erection for a year and a half. "Obviously, no licensed physician would ever say that, but that's a dubious poetry, Braff's nod to his losing friends, I suppose, to let them know he's still thinking of them, just like the "37" joke in "Clerks" Kevin Smith nods to his friends. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, Braff finds true happiness and lets off steam; the story is predictable. But if you want to make a film that is a complete cliche, give it at least some charming performances to give it a little life. And Braff does it. He has the type of position to occupy, that of informal acceptance, which makes his role as true and poignant Andrew an actress both real and poignant. Natalie Portman (also of Beautiful Girls) gives a big boost to the film. With her tiny features and flickering moods, she almost flies the image of her traveling companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good as the mother of Portman, and Peter Saarsgard (though much better in "Shattered Glass") is remarkable as a gravedigger friend. I would recommend "Garden State" if you can not get enough story-telling novels in a movie, but when people start greeting him as a masterpiece, they just are not aware of it. Braff thinks you can take the same old tired scenario, write some "f ** ks" and "awesomes" and give a tap on an acoustic rock soundtrack that gives a contemporary look to the material. It's not.
