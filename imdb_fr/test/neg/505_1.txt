This infamous Western is (in its day) the biggest budgeted disaster in Hollywood history. I had the "chance" to see the full 220-minute version in a theater in 1990. It was really amazing to see how the movie was. <br /> <br /> They had a superb cast, a story based on a real incident. (a fight between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s), beautiful landscapes ... so what went wrong? Three words - director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after "The Deer Hunter" that he came out and made this god terrible Western. He is not totally to blame. His previous film "The Deer Hunter" was considered a masterpiece and United Artists left him free reign. They left him alone ... and everything went wrong. Cimino insisted on redoing sequences again and again until they were perfect. <br /> <br /> First of all, the sound is horrible. Whole sequences scroll and you can not distinguish the words that the characters say. For example, the character of Jeff Bridges is presented during a dance sequence, but I still have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! It's the director's fault - he should have made sure the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are filmed with so much dust that you can barely understand what's going on. The story does not make much sense and Cimino took great liberties with the facts - in the real story, only one person was killed - Cimino made a massacre. There are certainly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by a lack of history and an incomprehensible dialogue. Moreover, the bad sound was not the fault of the theater: all the impressions resonate in this way. <br /> <br /> This bin actually closed United Artists and ended Cimino's career. A typical example of a director so full of himself that he does not realize what he is doing. Jeff Bridges said it was the worst film he ever did. This is from a guy who did "Tron"! Do not miss. <br /> <br /> There is a very good book called "The Final Cut" which describes in detail the disaster. I want IMDb to have negative numbers - it deserves it!
