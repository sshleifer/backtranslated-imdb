The problem with this film is that it's not funny, it's not scary, it's not dramatic, it's not intriguing, it's not stimulating, it's not, it's not is not exciting, it's not the least interesting. I recently saw this film on tape and was happy not to have spent money renting it. It's basically a bad attempt to film. I will not even bother to tell you the story. Story? What a story?
