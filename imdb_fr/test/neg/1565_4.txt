This adaptation contains two parts: <br /> <br /> 1. The "now", when Gulliver is at home in England and is soon placed in a mental asylum by Dr. Evil Bates <br /> <br /> 2 The "described" time, in which Gulliver describes his travels. <br /> <br /> The times are interspersed with a very unstable tempo, which makes any voluntary suspicion of incredulity much more difficult than if the film had simply done it. have threw this part and followed the book as is. In the book, there is no Dr. Bates, no asylum, and Ms. Gulliver is very little mentioned. The journeys - plural - are described as one in the film. There are several films on the topic of healthy people thrown into the asylum by a nasty person, look at them if you want that kind of thing. The "now" part adds absolutely nothing to the value of the story, it is a complete invention of film adapters and takes precious time to the real story. During all this time, I wanted the next trip to be presented. <br /> <br /> So much for the disadvantages. The parts that are really part of the real story are well done and the CGI is really well done for its time. Many small (and some medium) parts of the actual trips are simply cut out, but that does not end the story. As far as I know, the only version that describes the four trips, and for that the film should be the subject of a special mention. <br /> <br /> The two intercalated parts have an approximately equal time. I evaluate the first part 0 out of 10 and the actual travel coverage to 8/10. On average, I give him a 4/10. If only they would have cut the trash and would have focused 99% on the actual trips, since this reduction would have saved a lot of time, which would have been much better spent to fill the cut details of the trips. <br /> <br /> Why does an adapter think he's good at improving Swift's work, I do not know. My best guess is that CGI was so expensive in 1996, so the film production company felt the need to incorporate a lot of stuff that did not need elaborate decors, GCI, and so on. same time, producing a mini-series clocked at a fixed number of minutes.
