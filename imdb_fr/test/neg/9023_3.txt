Although most of Wayne B's efforts are entertaining in a fun way, this film is edited and written in a careless way, it's a failure. The first ten minutes only show Wayne and bandits night scenes interspersed with archive footage obviously shot during the day. Dwire plays a half-white, half-apache bandit with a strong Mexican accent and he does not seem to be able to draw any nationality from it! I give him a 3.
