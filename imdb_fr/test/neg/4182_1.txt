After finding myself in the trainwreck that was the first film of Dark Harvest, I could not let myself go to anything. Seeing that there was a sequel (or rather what I thought was a sequel), I had to increase my level of pain. Seeing that it had nothing to do with Dark Harvest, it should have been a good thing. We had no deadly scarecrow in this one, but rather a fool walking in a cornfield shouting little things like, "Girls!" and "Can you hear me?" sometimes. In addition, we had two (four if you include the two girls for whom the director wanted the same effect as the twins of The Shining): unpleasant little girls who could not play. And the icing on the cake should be the Corn Buddy. I should have known that this movie was going to be terrible when the dog got an opening credit. How I managed to stay awake through this movie, I'll never know.
