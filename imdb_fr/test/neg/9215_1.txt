In my opinion, the end is what completely ruined the whole thing. The initial idea of ​​suddenly making someone understand that they were the son of God and the second coming were somewhat intelligent. People began to believe him and his friends became the new disciples. People were going crazy, demons had people, all kinds of fun. Of course, everything went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to take the impossible task of going through a multitude of writings to find the "third testament" in five days, but in the end it became that ridiculous humanistic fantasy. I will not spoil it, but I will simply say that it is as if it were written by a teenager with a very limited knowledge of theology. I hear they are doing an American version of this story, I only hope they change the end.
