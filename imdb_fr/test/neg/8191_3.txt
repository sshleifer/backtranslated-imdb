I stumbled upon this movie while I was looking for something to watch while having lunch. In fact, I turned to the WE network because he said that the last 20 minutes of a movie about the importance of "staying true" to a gym team - I imagined that goodness was corny. Well, I'm very good. <br /> <br /> First, I missed 20 to 40 minutes at the beginning of the film. Fortunately, most were recapitulated fairly quickly, especially in the bedroom scene where Crystal admits she felt responsible for the death of her rapist. <br /> <br /> I love Jenny Garth and watched her pretty much everywhere. She is so pretty and I want my lipstick to be as perfect as hers. She looks great all through this movie and does not really get older on what seems to be more than a decade. <br /> <br /> Overall, I felt bad for the actors watching this movie. All tried to sell their pieces, but they were so poorly written that it was a constant struggle. Frankly, I was surprised to see Terry Farrell and Mitch Ryan (Greg's father of Dharma and Greg) about it. <br /> <br /> But writing was not the worst part of this movie. About half an hour before the end, his mother dies and when they show the tombstone, the date of death is 1979. Having missed the beginning, I had the impression, in the cabinet, that it was happening in the 80s. Not a leisure suit or a bell bottom in sight. Shame on the person who made the custody of this movie! Do not get me wrong, all the outfits of this movie were beautiful, but they were completely wrong for the period. I almost wonder if they told the wardrobe that it was a vintage piece. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - good to laugh or feed a solution from Jennie Garth. :)
