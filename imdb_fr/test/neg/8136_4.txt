Of course, I disappeared in the movies. Neil Young's concert movie "Heart of Gold". <br /> <br /> There have been many great concert films over the years. The best being "The Last Waltz" by Martin Scorsese, who filmed the band's last show at Filmore West. A phenomenal concert and a phenomenal film, if you like rock and roll and you feel like you're born in it and you're part of the music, and if you could be part of the band if you had a better guitar and somebody one would show it to you. the chords and with a few chords and a lyrical or two, you could change the world ... as you can guess, I felt all five deep in my twenty-four year old soul. <br /> <br /> Neil Young was in "The Last Waltz". Before digital, they had to manually scratch a large hanging cocaine stone that was coming out of his nose. Thus, in the film, there is a bright light that is not the star of Bethlehem hanging over his lip and below his nostril. it's a bit of rock and roll history. <br /> <br /> But "The Last Waltz" was created when the band, Neil and all the others were in their thirties, and "Heart of Gold" was shot last year when Neil was in his sixties and his band seems they reached the late 90s and the entire film could be used visually by the Christian right and the DEA in the same way as those films of the Ohio State Patrol on the dangers of driving drunk while I was in high school, showing teenage windows before or hanging trees or bloody in a ditch. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes and this is a fantastic concert, open them and watch the hidden portrait of Dorian Gray. The case, Emmylou Harris, formerly of an ethereal beauty, literally came out of the darkness to sing with Neil and, from darkness to light, appearing like a ghost ring that arose from the river in front of Rivendale. Terrifying, ghostly, a nose that does not appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery, eyes that give buttons a realistic appearance, and the ability to express an emotion, human or otherwise , embarrassed by the indulgence with Botox. My mind has been racing ... of porcupine ... of Peru ... of Jack Daniels ... of living hard for decades ... my god ... the sweet Emmylou Harris I saw sing for free at Fred's in Boulder, a 2000 year old face the dead pharaoh would not accept. But the voice, as pure as a thick bottle of Boulder beer with lips, brewed in the waters of Boulder Creek and I closed our eyes and felt ammmmmbberberrrrrrrrrrrrrrssss (a tribute ... we must use this tribute at least one times in any movie review ... at Fred's Burgers on Boulder Mall and Steve Martin's Pink Panther). <br /> <br /> It would have been a great concert sitting in the darkness of the Ryman auditorium, about twenty rows. But, up close, it was a medieval play describing the horrors of indulgence and the consequences of a sinful life. <br /> <br /> The theme of the concert, illustrated in the landscape, A Prairie Wind ... the last song, Massed Guitar (I counted eight) and I wondered if the irony was at the rendezvous you. I do not think so. A Native American bassist, a lead guitarist dressed in the style of Buffalo Bill, a pianist whose face resembles that of the howler in The Scream of Munch, the chick singers (actually female singers, recalling especially one of the missing youths from the stewardesses who still crisscross the friendly sky) dressed in full-length matching denim dresses ... no, she was played straight. <br /> <br /> None of them had seen, I bet, a strong wind. <br /> <br /> This will be an excellent CD, and would be happy to tell stories of the hippie Dippy Boulder when Neil was a long-haired Canadian crooner whose indecipherable lyrics seemed to reflect grief and loss, feelings too universal than now. . <br /> <br /> But, only in a dark bar.
