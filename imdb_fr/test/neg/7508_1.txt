Now, I'm a big fan of Zombie movies. I admit that zombie movies are usually not that good, but I love them anyway. Despite the role play and worthless dialogues that occur in almost every Zombie movie, this one is by far the worst. You see, there are some basic rules with zombie movies. 1. Zombies are suicidal. Tactics are rarely used and NEVER act like a boxer. They do not dodge a blow to the head, they take it with an awful smile. They do not try to hit you in the face, they grab you by the arm and bite! 2. Zombies can not talk. Only in Evil Dead. Otherwise, they do not speak. 3. You do not fight zombies with melee weapons. You lose in a melee fight against the zombies. Firearms are used. In this film however, the scrum is the way to go, which is wrong. Very bad. <br /> <br /> He has NO quality who redeems. <br /> <br /> If you would like to watch a Zombie movie, watch it with an average score greater than 3 on IMDb.com
