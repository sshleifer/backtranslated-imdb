I recently rented this movie on DVD and thought it would be an interesting choice since I'm from the north of England (Bradford) and I'm also interested in making a movie. However, it soon became clear that this film seemed to lack a decent level of development depending on the scenarios. The characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance. The subject could be an interesting basis for a movie. However, the delivery of this seemed naive and fuzzy. <br /> <br /> The end had the impression of judging the characters - punishing and rewarding the efforts of the filmmakers. It seemed a bit awkward and silly, and seemed to contradict the "realism" used in the filming style. For me, the film dealt with the characters and the subject in a rather heavy and clumsy way. I had the impression that the writer had already decided how he wanted to put an end to the story and make every effort to make everything else fit. <br /> <br /> Another point that is particularly close to my heart is the Loach think the film had. I am very upset that British filmmakers do not realize that British films are not just brutal realism. It has become an almost safe option. The film is a great playground for imaginative ideas and is not exploited by British feature film producers. There is a lot of talent here in the UK. It is unfortunate that most of these people end up making music videos and commercials 100% of the time or to the United States. <br /> <br /> Love + Hate would have worked better if it had been reduced to 30 or 60 minutes and it had appeared as a television series.
