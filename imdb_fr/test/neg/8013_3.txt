Well!! the film has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. It's a Hallmark television movie. This comes from a novel by Thomas Hardy. It contains Catherine Zeta Jones. She is by far the only one in the movie to act better than in my high school theater class. Oh yes, there is Clive Owen. I'm not British, that means almost as much as being a Thomas Hardy novel. Except he was in "The Bourne Identity", and I liked it. That's about all that surrounds everyone. That's really all there was. I become repetitive, but I like CZJ, so I held it to the end. The computer tells me I do not have 10 lines and I keep counting them. I still count 11, but maybe my style does not please me, but it's also my opinion of the movie.
