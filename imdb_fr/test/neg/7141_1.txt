Okay, first of all the good thing: if you saw the trailer, you know about 100% of the "scary / nervous" moment of the movie. And yes, it's a good thing, because you should stick to the trailer and not go see the movie. <br /> <br /> I now understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar did not stay alive very long in this movie, she did it. do not want to associate his name with this production. I wish him the best for "The Return". <br /> <br /> You have to follow 3 different stories in this movie, and they are all disconnected (in time and in direction) until the end. And even then, it's a very bad climax. And God does not even forbid us to open the door to another suite. <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, "The Rage and Fury" is running. No need to visit the house, just be next to someone who has finished and inside. It's no longer a curse, it's a bit of a virus. Enter the house, be afraid, come back to the United States and spread the joy in your building. <br /> <br /> It's not so hard to follow, but you do not really care about anyone. The line of the plot is slim to none and you have a lot of scene in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head ... Milk anyone ?? I saw Ju-On 2 at the Fantasia Film Festival last summer, a completely different story, but much better than this one. This is not a remake, but this time, maybe they should just have done it again. <br /> <br /> If you have to see it, wait for the DVD.
