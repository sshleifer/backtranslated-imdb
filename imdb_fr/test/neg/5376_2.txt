I guess I should be right and point out that I do not believe in ghosts. That said, the subject interests me a lot and I appreciate as much a scary story as the next one. I am a fan of Ghost Hunters because they are trying at least to give their surveys a scientific angle. Even the first episodes of Most Haunted had an entertainment factor in the camp. Paranormal status has none of these qualities. The cases themselves have the potential to be interesting, but like a lot of "reality TV" lately, they are suffering from overproduction, bad screenplay and silly scenarios. The leaders of the series freely admit that writers "guide" the stories. I hear they will even perform miracles in a romantic subplot to please young women. The show has many other flaws too. As others have said, storytelling is quickly turning into a blackboard. Above visual and audio effects quickly become just as irritating. I am ready to suspend some incredulity for the pleasure of entertaining ourselves, but all this bow "demon with a vendetta" is just ridiculous. Since the producers of this show are also responsible for dead goose bumps like Laguna Beach and MTV's Newport Harbor, I guess that's really not a surprise. If you're a hardcore fan of Ed & Lorraine Warren or a big fan of "reality TV", I guess you'll find a lot to love in Paranormal State. For the rest of us .... I recommend you avoid.
