A stereotypical story with all the tired clich√©s. I was shocked that the horrible scenario became a movie! Such a waste! How many ORIGINAL scripts are scattered without being produced? <br /> <br /> At the climax, I could predict what would happen in each shot. <br /> <br /> Oh, and do not even talk to me about the stupid sexual tension between the gorgeous policewoman and the paralyzed cop who can barely move a finger. YES INDEED. I can buy that. And then? Porn fingers?
