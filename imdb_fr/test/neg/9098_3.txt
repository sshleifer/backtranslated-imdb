I remember seeing a video of this movie on HBO when I was a kid and it scared me. When I found it, I watched it. I wish I did not do it. The movie was not scary. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around an old woman who runs the castle. She feeds this horribly disfigured person in the cellar of a 12th century castle. She continually beats the poor guy every day and feeds him. Well, that day, she dies. A few months later, a family settles. A father, a mother and their blind daughter. The father was involved in a horrific car accident that killed their son and left their daughter blind. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, the girl hears sounds, things break, etc. and everyone is not worried about anything. at all. That's until a few people fall dead. Apparently, the creature in the cellar has been released and is killing people. How this thing has survived in recent months without food or water is impossible! Whenever I saw the creature, it gave me goose bumps. The creature pursues a bloody slaughter and the police blame the father for the dead. <br /> <br /> It was a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 stars out of 10 Creepy not scary!
