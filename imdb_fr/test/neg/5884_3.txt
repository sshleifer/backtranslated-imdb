The title is unsuitable: the film describes barely a year of the so-called "divine marquis". He had a difficult time because he was threatened by the guillotine: the silent joys of the reign of terror. <br /> <br /> Historically, the background is rather crude: "The festival of the supreme being", an unsuccessful attempt by Robespierre to create a secular religion, its fall, a heavenly opportunity to show the sinister machine of Dr. Guillotin at work <br /> <br /> Regarding Sade, it is a downright mediocre case: he is waiting in an old convent with other nobles, a gold cage if you compare it, say, to that of Marie-Antoinette or the scientist The destiny of Lavoisier, and he exchanges futile conversations with a young virgin about death, love and other anecdotes. There is the obligatory "daring" scene, but you have to be patient because you have to wait a long time for it to appear on the screen. compared to current standards, can we call it risky? Cy Enfield's "De Sade", which has one of the lowest ratings of the IMDb, is at least entertaining, and Keir Dullea was a more credible Marquis than the aging Auteuil. And he was introducing John Huston.
