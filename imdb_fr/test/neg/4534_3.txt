This film had some fun moments. Louie, the main character was well chosen with other secondary characters. The film's opening shot sets the tone, but the direction and the story deteriorate from there. Aside from a twist at the end (interesting and fun too), I wish this film has a better direction and a more developed story. Without revealing the plot, the idea is better! I just wish it was better executed in this short film. The potential was there but he was simply not delivering the goods.
