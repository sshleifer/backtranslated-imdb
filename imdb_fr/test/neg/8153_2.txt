Cyclone is a piece of shit with little redeeming value, even if its forehead is so entertaining. A friend of mine took the tape to an overflowing laundry basket of St. Vincent DePaul. Okay, maybe it's a bit risky, but it was supposed to be a garbage bin, not an old shitty VHS trash, something the less fortunate members of our society do not really need improve their lives. This could be considered a pity. Watching a movie like Cyclone would only add to their problems. Be that as it may, the basic premise of a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle that she armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers is not even properly exploited. The two "high-speed" chase sequences involve vehicles traveling at speeds below 40 km / h, and a high-speed motorcycle that is likely to be overtaken by an old shitty car is not as impressive at mind it. There is only one scene where goofy bikes are used, at the climax of the movie, and it's ridiculously inefficient, or just laughable, when it is. This includes laser beams that seem to come from the hands of an evil wizard in a 1980s cheese sword and witchcraft that has produced large bursts of flames that do not seem to have a noticeable effect on their targets, even when they strike directly. The rest of the movie is just tedious to watch. Many bad actors, yes even Combs and Pram, are cracking, most of them seem to have been removed from the scene of a porn movie by exchanging a very bad dialogue for the desperate purpose of advancing the barely coherent plot. There are some badly organized sequences of fights and incredibly unusual comic relief scenes with some cops and the owner of the motorcycle repair shop. The comedy of Benny Hill, an excited old man, does not stop to look at the variety in the female breast. Basically, the "financial" scenes involving the bike that do things are few and lame and the rest is clumsy filler material. Jump.
