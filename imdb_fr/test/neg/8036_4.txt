Freda plays this late effort as a 70s Gothic thriller (that is, the 70s thriller), but lacks thrills. It's certainly not a terribly bad movie, but it has the same feeling that many of Freda's recent movies have from someone who gave up after seeing the first daily. It starts well enough, almost giallo like a tone, then takes a turn in the Gothic territories with a decent establishment (although terribly shot). Then suddenly, Freda seems to have lost interest in the film and we have only extended shots of Camille Keaton and burning candles. About an hour after the beginning of the film, we have a kind of violent climax with decent special effects to poor. This is followed by a slow-paced exit with a very obvious twist end (if it's even meant to be a twist?). And throw some very shy explanatory scenes along the way and you will get a tragic ceremony. Thus, some parts have its qualities. But suddenly, stumbles and collapses in front of you. Pity. <br /> <br /> btw stay away from the SHAROMA DVD, a useless edition, pan & scan, which kills what might be a good visual experience.
