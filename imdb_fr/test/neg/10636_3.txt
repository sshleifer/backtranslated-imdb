I just saw this on TCM tonight and was shocked by the role of Jean Arthur. Her eyes were wide-eyed with surprise and usually did not do enough, unlike Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was wonderful in his restraint and his comical timing. She is the best thing in this movie. Wilder's gags were plain and frankly more like something a freshman would write while trying to "escape" with being mean, witty and dirty, but just seemed boring and not funny at all. It seemed like the humor was too much to be funny. The end was totally artificial. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD: I never thought for a moment that Art Lund had suddenly fallen in love with Dietrich and was suddenly madly in love with Arthur. Oh, Billy. Get real! 3 out of 10
