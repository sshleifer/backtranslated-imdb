After reading _River_God_ and _The_Seventh_Scroll_, I can not begin to express my disappointment with this movie. Although I agree that a poetic license is perhaps permissible, this film is in constant contradiction with the books, doing an incredible injustice to the fascinating, plausible and wonderful stories written by Wilbur Smith. I can only believe that the writers, the director and the producers of the film have never even heard of Mr. Smith, let alone his work. Smith's vibrant characterizations are converted into wooden figurines, any historicity is ignored or ignored, the realism of the books has been modified to include more ghostly monsters suitable for a cartoon. And why does an Egyptian henchman speak Spanish? Geesh, no wonder the movie has been turned into a TV mini-series! Did Wilbur Smith help to make this movie? I can not believe he did it. Terrible and terrible film. If you have read one or both books, do not waste your time and money watching this money. You will be sorely disappointed, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Only a moment of supreme generosity persuaded me to classify this film as "2", and this only because of the superb, sometimes spectacular.
