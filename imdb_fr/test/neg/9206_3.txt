After the success of Star Wars, sci-fi movies sparked renewed interest. It was one of those inexpensive attempts at money quickly. <br /> <br /> A group of survivors of a spaceship lands on a planet inhabited by stop motion dinosaurs, half of which are systematically killed (the dinosaurs). Actor level porn movie. Cheap special effects, even for the time, although it seems like a lot of effort has been made. <br /> <br /> The costumes were 1970s, just like the hairstyles. Ahh, the 70's. I was expecting a disco to come out anytime. <br /> <br /> Nothing to really recommend in this movie.
