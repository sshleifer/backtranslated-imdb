I like to watch a good giallo gore. Unfortunately, SOLANGE is not one of them. It's long. Very long. The story is delicate and does not make much sense, although it is very obvious. The scenario spends a lot of time on murders and girls but it spends almost no time on the murderer. This leaves a big hole in the story: we might see a group of young women showering together, but we do not see at all why the killer decided to murder these girls. Yes, what happened to Solange is terrible, but we stayed in the dark when, why did the [boring] killer decide that it was worth trying to offer these naughty girls? Everything is so artificial that I could not get in a bit. <br /> <br /> As for the look of the film, again, boring. Nothing memorable about it. Players? Boring. The scenario? Ridiculously boring. The "hot" love story between the teacher, the blond and the student was really embarrassing. What planet do they live on? The music? Boring. Jump.
