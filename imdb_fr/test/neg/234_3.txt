The kid is born retarded. It contains half a dozen directions, a dialogue of features and an action inspired by much older and better-known flops, and may sound funny - if only the writers knew what it's funny. <br /> <br /> The content of Disney much better over the past two decades, but make no mistake. They should have left a lot of space for The Kid, sing a lullaby, then get the train back into a ravine. Euthanasia.
