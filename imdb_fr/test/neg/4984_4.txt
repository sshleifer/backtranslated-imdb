Featuring: James Belushi; Peter Dinklage; Alex Neuberger and Jason Lee Underdog are a true hero tale. Here is the story of Shoeshine, a regular and playful little beagle. When he is a dog nestled by a hell megalomaniac bitten of destruction, something strange happens. <br /> <br /> Our little unusual cabot gets extraordinary powers. He can run as fast as a cheetah; fly as fast as a superhero and has the power of thunder. He is no longer a shoeshine boy; he is Underdog ?? the best crime fighter in the animal kingdom. The city can not sleep until Underdog gets rid of the evil Dr. Simon Barsinister and his friends. <br /> <br /> If you want a really light entertainment with all the clich√©s of superhero movies, then this one is for you. For quality entertainment, this is strictly for juniors. Those of you who hope to take advantage of the comedy of the fast-decayed star - James Belushi - a warning: this is not one of his best works.
