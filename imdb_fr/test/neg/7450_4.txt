"Ernest Saves Christmas" is the special Christmas film of comedian Ernest. In this film, Ernest has to find a successor to Santa for Christmas to continue. On the way, he meets a girl who is a thief and ends up stealing something very important for Santa Claus (I will not tell you what it is, you just have to watch the movie for yourself). Like most of Ernest's films, there is a lot of wacky humor. <br /> <br /> This film is probably one of Ernest's best films. It's funny and there are important lessons to learn about friendship and family and not being afraid to show love. This is not the best Christmas film, but it's a good movie to immerse you in the spirit of Christmas. It's a bit sad that the movie is a little outdated now.
