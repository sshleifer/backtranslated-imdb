I thought Sliver offered the most boring and trivial "thing" that ends in film history, but of course I was wrong. I had no disappointment about the quality of this film. Unfortunately, it was worse than I expected. The worst part is that the obvious ending is so ridiculous and horrible that you can not believe it until that happens.
