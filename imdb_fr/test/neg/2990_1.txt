Bad ambient sound. A lot of reshuffle. Loooong useless scenes. Example: A man sees an interesting woman in the hall. Manages to stay there and watch it while waiting to wait for the building supervisor to receive a package. Say nothing. Stares scary. No more interference and other irritating ambient noise. Expect. Expect. Expect. Guy does not say anything. The woman looks frightened or at least slightly disturbed and rightly so. The manager comes back with the package. The guy goes to the apartment with the package. <br /> <br /> Another example: the guy and his host are watching the wrong television. No more ambient noise and brewing. Wait wait wait Guy goes to bed. If you can continue watching this movie longer, you can watch them watch TV later. <br /> <br /> If you want a story, dialogue, entertainment or a well-designed movie, look elsewhere. .
