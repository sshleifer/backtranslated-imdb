The recent documentary "The Adventures of Errol Flynn" is an in-depth look at Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart, Cagney, Wayne, etc., looked like blue-collar types on their screen images, but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner. himself trapped. If he had not been under contract with Warner Bros., he would have been perfect in the role of Cary Grant in Suspicion: the beautiful charmer whose smile of 1000 watts makes blind the fact that he is a predator. And he could have played with his best female sister Joan Fontaine. That was Flynn's problem: he was the hero of the ultimate screen until his own habits and bad timing caught up with him. In a way, Grant and Flynn are similar, but Flynn was the most macho of them: it's possible to see Grant as Captain Blood, but Flynn in The Philadelphia Story, Mr. Blanding builds his Dream House, or Monkey Business, or Operation Petticoat We turned these roles on their collective ears because he is too sure of himself and the sexual tension he would have brought naturally would have made the scenarios troubled. But this wobbly biography is only a plasticized vision of Flynn and his time. There are times when I was expecting a piece of laughter or an audience to say "Ahhh" at some point. It does not go deep into Flynn's life, but only in Screen magazine. It does not plunge into his struggle to be considered more than a derring maker. As in the clean biographies of Lon Chaney (the father, not the Wolfman, nor Lenny "Of Mice and Men) and Buster Keaton made in the 50's, it's just a piece of fluff
