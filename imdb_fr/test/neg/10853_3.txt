A very bad movie, an amalgam of clich√©s and historical inaccuracies. Some examples: in a recent scene, the Soviet infantry is attacked by the Germans; instead of remaining in their trenches to shoot them, they advance in open ground to fight against them, contrary to all infantry tactics; Kate, one of the main characters, is supposed to be the daughter of a white Russian obsessed with Russian, but she does not speak Russian; a convicted German aviator attacks an anti-aircraft gun - the gun, however, does not fire shells, but strikes directly on his plane, which does not look much like a German WWII aircraft. In all fairness, when they have been able to escape the absurd plot and the resulting absurdities, there are truly powerful moments - the representation of people slowly starving is made and moved in a convincing way, but only shows the rest more. A movie to avoid.
