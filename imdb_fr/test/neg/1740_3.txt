This faint attempt to fudge your typically stale Japanese horror film into a scary cult hit did not have the ammunition needed for the viewer to stay involved. Translated into a vortex, Uzumaki is just about that: an irrational and superabundant homage to the strange downward spiral of nothingness that has apparently captivated a whole small town into madmen obsessed with madness. While this is certainly a nice movie-b, the usual boring actors, directors, screenplays and screenplay will shake your head, except for Asian horror buffs. What could have been roughly translated into a Japanese equivalent of a David Lynch piece in its infancy, warns its gimmickry in a spiral even before it can explain itself, which of course is not the case. Apart from a few intelligent techniques used, the film rarely associates dizzying themes with dull script, finally appearing as a cheap exploitation in the cult genre, substituting hollow images for an authentic substance. At the end of the film, there was practically nothing to gain from interactions, except for a few tiny scenes or images going beyond the single-note movie. I congratulate the authors for having at least tried to integrate gender into more supernatural and metaphysical domains and to understand the approximate losses lost in translation, but with zero substance to support any madness of this phenomenon, it will probably be relegated to the second plan. hollowed basements.
