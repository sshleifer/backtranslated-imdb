Greetings to all, <br /> <br /> Is not it amazing the power that movies give you after the first viewing? <br /> <br /> I was so excited about the first viewing of this movie that I could not stop talking about "Flatliners" to all my friends for weeks. Remember, I was 18 and my taste in movies has become a bit more conservative since then. <br /> <br /> Then somewhere, I forgot this movie until I saw the DVD in my local store and I remembered how awesome it was. I thought, "Well, I'll catch you by surprise right out of the special edition." <br /> <br /> Last week, I was thrilled when my best friend invited me to watch Flatliners on DVD. I hoped that this movie would be even more appreciated during the second visualization .. As I was wrong! <br /> <br /> Verdict: after 11 years, my vision of this film had shifted from a very scary 1st class movie to a total junk that superimposed on the religious and supernatural side of things rather superficially. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Julia Roberts' acting (except Erin Brockeridge in which she deserved her Oscar) I think the problem with this movie is definitely with the director and so bad a scenario. I left this film with the feeling that it had no real substance or potential, and just some scary and cheap shivers that were not at all very well made. Even the score of James-Newtown Howard, which I like as a film composer, could not captivate me and make me vibrate. <br /> <br /> In 1990, I would have given this film to 9.5 / 10; but in 2001, I would be lucky to give it the best 2/10. <br /> <br />
