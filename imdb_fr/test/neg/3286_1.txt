The actors and actresses of this series are OK, but the scripts were absolutely horrible. This family is so dysfunctional that it's not even funny. In fact, scripts very often illustrate how not to be a parent. The scripts are so bad that they make Homer Simpson look like a better father than this one. <br /> <br /> Anyone who becomes a parent, if you want to see what to do with your children, this show is the perfect guide. I think the basket of this show feeds us, is beyond words. <br /> <br /> Michael Rapaport has seen much better in his career (including his role in HITCH). They need a strong lead and better scripts than I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> If you think this is generational, my teenager has even disabled a series of this horrible show.
