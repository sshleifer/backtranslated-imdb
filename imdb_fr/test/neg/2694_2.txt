I saw this movie as a preview before the opening of Venice at the Telluride Film Festival. Your reaction to this question will largely depend on your attitude towards Shakespeare's text. On the benefits side: Pacino actually gives a very good performance as Shylock; Lynn Collins is a beautiful Portia; and the film has a sumptuous look. <br /> <br /> Negatives are predictable. "The Venice Merchant" is arguably the most difficult of all Shakespeare plays to be staged today, largely because we look at it through the distorting lens of twentieth-century history. The romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia is no problem. Shylock's character does this because we lack the original frame of reference for the Elizabethan audience. Shylock is both a human character endowed with human qualities and motivations and an abstraction of the ruthless quality of the old law. When he says, "The eyes of a Jew are not they?" it's a character; when he proclaims "I will have my bond!" it's an abstraction. The long passage to music and cosmic harmony in the final scene (here moved and cut into ribbons) is the key to the play, in that it restores universal harmony after disruptive and perverse forces (the Shylock of trials) are ejected. It is possible to give psychological meaning to Shylock's character by showing his character gradually gone mad and by becoming monomane as the scene of the trial approaches, the key is that at some point he must stop being sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Pacino's performance does it almost, but not quite. The film can not decide. On the one hand, there is the good movement in the character of Shylock, and on the other, there are many unpublished images of abused Jews and Venetian whores with red nipples. (probably to show the decadence of Antonio et al). Shakespeare did not write a social drama of the Ibsen type; he wrote a comedy about the classic model of the breakdown of the social order and the reestablishment of social order, symbolized by marriage, with a theme of love against the law at the center of Shylock's plot. <br /> <br /> In this sense, the film is a masquerade. Radford's operation on play and staging almost forces us away from what the game really means. (Taking the beginning of the final scene, cutting most of it and moving it before the trial stage is the most extreme example.) There are other important difficulties. Jeremy Irons, a good actor, plays Antonio as if he were overdosed with sedatives. Joseph Fiennes is pretty but shallow as Bassanio. Most actors, with the exception of Collins, Pacino and the actor playing the duke in the trial scene, mumble their dialogue. <br /> <br /> Final verdict? A nice movie with some decent performances. It's not Shakespeare, it's a bad interpretation. Your time and money are not really worth it, although Lynn Collins as Portia almost buys it.
