Sorry Randy. I love your comedy, but in this case, you really laid a golden turkey egg. <br /> <br /> The plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin, the game was more woody than the giant sequoia and I think the direction was nonexistent. <br /> <br /> It seems like pathetic attempts to take off other movies, Jaws and European Vacation, to name just two. <br /> <br /> If my memory is good, Eric Idle played the same type of character in Nat Lamp European Vacation, but much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo have been approached to do this sequel. If so, they certainly knew what they were doing when they refused their roles. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, no one can be better than Chevy and Beverley in their roles of Griswolds and Randy Quaid complimented them admirably at first. movies. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid should have left the National Lampoon while he was in front.
