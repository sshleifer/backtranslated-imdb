what was that? I admit that some scenes caught my attention, like the bullshit where the protagonist sees or calculates the number 23 wherever he goes, but that was pretty much the film in a nutshell ?! To cry aloud, it was supposed to be a suspense movie and to be called a psychological thriller, I was expecting it to have at least a catastrophic effect on the mind, but what did we get? We just got something as crappy as an animal control guy who's in the midst of a mid-life crisis and his journey to redemption. A bit like an old movie if you ask me. I probably should have just rented wild pigs, it would not have made any difference. I mean who we laugh at, they should have made someone else the killer of this girl. By juxtaposing Sparrow with the protagonist of this book, number 23, they were pretty much giving the movie to viewers by hinting that he was the killer from the beginning. How would that shake his head? Shame on all the voters who have chosen to be generous with this miserable work you call movie and congratulations from most of the critics who subscribed to my reaction.
