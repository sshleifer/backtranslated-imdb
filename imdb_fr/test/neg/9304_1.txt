It's the worst movie of all time, without a doubt, and Schindler's list, in fact, had more laughs. This not only tells you how funny this movie is and that SL is great, since it's heartbreaking and it contains 1 laugh. I wish I could meet "Yahoo Serious" in order to be able to strangle him personally, for that and for all the others very, very, very bad movies in which he went. There is also very little to say about Australia, since they like it. stupid fruit. Do not get me wrong, the people (Mel Gibson) from Australia are great, they brought us Mad Max. It makes me very nauseated that people like this trash (a review I just read said it was "very funny", disgusting, is not it). Personally, I will boycott this movie and launch an online petition to ban and burn all Yahoo Serious movies because it is so, and so I insist on the fact that I am DELAYED. <br /> <br /> Note: If you are forced to watch this Clockwork Orange movie, call me to have you euthanized for free.
