I only bought this DVD because it was very cheap and seemed interesting in a special way ("special" meaning "delayed"). The film proved to be quite uninteresting - boring camera work, nothing really directs the story, and of course, the acting is awful. It was not even "bad" in a camper way - it was just bad. There are actually a handful of broad lines of dialogue, but for the most part it is clumsy and weak. All I could think of while I was watching this was that it could be a good movie if the script had undergone a major overhaul (if it had been written by someone who really understood the drug culture ) and if decent actors were chosen. I would not recommend "Weekend with Babysitter" unless you are considering a career in filmmaking and want to learn what not to do in a movie.
