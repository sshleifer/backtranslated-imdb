I do not remember when I saw a worse movie. The acting was overworked, the dialogue banal to the point of being painful to listen to, second-rate special effects and derisory history. <br /> <br /> I never wanted to go to a movie suite, and if I was alone, that's what I would have done, about 30 minutes later, and I spared myself almost two other exciting hours of dialogue inducing nausea and intrigue with more holes than a Swiss cheese "the size of Texas." I can not emphasize enough the miserable experience lived through this collosal waste celluloid perfectly good. <br /> <br />
