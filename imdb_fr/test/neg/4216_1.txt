Alexandra Ripley wrote a horrible sequel to Margaret Mitchell's book published in the 1930s. Margaret Mitchell's heirs sold their rights and allowed Alexandra Ripley to write a garbage book even worse than the romance novels. Barbara Cortland. I was a big fan of Margaret Mitchells' book and Alexandra Ripley's fake sequel was written just to make money. <br /> <br /> Although I've always admired the acting talent of Joanne Kilmer and Timothy Dalton, it's a really awful movie. The scenario is horrible and full of clich√©s. Ann Margarets as Belle Watling is so awful that I wanted to slap her. <br /> <br /> The only thing worthy of interest in the film is Sean Bean who gives a masterful performance as a brave villain - Lord Fenton. Sean Bean's performance goes in the direction of "The Man You Love to Hate" and portrays a dangerous sexual symbol. <br /> <br /> But Sean Bean only appears in the first half of the film and must be tormented. watch an incredibly long 6-hour movie with an unbelievably boring scenario. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie unless you're an unconditional fan of Sean Bean and only watch it for its great performance.
