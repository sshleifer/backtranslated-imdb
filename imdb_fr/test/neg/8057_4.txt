This film tells the painful journey of a young man in search of his sexuality. <br /> <br /> The film is raw and unpretentious. He does not rely on hot sex scenes to attract viewers. Although the plot may sometimes seem inconsistent and disconnected, some events are not explained correctly. However, I can understand it because this film is a collection of very personal memories to the director. The subplot of his sister and mother probably does not need to exist in the film, but I imagine that these are very important events in his life. <br /> <br /> The low budget of the film is clearly perceptible. . Too bad the sound effects are poorly done. The narration and some dialogues (especially the scene in the classroom with the French teacher) are so echoing, which makes it difficult to understand what is said. The ambient noise, a noticeable traffic noise, is also captured throughout the movie. When one scene cuts another, the noise level of the traffic changes. <br /> <br /> This film is certainly not fun, but it certainly serves as a diary of a young man's journey to embrace his sexuality.
