I must admit, as shameful as I am, that as an impressionable young teenager, this horrible cooler was one of my favorite movies of all time. Nine years after first viewing Stephen King's scary story, I came to my senses and was able to evaluate Fritz Kiersch's work in a more reasonable way. <br /> <br /> Indeed, King's story about a small upbringing Nebraskian farming community A young demonic preacher and his sadistic sidekick really upset the paper, but it makes it a cheap and average horror show on the celluloid. Much of this result can be attributed to the fact that Kiersch almost makes the beginning of the movie become a hacker-slasher show, and then turns the finale into a nightmare of special effects. <br /> <br /> The actors are reasonable, but they can only represent the maximum of credibility that allows them this rather incredible film, and the soundtrack of Jonathan Elias is even more frightening than the images. <br /> George Goldsmith's screenplay transformed Stephen King's haunting short story into a shocking horror. Isaac, Malachai and all the other "Corn Kids" are not really scary. <br /> <br /> Sunday 7 August 1994 - Video
