I should have stayed without seeing the movie after reading the review here. I saw the whole movie fast forward and finished in 25 minutes. although it is a low-budget film, it could have been improved. <br /> <br /> The film starts rather like a thriller and in a few minutes, it tells you that you must turn off immediately. And why was the film called a "forced landing" when it had landed so well in such a bad climate? <br /> <br /> Without any actor, all characters move or act like children. <br /> <br /> And do not forget to comment on the joker - the main hijacker that would have been more appropriate if this movie was a full-time comedy.
