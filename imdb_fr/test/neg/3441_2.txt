These writers try to recreate the characters they have on "scrubs" in a different profession, but the characters with whom they are stuck do not have charisma or playing skills, not to mention the writing that seems poor and without effort. These guys are trying to create something that would be nice if the writing was not so disgusting, leaving only the lifesavers for two attractive teachers who barely hold it. The humor in this show seems to want to try to target an audience with an I.Q. 40 or less. Another reason why this show is becoming a failure might be that the writing in the show "scrubs" is excellent and that this show has to follow, leaving the viewer in a strange position not knowing whether to cry or simply lose hope in new sitcoms. all together. It's just my opinion but I think these guys should stop now before humbling themselves more than they've ever done.
