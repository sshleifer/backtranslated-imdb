God! Where do I start? From beginning to end, I could not help but hate this movie. Vineyards? Vines that make noise in cell phones ?! Oh yes, I'm so scared - I'm going to rid the weeds of the earth! Come on! The plot did not succeed. When the group discovered the ruin and the inhabitants of the village (no pun intended) came to warn them and brandishing weapons in front of their faces, do not worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take pictures! This whole scene really made me wonder why she did not photograph her stepson, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker), sawing the legs of Mathias (Joe Anderson). When the fools threw the rope after Mathias for the first time, how the rope was at least ten feet off the ground, but how finally it was barely two to four feet off the ground. I can not start covering everything that was wrong in this film, there is too much to cover. I would say that the graphics to the extent that the gore was great, but it was worthless since the acting and the scenario were terribly bad.
