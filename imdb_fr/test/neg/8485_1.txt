I can not believe it! I thought it was a good sequel when Jim in the movie had a baby but rather a movie with dumb actors, a stupid plot and stupid scenes. This should be in the 'craziest movies of sh * t in Earth'. Thank God, the same director did not do that because it's so stupid with caricatures like the fart was not funny, not the pee and not the dance! I made fun of that because of the stupidity of the person who did that, like his father Simpson, who made a movie about a donut! I wish someone would remake the mask's son with a plot like this! The mask guy (Jim Carry) and his wife have a son who is a normal baby. When the baby finds another mask, he also became the mask and the mask guy tries to get his mask back! It's very bad so I'll give it a 1 in 10. Fu * king sh * t!
