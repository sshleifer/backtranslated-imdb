It's one of the worst films I've seen and certainly the worst film that Nagesh Kuknoor did. I can not believe that a person who created a movie like Teen Deewarein could create such a shit like this. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film itself is really due to the fact that Zeenat must search Meera and get her clemency to help her husband avoid the death penalty in Saudi Arabia. The common logic is that if Zeenat can not easily search for Meera, or the Soudi government, neither Zeenat can safely falsify Meera's signature or thumbprint and produce it before the Soudis. Another silly thing is that Shankar has indicated an incorrect address in his passport. Indian government officials can not go to the address. After some time, Meera recovered Shankar's suitcase through the Soudi government. Wow! Does not he make Soudis better connected in India than the Indians? <br /> <br /> Nagya does a little more poetry in the film with the role of Chopra, who looks at Meera and looks for Meera's father-in-law, Girish Karnaad (this guy just lost his help) for the help to keep it. <br /> <br /> Nagya does not speak Hindi and he was assisted by other types to translate the English dialogues he wrote in Hindi. This time, it seems that his assistant was seriously intoxicated when writing dialogues of the type "Imaan ki Chalaang" (act of honesty). In a few minutes, to our worst nightmares, Meera not only makes this honest leap, she stamps her foot to do "Imaan ka Naach" (Honesty Dance). <br /> <br /> One of the only light spots in the film, its cinematography and its really nice colors. But since Bollywood learned about post-production, almost all movies have bright colors and backgrounds, so nothing serious. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that making a nerdy movie is not limited to Chopras or Johars or Barjatyas, Nagyas and all are ready to be touched.
