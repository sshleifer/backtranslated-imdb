I thought I was going to see a movie about UFOs. Instead, I saw a film that tried to force the public (me) to make the decision to accept Christ in my life or risk going to hell. The whole thing about UFOs was a big red herring !!! The game was pretty pathetic. In fact, it seems that members of an evangelical church have just met and decided to make a film. All the characters spoke as if they were talking to other members of the church. It was not a real dialogue at all. I would have liked to have read some reviews before seeing this movie so I did not waste my money on it. If, on the other hand, you have a global vision of the church scene and want to see a demonstration of how to make your point of view (no matter how limited) on other people, then go -y.
