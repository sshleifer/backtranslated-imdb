The acting is awkward and scary, and not in a good way ... at all. The writing, the dialogue and the chemistry between the actors are horrible. Nothing makes sense and each close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts three or four seconds too long, giving the impression of a Mexican opera (telenovela). Everything about writing is unrealistic, and all the actors involved make things worse with their complicated interpretations of the script. Am I the only one to see it ??? To use the word cheesy to describe this Canadian catastrophe would be the least we can say of the century. Did the director even watch the final editing before it was broadcast ???
