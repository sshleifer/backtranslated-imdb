What a misfortune, but also what luck, that two films about terror - The Cave and The Descent - arrive at about the same time. Unfortunately for The Descent, its release in the UK on July 7th coincided with the day of the terrorist London metro / subway terror that killed nearly 60 people and injured hundreds - it's not a big deal. night / a particularly cinematic weekend, especially seeing a scary film about Sheesh about friendly women stuck in a dark and deep cavernous caving system. Both films have virtually the same elements - half a dozen characters, lost in a speleology system never explored before, and no one from the outside realizes that they are stuck there. A lot of water, caverns, dangers ... then, finally, vicious creatures resembling human beings or derived from humans who are determined to make their prey. Where the two are so different is that The Cave is a fantastic, fantastic and totally incredible adventure, more fantastic than horror or drama. The tiny budget British film (shot in southern England though located in the Appalachian Mountains) is terrifying to the penny, a shock that blocks the heart and makes it hard for people to leave the projections early in the shock. This eliminates girls in any order - you really have no idea what to expect next - surely not her! The Descent is also lit up in a naturalistic way, which makes it even more frightening, unlike the playfully lit cave that resembles a giant and magical Santa Claus cave, with its cathedral-sized rooms, dazzling under a blue light ... who knows where, while caving torches are exclusively used to artistically illuminate heroes with granite jaws (more like puppets than a Team America / Gerry Anderson / Thunderbirds creation) . Fantastic amounts of equipment are also carried away, but despite this, actors in an impossible voice have clearly forgotten to gather any feeling of imminent danger, drama or anything that is worthy of a horror movie - he is strictly PG. And in this case, the actors display the exact order that everyone expects - I quickly wrote a list after being introduced to each character, only getting that Piper Perabo was not in sequence. Cave's script is entirely digital, unlike Shakespeare, a room full of chimpanzees would write after a week ... Take the typical exchange between the white and black tracks of the "good friend"; "How many times have we been in this situation before bud?" - "too many" (answers Morris Chesnut). I swear you could hear my London suburban audience gasping for evidence. The scariest thing about The Cave is that in the end, there's an opening for "the sequel" - "The Cave 2: Overground" or something else. Be afraid, be very scared ... Or catch The Descent and be really scared, very very very scared. RR
