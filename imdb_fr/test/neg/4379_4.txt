For a Norris film, it's pretty tame. For an action movie, it's a little boring, and as far as predictability is concerned, my friend and I have almost achieved every turn of this movie. It was good that not all the killer's movements were telegraphed by the clich√© of 80s action movies, but that the only unpredictable movement defied the intrigue and organization of editing. Generally, it is said early enough that the murderer (Jack O'Halloran, who is one of the few little-known actors) only kills women. STILL, he stops his M.O. all of a sudden and kills the men, huh? I suppose that can be interpreted and rationalized in a certain way, but why did the film come up to show that it is going to kill women? <br /> <br /> Again, I'm sure there's a reason (that is, to create a suspense), but why spend time watching it while many other suspense are considerably higher. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Renegade" may appreciate Branscombe Richmond's little cameo as Victor, but his brief appearance can not save the film and even a 4-vote seems generous. <br /> <br />
