Alas, it seems that the heyday of Italian cinema have sunk into oblivion. And the recent idea of ​​the famous filmmaker Lamberto Bava is another clear proof of this hypothesis. <br /> <br /> I felt lucky to see many films by this prolific director (like Body Puzzle, Delerium, Macabre and the two demons). Although this is not entirely satisfactory, they have never been so bland. <br /> <br /> It was suspected that this new entry into my DVD collection was money thrown to the winds shortly after the scene of the car accident, presenting a clumsy and improbable body position under the car turning around. <br /> <br /> And the sense of superficiality grew in the chain of events that followed. <br /> <br /> Silent dialogues, unresolved scripting and a total waste of talent from international distribution. The only character who offered more or less acceptable performances was the mischievous son of Mark's son, infusing all the boredom with his taste. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the work of Mario's son in all respects could not be welcomed. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing his murder house hope to be an improvement.
