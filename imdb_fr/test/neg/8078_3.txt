A group of teen bikers are in the forest in circles. They have fun; little do they know that nature is about to be released by a refugee emo from a film by Deliverance or Hills Have Eyes. He is armed with matches and fire accelerator. And he has a bleeding eye or something. Why burn a park? I do not know. Maybe he does not like Smokey the Bear, or something like that. But he wears military / naval fatigues, if that can help you. <br /> <br /> The rangers send a single helicopter to fight the ensuing fire; that's all you've ever seen except a group of people in a base somewhere talking a lot about fire but doing nothing. A police officer, a forest ranger or a militiaman, whoever he is, falls from the helicopter on a defective cable. <br /> <br /> Everyone is now riding their bikes like motocross auditions. Evel Knievel takes turns, turns around, and so on. They argue constantly. The shots are as fictitious as a $ 3 bill; it's the same sequence under a dozen different angles and the fire is neither growing nor moving. And you have never seen fire fighting equipment before. <br /> <br /> A movie from the SyFy channel containing about 0% science fiction. What you can expect from this: bad action game, cheap effects and a story that is not going anywhere (like motorcycles and fire are not going anywhere). Insomniac cure laughable.
