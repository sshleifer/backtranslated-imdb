I test myself to watch 3 bad movies in a row to see if watching 3 bad movies in a row could give me amnesia. I have a dubbed version of this movie in English. Now, let me go down the points. Music score: poor quality, but at least that's fine. Story: This is a guy who goes to town and he meets his sheriff brother and they fight to get land from a major's farmers and he allies with Mexicans to drive them and Trinity and his brother try to teach them how to defend it - The final climactic battle scene will confuse anyone with whom #### are the good guys Conclusion: better than I thought but I have to continue like this I'm next will watch the movie "Universal Soldier" by Dolph Lungren and Jean-Claudde Vanne Damme pray for my sanity
