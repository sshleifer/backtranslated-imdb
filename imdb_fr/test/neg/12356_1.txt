SPOILER ALERT. <br /> <br /> This movie will spoil your afternoon viewing slot or "in the wee hours of the morning". <br /> <br /> I like Marc Singer. He portrayed good characters in the roles I saw. Until this movie. <br /> <br /> What begins as a promising film quickly disappears with the disastrous context of cgi'd and the extreme proximity of the person on the verge of death ... <br /> <br /> Next the situation is getting worse. <br /> <br /> Much worse. <br /> <br /> Describing this as a restless action would insult pigs. This film goes to the bottom of the ham barrel and scrapes the scene. <br /> <br /> Aside from the overcooked cooking of Marc Singer, Mike Dopud walks and walks across the landscape with the air of fearing falling on the rocks and his nasty "gooey-eyed" man makes him look like to a fool. It is not at all threatening. <br /> <br /> George Stults looks like a deer caught in the headlights. He claims to have been threatened by the other two but his character was threatened by a cashier offering him "paper or plastic". <br /> <br /> This is really a vehicle for Nicole Eggert as an independent woman who gets it Life has returned despite the fact that she has attracted the wrong kind of men ... She was not remarkable. <br /> <br /> This is not a remake, but it is remarkably similar to "Cliffhanger" - experienced guide, loses someone in a fall, stung consciousness. to help someone else, a missing treasure worth a ton of money and a gang of naive exploiting the guide. Except that Cliffhanger was an excellent vehicle for Stallone and Lithgow. I must admit that Lithgow stole the show. <br /> <br /> Even the involuntary comedy was mediocre. Sometimes I did not know for sure if they were using a rubber-faced model to replace Singer, who was trying in vain to storm the meteorological station (no pun intended). Leaning his face on the door post and his awkward manners in general did nothing to help his character. <br /> <br /> To avoid. <br /> <br /> No, seriously, avoid it. Save 96 minutes of your life and do something more constructive, like watching the paint dry or growing grass. Or just close your eyes and examine the back of your eyelids for 90 minutes ...
