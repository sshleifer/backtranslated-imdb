I'm a fan of some holiday movies, but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the television, you know everything is out of breath. Made for TV National Lampoon movies do not go well on TV. This film is another reason. <br /> <br /> I think that many of us were enthusiastic at the time of its release, but we also had to face the reality ... it's a TV movie. Randy Quaid is fine as a cousin Eddie, but is better than starring. Dana Barron sets the story as the first actress to reprise her role as one of Griswold's children. She's just as pretty, but it does not help a fine script. <br /> <br /> Why was this movie made? This is probably because NBC has recently taken over a few years of Christmas holiday presentation. There is nothing wrong with playing. Everything is in the script. It's just not so funny. People have to think before writing things like that. It's a Christmas film that I do not recommend.
