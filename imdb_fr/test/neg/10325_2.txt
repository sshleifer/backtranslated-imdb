I give it a 2 - I reserve a grade of 1 to the films of Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen. We do not even remember what this movie was about. The only thing we remember is a gunshot scene where the actors fall to the ground, roll on the other side of the hallway or something, and then resume shooting. It was like watching 80-year-olds with 2 broken legs trying to perform "stunts". Moreover, when the characters were driving in a truck, the sound of the engine (or the radio, I can not remember) would disappear completely when the actors spoke. <br /> <br /> the cover of Sandra Bullock. very sad, very bad.
