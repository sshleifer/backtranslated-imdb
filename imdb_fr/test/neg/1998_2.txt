Normally, I like Casper in his films, which is a real credit for STARSHIP TROOPERS. But the cover of the box on this video SSOOOOO half-sleds the tenants. On my local video, people rent it while waiting for a (PERHAPS) Borg as a vampire, and instead get a bad reproduction of Lon Chaney. He had great potential and fell very flat. I really think I could have written a better story and played on the screen. Why in EVERY sci-fi movie, do they constantly refer to the solar system as a galaxy? None of these writers or writers remained awake in science class? It is a domestic animal, but a solar system is a star with planets, a galaxy is a whole group of solar systems. It's like referring to a can of coke as a total of six packs. It sounds even more stupid.
