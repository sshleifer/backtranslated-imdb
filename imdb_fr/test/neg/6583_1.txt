Just like Final Fantasy, if you look at a still shot, it does not look so bad. But when people start moving, it's completely horrifying. The jerky movements, the lack of frightening emotion and the lack of sensation of life in the face give me goose bumps. The characters do not even appear LIVE / organic. <br /> <br /> I attended a preview screening with my daughter, who actually fell asleep! She was not engaged at all. For the record, I thought she was easily engaged by both Pixar-esque movies as well as by a number of "bad" 2D movies like Sinbad. <br /> <br /> The lighting is painful, giving children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin at a campfire. The lip sync is bad - worse in reality than Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> I also doubt that Hanks played five characters ... it was a major distraction throughout the movie. The role of the conductor is strange - though in a way that I simply can not identify. It reminds me of my father's false "voice" when greeting customers. <br /> <br /> I think that's the reason why multiple roles distract - you're perfectly aware that the voice is the same, yet very different. This gives each character the feeling of being ACTED, as opposed to real human characters. The illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role play of Hanks. I've seen the technique work - at Eddie Murphy, but Hanks can not manage with a single voice, given the awful animation. <br /> <br /> I would not want to lose my money that - wait for the rental.
