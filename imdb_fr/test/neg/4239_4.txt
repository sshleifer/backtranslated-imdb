First, a warning. "How to marry a millionaire" is preceded by an orchestral interpretation of the seemingly random five-minute "Street Scene", a legendary play by Gershwin treated with all the pomp and ceremony of Gershwin. Sitting through takes a little patience. If you have the DVD, rest assured, you can move on. You will not miss anything. <br /> <br /> The film itself is one of Hollywood's 50s perpetual disappointments, a movie so full of major star power, opulent staging and a perfect high concept. failure seems inconceivable. The title alone is perfect. Generation after generation, however, they are forced to ask: how is this so soft? The scenario is an albatross on the neck of production, a dead and smelling thing that stifles everything and everyone before they can really come to life. There are no comical situations, just isolated moments that play for laughs. Whenever a comedy scene threatens to develop, the film quickly moves on to other less interesting things. A typical case - the scene where the three main women each bring a date to the same fancy restaurant. One of them, short-sighted, refuses to wear his glasses out of vanity. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood farce with a mistaken identity, an angry woman and probably a face pie for someone? Well no. Instead, we cut between the three dates because the ladies react "comically" to the comments of their partners. Hit the punching line and move on to the next soft joke. If in doubt, run Marilyn against a wall. Where is Billy Wilder when you need him? <br /> <br /> The three stars represent almost perfectly the cycle of life of the classic goddess of the Hollywood screen. It was one of Marilyn Monroe's amazing movies, and the camera just eats it, even if the screenplay does not give it anything to do. It is so luminescent that it almost seems to burst again. Lauren Bacall, for her part, was a major star for almost a decade and she knew how to dominate the screen even with Monroe. She gets the one thing that goes for a real role and delivers the good few lines in a cynical snap - with the right material she could have brought this thing to life. She's a curiously ageless actress - when she's lying about her age in the movie and pretends to be forty, it's not instantly ridiculous - and much less young than her co-stars, giving her a convincing authority. Betty Grable was far from ageless and spent eight good years on her co-stars, putting her near the end of her Hollywood career. There is sometimes an air of despair at home, stuck on the screen with nothing but a toothpaste smile and some comical timer notes, unable to play its true age but not deceiving anyone as a contemporary of this new generation of actresses more accurate, relying on the same old schtick that had served him throughout his career (for Marilyn-skeptics, see the two juxtaposed in this film helps to highlight the subtlety and, yes, the intelligence from Monroe). She is also crammed with deadwood in terms of male co-stars (although all men - even the great William Powell - are guilty of lazy performances); she is incapable of knocking out comic sparks. It's best to give Monroe's underutilized role, which could be funny on its own, and leave Grable's repetitive routine. <br /> <br /> Let the movie be as enjoyable as possible let Hollywood's Hollywood production seduce you, one that makes the two tastes of "In the light of the silver moon" observable. But somewhere, buried under jokes and professionalism, hides the sketch of a bitter and cynical comedy on the theme of marriage that Bacall could have made sing - and the new generations of moviegoers will sit down with "How to marry a millionaire "waiting for this film, ready to be disappointed again.
