The Tender Hook or who killed the Australian film industry? Case No. 278. This excuse for a period drama takes a casting and an idea with potential ?? Rose Byrne, Pia Miranda, Hugo Weaving, in a gangster drama from the jazz era ?? and transforms it into a sluggish and executed rhythm. McHeath (Weaving) is a promoter of boxing, a gangster and an active illiterate. for no apparent reason, he decided to sing songs by Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen before the fighting. How postmodern. So stupid. Anyway. There is a boxer, Art (Matthew Le Nevez), who becomes the last protégé of McHeath, alongside his esquire, unfortunately an aboriginal, Alby (Luke Carroll). <br /> <br /> McHeath's gray calf, Iris (Byrne), stands out. Sexual tension is silent beneath the surface. Miranda plays Daisy, a friend of Iris (these flower girls stick together) who never stops performing in unannounced scenes. They practice dancing together and talk about "dating" with guys. In the 1920s I stopped counting anachronisms after that. There is a secondary plot involving Japanese beer and a story of Broome bead fishermen. I do not know what it was. For a reason that is not fully explained, Byrne puts cocaine in Art's lemonade. McHeath thinks he's drunk and throws him out. Byrne is plotting and plotting to help him again. She is a great for conspiracy and shenanigans. Most of which cause problems. McHeath's two rifles, the stout Ronnie (John Batchelor) and the Russian Donnie (Tyler Coppin), argue between McHeath and his role in one of Iris's ploys, but Ronnie drops out when he sees McHeath crying. Many virtually incoherent scenes end on the road of the film. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Ogilvie spends a lot of time working with filmmaker Geoffrey Simpson to create beautiful images, but fails to generate a sense of style that could have compensated and adorned the vapoury scenario and pathetically underpowered; Unfortunately, Ogilvie's sense of film grammar, the lack of structuring of scenes and exposure, are surprisingly incompetent. In an early scene, Daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists. How she got there, and in fact who she is, seems to have escaped Ogilvie's mind. There are many other examples of this neglect. Where he hunts the poetic thinness, he realizes only a minimal irritation. He obtains delicate performances from actors who are usually reliable and badly melted. Weaving and relying on Byrne's ability to project a kind of haunted humanity like a doll while wearing it incomprehensibly. <br /> <br /> It may not matter. many if the story had more substantial characters and a stronger plot, preferably not stolen from a dozen old black movies and scalloped with pop culture quotes sprinkled with sensations. But this is not the case. It's boring.
