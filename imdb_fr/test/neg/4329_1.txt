Imagine watching a slide show where the projector lingers long enough on each slide so you can memorize it three times. Now imagine that the images in the slideshow consist only of banal scenes ?? a small park; and empty the tennis court; a piano. Now imagine that the people running the slide show have a frustrating, slow, semi-lucid conversation about events that are only occasionally linked to the slides they show you. Awesome ?? you have just imagined the entirety of the movie "India Song". <br /> <br /> The film is an extremely slow montage of images that just scream `Look at me! I am DEEP !! so blatantly important that the images themselves and the film as a whole are not only devoid of depth, but COMICIALLY devoid of depth. The visual elements could easily have been replaced by a series of static images as described above, because it is so rare that there are actually people on the screen, and even when they are, people move only slightly more often than furniture. They never speak and never interact significantly? they look at each other and cry sometimes. The most energetic moment of the first hour of the film is the moment when three people pass through a car park in slow motion. In fact, the visual elements could easily have been left out, the story being told entirely through storytelling. The story is about a woman who hates India because she is hot and who hates people does not hate India because she is hot (this point is covered many times). It is also a man who has the feeling that he has the right to sleep with the aforementioned woman, because she sleeps with those who ask him, but he can not sleep with her just because he never asks and that he is very upset. about that. Then he looks at her as a single tear runs down his cheek. Later, he looks at his bicycle as a tear runs down his cheek. In fact, we do not see the only tear running deep down his cheek when he looks at his bicycle, but you know it's still there, just because it's the kind of movie it is. <br /> <br /> better, the narration becomes a background sound, serving as a perfect complement to visual inducing coma. To remain conscious throughout this film would require an act of supreme determination. Looking at it and coming out with a serious and meaningful idea of ​​what it was supposed to be supposed to do would cause the same type of migraine as trying to read long technical documents in the dark. This film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudo-artistic pretensions that man knows.
