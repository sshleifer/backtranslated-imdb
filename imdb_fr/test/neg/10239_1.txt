I've seen several adaptations of scenes and movies from Alice in Wonderland and this one has to take the cake for the worse. My family bought the DVD unsuspectingly and did not even manage to get through the first half. Later, I went back and forced myself to look at everything (it was a Christmas present for me) and I was simply dismayed. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor (and barely buying back enough to save the whole show) is Mark Lin-Baker playing dummy turtle with a Yiddish accent. This is one of the rare moments in the play that has a certain charm and can be taken a little seriously. Apart from that, the songs are half-songs, the melodies are half-melodies and even Meryl Streep can not make this direction beautiful.
