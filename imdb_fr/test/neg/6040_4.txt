WEBS is a rather strange film, though slightly observable. Richard Grieco plays an electrician who gets sucked into a parallel Earth invaded by mutant spiders, or something like that. The film itself was made with a modest budget, which explains the limited localities and the rather tedious scenario that manages to do very little with a rather interesting premise. Basically, a 90-minute episode of the TV show "Sliders", and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 <br /> <br /> (visit www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review and reviews of other such films)
