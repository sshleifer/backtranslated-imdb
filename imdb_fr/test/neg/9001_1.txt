As a fan of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr, I had to see that. What's good is that the clips of Lugosi, Karloff and Chaney Jr.along with all the vintage clips, that do not gel with the new black and white images. Not even near Steve martins Dead men do not wear no plaid, it was a great thing.with all the technology we have now, why did not we do it better? If you intend to pay 5 dollars and a little change, be warned that it is really bad. but if you like Lugosi, Karloff and Chaney Jr are watching their movies instead. Even the wood did better than that one. The new actor Mark Redfield is pretty good as an imitation of Bela Lugosi. The clips they use are; the monkey, Mr. Wong, the most dangerous game, lost world, indestructible man. and devil beats.This notorious Bela Lugosi classic.I believe that this production has been very low budget, and it shows.1 out of 10.
