To begin my remarks about the film, I know that the subject is appalling and that the words can not adequately express the compassion that an honest person would have for the people who are dealing with the post-horrors of a dropped atomic bomb close to home. <br /> <br /> However, this movie does not really treat horribly, except for the first 10 minutes. Some of these images are horrible and should be reminiscent of what nuclear weapons can do. Seeing burnt people wandering aimlessly or a man combing and tufts of hair coming out, etc., is not good to see. <br /> <br /> But after the first ten minutes, this Japanese film is about people struggling with the aftermath of Hiroshima in the 40s. In fact, I discovered that the story quickly became a soap opera boring. <br /> <br /> Almost the whole story takes place five years after the bomb and deals mainly with the problems of a family at that time. That's why it became more of a melodrama than a shocking story of a nuclear disaster. Is it just a story about how these people lived their lives from around 1950, if one of the women had been permanently damaged and if so, should she get married? <br /> <br /> It could have been a real impact movie but it's not going in that direction
