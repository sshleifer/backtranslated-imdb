I do not know who funded it, or why, but this movie "Vampire" is really awful. It's trying to be hip and fun for MTV's younger generation, but it's downright ludicrous. The acting is horrible and the staging is horrible. I heard that the budget was $ 600,000. I want to know where all the money went?
