It's been 3 months and you know what that means ... A new Seagal movie. Seagal really turned the role of horrible film after horrible film. Whenever every movie gets worse and worse, it's really amazing! I do not really know what to say about TYD. First, it's a shit, history makes no sense. Secondly, he uses stuntmen in all his fight scenes. other movies! It's amazing to see how this guy continues to find work, he arrives on the set late and leaves early and, as a result, his films are filled with holes in the machinery and stunt men. Why do we continue to buy his films, why do we continue to hope that perhaps he will make a good movie?
