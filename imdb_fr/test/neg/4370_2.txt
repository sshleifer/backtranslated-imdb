One day, I thought to myself ... what is the worst thing that can happen today? I answered myself with a simple: "Oh, it's already happened. I rented Killjoy / Killjoy 2 "on DVD. Well, what is there to say? The budget was not big enough to rent a police uniform, the film eliminates scenes of sex and death. There is a funny phrase I can remember, and the acting is much worse than the first. There seems to be no lighting on the "plateau" (the woods somewhere) and the killer clown known as Killjoy (which makes Leprechaun look like the Exorcist) is less spectacular. This time, he is not portrayed by Angel Vargas and is completely changed as a crazy irritating clown character into another type of crazy irritating clown who often says "CHILD". Somewhere between Freddy Krueger and a blade of grass ... is this version of Killjoy. Somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of s --- t is Killjoy 2. His wickedness is underestimated. This film has no quality, except the song that ends at the end of the credits ... which provides a little fun. Killjoy 2 is not really a film, but a tension exercise. Killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered the worst movie I have ever seen. MINOR SPOILER ######### Let me describe one of the scenes of supernatural destruction. A girl is locked in a wooden shed (maybe an addiction?) When Killjoy peeks through a hole. He has a few small chattering teeth (like the ones you can buy at Spencer's Gifts) and he does something with them (maybe they get them up ?!). Then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line (which can not be written on IMDB). From what I understood from this scene (not what is shown in the film), the teeth went into addiction and killed the girl in an interesting way, but not shown, then came back in Killjoy. If I had those teeth, I would have run. Run away from Killjoy so he can never hand me back. Killjoy 2 is, hopefully, the last Killjoy to suffer Even as a fan of movies that others would describe as very bad, I think this "film" could unify the human race and create peace in the world. he was promised that this movie and everything that reminded us would be destroyed. I give it 2/10 - just because the creators managed to move the images.
