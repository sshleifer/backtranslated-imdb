I was really looking forward to this title. It sounded and looked funny. The idea of ​​making a monstrous film of the 50s might be worth a few laughs, but instead, this title is boring. First of all, there is almost no Froggg in the whole movie, which is the biggest disappointment. I have to sit through more than 75 minutes of drama and lame dialogue to get some glimpses of Froggg fucking a topless chick. Why? In addition to that, the film lacks amusing intrigue. I mean, give me something a little more interesting than a group of talking heads. I wanted to see hot girls looking for the creature in the swamp, I wanted to see cute dragged to her lair in desperate need for help (Black Lagoon creature), I wanted to see some crazy Froggg action scenes leaving for a killing, or maybe escaping a silly trap. Something exciting! Really, have fun with it, be creative! Who wants to sit in interminable and tiring dialogue scenes in a creature movie? My advice to the filmmakers: Continue, your concepts are good, but your execution must be much more inspired. Have fun with the creature, put humor into action and most importantly ... put more creature in a creature movie !!!
