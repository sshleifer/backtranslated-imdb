I imagine that after Leonard Nimoy managed to direct "The Search for Spock" and "The Travel Home", William Shatner thought he could run it too. Although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he is simply not a good director. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is irrefutable evidence to support Trekkies' claims that William Shatner is an arrogant selfish person. Although his character, Captain James Kirk, has always been the most important role in the original movie "Star Trek", it seems in this film that he is the heart of the film, the other two most important characters, Captain Spock and Doctor Leonard. McCoy, are here to support him, and the other characters are just here to add comic relief. <br /> <br /> The plot is that an emotional Vulcain excluded named Sybok is mixing minds and releasing the pain trapped inside. of this traumatic event from early childhood that changed them forever. Grateful, they join him in his quest to free the world from pain and therefore peace. Sybok and his followers seize the building in which a peace conference is held between a human diplomat, a Klingon and Romulan diplomat. This attracts the company still under construction there, since none of Starfleet's other ships have "experienced commanders" (honestly, with the way Starfleet is run, the Klingons and Romulans should have conquered them there has years). Sybok adds the crew of the Enterprise, except Spock (who is revealed to be secret brothers with Sybok), McCoy and Kirk. Sybok orders the Company to go to the "center of the universe" to meet "God", who apparently has every word in the word. However, it turns out that this is only a minor entity when he asks for the use of the Enterprise and Kirk asks, "What does God need with a spaceship." The entity is destroyed, but not before Sybok, realizing that he has been lied for years, sacrificing his life and deserves Spock's respect after the Enterprise's photon torpedoes destroyed the entity and inexplicably Sybok. <br /> <br /> OK, science fiction movies are not known for their realism, but at some point, rationality must be applied. Why do people follow Sybok just for releasing their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I have certainly led a life without trauma. Why does not Kirk attack his crew for mutiny and betrayal after joining Sybok? What was Sybok's goal to sacrifice himself while the torpedoes were going to kill the entity anyway? <br /> <br /> The plot is therefore weak. Another problem is that Sybok, although played well by Lawrence Luckinbill, is poorly described. It is not because he is emotional that Vulcan acts exactly like a religious fanatic. Shatner (who was co-screenwriter and director) could have at least developed an appropriate dialogue for an emotional Vulcan. I suppose he feels that every emotional being speaks like us. Well, I guess that means Klingons should say "do not" and "do not" more often than "do not" and "do not do it". And the Cardassians should not extend their sentences because they like to talk (yeah, I know it's sad to know). Please ... each ST race uses a unique dialogue. Why is Sybok an exception? <br /> <br /> The only thing not to criticize is the acting game. I always knew that "Star Trek" had great actors, and this film is no exception. The Cudos also go to Leonard Nimoy because it had to be hard to play the maverick Spock in his old age. <br /> <br /> Some other things I did not like: <br /> <br /> Shatner and the late Kelly DeForrest twice shows what singers they are bad singing "Row, Row, Row your Boat "in this film. I guess Shatner wanted to silence his detractors about his ability to sing. What he did was prove his argument. <br /> <br /> Uhura does a fan dance while wearing only tree bark to lure men into a trap. After all, the dreams of all men are filled with images of mature plump women dancing naked. <br /> <br /> The comedy is beautiful as long as it does not affect the nature of "Star Trek". too much, but when Scotty hits an Enterprise object and knockouts himself, it's a little too far. <br /> <br /> Kirk is the only crew member to be able to reject Sybok's offer to release his inner pain and see through the deception of the impostor of God. Even Spock can not handle one or the other? Like many suspects, these scenes were perhaps Shatner's Valantines to his character. <br /> <br /> The concept of an entity posing as God had already been used in "Star Trek" before this film more than once. Be creative, Shatner. <br /> <br /> About lack of creativity, I did not care about the music of "Star Trek: the new generation". <br /> <br /> All in all, very bad movie "Trek". If you are a Trekkie, look at it once because it's "Star Trek". Otherwise, look at "Star Trek II: Khan's anger". This is much better.
