First of all, I just want to say that this show could have gone well, much better than it does now. What made her fall was certainly the acting Miranda Cosgrove, who plays the role of the main character Carly, looked almost worthy of her own show when she was playing Drake and Josh. Unfortunately, iCarly was a big disappointment. Not only is Miranda not convincing enough, she's incredibly stiff when she moves. She does not seem to know how the "carly" character could move or stand. At the end of the very first episode, when she raises the hat, her arm never leaves her elbow. even when she was dancing, she looked like a stick in the breeze. And singing? The theme song was great, just because Drake was there, the music was pretty good and Miranda's voice was wrong. I must admit that the plot and the settings are good, unrealistic, but hey, it's Nick. They are practically known for their stupid lines and characters. But wow, it's the worst of all.
