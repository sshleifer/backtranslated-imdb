After watching this film several times, I came to the conclusion that Milos Forman had made the very bold decision to create a muse for Goya, when the artist was leading what most people would consider a passionate life while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era were raging across Europe, which would surely have enough drama to be inspired. Although I understand that Mr. Forman told in the microcosm of the tragedy of Ines' life the devastation of the world at that time, I felt that so much remained about Goya and his humanity . The strongest and most eloquent point this film has made is that given the fallen nature of man, each of us is a bad potential in the flow of life, each of us has evil in us and must fight with the help of God. What eloquence when Goya says he should have helped more Ines, what a truth for us all! We must defend and protect the innocent. The superbly ironic scene in which the once imprisoned priest sentenced to death pronounces the death sentence passed on Lorenzo who originally sentenced him is a matter of genius. I had to wait for something more after the credits. Perhaps less unreal coincidences, and more of the inner life of the characters.
