Honestly, this movie is one of the greatest movies of all time ... if you suffer from insomnia. It is a surefire way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. As the film progresses, the audience falls into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any type of plot that the film might contain. This effect is certainly due to the lack of gentle action / sweet girls. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Mr Eisenstein was obviously not able to master the art of editing. An excellent example of this is the stage on the steps of Odessa. For no apparent reason, an event that in real life would have taken a few seconds turns into a seven-minute nightmare for any sane viewer. This mounting flaw tarnishes any kind of realism throughout the film. Honestly, I've seen more realistic montages while watching cartoons. <br /> <br /> Some commentators have called Battleship Potemkin "one of the greatest movies of all time" and "truly a masterpiece". I write this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this movie at all costs. My best guess is that my fellow Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. What they meant was, of course: "One of the greatest sleep festivals of all time" and "Really an epic failure". <br /> <br /> In conclusion, do not waste your time. If you'd like to watch a top quality movie, visit www.youtube.com and watch a montage of Halo 3. If I played the movie "Battleship Potemkin" in a Guardian killer game, I would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then my tea bag dead. PEACE!
