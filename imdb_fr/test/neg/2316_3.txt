"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!" If IMDb allowed revisions in one word, that would be mine. This film was originally intended for children only and it would seem to be very difficult for adults or older children to watch the movie. The song, the story, everything is dull and faded - just like this impression of the public domain. Like other comedy-based comedy-based comic-book movies (such as the impressive SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and the BABES IN TOYLAND), this film has limited appeal and does not age well. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many children would even find this film enjoyable! So, my advice is to NOT watch this movie. If you NEED to watch a movie from Abbott and Costello, almost every other movie (with the exception of A & C GO TO MARS) would be an improvement.
