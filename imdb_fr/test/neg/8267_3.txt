I found the experience terribly disappointing! But I added a better style option similar to the bottom of this entry. <br /> <br /> This "Felicia trip" is intriguing. There is drama. But he is full of stereo types! <br /> <br /> It therefore ONLY serves discretionary temperaments without any concern for more true justice, fairness and truth, beyond the black and white judgments that correspond to 30-second "NEWS" announcements that dot our everyday multimedia experiences, especially news bulletins, true or misleading in such representations! <br /> <br /> It's SO EXAGERED, it reminds me of the fairy tale of "Little Red Riding"! Consider the innocent girl without identification crossing borders interrogated by a guard but released without any evidence and pursuing in search of her 'Romeo' who did not give her address "helping hand" befriend her with its improbable story made by the diaper! <br /> <br /> It seems to suit the directors and the management team that no one has faith or pray to God, even in these times of despair! <br /> <br /> Thus, in these first parameters, he orchestrates and tells much of what will happen! A nightmarish journey that betrays the essence of substance without fairy tale resolution, without truth, without integrity and without credibility! ... then a twist and all is over. What a desappointment! If you want to see a MUCH HIGH movie that explores similar themes with MUCH more credibility, with a much more powerful insight, watch the 1983 film "The Man of Flowers" by Paul Cox / Norman Kaye !!! <br /> <br /> Unlike here, you will not be disappointed!
