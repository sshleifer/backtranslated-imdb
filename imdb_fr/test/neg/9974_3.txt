This original HBO is pretty simple and pretty stupid. Armand Assante, once again making a bad imitation of Stallone, is Ray Wellman, a former inmate on parole. All he wants is his old girlfriend Lacy, played by a young Marcia Gay Harden, back. Unfortunately for Ray, Lacy met the Elliot Pier, played by Sam Neill. What makes it even more complicated is that Ray's old friends of Cell want favors and kidnap Lacy to make sure they happen. Ray and Elliot team up, despite mutual disgust. <br /> <br /> The following is violent and slow, but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why she would win an Oscar in the future, she is not so refined here, but her raw emotion, sincerity and some scenes rather explicit nudes are almost worth watching. Almost. <br /> <br /> Rent "Fever" (no, the title is not suitable for the film) if you are one of his fans, otherwise skip it and be grateful that his stars are doing better things. <br /> <br /> Note: This is an "R" movie for language, violence and nudity.
