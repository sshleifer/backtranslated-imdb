This film was like a gathering of people who had been in other movies and they decided to make a very bad movie. There was a guy from "Detroit Rock City", a girl from "The Cosby Show", that dork who had kissed the girl and bought that sausage in "Sorority Boys" and there was more. OK, that's not a bad movie in itself, it's just something I noticed. All with the prostitute and the French girl of the same name was stupid and the thing with 37 people writing these notes and if you think they will mingle ..... quite shocking ....... you have called. And the purse was just stupid. It was so bad that I watched the movie in two parts and reached only 50 minutes. If you look at this and expect "Van Wilder" or a movie like that ...
