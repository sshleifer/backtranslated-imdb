What I miss most in this film is that it leaves no room for imagination, everything is said. It's like a documentary film, but not as good as a documentary, because it's not a documentary. A patchwork film without a story continues. Very superficial, there is no reason to think, because the film already tells you what you are supposed to think. Too many different problems are discussed but none are developed to make you think. I do not even know if it's a funny movie that wants to be serious or a serious movie that wants to be funny. Many scenes are very unrealistic and the acting is quite mediocre. The movie is pretty boring.
