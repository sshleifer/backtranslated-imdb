If a copy of this film fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. I am a big fan of "B" movies and I have seen my share of bad movies, but there is not a letter in the alphabet that can adequately describe this piece of solidified and rancid jasper. This film goes beyond the phase "so bad that it's good" and goes directly to the phase "so bad that your world will seem a little less significant to have watched". <br /> <br /> It is difficult to say what is more disturbing: .1. The fact that those who wrote this thought that their political satire (I use the term very, very vaguely) was spiritual enough to film. They managed to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this garbage for obviously little or no money. That someone really thought it would be a good idea to take it to distribute on a horror anthology DVD. <br /> <br /> If I had been a weaker man, I would have most likely depressed grapefruit spoons in my eyes and then blindly cast myself to my death in oncoming traffic after watching that. In the current state of things, I live, but the experience marks me forever.
