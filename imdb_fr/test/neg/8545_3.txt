Terribly disappointed by CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD. Lost is an exciting and unpredictable scenario. Instead, it is rather unpredictable than the obvious attempts to manipulate the public by a pretentious and superficial production and distribution team. This story ended up looking like a soap opera rather than an independent movie, which should have been. This is what happens when distributors try to reach a wider audience (beautiful ridiculous images of the Rio coast, etc.) at the expense of a story and captivating characters. I really do not care what happened to one of the characters in this movie - they were all very dimensional. In short, sad waste of potential that should have been a slam-dunk following the exceptionally inspired city of CITY OF GOD. Boo!
