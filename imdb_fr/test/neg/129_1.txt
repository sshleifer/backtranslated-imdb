I can not explain how this film is a load of waste. I really like I can not. <br /> <br /> plot = acting shit = shit budget = so low its risible <br /> <br /> Jesus, that's the only good thing in this movie, it's the main character It was rather hot. <br /> <br /> The only people I feel and who think this movie is good are the ones who participated in the film. I am sure they did not fund this project because no money was invested. (HAHAhaha to the point where the heads are shaved) <br /> <br /> This film has already wasted too much my life, so I will not waste any more time writing my review for him.
