The Emperor's dog (Richard Haydn) is engaged to Johanna's dog (Joan Fontaine). However, when Virgil (Bing Crosby) arrives in town to sell a gramophone record player to the emperor, his dog is attacked by Johanna's dog. After a vengeance attack in which Virgil is banished from the city, a psychoanalyst insists that Johanna's dog must face Virgil's dog to be able to defeat his dog fears. This is arranged and the dogs fall in love. Virgil and Johanna too. The rest of the film passes with love and in the end, Johanna's dog gives birth. But who is the father .......? <br /> <br /> The dog's story is the very weak vehicle that is used to try to create a story between humans. It's a terrible story. There are 3 main musical pieces that are all garbage - bad songs and awful choreography. It's just an extremely boring movie - Bing has too many words in each sentence and delivers them in a way that is almost screaming and irritating. It's not funny ............ NEVER .......... but it's supposed to be. Bing and Joan did a lot better than that.
