This film is terrible and does not blame Jesus Franco, because it is not his fault. <br /> <br /> This film was shot in silence for many years by Welles as he got the money to bring together a team and the actors. shooting. The number of films actually shot by Welles is unclear, although not all sequences and sequences are present, as several "key" sequences, such as Quixote in a movie theater, are in the hands of collectors or patrons. give them. The film lasts a little less than two hours and I would have a hard time imagining it. I am of the opinion, based on several comments made by Welles before his death, that he had never really intended to release the film, but mounted it as a personal toy. <br /> <br /> What exists here is for the most part beautifully shot, but dramatically dead. Quichotte and Sancho wander through the countryside during the first hour. Dull would be a kind description of the material. In the second hour, Quixote ends in modern Spain and in a series of not very good sequences that deal with everyday life. That does not mean that there are not some good times, the windmill and chicken sequences are pretty good, but it's mostly a huge waste of film and time. <br /> <br /> "Finished" by Jesus Franco, who was Welles's assistant director in Chimes at Midnight, of great quality, we have a series of film fragments that have been put together as best as possible. Many people have crucified Franco as the reason why the film stinks, but frankly, you can not make a good movie with crappy stuff. One critic stated that he had seen a different version of the film in the 1970s, which meant that Franco had created this version and ruined it. While this may be true, I came across stories of Welles cutting and intersecting the film several times over the years as he could never do it properly. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible, no matter the slice it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I wonder how good a filmmaker Welles was. Apart from Citizen Kane, almost all of his films were affected by a lack of budget or were hampered. We are therefore under the pretext that many of his films "would have been better if only ...". How do we know? How can we know? Welles was perhaps a less talented man than we thought and many of his limit films are simply not good and never would have been. Although this is not a place to discuss Welles' place in the history of cinema, Don Quixote's material has survived, assuming it gets closer to what Welles wanted (I think it's the case), is a good argument to rethink our vision of the man and his work. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 for the good sequences (although 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality)
