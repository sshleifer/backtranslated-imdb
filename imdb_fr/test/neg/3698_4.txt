This is the kind of film that BEGS should be showing on TV at 3 or 4 am, if at all. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that the directors responsible for "The Attack of the 50-Foot Woman" thought they were making a relevant statement about women and the plots and dangers of demon rum, all wrapped up an allegory of science fiction. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it was a tax deduction. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "the attack" is preferable for the spectator in the following cases: a) extreme intoxication, b) seen on a double bill with one of these Jacqueline Suzanne's movies (maybe "Once is Not Enough"?) or c) just a night where you do not feel safe and where the world around you is a little too perfect. Enter "Attack" and you will feel good, guaranteed! <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to laugh at the expense of the hokey script, the rubbery special effect and the four-eyed sheriff. And I think the last line should be engraved in a monument somewhere in Washington DC - it's just memorable. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "The attack of the woman of 50 feet"; buy a copy, send it to Gloria Steinem - she will love you for that.
