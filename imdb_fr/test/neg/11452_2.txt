This film was, out of 67 of the 71 best pictures I've seen, by far the worst. First, I found the plot somewhat absurd - the husband missing for 25 years / still in love / not even a letter! Leave me alone. And why did the guy who had been away for so long by chance work on an oil rig next to the congresswoman's party? This film also featured some of the worst stereotypes of African Americans I have ever seen. It makes party (see Prissy) completely progressive! I hardly saw a film that displeased me so much. UGH!
