Twenty years ago, Dr. Chopper (he was driving a helicopter while cutting people apart) disappeared when the police found the corpses in his clinic. Since then, people have disappeared around Lake Tanoka (or something like that) and corpses / parts of corpses have been found everywhere. It turns out that Dr. Chopper needs parts of the body to stay alive and took them to strangers, like a pair of lesbians and 5 sorority girls at their initiation (you see the picture) while traveling through Tanoka Lake. When a group of teenagers decides to go camping, they have to fight with the doctor ..... <br /> <br /> Well, if you want to waste a little time, that's the good thing choice. Acting varies from very bad to poor with girls who stumble and fall all the time for no apparent reason. All chances of showing skin are taken but without showing anything at all. The same goes for the special effects that are pretty pathetic with each slash filmed in one corner, you can not see it, but there are a lot of body parts in the film all soaked with blood (probably to hide how much they look really sad). The plot is quite flawed and the dialogue rather sad. The only time I laughed was when Dr. Chopper said, "Hi!" trying to be scary. Do not look at this one if you are not a fan of hack'n'slash. Even then, I would recommend you to look at something better.
