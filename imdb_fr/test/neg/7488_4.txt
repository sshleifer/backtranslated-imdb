It is clear that Andreas Bethmann would like to wear the crown of Jess Franco while coveting (at least kinematically) the wife of the old beast of burden, Lina Romay. Romay plays a corrupt prison guard, salacious and masturbating in this W.I.P. modern and ambitious. movie. With a few exceptions, many of Franco's films are unnecessarily produced and produced in a neglected and hasty manner. The plans do not always cut together and the sound mixes can be horrible. While looking at "Angel of Death 2" (aka "Prison Island Massacre"), I wondered if Bethmann was deliberately trying to replicate Franco's patent mediocrity, or if he was just of poor quality as his mentor. Is this film deliberately bad, which would be doomed to failure, or is it just bad by negligence? After a hitchhiker is forced to do a blowjob with her gun, her rapist fills her mouth and then fills her vagina with drugs. A few minutes later, she is taken to a prison on top of a cliff for reasons that are not explained and subject to threats and brutal treatment of staff and other detainees. Since this is a WIP movie, there are many lesbian scenes and a lot of violent behavior. The blood is bloody and sadistic too, with delights like pulling teeth and scalping (courtesy of Olaf Ittenbach). The acting is pretty awful and the fight scenes are lame, but there is a love of sleaze in every frame and an understanding of what trash fans enjoy. Unfortunately, the flat script creates a flat film. So, despite many atrocities, hardcore sex and an appearance of Jess Franco, the experience is empty. But is not that what most of Jess Franco's movies are?
