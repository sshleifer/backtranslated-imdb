If I was 5 years old, I could find it scary. It's (I suppose) a low budget movie. The acting game is not good, but could be worse - the shooting and the special effect is awful. The scenario is thin and it is not worth lingering. Too much time is spent on boring screaming scenes. The pursuit or the fight against the aliens remind me of children who fight with scary masks. Some gore with blood and body parts - scare a 5 year old, I guess. Apparently, scare some people's crap in the movie. <br /> <br /> It is far from reaching something like the movie Tremors. <br /> <br /> It turns out to be an "incident". and we see extraterrestrial ships near the Earth. We wonder if someone will do a sequel ...
