It's completely nil not to watch the main character is so concerned about the king that the bomb shelter of the doc is not big enough for everyone. So he says that the doc plays God saying who lives and who dies all his life, he kills people without thinking twice and hitting people until death, the main character is a little selfish rag because, because of him, the doctor who built the shelter died and his friend died. he also killed several unnamed cops the main character is just a stupid hillbilly king's head who does not have the notion of even greater goodness, this movie has no absolute meaning. tell me why a comet would cause seismic activity? (If you speak of gravity, I will provoke the rape of the king, because the comet is smaller than the moon and you do not see the moon causing volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and avalanches). <br /> <br /> atmospheric releases (red flashes, why is it also red?) In addition, if you do not know, the MOON OF FUC KING ARE HIT BY COMETS THOUSANDS OF TIME !! ! That's why there are many royal craters all over the moon. the size of an object needed to break the moon in fragments, as described in the film, would require a comet the size of the moon itself. <br /> <br /> It takes huge amounts of KE to blow up a satellite like that. <br /> <br /> One of the blunders of this film is that the nuclear explosion in space resulted in a disk-shaped shock wave. it is incorrect, because in space, the explosion should have produced a spherical shock wave. this inaccuracy is also evident when the comet strikes the moon. <br /> <br /> Also, someone tells me why the commander (the person who drives the big old broken plane) suddenly felt the need to die? I mean he looks like walking with them to the shelter, then he stops, he greets the main character. <br /> <br /> WTF?!? !!?!? the main character is also an ugly hole @ $$, he has a huge forehead and sparse hair. disgusting. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM !!!
