Finally. Here is a film that does as much for the reputation of the men of Greece and Russia that "Gigli" did for those of Mr. Affleck and Mrs. Lo. From the edge of the city tells the sad and sordid life of some young Russian emigrants who live in Athens and the surrounding area and rob cars, get fucked, emit prostitutes and prostitute themselves (but 't do, you know .. .. And if we do it, it's only once or twice, with the same guy. ") There is almost nothing here that you have not seen before and better, only the local Athens adds a small novelty - even in this case, there is only one scene or two that is scenic.The writer / director Constantine Giannaris ("3 Steps to Heaven") offers a relatively generic time of 95 minutes, in which the remarkable moments imply how much of these guys are stupid, sexist and (so it seems). (It is interesting to note that the more the guy is gayer, the more he appears redeemable.) Which is really embarrassing, it's the treatment of women, the Greek and Russian men would seem give the Italians reason for their money in this famous madonna / whore complex. Has life in Greece improved a lot for women since Plato and Socrates? It must be asked. <br /> <br /> If I seem to equate the Russians and Greeks in this review, I apologize, but even the non-émigrés represented here (the taxi driver, for example) are crazy. According to another review on this site, the film (a success on its own ground) has in fact been submitted by Greece to an Academy Award for best foreign film. What it says about the state of Greek cinema, I hesitate to think.
