There are a number of movies that my high school friends were joking about. It was above all the camp works of the 50s that were broadcast on television during the last show. It was one of our favorites. The soul of a fallen native is brought to life in a stump with a scowl. Now, my friends have claimed that if you look closely, you can see that the thing has shoes. I have never seen this. What strikes me most is that the natives seemed to be white men with greased faces of black fat; some looked Italian. They also spoke with the weirdest tone that did not seem to fit their situation. As with movies about mummies, the mobility of things did not seem to be a threat. In a confrontation, we must only walk fast; I guess it's the old element of surprise. If you see this, do not take it too seriously. Be happy that we have a battery of old horror movies that have brought us such joy.
