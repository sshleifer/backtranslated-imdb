God, I've never felt so insulted in my life with this shit. There are so many ways to describe this shit that I think that if I said everything that goes through my head, I would be banned from this site. <br /> <br /> How to start? Well, on the one hand, it's not necessary to know the original series to know that this movie is a slap to the face of those who have seen it. The biggest slaughter of a theme song ever made is here, from a metal version to a freaking, what were they thinking about? What is the connection between Underdog and an intense electronic music style? The story is so fundamental that I will do something that I do not usually do and that I do not even summarize a summary. Just think this: a dog gets super powers, fill in the rest. This is how predictable this film is. And then come the jokes ... please, kill me now. This style of humor that may not make children laugh is so bad, well, expect what you can say after sneezing. It was a bit funny. <br /> <br /> But what surprises me the most is that Jason Lee (Ny Name Is Earl), Patrick Warburton (New Groove of the Emperor) and Jim Belushi (According to Jim) are all here. In the shows / films I mentioned, the actors, in my opinion, do a good job and, with the exception of Lee, are the best actors in this film, but that says very little. The rest deserves the Golden Rasberry nominations for this shit. I am very sad to see such good actors being buried by this disaster. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is as serious as Doogal, which I also examined, and which, again, I would explode if I saw something worse than that.
