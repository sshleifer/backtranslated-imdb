My spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie made me so angry that I got pissed off. <br /> <br /> Once you've finished watching, you're staring at the TV in confusion and horror. Then there is a light tap on your shoulder and a whistling voice: "You will die in seven days." You turn around and one of your best friends stands there with a look of absolute hatred for the one who suggested this movie when you were in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to lie: it's the worst film on the face of the earth. I saw it with 5 of my friends, all 18 year old boys, and here are our reactions: - One person actually started crying and punching himself - Someone screamed and fainted -A person got up and stumbled to the door reappear more than an hour later -A person just blackened (this one was me) -A person started babbling incoherently, as if he had both cerebral palsy and Touretts syndrome - A person went into a sort of catatonic trance and did not answer our voices for more than twenty minutes <br /> <br /> The movie is really so bad. There is a part where the belated cameraman stumbles (while holding the camera), but the producers have decided to leave it in. Seriously, you can hear him growling and swearing when he touches the ground. There is only one special effect, and it is special in the same way that a delayed child who tries to solve a Rubix Cube is special: the camera rotates so that the action on the screen (action , No. Some dumbass lost in a cornfield for 80 minutes freaking) makes a barrel. <br /> <br /> In no circumstances should it be watched, and the film itself warns you about it. Do you know what the slogan on the back is? "Some warnings should not be ignored." Honestly, I think the release of this film to the public is a morbid joke on the part of the producers. That does not mean, however, that you should let him go if you see him at the movie store - he would then stay on the shelf for another poor miller to see him. Instead, buy every copy you can get hold of and send it to people you hate.
