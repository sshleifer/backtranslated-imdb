For a series inspired by Kolchak, it is ironic that the first attempt of a vampire episode by The X Files lands squarely on the ass. I was always intrigued and - at the risk of looking like the dreaded Hans Keller - I often wondered if I was missing the goal. The story looks like a puzzle whose pieces do not match the box. So you spend a pleasant evening by the fire trying to reproduce a truly marine sky. This incomplete feeling remains, no matter how many times you revisit the episode and whatever attention you give it. I know this criticism puts me in danger of being dragged to Whitby by vampire teens who will drink my blood while listening to Busted, but that's a risk I'm willing to take. I have always been a werewolf-man.
