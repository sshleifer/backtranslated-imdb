* MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In this supposed satire, Chaplin set his sights on the evils of German fascism, playing the dual role of Toman's dictator, Adenoid Hynkel and one of his subjects, a Adventurous world war hero and jewish hairdresser. Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and the Marx brothers, Hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on his neighbor Osterlich while leaving time for many strangely flat pieces. The famous waltz of the dictator with an inflatable globe is in reality entirely heavy, disappointing and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Chaplin certainly deserves to be congratulated for watching Hitler and for speaking loudly about celluloid - his beloved final The talk is actually the daring and memorable climax of the play - but the film is simply not sharp enough or funny enough to deserve the praise often given to him or to require repeated viewing. The best gags are far from the boring posture of Hynkel and involve The Barber trying to avoid a big spinning bomb (a sequence that steals the showdown in The Gold Rush) and later, with a pot on his head, accidentally leaving the board off the board. On the roof of his shop. <br /> <br /> Compared to the director's silent classics, The Great Dictator is slow, extremely incoherent and utterly unsatisfactory, while the sterile chimes between bursts of laughter are often long and hard to bear. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing images and The Great Dictator certainly ranks as such.
