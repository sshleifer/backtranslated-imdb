This movie was terrible. You could not move fast enough to get to the end of this movie. The last 20 minutes of the movie have passed and I literally pressed the eject button in the middle of the stage. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Worse than all of Dean Cain's movies together. For starters, the acting game was terrible. I realize that the main actors belonged to the survivor cast, but one would think that any television experience would have given them a little more talent. The other main problem was the lack of visual effects and the poor quality of the film. In the defense of the films, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was good.
