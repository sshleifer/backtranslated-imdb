Well, run me to the side. I have not seen a movie at home that bad since the 13 SECOND or HALF CASTE. Someone should remove the Sony Handycam from this guy! This movie proves that being able to make a movie on your camcorder for $ 20 does not necessarily mean you should do it. <br /> <br /> I remember one of the things that Robert Rodriguez wrote in his book, "Rebel Unmanned", is that when you have decided to create a function without a budget, you have to use all the assets at your disposal. Rodriguez says you should take stock of all the slots and accessories that you can beg, steal and borrow from your friends. Robert Rodriquez was friends with the mayor of a city in Mexico. The mayor allowed him to film for free. What you have in EL MARIACHI is a movie that seems to cost a lot more than the actual budget. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the director of this film has a copy, and he took it to heart. In this case, he was apparently friends with a guy who owned a cornfield where they built a haunted house every year. This seems like a good location for a horror movie, but it's hard to keep an interesting cornfield for 90 minutes. Not a single installment of the ENFANTS DU CORN series has spent more than a few minutes in the corn field. Hitchcock only spent about ten minutes in one in NORTH NORTHWEST. One hint, man ... Cornfields do not make movies fascinating. It would have been nice if the director had more friends with more places, because it gets pretty tedious after the first 15 minutes. This film seems to cost about $ 30. (or whatever it cost to enter the labyrinth of cornfields). <br /> <br /> Apparently, he could not even find anyone to play in his movie, so he threw himself. Big mistake. Here's an idea, if you really want to make a movie, find an actor. So when it comes to assets, it seems like the labyrinth of cornfields is the only thing the poor guy had. Maybe he thought that was enough. In fact, I'm going to go on a limb and say that I knew he thought it was enough because the film, before capturing the coveted honor of being a continuation of DARK HARVEST, was simply called THE MAIZE: THE MOVIE. Maybe he is already preparing MAIZE: MUSIC or even MAIZE: THE MINI-SERIES. <br /> <br /> Our jack of all trades (and yes, the "Nothing Master" part of this adage is definitely appropriate here) plays a psychic father who can tell when bad things are going to happen. Think of the character of DEAD ZONE, but are not as good actor as Christopher Walken or even Anthony Michael Hall. Psychic Dad has the premonition that his two daughters, who are in maze labyrinth with mom, are going to be killed. He rushes to save them. From that moment on, the whole film happened to watch Pyschic's father run into a cornfield looking for his two daughters. He finds the two little ghost girls of THE SHINING and helps solve the mystery of their murder. <br /> <br /> Shot on a $ 200 Handycam. The director has thrown himself. Published on iMovie. Improvised story. If that's not enough to keep you away from this deadly disaster, consider this as a last warning ... TOTAL FILM unfolds in a cornfield, boils and ghouls. Here is Ghoulie Guru's advice on how to save money while having the impression to see this movie. The next time you see a corn field, stop the car. Take a flashlight and go run for about 90 minutes.
