The main premise of this film is the fantasy of every woman: a vagina that kills and eats men. At least, it's a fantasy for all women who have ever fought a man. What is it, 99.9999% of women? But do not worry, it's not some kind of dreadful eats of men. It's more like a comic slurping in, like a drain plug. There is no blood or parts left behind. So, for fans of blood, guts and coolness, forget about this film, not a lot of composure here. <br /> <br /> The two main characters of the film are somewhat unrealistic. Helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute. Meanwhile, Dennis is a good guy who harasses Helen. <br /> <br /> The story is already a little ridiculous at this point, but then they add two other equally stupid sub-stories that send this film the wrong way. Territory B-movie. The first new sub-story tells of Dennis discovering a new love with a pair of Siamese twins; and finally murder one of them and become a bank robber on the run. The second new sub-story is about finding a new love for Helen with a kind policeman who saved her from a bad prostitution-related outing and decided he wanted to marry her. Dennis and Helen finally meet up at the end of the film in totally unbelievable circumstances and, as if by magic, Helen's murderous vagina is healed!
