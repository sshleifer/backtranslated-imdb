(There Are Spoilers) Usual slasher film with the story unfolding around this abandoned mine by God outside the almost deserted city of Sutterille. After receiving a letter card and a gold nugget from her brother Jared, Shadrach Smith, Clair and her husband Nick Breman, Carrie Bradac and Sean Hines, go to the village along with four other friends and gold prospectors from the Alx & Tori frame, Steve Wastell & Sangie, and Hayden & Rox Ann, Rick Majeske and Elina to play their claim. <br /> <br /> Later, it became apparent that the fact that Jared had disrupted the long-forgotten gold mine had revived Jeremiah Stone's ghost, Vernon Wells, and the resumption of his terrorist reign. Stone, or 49er, is one of the ridiculous ridiculous in the history of moving pictures. It looks like Stone has been buried for years under a few tons of coal lying around with this hook that cuts people in half. After practicing almost all of the cast, Aunt Nelly (Karen Black), whose daughter Eve (Alexandra Ford) was also one of Stone's victims, tells those who are still alive that unless return the gold to the Stone mine, the crazy miner never rest until he has killed all those who still have it. <br /> <br /> Aunt Nelly is left just time to tell her story before she becomes a human torch of Stone and eventually jump into a nearby stream.The film continues without end, the A killer miner running wild, looking as scary as burnt toast and just as dark. Even those in the movie did not seem to show any real fear of him. In a scene where he broke into Aunt Nelly's house, everyone was charged instead of running away, resulting in the loss of the ghost miner's right arm; Stone spent the rest of the film with a miner's pick attached to his "stump". <br /> <br /> Besides the actress Karen Black, the movie "Miners Massacre" also includes veteran actors John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch in the role of Sheriff Murphy and Old Man Prichard. Fair, but nothing special, the film has a predictable end with all the gold mine in flames. The audience has hinted by the authors of "Miners Massacre" that the end of this senseless madness is nowhere and that it could very well resurface in a very near future in a possible sequel, God help us all!
