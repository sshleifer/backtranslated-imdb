UFOs are actually a demonic deception to deceive people into thinking that there is another intelligent life in the universe. The idea of ​​Satan is to make you believe that there may be more in life than what is in the Bible. <br /> <br /> The kidnappings could be used to explain the kidnapping. People left behind would think that it is a massive kidnapping by aliens, instead of God taking all Christians to paradise. No reason to repent if his extraterrestrials. The deeper message in the film is that if you do not believe in God and have life in your life, you do not believe in anything and your life is irrelevant.
