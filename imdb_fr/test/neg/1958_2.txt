Why did I have to go out and buy (yes buy!) JACK FROST 2: THE RETURN OF MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN ??? Maybe it was an explosion of temporary mental disturbance? But I guess it's because I sort of liked the first JACK FROST. It was a stupid but amusing horror comedy that had acceptable effects of Screaming Mad George. That and the fact that on the back cover of the sequel, there was this beautiful picture of this guy impaled by this giant ice cube (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all the rest). So I said to myself: if it's as silly as the first one and there's nice splashing / gory, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so wrong! <br /> <br /> Let me first say that the film deserves credit for its extremely crazy and delayed plot. I mean, a killer mutant snowman on a tropical island that breeds mutant killer baby balls that can only be killed or injured by bananas ??? As much as I like the premise, I really hated the movie. First of all: Although the first JACK FROST looks like a real movie (apparently shot on a real movie and on all the movies), this sequel looks like a third-rate soap-opera. In this way he has a look too filmed on the video. The lighting is simply awful (bright white spots for the daytime look and stupid colors like blue and green at night). The acting game ... well, do not even go there. The dialogues range from steep to extremely senile (this Jamaican man was just stupid, saying "man" after every sentence). And as for the killer snowman's voice, all I could think of was a Chucky Chucky, in the seventh game, spitting out dumb and supposedly witty phrases before he kills somebody 'a. <br /> <br /> The best joke was a guy asks "Why are you talking to your watch?". And the best scene was probably the one with this beautiful Asian girl who came out of nowhere and who was swimming in the pool completely naked (thank God for that!). Oh, yes, and this little scene on the end credits with these two Japanese guys on a misnamed niche boat made me laugh too. But the worst thing about this movie was: Where was the gore and splash action that everyone is talking about? There were many opportunities to show some bloody decent killings. Many people have been killed in an original way here, but all off screen. As I read in many other comments, there were indeed beautiful montages to an explosion of the head, a crushed body, ruffled eyes, tongue torn off ... but in crucial moments, the editor in chef cutting white splatters on the floor or nothing at all. This frontal shot of this British being impaled (from the cover of the DVD) was not even in the film. I only saw this killing filmed from the back (which means I did not see sh! T!). I was waiting for that to happen throughout the movie, then I do not see anything?!?! What a desappointment! Would I have seen a cut version of the film? It would be a shame, because only a decent amount of splash could have saved this movie if you asked me. To see many killer snowballs reduced to blood pulp was not enough for me. Speaking of these snowballs: they were very badly done. They made MUNCHIES look like an "animatronic" at the cutting edge of technology. But I guess that was the goal of all this. At one point, the effects team even turned to a ridiculously bad CGI. Boy, you really have to see it to believe it. The best is not to see it, in fact, because this movie is really a shame (okay, I laughed with him because he was getting worse). Just stay with the first JACK FROST (1996) and everything will be fine (keep in mind that this is a pretty silly but fun horror comedy). <br /> <br /> It's funny, but writer The director Michael Cooney had to realize that he was a very bad director after JACK FROST 2, then he focused on writing. It turns out that he then wrote two very good thriller scripts for THE I INSIDE (with Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (with John Cusack). The man seems to have talent after all. <br /> <br /> It would be too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest possible score. So, I say a point for this naked Asian girl doing the skinny dive and a point for these completely delayed snowball babies. Congratulations Mr. Cooney!
