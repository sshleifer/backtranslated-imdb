Beautiful music. Beautiful photography, some scenes are breathtaking and touching. But the dramatic tension is lost in a film so badly mounted that it is difficult to know exactly what is happening. Sometimes the dialogue is incomprehensible. Then there is Richard Gere. He is supposed to be a factory worker who has problems and works on a farm. We see dozens of sweaty and dirty farmers under the hot sun. We then see Gere, who seems to be moving away from an advertisement by Calvin Klein. Sam Shepard, another glamorous guy, is supposed to be terminally ill. But he looks great. Nice try, but it does not work. Brook Adams does his best but gets lost in the landscape. The real star is the girl.
