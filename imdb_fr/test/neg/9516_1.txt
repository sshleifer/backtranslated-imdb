This movie was so frustrating to watch. The split screens do not allow you to get much involved in the emotions of the actors. I was constantly back and forth looking at all those tiny pictures that I ended up with wiplash at the end. This is essentially a scam for "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Timecode". I would have liked to be out like so many others.
