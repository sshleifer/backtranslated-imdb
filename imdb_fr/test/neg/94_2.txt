The most positive points in this film were the credits (style of the text) and some moments in the acting of Ice-T. The story; two rival gangs that must fight, with the secondary intrigues of betrayal, power and change, are well-worn intrigues but in this case difficult (very) difficult to cross. The decrepit landscape, which added a slight credibility to the scene and dubious lighting, was constantly distracted from any interest / identification of the characters (the brightness of the front / nose of the actress was blinding, not to mention other scenes of same problem.) Even halfway through the movie, I wanted to know more about how and why this happened as opposed to what was happening on the screen. A disappointment if you saw Ice-T in other roles. Congratulations to other actors who seemed to be playing their role despite the weakness of management; The kick of Corrupt and the other employee of the restaurant.
