It's as if the publisher and the scriptwriter only had 40 minutes of real time. This is supposed to be a remake of a Chinese movie, which is obviously far superior to this junk. It is clear that some brainless Hollywood writers and writers have decided that this film would be a mano a mano, a man to another, instead of letting the story be played with the personalities of the characters built in the first 40 minutes. At this stage of the film, the characters do not behave like ordinary people and do not even look like their own personalities. That does not make sense. Why did this movie fail? It's just not believable and it's a shame - it started with a promise. Do not be fooled.
