The summary was promising but watching the movie was a huge disappointment. Nothing happens in this movie. The layout is linear and unsurprising. The normal characters stay normal until the end of the movie, the strange characters are strange until the end of the film. There is not even a single attempt to persuade the viewer to think that the villain is anyone other than the most obvious candidate. On the positive side, the actors play quite well, and there is a little atmosphere in the film, but far too little to be meaningful. <br /> <br /> The people who voted 10 for this film did not show it, or are members of the film production team! 4 is well paid.
