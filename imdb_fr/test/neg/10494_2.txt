When the budget does not create a Cadillac, Packard, Lincoln or Imperial hearse, we speak in a low voice. It's the language of birds for cheap cheap. <br /> <br /> What's in the hair of the forty-year-old boy? The guy who looks like a cement head who tries several times to overthrow John Agar and provides the only fright of the film by its proximity. His hair looks like a shoe. A patent leather shoe. It's a shoe. <br /> <br /> The nurse needs an immediate wash of hair. She has a hairspray in her blonde locks that would ignite if the production company could afford lights. <br /> <br /> The monster? The music was more scary. I would try to flee the music. The monster probably had better hair than the rest of the cast. Apply a little lipstick on this monster and you will get the elder sister of Divine. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera, editing and plot provided a buffer to prepare the public for bad music. <br /> <br /> Hello Mr. Agar? We're thinking of doing a sequel to Night Fright and ... Mr. Agar? Agar? Tom Willett
