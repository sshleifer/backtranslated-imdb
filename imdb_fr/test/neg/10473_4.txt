I really do not know if it was supposed to be science fiction or horror. It was confusing to say the least. What really upset me, though, is the lack of story development between the characters. <br /> <br /> The 17-year-old Sheriff (Bruce Boxleitner) daughter (Clara Bryant) is stuck with him during the summer, and they do not spend 30 seconds on the screen at the same time. <br /> <br /> Native American Indian (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) apparently has a great taste for the sheriff, but does not spend time together either. . <br /> <br /> The hot secretary (Kristen Honey) ended up dead and she had more ability to act than the other two together. <br /> <br /> The bad developer against the Native Americans is an overused story, but personally, I like that perverse developers get theirs while I live in Florida. <br /> <br /> The only reason I stayed with this is this creature. It was original. I have never seen anything like it and I am a sucker for new creatures.
