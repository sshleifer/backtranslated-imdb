OK ... even before starting the more or less constructive criticism of the film, I would like to say a few words that come from the heart ... THIS FILM SUCKS !!!! DO NOT SEE IT EXCEPT IF YOU WANT REAL STORIES OF BOY SWEATY AND WOOD-ACTING, NON-FIELD STORIES .. So, let's see why I find the movie so bad: 1. There is no 'history. There is no conspiracy. The director tried to create a mystery if the feeling was not there. 2. All this looks like a big one and a half hour promotion for some kind of "BSB" group of goth-wanna-be-but-looking like ... Like all the guys at school, the abs are perfect , not young fat or ugly people ... there is not a beautiful girl in the movie, not one. The main character is either wet in the pool, or sweaty in bed ... poor guy. It must be awful to go on a date that transpires like this. 3. Can these guys do something good with their powers? Nothing good? For example, put out the fire in this old stable or help his friend who had the accident instead of running to break things and show themselves in front of others. 4. wooden play. The main character has only two expressions on his face. Expression number one: sad. Expression number two: try to look attractive but always look sad ... In this group of boys, there are 4 types: the main charmed, his best friend who had the accident, the blondy, and the fourth ... what was the name of the fourth? I think he spoke only twice throughout the film: once in the beginning (he said that jumping off the cliff using "power" will not kill them) and a second time at the end when he and the blondy lost the girl .. the film could have been done without him and no one would notice ... Anyway, my verdict: 1 is the perfect score for this movie. Guys - do not go see him. There is very little action, no suspense, no hot girls. The girls - at least the actors are beautiful ... What I would advise you to get a soundtrack of this movie - it's the only thing that I liked.
