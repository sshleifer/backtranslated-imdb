You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was perceived as a failure by the studio and that it was put on hold for a year before ALICE FAYE's popularity reached such a level that the studio decided to release the film even though it is never completely finished. It's modestly acceptable at the box office. <br /> <br /> Faye refers to a murder while in a nightclub in New York - and this scene was actually in the script and was the way the movie was to begin. Instead, it is completely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence (including a full Faye song number) was never filmed. However, the rest of the story is pretty much intact and allowed the release of the movie in 71 minutes. <br /> <br /> WARNER BAXTER, who looks tired, is too old to be as credible as Faye's romantic interest and only superficial as a degraded reporter. Today's audience will take offense at the portrayal of Chinese using fractured English phrases such as "Me likey make noisy". Key Luke is a Chinese Loyalist but plays his role in a discreet and direct manner. Arthur Treacher is almost invisible and yet receives the fourth bill on screen because of the changes made to the story. Originally, Joseph Schildkraut played a role in the film, but his role was eventually removed. <br /> <br /> A mishmash of film intended to entertain Alice Faye's most fervent fans, who will get a chance to see her in a dramatic - albeit feeble - role. Charles Winninger is totally lost as a man of goodness at the head of the American consulate. <br /> <br /> Despite all the weaknesses, there are some scenes of narrow leaks actually played and the black and white photography of Karl Freund is of superior quality.
