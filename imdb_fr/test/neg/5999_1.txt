I can not see what everyone sees in this movie. The acting is just horrible, the choice of music is, to put it mildly, singular, there are not enough scenes of fighting, the plot does not exist and any entertainment that can be obtained from this movie is ruined by the annoying way some movies are filmed and gives you a cracked head.
