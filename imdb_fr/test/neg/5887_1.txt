At the very least, some of the sitcoms that are constantly leaving the United States are honestly bad. This junk food, however, represents a "comforting" parenting side for a clothing horse. Acting in a ridiculous way "learns" with looks and phrases in the style "I am so important and slim and handsome". In the episode I was in, someone's "work" was at stake, simply because a colleague had "made" a phone call, which destabilized her ... !! Really, it's the lowest of the lowest. What kind of damage does this impose on the observer masses, to see only glam-puss and gluttony people parading around "work". Make quite sick. When the titles came out, I thought, well, that provided jobs for the boys. You know who you are.
