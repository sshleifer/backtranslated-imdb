Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as an opportunity to become beautiful. When she refuses the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and it becomes beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst in her and she quickly left a chain of bodies behind her. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard the phrase "as exciting as watching the paint dry"? That pretty much sums up Satanik. During the movie, one of the characters said, "Something so horrible is inconceivable." I did not know if he was talking about something in a movie or the movie itself. I am really disappointed because I had a lot of hope for this one. Satanik had possibilities, but they never came true. At every opportunity, the plot asks Marnie to do the most banal things that are. The writing is horrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She is not very attractive and can not take the film alone. <br /> <br /> Another big problem of Satanik is the staging and editing. It's a mess. We see things and places that have no impact on the film. The camera lingers too long after the end of the scene. I can not think of one shot that could call something other than an original. This group of filmmakers shows little imagination or talent. <br /> <br /> I do not know maybe the Italian comic book on which Satanik is supposed to be, but I'm sure it must be better than this one. .
