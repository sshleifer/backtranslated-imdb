I found this film extremely homophobic ... the main character does not know he's gay until he realizes he likes Barbra Streisand and has a soft wrist !!! I was so upset that after the screening at the Toronto Film Festival, I went to talk to the screenwriter to complain about this film. This is the kind of movie that GLAAD has to work for to have banned.
