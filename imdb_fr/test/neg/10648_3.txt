After the failure of "Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth", the chapter that served as a "fatal blow" to the franchise, another cheap and embarrassing cashing was not a surprise. An abominable attempt to explain each Pinhead mystery and the puzzle box, literally covering centuries of history, in a film lasting less than 90 minutes ... The display is sub-equal to an actor miserable, to a miserable b-movie. special effects, and a ridiculous and insulting attempt at black humor, while trying to keep the whole project completely serious. I wonder how many directors were afraid of it? Poor Pinhead has a lot of time on the screen, so that all the mystery and threat that this iconic character had are completely lost. After an hour of listening to long speeches and dramatic postures, we simply want to tell the guy to shut up! moderately entertaining in places, especially in the first segment, this mess starts to look like a cheap and ugly film made for TV splashing after a while and ends in the most ridiculous way imaginable : Pinhead, with his dog Cenobite, kill a bunch of idiots ... in space! I'm sorry, but any real fan of the first two movies in the series, which gave the abortion of a movie to more than 3 stars, should be ashamed. On a side note, the following movie; "Hellraiser: Inferno" is in fact a surprisingly intelligent and stylish black film, which brilliantly restores the role of "Pinhead" as master of illusion and cruelty, and revives the concept of evil inherent in humanity . centerpiece of the original film, and the whole point of the story. For all serious horror fans, see Hellraiser I & II, skip the bad III and this one, and continue with "Inferno". You will not miss anything by jumping this trash ...
