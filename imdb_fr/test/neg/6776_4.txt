In the Japanese mountains, the young disabled artist Sessue Hayakawa (nicknamed "Tatsu", "The Dragon Painter") paints beautiful landscapes. He prays "Divinity" will restore his fianc√©e, which, according to him, was turned into a dragon, 1,000 years ago. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, an older, desperate painter, Edward Peil (as Kano Indara), complains that he has no sons to continue his family of artists. When Mr. Peil sees Mr. Hayakawa's paintings, he sees a painter worthy of becoming his "son and disciple". Hayakawa also falls in love with Peil's daughter Tsuru Aoki (Ume-Ko), convinced that she is the reincarnation of her long-lost princess. But, with his accomplished love, Hayakawa loses his ability to paint ?? <br /> <br /> Introductory Notes, "" The Dragon Painter "was published in 1919 by Haworth Pictures, a Hollywood production company created the year before by Sessue Hayakawa, a Japanese-born actor. was the ninth of Twenty-two feature films produced by Haworth, each adapted to the talents of Hayakawa and his Japanese acting company.
