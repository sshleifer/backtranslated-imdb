There is a moment in the film where the boss of the "machines of death" (a triet multiethnic to please everyone, being inclusive I think it is called nowadays) speaks to call a man business. Except that such is his delivery that it looks like "leather". It was at this moment that this spectator regained consciousness, thinking that this dull film opened a turning point in the new world of the evil. But that was not the case. The boss had to talk because the "machines of death" did not say a single word throughout the film and spoke as she does. Interminably. There is action in the film, but it's not so exciting and the plot goes from one shot to another. The three silent "death machines" live to survive another day at the end of the film. I hope there has been no follow up.
