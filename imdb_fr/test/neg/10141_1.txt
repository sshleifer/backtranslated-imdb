It's really a series "ok" ... everyone is very good. but I just can not take Reba. she tries to be funny but she just is not and then she has a stupid accent !! if they took it out of the show, I'd like to see it every day. <br /> <br /> I watch the show for 10 minutes now and, as I said before, Reba is destroying the show. However, the 20 year old guy (I do not know his name) but he's so funny, and he really records all that. <br /> <br /> So here's the recipe for a good show. Start Reba, then put the 20-year-old guy in the lead role. <br /> <br /> I really hope someone agrees with me and thinks (like me) that he should send Reba out of the show and put someone else in the lead role
