Although I could see the potentially redeeming qualities of this film through its intrigue, I certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the stage structure unfolded was too much to ask most viewers. Huge holes in the storyline, such as the mother's never-before-explained commentary "Your father died today," made it even more difficult to make sense of these characters. <br /> <br /> This first place in Cannes in 2001 is a shock given. Maybe the French were hungry for the film noir that year and they wanted something as sadistic as this film. I understood the long scenes as a way to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible, but when I could not understand the main character, it was going too far for me and kept me quite apart from the story. <br /> <This movie is reserved for the most passionate film noir moviegoers and those who do not expect any satisfaction from watching a movie once it is over. I liked movies such as "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which were much more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the sense of editing and stimulation. Watching this slow and painful teacher, silence after scene, became so superfluous that I found it tedious - and I really wanted to love this film at every turn.
