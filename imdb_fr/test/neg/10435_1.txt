The acting game made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play. The story is full of holes, gaps and jumps, so you have no idea what just happened. Half of the scenes are useless. There is not a small idea of ​​the development of the character. The score / soundtrack includes about three songs, one of which is played in about 70% of the scenes. I'm happy to have rented the movie but I still feel wrong. Avoid this movie at all costs, unless you want to see honest actors give horrible performances. It seems that most of the budget has been spent to engage some brand actors in this less than bad movie. This film is like going to a strip club, it tries to excite you and interest you, but, just like you think something is going to happen, you are immersed in a scene unrelated to you and trying to understand how did you get there?
