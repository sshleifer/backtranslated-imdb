Crime partner Quentin Tarantino, Roger Avary (co-author of "Pulp Fiction"), launches alone (QT will execute this prod.) For this French thriller too hot. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz It's Zed, an extraordinary cracker who left the United States for France adrift at the request of an old friend. He then teams up with a motley crew of drugged hippies who, with little or no planning, think they can knock down a vault filled with gold bullion at a French national holiday. <br /> Avary has revamped the Theft has turned out badly as a theme that Tarantino has so well developed in "Reservoir Dogs". Only "Killing Zoe" is not good enough to survive alone. Avary has therefore launched a beautiful distraction. Julie Delpy is Zoe, a student who just phoned and entertained Zed when she arrived in Paris. An amazing distraction, certainly, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> I guess our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme, but unfortunately the move did not help add so much depth to his so shallow plot. necessary. There has never been a story in this idea, which was just that, an idea. Even the surreal journey in the sordid dives of Paris is uninteresting. I guess you'd have to admit there was never a movie in the story of a group of gangsters shooting at each other until you add characters complex and a catchy dialogue. "Reservoir Dogs" had it, "Killing Zoe" no. <br /> <br /> Stoltz's strong interpretation of the dubious portrayal of Zed and Jean Hughes-Anglade of the obsessive ring leader does nothing to lift the proceedings. In summary, Avary tried unsuccessfully to create entertainment from scratch. <br /> <br /> Friday, September 15, 1995 - Astor Theater
