It was a sequel to Crash Dive, which was a very good movie in the low budget category. I thought this movie would be good too, but I was wrong. First, this film has nothing to do with Crash Dive, except that both are on submarines. Secondly, the plot can be slow, tedious and, in some cases, totally absurd. <br /> <br /> This movie will not catch the attention of most people. (I remember reading a book in slow, boring scenes.) Some scenes are supposed to be used for a dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh. The corkscrew scene is one of them. After overcoming my initial shock, that anyone who slips it without knowing that people do not believe it, but make fun of foolishness, it allowed me to find humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to see MD in a good movie, watch Crash Dive and leave that lame film on the shelf.
