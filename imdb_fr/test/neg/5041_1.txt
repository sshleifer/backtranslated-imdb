There is only one way to describe this film. <br /> <br /> so bad that it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> the acting is so bad that I laughed at myself. The main character of this movie that tries to use a gun is so ridiculous that one might think he was trying to copy a toy action character. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when you see it yourself, you can not help but agree. <Br /> <br /> The monster looks like a CGI trying to recreate the clay monsters you find in old Sinbad movies. <br /> <br /> in short, this film is only good for one reason a very big laugh at the bad movies can have. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a bad scenario and special effects that go wrong <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU
