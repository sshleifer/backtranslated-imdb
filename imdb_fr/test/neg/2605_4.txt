It could have been great. The voiceovers are perfectly correct and correspond to the characters of a T. A little problem though; the appearance of the characters, most of the support characters or guests are exactly the same. The same bored look on all faces only shows minor changes such as hairline or size. It seems strange to see the voice of a very large guest star come out of a lifeless form like the characters here. If I'm not mistaken, Kathy Griffin made a voice-over for this show and it seemed too strange to be funny. <br /> <br /> There are some other problems, one being the family plot. The Simpson did a lot better where they could actually buy most of the situations in which the characters found themselves. Here we get too much annoying distractions, as if someone had a strange fantasy, then we are supposed to find that funny, but for some reason, the delivery is a bit off. As you can probably see, it's hard for me to accurately define what's wrong with this series, because it's really just a Simpson clone or "Married with children". <br /> <br /> If I had to point out what is totally wrong with that, it's probably its repetitiveness. Peter Griffin is not really a brilliant character, but none of the others either. Lois should have been called Blade Laws because she's sort of one-dimensional. Seth Green as a kind of retarded son is the best in this series and is the most stereotyped part of the series. <br /> <br /> So, what can I say more? There is nothing wrong with this show, but in the long run, you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons have been doing for almost two decades.
