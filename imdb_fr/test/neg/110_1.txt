I just finished watching this movie and I'm disappointed to say that I did not appreciate it. It's so slow, slow and uninteresting. This Harry Potter kid plays a shy teenager with an impolite mother, then one day, this rude mother tells him to find a job to be able to accommodate an old man apparently having no place to live started living with his family and therefore the kid is going to work for an old lady. And this old lady who lives alone teaches girls, driving and life! I could not understand how much an 18 year old guy likes to spend time with a terrible woman in her 80s. Sorry if my comments on this movie bothered anyone who could have appreciated it, I could be wrong because I am not British and I may not understand the company, their family structure or their way of life. The film is primarily designed for the British public.
