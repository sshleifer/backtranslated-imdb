this movie was downright awful. most comic scenes seem obsolete and banal, and the funniest scene in the film may have been unveiled. the premise of the movie is so incredible and ridiculous that it's hard to really get into it. the actors themselves describe the most unrealistic characters. it's not just the fact that movies are so hard to swallow, but it's the way they continue to force you to bite your throat and expect you to accept it. the plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict. The boy is somehow rejected from all the schools he asked for (I suppose he completely forgot to attend a community college) and decided to start his own school for his rejected classmates. all is well for a moment until the validity of his school is questioned. Meanwhile, the ridiculous character manages to woo his handsome neighbor to fall for him with his spiritual sarcasm, which is apparently a skill he possesses. Then comes the final struggle with the students, who somehow bond with everyone and fight for the survival of the school. of course, the main character then persuades the state school board to allow his school to stay alive with an "inspiring" speech. This movie would have been more fun to watch if I was under 16 and I still did not know all the problems of college.
