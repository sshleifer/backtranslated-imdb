Despite an excellent soundtrack and the presence of the astonishing Rappaport and Woods, it is another of those stupid comedies where New York throws itself on the hero in order to show to which sumptuous author belongs this place. Yes, there are other things in the movie that are also fearful, but that's what's important. The trend for New York independent filmmakers seems to be "I do not need to be talented, I have NEW YORK!" Okay, to be fair, the movie has its moments. The flashback on why this guy's name is Wacky Jack was pretty fun. The scenario is neither a story nor a plot, it is a galaxy of bad scenes linked together by the same character. <br /> <br /> One of the worst things is that there is no motive behind what the characters do. Uncle Sam has the kid deliver the drugs, why? If it's so important, why did not Sam do it himself? Then, the main character puts his ass bare, scene after scene, without having absolutely no advantage to lie. The guy falls in love with a stewardess, none of them having reason to fall in love. Characters are a group of pawns that the author can move to see if he can get something weird. <br /> <br /> If you're easily entertained or like watching bad independent movies because they make you feel smarter than watching bad mainstream movies, watch this. If you want to see what a light GOOD crime movie looks like, look at Takeshi Kitano's "Brother". "Kicked In The Head" is the perfect example of why so many people hate offbeat independent movies: LOTS OF SUGAR. And a note to the director: Do not be afraid to excite, entertain, enlighten or entertain the audience from time to time. Being boring does not make you a better filmmaker than those who can interest me.
