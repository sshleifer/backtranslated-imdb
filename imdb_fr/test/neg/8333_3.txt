I went to see that because I had never seen Tel Aviv, where the story unfolds. I was disappointed because it does not offer many views on Israel's largest metropolis. It's also pretentious, one of those films that hints at its meaning until you give up with a shrug. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist is Batya, a woman in her twenties who works as a waitress at weddings with caterers. It is obvious that her parents make fun of her and when a little girl comes out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her, Batya feels obliged to take care of her. The little girl does not speak and Batya can not give her to social services because it's the weekend and the agency is closed. She brings her home with the roof flowing and when it comes time to work in the evening, she has to take the girl with her. The boss is very unhappy with this situation and other weaknesses of Batya's work. <br /> <br /> Another main character is Keren, who is getting married. At her wedding party (where Batya works of course), she breaks her leg out of a room box reserved for women whose door does not open. She and her new husband can not take the planned Caribbean vacation. They end up in a shabby hotel by the sea without a view. It smells bad, there is traffic noise and Keren complains all the time. Her husband meets a strangely seductive elderly woman ?? a writer ?? who also resides at the hotel, and Keren fears that he has slept with this stranger. <br /> <br /> The third main character is a Filipina woman, Joy, who cares for the elderly. The old woman she is in charge of is very crabby and does not speak English, only German and Hebrew. Joy speaks English but not Hebrew or German. Joy is mainly concerned about the situation of her son in the Philippines and wants to buy him a toy boat, as he requested. She finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it. The old woman's daughter, who hired Joy, is an actress appearing in a sort of post-modern adaptation of Hamlet's "physical theater", and does not get on well with her mother. <br /> <br /> The entry that these three stories that momentarily intersect resolves themselves is supposed to mean something profound. I did not understand. Batya's relationship with the little girl has a fantasy element, and Batya's non-existent relationship with her parents may be reversed in this relationship. When Joy sees the toy boat in the shop window, there is a strange effect: the small sails swell as if they were carried by the wind and they acted as if they were the size of a real ship. Keren traces the outline of a bottle around a boat that is on a brochure cover in the hotel room, and a narration of the strange woman's poetry mentions a boat in a bottle. But what does all this mean? I thought about it for a moment and realized that I was not going to lose sleep in the process. If anyone has a clear idea of ​​what it's about, maybe he can help me.
