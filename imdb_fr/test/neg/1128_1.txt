It must be the worst piece of shit I've ever seen. Randy Quaid is funny as a secondary actor in the original, but not as a star. Too Eddie. The original is a classic. Like the original, the supporting actor directed the show. Ed Asner was very funny. He is the Eddie of Christmas Vaction 2! How is it that Snots is always the same after all these years and that everyone in the original looks like 14 years more. After 15 minutes of watching this movie, I did not even think I had laughed yet. The island just did not work. If it were not the beautiful South Pacific female guide on the island, the movie would have been a total loss. I sat on this review for a week and yes, I still think the movie should never have been done. Let's hope there will be no THIRD! <br /> <br /> Shawn Gearin
