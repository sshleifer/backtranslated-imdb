THEIR MOMENT POURPRE <br /> <br /> Format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and white - Short film) <br /> <br /> Two unlucky nightclub revelers (Laurel and Hardy) are unable to pay their bill, causing a violent punishment from a server with a quick complexion (Tiny Sandford). <br /> <br /> A typical scenario of L & H, less substantial than some of their best work of this period, but nevertheless worth the detour. Stan takes center stage this time, caught in a financial dilemma after having withheld a portion of his salary to finance a night in the city, only to know - too late! - that his injured wife (Fay Holderness) has replaced his reserve with worthless coupons. Some of Laurel's extended shots as he slowly becomes aware of the ongoing disaster reveal his genius for characterization and mime. The morality of the 1920s is portrayed by Patsy O'Byrne, playing the role of an ax-occupied corps who takes great joy in alerting the respective wives of L & H (Holderness and Lyle Taho) to the misbehavior of their husband. The end sparkles, but the film still has a lot to recommend. Directed by James Parrott.
