This little film is remarkable only because it is the worst film ever made by Abbott and Costello. It's dreadful in every respect: shabby music, horrible choreography (discover the clumsy dancer), special effects and tacky decorations, wooden actors (the main actors are barely at the secondary level in their job and have never been heard later), and a script without a laugh. Better times were coming for the comedy duo. Abbott and Costello meet Captain Kidd, as well as the television series that has sometimes been inspired. But skip this one.
