A woman finds herself caught in a seemingly inexplicable wave of suicides. Again, is it really suicides? It looks like there is a ghost in freedom. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair that hides his face and he moves his head or arms twisted in such a way, forming a very strange specter. Recurring theme music plays from unexpected places to announce the arrival of the ghost. Weird sound effects, which sound like small broken branches, always accompany this unhappy spirit. Does this sound familiar to you? Well, if you have seen some Asian horror movies in the last 10 years, that should be fine. Borrowing heavily and shamelessly to "The Ring," "One Last Call," and some other recent horror hits, this film tries to lead an uninteresting and exhausted plot to a climax, but we have already seen it. Avoid it unless you are desperate or have not seen other Asian horror movies in the last 10 years.
