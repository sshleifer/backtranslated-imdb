Negative numbers are not available to indicate how bad this movie is! A wooden role play associated with a story that has been reformed dozens of times. Everyone in this movie should attend Overactors Anonymous. One might think that an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young men from a preparatory school are trying to tackle the bombing of Pearl Harbor. This raises some interesting questions, but the way in which they are transmitted actually makes more of a joke. Typical characters were present, including zealous jock and nerd (glasses included). I could not have been more indifferent to wooden dialogues and clich√© characters. At the end of the movie, I had to throw the DVD in the trash. Stay away from this failure! You will not get back the 90 minutes of your life!
