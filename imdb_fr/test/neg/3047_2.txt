It starts interestingly, because there is a carnival right next to someone's house with an oil rig right there too and some kind of church in front of a store across the street with a sign "Jesus saves" neon, straight in a small neighborhood ... Now it's pretty dazzling, so unlikely ... and then we go directly to the film that takes new improbable. Of course, it's a lame remake of the 1979 thriller starring Carol Kane in the role of babysitter Jill Johnson ... now Jill is a chick who used her cell phone a few minutes so high that her bad parents punish her by forcing her out, probably something that the target audience of this movie can identify. Jill is taken (of course) by her father to this huge, luxurious lakeside house to babysit for the Mandrakis family. The kids are already well in bed when Jill arrives and the maid is still there, huh, she could not keep the kids? Of course, despite the remote location of one of Jill's friends, someone with whom she apparently has problems, such as a "boyfriend robbery" or something like that. Anyway, of course, the alarm in the house rings for no reason, then someone's calls begin to arrive, those of someone who wants to kill her. Of course, Jill calls the cops and since there is no real threat to her life, they kidnap her, but tell her to remember if she can do anything else for her. Take a look at the scene with Jill calling her friends to the bonfire high school rally or whatever it is supposed to be, it looks like some sort of "Burning Man" festival, ?? !! ?? There are all sorts of artificial fears in this movie, including the cool Chester cat that of course appears here and there, one of the most tired "horror film" clich√©s ever. Will I admit that I fell asleep at some point and forgot something? Hard to say or to worry about, really. This is one of those movies that makes me wonder how much the remakes of "Amityville Horror", "House of Wax" or "The Fog" could have been. Anyway, reading the reviews online, it seems that the people who are most scared of this story are girls aged 12, and I can only assume that statements like 'made my pants pee'. Well, we can only hope that this will put an end to the Hollywood remakes of movies that were not really great at first, but do not bet on it. 2 out of 10 and I am too generous.
