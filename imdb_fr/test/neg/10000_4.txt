This is an example of why the majority of action movies are the same. Generic and boring, there is really nothing to watch here. A total waste of the barely exploited talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, who have proven time and time again that they are capable of acting and playing well. Do not bother with this one, check out New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz's Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and discover the real deal. Ice-T's horribly clich√©d dialogue makes this film that makes people cringe, and I still wonder what Bill Paxton was doing in this movie? And why on earth is he always playing exactly the same character? Since Aliens, all the movies I saw with Bill Paxton make him play exactly the same irritating character, and at least in Aliens, his character is dead, which has made him somewhat gratifying ... <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a second-class action basket. There are countless better films to watch, and if you really want to see this one, look at Judgment Night, which is practically a true copy, but with better acting and a better screenplay. The only thing worth looking at was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which is close to catching up with the horrible film itself - but not quite so. 4/10.
