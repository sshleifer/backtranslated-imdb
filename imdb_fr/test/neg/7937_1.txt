Is it just me, or is it an AWFUL movie? I'm going with a movie AWFUL ... <br /> <br /> Knowing it's a dude movie (usually defined as being full of car chases, accidents, shootings, explosions , etc.), I always expect some credibility. If I can not believe the principle, the film WILL NOT WORK. So, we come to the problem with "Assault on Precinct 13." <br /> <br /> Not one for spoilers, I never report details of the plot. However, I'm going to make an exception here, because the plot is so useless. A villain is imprisoned in City 13. The pals of this villain want him out. Surprise. The bad guys' buddies are actually corrupt police. A young heroic policeman, troubled but troubled, saves the day by exchanging with the girl. UGH. Yes, it's as simple as that, and that idiot. <br /> <br /> "Assault on Precinct 13" takes place in Detroit. This is not a bad scene for crime and corruption (I spent 3 months at the end of 2004, so I know what I'm talking about). Despite this, he is outrageously violent and insulting to the police and the citizens of Detroit. I spent a lot of time in downtown Detroit, but I can not imagine how the pursuit ended in the downtown forest. I must have missed this ... <br /> <br /> There is NO refund for watching a bad movie. Save your money. There were too many good movies in 2005 to spend even $ 3.00 on Blockbuster on this one. <br /> <br /> FINAL NOTE: 1 <br /> <br /> (Only because I have seen worse films.)
