I wanted to love this one - the situation was rich and the setting unusual and interesting. But the story is awash with romantic Gothic feminine and childish elements difficult to swallow. The director has unjust prejudices about "goy" characters - just letting them be grotesque cartoons - and inexplicably indulgent towards the behavior of the heroine who destroys the home. The potentially interesting power relationship between the inventor and the housekeeper is not really dealt with. <br /> <br /> Feminist directors will have more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to reject sympathy for heroin and start dealing honestly with problems. This film looks more closely like "The 7 gold coins", another serious failure, more than "The Piano" - a true story of passion.
