It's not a terrible film, just tasteless. The plot is deeply imperfect and improbable. He tries to be a number of genres and fails everyone. He fails as a comedy, thriller and horror film. He succeeds almost like science fiction. The direction is not inspired and Katie Holmes, the figure of the cute cherub she is, should model the clothes of adolescence and not play. Helen Mirren is the only thing that prevents this film from being a 1 in 10. Its performance is fabulously harmful and is worth (almost) worth to suffer for the rest. Its ability to transmute imperious to fake sympathetic to manipulate and control sneakily its prey shows a magisterial scope. Apart from the exquisite exorcist rendition of Marissa Coughlin, Mirren is the only reason to see this film. A solid 3.0.
