I am a fifth grade language teacher and after reading this book (which the students loved), we watched the movie. They burst out laughing! Unfortunately, it's not a comedy! The comedy was so awful that I felt like watching a group of neighborhood kids play a play. My students imitated the lines and laughed from end to end. I agree with them, sometimes it was bad enough. Still, I would show it to the students just for fun, and to compare the movie with the book. We then created a Venn diagram (teachers know what it is) to show what was the same in both cases and what the differences were, which gives educational value. I noticed that another adaptation is being shot for 2005, so we can only hope that the acting will be better!
