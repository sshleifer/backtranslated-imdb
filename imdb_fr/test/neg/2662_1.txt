Have you ever seen the movie "Marathon Man"? Part with the dentist? I would rather it happen to me than to go through "Random Hearts" again. It was not just without interest, or without a story ... It was horribly, painfully and terribly BORING. At one point, I momentarily lost consciousness. For the average layperson, I may have seemed to be sleeping, but other moviegoers knowingly understood that I was actually BLACKED OUT from the edge. I thought I was going to die. When the film finally came to an end (I think it lasted twelve hours, but I'm not sure), I hinted a "Thank you Jesus, it's over!", To which all other moviegoers have cheered . If I had to listen to the Harrison Ford drone a second longer in this monotonous groan, I would have been forced to look for something sharp in which to catch my eyes to distract me. That's 136 minutes of my life, I will never come back.
