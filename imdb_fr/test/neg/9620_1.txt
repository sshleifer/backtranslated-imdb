I saw this film during its premiere in Los Angeles. I think I laughed two or three times. The rest of the time, I was shocked to see how ridiculous / poorly drawn and poorly written it was. Kirby is actually the only saving grace of the movie. I was disappointed with Larry Bagby's performance, which I usually find entertaining. If you like to watch the homemade shorts of your friends that they shot with their mother's 8mm video camera, there is a small chance that you like this movie. What makes these films enjoyable is that it's your friends who play all the roles. You do not know these people, so you'll probably find him as boring and stupid as me. Dear Mr. Nelson, go back to film school, intern for a while as deputy administrator, or any other unimportant job, to let you see how things are going in a movie. Then, search as long as necessary for the director of photography who knows what. stop means he has the ND filter on hand. Then try again. Repeat as many times as necessary.
