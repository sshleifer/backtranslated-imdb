This film was frankly chosen as a pig in a bag from our local video store. He turned out to be quite a pig. The plot, as it stands, was disjointed, inconsistent and predictable. The actors were constantly embarrassed to pronounce the lines poorly written. The only fun moment in the entire movie was devoted to the dangers of smoking and the inadvertent deployment of an airbag. The rest of the film lacked punch to amuse one of my young daughters (under the age of ten), myself, my wife, my mother-in-law or even the cat or the dog. My advice, if you are tempted to borrow this turkey, is to save your money and your time. Look for something else ...
