I just watched this movie and it turns out to be pretty lame, as mentioned by other user reviews. What bothered me the most was the Southern accent that some of the characters had, it happened in Wisconsin, not in the South. As mentioned in other reviews, Ed Geine was not a big guy, so why does the guy who plays Jason and Leatherface represent him? <br /> <br /> I quickly went through the essential, because there are many slow parts. <br /> <br /> If all goes well, someone will do their homework on Ed Geine and the city and make a more accurate film
