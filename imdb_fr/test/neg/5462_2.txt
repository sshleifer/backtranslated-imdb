I agree with what many other commentators have concluded. Subject that could have provoked reflection and shed light on an inverted double standard, which failed miserably. <br /> <br /> As rape is a crime of violence and forced abuse, the scenes are mostly pathetic. . It would have been a better idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the act. And the victim's laughter with the cops, when he aborted his complaint to the police, seemed as authentic as the cops'. No embarrassment, no hesitation to simply participate. I do not know if it was a bad acting or a bad staging, but someone was quite missed. As for his supposed supposed search of his attackers, pathetic. They should have skipped most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in themselves, and having met him with Colin Friels during his first stint at the police. The story could then have been elaborated with a good dialogue and occasional flashbacks - and saved through the intermediary and the superior presence, Colin Friels - the only reason I watched this movie - brings to all the projects that he realises. The only concrete revelation of this film is that it was shit.
