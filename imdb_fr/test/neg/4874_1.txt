I just saw this on a local independent station in the New York area. The cast was promising but when I saw the director George Cosmotos, I became suspicious. And of course, it was just as serious, as useless and stupid as all of George Cosmotos's films I've seen. He is like a stupid man like Michael Bey - with all the atrocity that the hug promises. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy has no meaning, no burning question engages the conspirators. We are left to connect the points of a graffiti on different walls of the film to the next. Thus, the current fiscal crisis, the war in Iraq, Islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million Americans without health care, the stagnation of wages and the death of the middle class are all overwhelmed by the terror of graffiti. /> <br /> A really amazing movie.
