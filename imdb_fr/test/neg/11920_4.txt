!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The premise is this: a shop is set on fire and the assistant Sergio is asked by the father of the man who lit the fire to take the packaging that Sergio accepts. Until now, everything is fine, but the logic is quite heavy, Sergio agrees to do for the sum of 25 000 dollars, but why? Come on guys if you were a handsome white guy, would you run the risk of getting a long time in a tough jail (a very real possibility for a arson) for $ 25,000? I know I would not, and given that you had a criminal record, no employer would want to touch you with a barge perch, which is $ 25,000 for a lifetime of workfare and welfare checks? There is also something else that seems to have disappeared from his, since Mister Lumpke told Sergio that his son had made the fire, he seemed oblivious to the possibility that he knew too much. Do not you think that someone would want to keep you quiet if he tells you something? <br /> <br /> I guess we will not have the right to think about such details, because PYROMANIAC`S LOVE STORY is not supposed to be an intelligent thriller, it's a romantic comedy with a light charm / girl movie probably better appreciated as a girls night out. Looking through this page of comments, it is obvious that the film has its supporters, but as a cynical man, I was not too impressed and William Baldwin went a long way
