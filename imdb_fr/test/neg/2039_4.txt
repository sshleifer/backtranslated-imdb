A bit boring, a little rude, a little disturbing, it was not horrible, but not too good. There is a good deal of goose bumps when the statue comes alive, however, the props of this scene. There is not much going on and the movie is a bit ugly. I was happy when it ended, and I do not think at all this story is true .... very surprised, this average is about 6.
