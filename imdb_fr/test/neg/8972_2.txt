The star of the stage, Grace Hayes, is the star of this dark movie. After years on the stage, she will visit a small university town to see if her son is raised by her grandfather. The boy does not know who his mother is, and when he sees him in a local malting house, he is an impetuous fool. Part of the problem is that he is a university clown, the other part is that he is really spoiled. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, it turns out that mom is really very rich and not only finances the life of her son, but a heavy contributor to college. She has the idea of ​​forcing the young man to mature. She talks to the man who raises Peter and sees his allowance cut off completely - hoping he will live up to the situation. It also turns out that she puts the job in school because she thinks all these kids have to stop playing and be more responsible. <br /> <br /> Now, here's where it gets pretty silly. To show they know the value of hard work, she hires several to sing and dance to the malting she just bought. Talk about artificial !! What will happen next will look like a long string of little or no talent or a poor man's version of a musical comedy Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney! I would suggest that children try to do something else to make money ... or maybe sing and dance until people pay for them to stop! I know I would pay them. <br /> <br /> Since the talent is far from talented, Peter is a bad actor and his transition from responsible adult to responsible adult is almost instantaneous, it's a bit difficult to take on. . This is not a very good film, it is an obscure film that should have remained obscure! <br /> <br /> By the way, it's interesting to note that Mrs. Hayes' son in the movie, Peter, is actually his son. The only problem with this is that Peter Lind Hayes is a really awful actor. He is not good enough to be an important man and he is either dull and uninteresting, or downright obnoxious. In particular, all the stupid impressions he makes are really bad and he has the charisma of gelatin as you scrape spam. Despite this appalling performance, he had a reasonably successful acting career. Who would have thought it if you had seen it at ZIS BOOM BAH - because here it is about as well received as bubonic plague !!
