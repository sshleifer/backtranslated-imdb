A group of four young men attending a prestigious private school is part of an ancient alliance formed by their ancestors in the late 17th century witch hunts. They each have a power that ages them every time they use it and they suspect that a new child from the academy could belong to a family that would have perished for a long time. This new guy wants everyone's power for himself. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a horror movie because it tries to present itself as. Yes, there is magic and all that is supernatural, but it is only an action movie. A very mediocre action movie. Concentrate almost solely on freshness and fluidity and pay only minimal attention to the plot, which has plenty of unused space for interesting twists. But no one has, and even before the end of the film, you will know what is being read and by whom. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes here and there, including a car exploding magically after a collision with a big platform, but that's about it. The worst thing is that director Renny Harlin, who has some very entertaining, if not intelligent, films to his credit, relies heavily on explosive metal music and tracks too sexy to wear this film, which makes probably the most stupid "horror" movie since the disaster "Alone in the dark." This is not as serious as "Alone in the Dark" because the few smooth scenes are actually smooth and are not ridiculously incompetent, but in the end, the highest that this movie can hope for is a nice and comfortable home in the end of evening. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Classified PG-13: violent action
