KK should stick to singing - this whole movie was a big trouble. I can not understand the meanness of the boys and the romance between Miles and KK - the sex scenes were not inspired either. The end was awful - unresolved - there must be a reason for murder. And all the voyeurism of the boy was strange ... the mother has always struggled against the boy. Do not you think he would get a little more Freudian? And why did not anyone tell KK to speak with inflection instead of monotonous? <br /> <br /> I'm happy to have paid only 1 USD to rent this rent. <br /> <br />
