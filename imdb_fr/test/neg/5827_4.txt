I saw Winnie's Heffalump a few days ago. A beautiful story based on well-known characters created by A.A.Milne. Although Winnie, Piglet, Tigger and Rabbit are all present in this animated feature, the main character is Roo this time. He befriends the frightening Heffalump who turns out not to scare at all and shows everyone that friendship knows no boundaries and that everyone wants and deserves to be happy. I love this movie and would love it even more if I was 10 or 15 years younger. Alas, I would like to become a child again to enjoy this Heffalump story even more, but all I have left is a feeling of sadness at the loss of a kind of childhood and innocence that this film is filled ?? I was happy to hear Carly Simon sing, Joel McNeely provided a very good score.
