Live version of Dragonball via Taiwan. <br /> <br /> The evil Lord comes to earth to recover the seven magic dragon balls ... pearls that, once gathered, will make a dragon appear and fulfill your wish. This results in a lot of action and bad comedy. <br /> <br /> What can I say that "the best way to watch this movie is with a lot of drunk but witty friends" does not do it? I do not know. It's a really bad film, but funny, in the same way as very bad movies. Come on, this is one of the few martial arts movies I've ever seen where you actually see the boys. It's a cartoon in action and not so far from what I saw in the series that it scares me for the big-budget American version that I'm currently filming. <br /> <br /> If you have stuffed friends and you feel picking on a movie see this movie. If you are going to see him sober (like me), avoid him.
