Wow, I was really disappointed. I did not really intend to see this film in the cinema and I would like to remain faithful to this plan. It really should be a movie made for television. I was a bit excited to see him because I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this film did not do him justice. Infact, I am a little disappointed with the acting. What a horrible concealment of Fairuza Balk's tattoos, it bothered me every time I saw his shoulder. <br /> <br /> There was no flow in the film, it was very difficult to enter. A scene makes us angry, we get angry, we want blood, the anticipation increases, the director takes us to another scene to show the love between Annie and Bobby. It would have been nicer to follow if it had been divided into three Sunday paper comics. <br /> <br /> The characters chosen to play certain roles were also not very logical. The gangster leaders were skinny guys, not very credible. Matt Dillon at the head of a gangster organization? Come on, give me a break. There was no intimidation there. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack .. wow. I think it's one of the worst sheet music I've ever heard. What ugly guitar solos, my god. The sound of my squeaks was more pleasant for my friends, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'd like to make a positive comment about the movie. The settings were well done. I liked the colors, a good job conveying this period.
