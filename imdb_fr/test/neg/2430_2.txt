First, when does this scenario take place? This must happen after the first movie because Kuzco knows that Pacha and Chicha have their third child, but that can not happen after the second movie because Kronk does not have a girlfriend, a woman or something like that? You never see her in the show. <br /> <br /> Also, why is Kuzco going to school? The plot of the series is that Kuzco goes to school to become emperor. But was not he emperor before that? And who is an emperor when he learns to become emperor? Should not it be Yzma? Or has Yzma ever been fired in this timeline? And if that is true, why does not he expect it to become empresses? Moreover, you know in the first film, he said he had been trained from birth to become emperor by private tutors. So he should know what he's doing. <br /> <br /> Kronk. Why is Kronk a student? He is about 25 years old, they said it in the first film. It's an adult who goes to high school. Does everyone think he's a jerk? I really like Kronk, but I think because of his age and the fact that everyone knows he works for Yzma, he should have been a teacher. Being a domestic school teacher would be quite up to it. <br /> <br /> Malina, it's very unpleasant. It is supposed to be Kuzco's moral interest / compass. But a lot of time, she comes authoritarian and knows everything. She often says that she likes: "I should be proud because I am beautiful and intelligent". <br /> <br /> She has an ESP when it comes to Kuzco and knows when he has problems, when he cheats, or even when he sings the Hot Hot Hottie song in his head even though it comforts the newspaper of school and guard A + right in all its classes. <br /> <br /> She seems more interested in using her beauty to get Kuzco to do the right thing and succeed in school and then go out with him. In fact, she seems more maternal in Kuzco than a love interest. <br /> <br /> Yzma. As I bought before Yzma tries to defeat Kuzco to become an empress. I do not know how it's supposed to work with the layoff and everything. Yzma seems to relive the first film of each episode. In almost every show in which she appears, she turns Kuzco into an animal in the hope of seeing him miss a class. (Only 3 times I can think of that, but it did not happen.) The jokes about Yzma being old are not as smart in the series as they were in the film. And the classic jokes about Yzma are used to death in the series (like "Pull the level, Krunk!", The roller coaster and the lab). <br /> <br /> In addition, some other points that do not make sense in this series. The fact that every time Kuzco is assigned something is treated as such, he will succeed or not the class, but he seems to succeed every task entrusted to him. So, why does a mission count so much? <br /> <br /> Seriously, who's running the kingdom while it's going on? Do they have a consul or a steward? You will never see anyone rule the kingdom unless Kuzco loses his powers or Yzma is an empress. <br /> <br /> Why does Kuzco attend a normal peasant school? Should not he learn to lead a country, what to do in case of war or something that will be useful to him in the future? I could see normal classes like agriculture (so that he knew how to prepare the country for a famine or something like that), but by knotting? How does this help you? <br /> <br /> Now, I know someone will say, "But that does not make sense, it's supposed to be funny." Then, they should have more fun things in there. All the fun things on the show have already been done in the movie. Also, if they notice some of these huge intrigue holes, why do not they have fun like in the movie? (For example, when Yzma and Kronk go to the secret lab before Kuzco and Pacha and Yzma and Kronk can not explain how they got their first.) <br /> <br /> There are some good points, it's nice to see some of the characters from the first movie in the series like Bucky and Monkey with the bug. Pacha and his family are always very good characters with a good feeling of earth. I think this series would be fun for the youngest. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the series is not as good as the film on which it is based, but it could be useful for younger children.
