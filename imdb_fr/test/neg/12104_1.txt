... out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry to show it, presented at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy did not have subtitles, so I asked the festival team if there was a problem with the received impression. "Not so ..." I was told. "the director wants it that way". <br /> <br /> Again, I am sorry to say that my French is hardly an elective level of high school (more than 3 decades ago). Most of the initial dialogue is in French, so I'm sure I missed the nuance and many details between my understanding of a few key words. <br /> <br /> I scored "1", mainly because of the irony of a director who used to work on subtitle production, refusing to put subtitles in a movie intended for an American audience. Excuse me, even though most Americans do not know where Europe is on a map, even a film festival audience should not be supposed to know the "mother tongue" of a given movie. Even if some of us do not know Finnish, I would still expect subtitles for the few "dolts" who are not sophisticated enough to master the 37 different languages ​​presented. I will endure this ego of David Lynch, not Litvack.
