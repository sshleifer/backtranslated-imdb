It was stupid. A bit like a film by Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> There were some funny games but not very funny. <br /> <br /> But I liked some of the actors. <br /> <br /> There were some Saturdays. Night Live people in the movie. But I would not recommend it unless nothing is better. And it was always better than any Jennifer Lopez movie.
