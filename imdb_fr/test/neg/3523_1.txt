Striking the ground running, the film begins with three murders in a row. No plot, no characters, no motivation; the second murder takes place off the screen, and the severed head of this victim is actually used to effectively club the third victim to death! This is a strong point. But the Lewises are obviously smart enough to lead with force. Soon, they cover sloppy dialogue scenes with a detective voice-over and film a quick endless rehearsal in broad and ugly shots. The horror atmosphere of this Betacam production quickly gives way to an infomercial insurance atmosphere, with the monumental (and rather endearing) simplicity of the tracks that steer things further in that direction. A Shlub cop investigates, a slaughter of meat kills, repeats, early culminates with a memorable gag punch in the salad. Only, how did the fingers end up in the salad? And was not the goal of the Blood Cult to collect cut appendages? When the GORE stops making sense, you know you have problems. And without spoiling the great and absurd end of twist, believe me on word: the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep impulse of destruction of the cathode ray tube. The basic reaction is to try to leave it behind and continue your life.
