Anyone who knows anything about evolution would not even need to see the movie to say "wrong". "this has never been refuted" is also a weak argument. To say that the universe was created by a giant hippopotamus can not be refuted. Although, to be fair, it seems that the only people who truly believe are the same as those who open e-mail attachments from people they do not know or who give their banking details to a guy in Zambia. No primate bones were found in the United States or Canada. There is also a good reason why legitimate scientists do not bother to study this. The same argument applies to the monster, the ghosts and the god of Loch Ness.
