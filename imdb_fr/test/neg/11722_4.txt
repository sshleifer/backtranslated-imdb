I saw this movie for a reason: the slogan is "Upset your head? And you're dead!" Cracking. It's no surprise that this stupid horror comedy is running out of steam before the tape is ready for use, but it bursts out laughing at its weird beginnings and its cast of characters: a human radar with eagle eyes, a strong man and a big one - The sexual magnets on the chest are all controlled by the mind by a huge head sitting on a chair, which is not happy that his family is blackmailed by a murderous scumbag. It sounds like a promising mix of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are a joke and that the plot is pretty ordinary if you ignore the giant head.
