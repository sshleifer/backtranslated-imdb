Luchino Visconti was and remains one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but Adam Low (the director of this thing) lets the stronger voice become that of Helmut Berger! How can this be? What a missed opportunity! We are coming out of this ordeal knowing less about what makes the Master great and more about things that we should not care about at all. The beautiful pictures belong to the world of Visconti, the embarrassing interviews of Berger and Zeffirelli to the small world of Adam Low. A must to avoid!
