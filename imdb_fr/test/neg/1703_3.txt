I have always thought that MacBeth is the most accessible of Shakespeare's "Great Period" plays. Compact, concentrated, with lots of violence, it should have been the most open game for screen adaptations. However, I am not aware of a very good record of the story - the best effort being the very tight version of Orson Welles. To the list of MacBotches, we must add the Connery / Baxendale effort. <br /> <br /> (It seems like it was not a "film adaptation" at all, but a television version that was aired in the theater after Luhrman's Romeo + Juliet and the hamlet of Branagh: that might explain some of his faults, but do not excuse them.) <br /> <br /> It starts well, with a tense battle sequence with pleasantly scary witches. Poor old Gray Malkin and Paddock are taken from the opening scene, but they do not stay alone for long. Sargent and his account of the battle, the betrayal of Cawdor's Thane, the unfortunate master of the Tiger, and even MacBeth's meeting with Duncan when he is assigned the role of Cawdor quickly join him. All these had virtues which pleaded like angels deceived against the dark condemnation of their expulsion, but they are expelled. These are not the only cuts, either. MacBeth is in a hurry. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the battle, we are directly into the meeting of MacBeth witches, which is well done. Curiously, Brian Blessed directed the witch sequences, and he has a lot of fun with the special effects since MacBeth and Banquo are informed of their fate. Jason Connery as MacBeth is clumsy, obviously not knowing what to do with the verse. Graham MacTavish as Banquo, meanwhile, is capable, making his lines natural and easy. A few minutes after Connery's murmur, the viewer is struck by the urge to see the roles reversed and MacTavish in the lead role. No wonder MacBeth felt the need to kill him. <br /> <br /> These first few minutes mark the culmination of the film. From there we move on to Helen Baxendale where we receive news of her husband. She is as lost as Connery and has denied the beard behind which he is hiding. His invocation of evil by "Unsex me here" is embarrassing, not disturbing. There are some pretty smart keys - "We'll talk further" of MacBeth is not a sign of his hesitation about his wife's perverse ambition, but his attempt to silence her by throwing her on the bed . <br /> The game of leads is the most disappointing. Connery's method is to watch the screen with wonder as he mumbles his monologues through a voice-over. Baxendale looks pinched and neurotic. An attempt to do something interesting with "Is it a dagger" - the fantastic dagger is a shadow worn by a cross on an altar - falls flat due to Connery's poor workmanship and unkempt direction that waste production all along. We escort Lady MacBeth into the murder room, where she stabs Duncan, but the effect is comical and not dramatic. <br /> <br /> The big scenes are sloppy - the appearance of Banquo at the party is made incomprehensible by attempts to mix the subjective rendering of the illusion of MacBeth with what his entourage sees or does not see. The second meeting with the witches is even less coherent and the prophetic visions are confusing. The timing seems to be a problem here - Banquo's banquet is the focal point of the play, but the film moves quickly towards its conclusion, giving it an unbalanced impression and leaving no room for the complexity of the puzzles that MacBeth is trapped to be appreciated, or for his descent into madness to be convincing. Another crucial cut is the scene where Malcolm tests MacDuff and MacDuff learns of the murder of his family. This deprives her revenge of most of her emotional strength - and the character of a lot of time spent in front of a screen. He is a virtual unknown when he shows up to kill MacBeth. <br /> <br /> This is a point to try. The MacTavish Banquo wins another. The first minutes attract another. But that's all. From there, it's the sound and the fury blah blah blah.
