If I had never seen an episode of the original Avengers, with Blackman, Rigg or Thorson, I would have enjoyed this series more. Although the actors do their best to maintain the action and interest of the scripts, I was caught off guard by comparing the episodes to the original series. Steed expected more participation in the fight scenes, and continuity seemed to indicate that writers had trouble keeping pace with the actors. To be honest, I can not blame them for trying to resurrect the fans of the original series, but it did not work, as evidenced by the fact that it lasted a season. Watching Steed's work through this series reminded me of General Macarthur when he said, "Old soldiers never die, they disappear!"
