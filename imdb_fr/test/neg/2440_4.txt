Justine does not find the ideal partner to make her first time the ideal partner. In the company of a geek friend, she enters a virtual machine to improve her appearance. When she sees the opportunity to create her perfect man, an explosion occurs and the results are left to your imagination. The problem is how many obvious sexual jokes are left? How can this kind of film be predictable? Some funny moments here and there, but nothing so outrageous or different jokes other movies or even a normal life. If you like WEIRD SCIENCE or jokes about "fish out of the water" associated with a "gender identity crisis", then you can definitely enjoy those 90 minutes.
