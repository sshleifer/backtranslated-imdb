Poor Jane Austen should be happy not to be here to witness the terrible catastrophe of an adaptation. So many great Jane Austen movies have come out recently that this one deserves to be definitely buried with two other movies I despise - The Man in Gray Flannel Costume and the 1969 version of David Copperfield. My main beef with the film is that it completely misses the purpose of the book. Jane Austen made fun of the gothic madness of her society, and much of her novel plays with language. The film, however, is serious and sounds terribly melodramatic. The light and amusing flavor of Austen's writing is completely absent from this heavy incursion into the period drama. The scenes of Catherine's imagination are gratuitous and uninteresting. In addition, Henry Tilney is terribly unattractive. Why, I ask, would anyone fall for him? If you're looking for a fun evening for Jane Austen, look Emma!
