Snakes in a Train (2006, Dir.The Mallachi Brothers) A woman receives a zombie curse, which causes her to have live snakes inside her. Brujo, who takes care of her, tries to take her to Los Angeles on the train. After several clashes on the train, the Brujo snake collection manages to separate from their owner and goes hunting. While all this is happening, normal passengers are resting every day. What is unknown to them is that something mortal is coming to them, and they have not come out. <br /> <br /> After watching the wonderful fun 'Snakes on a plane', I had to check that. I knew it was going to be a scam and the movie would look cheap, but what I found was worse to watch. The plot of the curse was ridiculous and should never have been included. The special effects are not terrible but are not the most beautiful. I did not have the slightest idea of ​​the end. It was silly to watch and pathetic. The acting was absolutely terrible and looked bad. They simply could not act to save their lives. If you want to laugh, watch this, otherwise you should really avoid that. <br /> <br /> "We have a train on the run, I repeat, we have a train on the run." - Conductor (Stephen A.F. Day)
