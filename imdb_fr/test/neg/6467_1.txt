The only fun thing I found while watching this movie was to hear Star Wars go through the movie wall (yes, I'm going to a very bad movie). This film is so insane that I would prefer that my eyes be scratched by a cat rather than look at it again. <br /> <br /> Compare it to the original. One is charming, funny, exciting, well played and one of the best movies ever made, the other is so far from funny that all you can do is hope your eyes come off and you avoid looking further. . I'm sorry. Christina Ricci is an excellent actress but can not compare to Hailley Mills and does not even launch me on Doug E. Doug in a first part occupied by the incredible and absolutely charming Dean Jones. The tiny part of Dean Jones in the new version is the only part of this film that partially redeems, and that's the only reason I can justify a score of 1 * (also because the imdb does not go in negative ).
