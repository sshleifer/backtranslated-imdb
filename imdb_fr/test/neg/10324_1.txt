I went into Blockbuster to watch some good old action movies. So I went through the action section until this film caught my attention, because the cover had a big letter in bold SANDRA BULLOCK. An action movie with Sandra Bullock and rated R !? YAY! Although I admit that I prefer it in a comedy, but if it sounds like "Speed", I'm sold. Unfortunately, Sandra is really not in this film, her role is minor: "Her girlfriend kidnapped" (She is fifth in the list of actors for Jeebus shakes!) Apparently, it was her first role (and after watching This movie, I thought as much as Sandra is the only human living in this movie, everyone could be a Zombie in a B-Horror movie, and this movie disappointed me by saying that Sandra was the star. I fell in love with Biff from "Back to the Future" when Marty shouted "THAT'S WHAT THIS ... !!!" "My God, I would have liked to look at that instead." <br /> <br /> Sandra is the only bright side of this movie, and every time she walks past the camera, it's like she's taking shock paddles and screaming "CLEAR!" for this film to go forward. but the lines are flat, no matter how hard you put in. More about Sandra later ... <br /> <br /> The movie is dull Very dull Think about the most boring moment uyeux of your life, then imagine live this moment for 110 minutes (for me, it's this movie). This film makes even the boring gunfights and bale time effects annoying, so annoying that elephant tranquilizers are confused. And the idea behind Bullet Time in this film is a close-up of a slow-motion AK that makes fun of you as the plugs that come out of it represent every second of your life as it slowly recedes. And I knew I was watching a bad movie because I found myself moving fast "THROUGH-THE-ACTION!" The parcel? . . . there was a plot? The music? . . . Even by age 80, the manure standards are bad but at least that's the only thing that kept me awake. Acting? Sandra Bullock was good and. . . ummm. . . to move on. Is it good since it is noted R? No, unless R stands for Ridicules-snooze-fest. <br /> <br /> And it's really a 1980s clich√© when a movie opens with an aerial view of the city (licking a guitar or a powerful ballet) and ends with a gun fight in a Dark factory with steel walkways and matching pipes. This film satisfies both. At least, this film establishes from what time it was useless since Sandra's hair was screaming "1980s !!!!" And a movie really has a fist when you watch a murderer stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and put his body in a box, which you sadly respond to: "This is probably the greatest action that the poor sap has never been. Another moment Hammy is at the beginning, when some-Agent-Secret-Dude hide a crowd of people and apparently this film thinks that people jump in the air and fall to the ground when they die. All that was missing was this scene: Mario Ditty or maybe Contra sound effects, but Nintendo might have sued. <br /> <br /> And it is sad to note that the main hero of this film tears out other icons of the BETTER movie. Before the big-caliber scene, Da Hero was in a boxing ring ("Rocky", anyone?), Sporting a leather fedora (not so "Indiana Jones") with disturbing spotlights behind him (Terminator II before you own the T-1000) What is really REALLY sad is that people on Youtube or Dailymotion can shoot better quality videos (with a poor quality webcam) than this movie. I'm serious, most Rant videos recorded with poor audio quality and blurry images are more entertaining than this movie. I can not even call this movie by name because its name reminds me of horrible memories of witnessing this cruel and unusual punishment (a terrifying violation of human rights!) The only bright spot in this abysmal abyss is Sandra's career that began to take off with this film. But oh Sandra. . . why did you have to be in such a nightmare? The salary was better worth it. The DVD also presents you a little story about Sandra, an extra, considering how she is the only one of this movie to become a house name. Which explains why this film uses its name as bait for unsuspecting moviegoers, Crafty little critter. <br /> <br /> I do not have much experience with bad movies, but I do not know when I see it. I could come back from "Mazes and Monsters" with a good old campy Bruce Willis Comedy. But even Bruce could not cheer me up after this movie. I have not seen any Ed Wood or Uwe Boll yet, but I think I am now excited for them. Because I can not even imagine a worse movie then. . . "GAG". . . "Hanged". . .
