Fortunately, I did not see this film in a film, big screen, just on a small screen video. I doubt I could have watched the movie in a movie theater and watched all the violence in the movie. After watching the first 30 minutes, I am both disappointed and curious. <br /> <br /> Disappointed by the difficult story to follow, the screens hard to understand, the huge aggression - I still do not know why I was shown the Daesu (main character) tearing teeth of another person, his stupidity on women, cut off his tongue. And also curious to see what the film will say as a conclusion, what is the final summary of all this brutality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although the film is not boring, I did not get an answer. all the cruelty I had to watch from start to finish. In my opinion, if you want blood and you want to laugh, there is Kill Bill 1-2, if you want blood with more meaning, you can choose any recent war movie, and if you want an oriental film, there are much better titles. over there. Subsequently, I will take the notes of the Cannes festival with more care, because if Oldboy received many praise from the jury, he had little to say to me and was only 4/10 on my scale. <br /> <I am hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with real feelings and a clear message.
