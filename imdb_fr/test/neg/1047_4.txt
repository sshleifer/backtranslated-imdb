I watched this episode with a lot of hope after seeing it on the list of "favorite episodes" of so many people. I do not brag under any circumstances, but from the beginning, I realized that they were in a kind of toy box / can, with the big eye that looks at them, the type of characters that are there. Even though throughout the episode, the questions of "Who are we?", "Where are we?", "What is outside?" To bring the suspense of the episode (which I had unfortunately already understood), I must say that different types of characters and their interactions have made the episode quite interesting. Although the turn of the story was more difficult to guess if ALL were soldiers (toys).
