The populist approach of Altioklar is manifested in all its titles, from the worst to the best. He does not care (or have any idea) about art, all that matters to him is to make people believe that they have a kick in the belly while watching his movies. The problem is that the effort is far too obvious, and that the events unfold with all the crazy exaggerations that mingle, the effort fails. <br /> <br /> On this "Turkish" film (who knows where the original is, the originals were made because it seemed to me to be extremely Hollywood), Altioklar tries to be a kind of Tarantino. (Mr. Tarantino, if you're reading this, watch the movie for the best comedy of your life!) He does not use subtle gestures to do it, all he does is use extreme things, and that becomes incredibly absurd. and laughable. <br /> <br /> Levent Üzümcü as a medical examiner with hair licked by the cow is just hilarious. I hope to meet him in person and ask him what he thinks of this film. Because I really found the role insulting to him. Demet Evgar groping her genitals was also unjustified, and did nothing but give the impression that everything was wrong. Another particularly silly aspect of this movie was the setting of the defective rhythm at 100%. When things have to be done slowly, the scenes take place suddenly. And at other times, you are sleepy at the thought of watching the ridicule unfold. <br /> <br /> If Altioklar is so deeply in love with the lame Hollywood superficiality, he should use Michael Sixarrows instead. Even such a gesture would not be as ridiculous as what he did in this movie. He should first learn not to imitate directors who never approach levels, then realize that he is not in Hollywood, and then to take private lessons from Zeki Demirkubuz or Reha Erdem on how to present the flow of ideas in the plot. This useless movie could not be saved, even by those, but perhaps it will be able to make visible movies in the future by taking these steps. <br /> <br /> By the way, I've already seen some infamous chess like Propaganda and Otostop, and I still can not help but say that this one was the worst Turkish film ever.
