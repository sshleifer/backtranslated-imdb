anyone who thought they had an Iron Eagle suit should be shot. In this case, once was enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Even if it's unrealistic, it's always fun. Iron Eagle II has a crazy plot and can be used to cure insomnia. I did not even bother to watch Iron Eagle III, but looking at the R note, I guess it's more violent than the last 2 movies. Iron Eagle IV is probably the most senseless sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as always delicious "Chappy" Sinclair. Another Jason returns to the position of Doug Masters (the Canadian Jason Cadieux, who looks like Jason Gedrick of the first Iron Eagle). But wait (here's a potential spoiler) ..... was not Doug killed in Iron Eagle II? The writers had to be desperate for a story so they revived Doug Masters saying he was a prisoner of the Russians. This film was the cheapest of all Iron Eagle movies. Why do filmmakers find it necessary to follow up on unattractive films? (eg movies of the Police Academy). I have always loved the work of Gossett Jr. in these films. He was the only one to hold this turkey together. Hope this is the last of Iron Eagle's suites. let him rest in peace.
