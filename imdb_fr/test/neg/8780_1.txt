I remember very well the bad press that this film had because of the production court order against Clayton Moore using the name of "Lone Ranger" or wearing his black mask during his personal appearances. Regardless of any consideration of the quality of the film, it was the height of the arrogance and short-term stupidity of the producers and their lawyers. And I suspect the lesson was well learned after the thunder of this film, which was widely perceived as a kind of karma for the shocks responsible for the judicial order against Moore. the custom, when relaunching a movie or a legendary television project, to invite the original star or stars to participate, and rightly so. Show respect, fools! And even if they refuse the prospect that has occurred, at least the offer has been made. This proves that film producers, studio directors and entertainment lawyers are not too stupid and arrogant to learn by example.
