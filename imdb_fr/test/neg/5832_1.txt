I come from Bangladesh and, here, CSC Costigan is a goddess of awesome sex. Joking aside, a friend and I were awake in the middle of the night, watching movies on Encore: Action, when we came across a series of sci-fi movies. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad, ... not bad at all) ... then Judge Dredd (Stalone almost ruins his career), then a movie called Lethal Target. One would think that the title "Fatal Target" could only be attributed to a really cool and really tacky knock-off Rambo. But no, what is delivered is what I would call a "semi-softcore, semi-pseudo-action, semi-science-fiction film" ... in fact, I think I can say that it's not even a movie in everything. If my main character had not been warm to my heart, my friend and I could have turned off the movie at the end of the credits. <br /> <br /> I have some questions to ask people (I would not dare to even say "professionals") who made this movie. -A, in the future, why are they using the weapons we used in 1999? Oh, wait, I understand, that's all they need, ... yes ??? ... so ... why does the protagonist wear what looks like a plain linen shirt and a vest, much like what people wore in the late '90s? .... oh ... I understand ... in space, it MUST have been a fashion statement ... well, so ... WHY, OH, WHY does the main character get a floppy disk 3.5 at a point in the movie so she can download some bullshit ?! wtf !? ... we have progressed so far, but we still have not exceeded 1.44 MB of space ...? <br /> <br /> I guess I ask too much. <Second question, let's just say ... yes ... it's a softcore porn. So why is there only ONE sex scene and why does it last 2 minutes? <br /> <br /> I mean, you take the REASON that people stay up in the middle of the night to see that shit (dare I say more 'movie'?) ... and reduce it to 2 minutes . Damn, they should just have taken that sex scene and sold it to another porn movie, and they would ALWAYS make more money with that "shit" than they did. <br /> <br /> CCCortigan is hot. And without wanting to offend the actress, she acts about as well as me. and I'm mentally retarded, and I only have one testicle ... (CC Cortigan, ... send me an email ... we'll have lunch) I'll write more, but I do not have enough square.
