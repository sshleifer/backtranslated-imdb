It's a very bad fiction movie. In fact, the quality is much better than that of many movies. There was a coherent scenario, a decent direction, cinematogrpahy, and I saw worse playing. The zombies were superb, they were clearly zombies of Romero, and it was really an interesting zombie story. Obviously not Oscar material, and if you do not like zombie movies, or B-movies, you probably will not like that, but if you are, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> That's pretty good, although they never clearly explain how he can heal themselves from shots and zombie bites. But if he has more than one line of dialogue that clearly reveals his bad behavior. <br /> <br /> It was a good end, at least I thought so. Romero should be flattered if he sees him one day.
