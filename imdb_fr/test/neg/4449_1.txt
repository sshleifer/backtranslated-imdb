Just to save you time and money, I'll tell you that this movie is definitely not worth the game and the essence it would take to burn it. Do not waste your time. In fact, you'd better forget that you've ever thought of looking at it. I have seriously seen better B movies in a language I do not understand. Whoever has already given permission must be sewn. The only positive thing I can say for this film is that with a new script and the good director and actors, it's a beautiful story. Let me break down; A virgin becomes pregnant with a demon, the baby while he is in his belly wants to feed. They are trying to make up for the fact that this is perhaps the worst film ever made with cursed and useless nudity. Overall, it's not worth the dollar it took to rent it.
