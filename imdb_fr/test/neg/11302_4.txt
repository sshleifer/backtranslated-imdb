An old film typical of N & B. The dialogues are sometimes good, but too often - especially in the second period - they become naive, sometimes terribly naive, sometimes close to the point where they are involuntarily comical. The first third, with its basic information on Gatsby Ladd illustrated by a series of interesting flashbacks, is the best part of the film. But once Gatsby moves into his new villa and does the same with Betty Field, the film becomes too melodramatic. The end is yet another end of cop-out; I do not know if the novel itself contains this silly end and cliché or if the producer of the film has made changes, but I always considered car accidents as a mediocre way to add a drama to the conclusion of a story. I've seen this parcel device a million times (or if it's not a car, it's a horse fall); the writer does not know how to finish the story, but he knows he wants it to be dramatic, he adds in a car accident. Lame. And to make matters worse, the accident is scandalously fortuitous and absurd, both in terms of intrigue and time; the plot because the mistress of Field's husband (Winters) is being killed by Field, and the fact that Winters sort of out of the gas station into the street, as if she had never noticed over the years she had lived there The road was dangerous on the other side of her house - and, of course, just as she was leaving, she saw Ladd's car and took her for her husband's car, then shouted " Here I am! Run me and make a tragic end in this way! "; In terms of time, Ladd and Field are involved in an accident the very day they are preparing to inform their husbands of their relationship. Basically, there is too much forced and artificial irony in this accident. It does not really help this movie to see Winters' husband, Da Silva, embark on a revenge mission to kill the guy who crushed his wife; He does it essentially by moving like a zombie, passing a car looking for scratches and acting really badly. The acting of Da Silva and the behavior of his character throughout the film are terrible and confusing, respectively. <br /> <br /> Scott Fitzgerald has been upset several times by the adaptation of his novels on screen by Hollywood writers. he had died well before the end of the film - he might have been right to complain, judging by the naïve storyline of this film. Or maybe his novels are even more stupid and naïve than this movie and they have been improved by the screen adaptations. Or, movies look a lot like novels. I could, of course, read this novel in particular to find out, but that does not bother me. Fitzgerald's name does not really inspire me to read one of his books (and I do not want to say how his name sounds). He certainly was not Heller, Clavell, or Twain. More like Hemingway? a lot of noise for nothing.
