Well people, this is another stereotypical portrait of gay life, however, the added disadvantage is to play poorly with, a horrible scenario, no budget, a terrible sound and not to forget the impossible scenario. <br /> <br /> It's Christmas in New York City and our story is immediately focused on two male individuals, apparently in love for some time. One of them did not let his parents (of right, zealous religious types) know he is gay (which adds to the implacability of the story because this guy is as effeminate as gay guys come these days) and that his parents are coming to visit him. They will stay in his New York apartment where he and his lover have just decorated for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The story continues to grow around the arrival of parents, who no one will appreciate anyway and how and predictable ways - they come to learn that their son is gay. Tears flow, as it was my interest for this film. <br /> <br /> The cast of characters, looked like an introductory course at the local theater. The lovers of this film are badly matched and their union does not seem to have cohesion. <br /> <br /> The owner is down and his attempt at humanism in the situation is undercooked and certainly did not help move the Plot further. <br /> <br /> The dragqueen friend who comes to the rescue of one of the lovers in his "difficult time" is stereotyped and gives a bad reputation to the unique art of dragging. <br /> <br /> Although some dudes at night find that one of the lovers has a beautiful body (again, stereotypical images) it does not help this story. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, especially if you are considering a purchase. You will shoot yourself if you do it!
