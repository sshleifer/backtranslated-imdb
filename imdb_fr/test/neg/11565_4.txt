Okay, there is no way to put it like a glove. The plot was ridiculous, the premise was ridiculous, the acting was unreasonable, the effects were laughable and all the outdoor scenes seem to have been filmed in Central Park, New York. That said, there was something about this movie that I could not leave. Maybe it was the atmosphere, or maybe it was the evil super-vixen or the girls of Amazonia. Anyway, I'm not one to sit on the sidelines and criticize without emphasizing some redeeming qualities, here they are. <br /> <br /> A violent group from the Liberal Women's Movement is described in a wild setting (Central Park, of course), and all the young masochistic men will be very impressed. In addition, some scenes in which some characters lose consciousness are amusingly dramatic (you will notice that I write dramatically rather than convincingly). <br /> <br /> All I can say is that some people love B movies and I'm one of them. If you are one of them too, try it. Sincerely, Mr. Kincaid. This is one for the ages.
