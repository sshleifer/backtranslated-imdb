All the people I talked to said that this movie would be good and really strange, so I thought I would praise it. In the middle of the film, I wondered what was happening and what is the purpose of this film. This movie from beginning to end is so bad that even the sick parts of the movie did not even bother me. I mean what will they do with the next volcano 2 The return of the lava. I mean, coming on this movie is so stupid that the characters are so undeveloped, and that Robert Englund makes the movie worse, I mean he could turn into Freddy Kruegur and Spook as well. In fact, I was looking for the bad guy to win, it was so bad. I mean the father is a policeman, he did not really seem to care that his daughter was going through one of the most important moments of his life. I mean, if my daughter were treated like that, I would do everything in my power to keep the guy behind the jail. Moreover, it seems obvious that the character of Dee Snyders would turn bad again. It's one of the worst movies of all time with Volcano and 8mm. Do not waste your time, you will not enjoy it ....! <br /> <br /> Note If there was no rating on this site, I would choose that, it's so bad that this movie is!
