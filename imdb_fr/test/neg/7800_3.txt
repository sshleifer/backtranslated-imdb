Almost certainly staged a montage of women reading lines (very briefly) and putting themselves naked (not very briefly) before an anonymous group (and uncredited) - certainly including producer Charles Band. Many Surrender Cinema movies (mostly lesbian scenes) are screened in a random fashion. Most women like to "ride horses" (Hmmm); there is a Polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting despite an audition; a secret; A camera that films actresses undressing behind a screen ... <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Lovell (too much makeup but still beautiful) presents some scenes from film and speaks in a "sexy" way to the camera (if you like lesbian scenes, the one with Lovell and Vanesa Taylor from Femalian is included and it's probably the best "lesbian couple" looking for all time). Bizarre excuse for a film and apart from the obvious draw of nude women, a frankly dull and uninteresting experience.
