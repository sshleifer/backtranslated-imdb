It's hard to believe anyone can take a quality book and make such a dreadful movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine that King Kong is turned into an organ-mashing monkey and that Fay Wray's role is played by a young boy. How about Elton John Rambo !!!! This film is even worse than the televised remake of The Night of the Hunter. <br /> <br /> Using the title Watchers and the name of Dean Koontz, the authors of this film should be prosecuted for fraud by book readers who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book. <br /> <br /> Read the book, I never talked to people who did not like it. Another good book is David Baldachi's The Winner.
