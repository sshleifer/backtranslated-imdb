When watching a Seagal movie, you expect a good action. You expect fights and not just a lot of shots like this movie. And: you wait for a rather simple story. OK, I can live with a more complex story even if it's a Seagal movie. But this one is, I do not know what to say. It's really very confusing. At the end of the film, I had big problems to understand what had happened. And I know I'm not the only one. The story lacks so much information and is so full of intrigue that it's almost impossible to keep track of what's going on in the movie. There are a lot of people in the movie, people change sides all the time and it changes places too often. Terrible. I just do not understand why it looks like Seagal is sort of following this one.
