I watched "Deadly Voyage" because David Suchet was there, having enjoyed it in the "Poirot" series. And Joss Ackland is always worth watching, so I went into the movie with the hope that it would be potentially interesting. Alas, it did not have to be. <br /> <br /> I will not allow myself to criticize the performance, the stimulation, the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others here have already given their opinion on these elements. The only thing I want to talk about is the message of the film, since it proclaims in the intro that it is based on a true story and that depends on it the supposed importance of the film. <br /> <br /> "Deadly Voyage" focuses primarily on a Kingsley, an impoverished black African who wants to settle in the United States because he believes he can make money there. Nothing more, nothing less - his motivation is totally selfish. (Of course, some people will prevaricate saying that he did it for his family, but in fact, he decided to have children with the income he could earn in Ghana, so he really created his own problem. ) To this end, Kingsley decides to put on board a Russian cargo ship bound for New York. In doing so, he faces difficult conditions, racist crewmembers and other challenges. <br /> <br /> But that's exactly where the film leaves me unsympathetic. Why should we expect the public to care about Kingsley? Just because he has a purpose? The objectives are not so rare that it would be advisable to focus on his goal, that of the captain of the ship or the woman he left at home with his newborn. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the US government. It is also illegal in the fact that he flies to the Russian shipping company. If he goes to the United States, that would mean getting out of a system he did not get into. And if caught, the shipping company will be fined $ 45,000. I very much doubt that illegal immigrants care about what their plan of action costs someone else; they are clearly just for their own benefit. He could have spent the $ 1,000 he had won in the lottery at the beginning of the film for a legal passage in the United States, and a residence application and a work permit. Instead, he chooses the illegal (and dangerous) way. <br /> <br /> Kingsley's trip is therefore illegal, selfish and can not be ethically justified. Why should we care about him and his ordeal? Just because he faces challenges? Why should its challenges be favored over the challenge of the Russian shipping company traveling to New York without stowaways? Because it's black and the shipping company is white? This seems to be due to the fact that Danny Glover (the executive producer of the movie) and the other people involved want us to root for Kingsley, as if he were a hero on some sort of noble journey. But once you accept that illegal immigration, theft and the mission of a fool are no longer noble, you can not worry about it anymore. <br /> <br /> Before anyone else plays the race card, I assure you that I feel the same, regardless of the ethnicity or nationality of the people involved. Imagine if a Briton decided to sneak on a train to Bhutan, cross the border softly and collect "unwanted" Buddhist antiques, to bring them back to Britain. What sympathy could the challenges he faced be able to generate? Very few, I bet. So why should we feel different for Kingley? Because he's black? Because he is poor by US standards? Filmmakers rely on the sharing of their view that the end justifies the means and that a shipping company fined $ 45,000 is irrelevant compared to the low possibility that an unskilled worker will earn a living. little more money in the United States than he could have if he had stayed in his home country. I did not buy it for a minute.
