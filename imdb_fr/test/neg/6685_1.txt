What a cynical villainous movie. Apparently, this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at what 20-year-olds are crawling through the gutter of Sydney's nightlife is supposed to be in some way in touch with its target market. Made by an industry, his friends and friends who apparently thought they could concoct any suspicious behavior with a young cast and pour it into multiplexes, SAMPLE PEOPLE miserably failed miserably at the Australian box office. He is so offensive in his clich√©d representations of obvious and easy targets that he was totally rejected by the very public for whom he was destined. Poor quality and cruelty, without trying to offer quality or resonance to the young audience who would have been attracted by the marketing or the casting of SAMPLE PEOPLE could have been interesting, even informative, provided not to be botched by his exploitative vision of what that teens want to see in a movie '. The character portrayed by Ben Mendelsohn is particularly offensive and Kylie Minogue is again spoiled by mediocre and talentless directors. It's as if producers think teens would look at ugly garbage, chained scenes and characters, and shallow, soulless characters. Well, they were very wrong. A low-budget film shot in 1983 called GOING DOWN has solved this problem well and is an excellent antidote to this poison.
