Although well produced for the TV movie, Dying to Love You breathes a low-grade melodramatic splendor. <br /> <br /> The film opens to Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson, who seems much older than his memory), who is a troubled businessman who leads an empty and lonely life after his wife Ruthie (who looks suspiciously like Roseanne Arnold) leaves him quickly. Now all Roger has is his cats ... and his ad in the paper. <br /> <br /> Once his ad is answered, he calls Johnnie-Elaine-Lisa-Oh, whatever, I'm the one you want me to be Lawrence. Then ... they have sex on the phone. <br /> <br /> I do not know where you are from or when you were born, but I remember that this part of the phone sex took place at the end of the 80s. sorry, but it was naughty. <br /> <br /> Soon Roger and the great comrade start a swirling romance. They fall in love, visit the zoo to see gorillas, then have a naughty sexual relationship with Roger's son in the next room. She ties him to the bed and seduces him. <br /> <br /> Roger is so stupid that he does not realize that Johnnie-Eliane is just a bimbo who likes to sleep. May God forbid women to sleep with one man. Soon, strange calls start to happen. Johnny Girl asks Roger to marry him with absolute speed. She keeps talking about her ex-husband who beat her. It's funny to see Roger believe her through all these things. That's until a cowardly colleague tells her to go digging through her things like a curious housewife. He takes his bad advice and lo and behold, he finds a suitcase with fake IDs, wigs, guns and a crossbow. He immediately takes the suitcase to the police and stops it. Despite all this jazz, he still loves the broad mute. She says so many lies that her tongue will ignite if she tells the truth once. <br /> <br /> Roger continues his life and meets an ugly woman, named Angela, who looks like something that is not Gremlins 2. She also has a child and Roger likes her a lot. But something in Roger's subconscious keeps him in touch with Lisa Rohn (if that's his real name) and he keeps coming back to see her. <br /> <br /> Now, Lisa is "the ex who is not going to leave" she "wins" a card without going out of jail and shows up at Roger's door. His son Matt is so busy trying to control it that he is pouring juice on the floor. He Rog is so stupid that he throws Lisa outside and does not even change the locks. Boy, if everyone was so stupid, I would not even write this criticism. The end of this film is so old that you will not believe it. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson is a movie king made for television. he looks like such a dawm mom in this movie. It is a little wooden and steep. The dazzling Tracy Pollan fits well with her role and her echo is true. She is extremely beautiful and I see what Michael J. Fox sees in her. <br /> <br /> This movie is nice to watch when you're on the late-night tip, but again, you could fall asleep, considering how dull and bland it is.
