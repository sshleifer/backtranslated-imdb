Although I have a great interest in Bible films, I was bored every minute of the movie. Everything is bad. The film is too long, the acting is mostly a joke and the scenario is horrible. I did not understand the purpose of mixing the story of Abraham and Noah. So, if you value your time and your sanity, stay away from this horror.
