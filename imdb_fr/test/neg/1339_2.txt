I saw this movie last night. In general, I do not comment good or bad, because I think that movies are like books to the extent that there is something for everyone and everyone is different, tastes vary, yadda yadda. This movie was bad. In the end, I thought, oh there, it puts my patience to the test. How many women really look like that when they hit the bottom and if I could just borrow money from mom and live to live my dreams of fashion designers - that's when life would be beautiful! I was out for a nice movie with my daughter (darling darling loves to watch movies together and I knew it would not be her thing), something soothing and soothing, but it was a bad movie. We are intelligent and interesting spectators and this film was not that. Annette Benning is a great actress, she did well. Wrong. Wrong.
