I could not help laughing at what the public could think of e-mail in 1996. Apparently, e-mail is an interactive discussion (similar to an online discussion) with a lame voice synthesizer that reads every commentary out loud high. And some of the other "technical" aspects are also funny to laugh at. I swear that the "high tech" communication center she owns actually has some Commodore 64 monitors. I guess it's almost like I'm watching the movie Hackers nowadays. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that for most of the film, the main actress evokes the illusion of being disabled, the final part of the film has a leg that I can not ignore. I mean, why include something so stupid? <br /> <br /> Anyway, to sum up: the plot is predictable enough, the bad behavior, the killer quite conceivable. But it can be fun in a kind of Mystery Science Theater 3000, I guess.
