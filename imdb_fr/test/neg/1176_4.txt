I watched this movie quite amused. I'm not sure whether it's a horror attempt in a Rob Zombie type affair or an exploration of real events. <br /> <br /> In both cases, he missed his goal. This is not particularly accurate from a historical point of view, as the characters are cut out and modified for the story. <br /> <br /> The performances were neither convincing nor bad. <br /> <br /> For me, I would have preferred a more psychological approach and this film could easily have followed this path without harming the overall effect.
