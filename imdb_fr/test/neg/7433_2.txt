I've always loved Bill Murray in films like Lost in Translation, and the movie trailer looked really good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically, Murray plays Jack Corcorin who recently learned that his father was dead and he should hear his will. He discovers that his father was a clown, because he left a big shoe, his squeaky nose and his main heritage, an elephant! The only way for Jack to get rid of this elephant is to travel 4,000 km in four days and pour it into a secure zoo for $ 30,000. Also starring Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are small moments of humor, such as the front of a truck leaning forward and Murray shouting, but overall, it's useless. Pretty poor!
