This is without a doubt the most annoying and frustrating game I have ever encountered. Each time you turn around, the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can not cross. Cut scenes leave you in control of your character's movements, but only to a small extent. In addition, you must play the game for about 2 hours just to go beyond the intro / tutorials. It's terrible! I'm afraid if I play this game again, I'll break something. This game is zero. The graphics are good, but nothing special, the game is terrible. To say that I hate this game would be a huge euphemism. I have it on sale, but I want to recover my $ 20. Such a waste!
