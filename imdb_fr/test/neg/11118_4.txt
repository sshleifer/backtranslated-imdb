Without John Rhys-Davies, I have to admit that it would not even be recorded on my meter. But despite this unique fact, it's not a bad little thriller, given the low budget, poor quality effects, rigorous gameplay and aspects of the Sci Fi channel. The effects of the blood are very convincing and the chupacabra looks realistic ... no matter what you think of a chupacabra, it is a beautiful chupacabra. <br /> <br /> Aside from the positives, it works pretty well. like Kolchak: The Night Stalker (Darren McGavin, do you remember?) meets the Love Boat, but despite the ultimate cheese of this work, he still keeps something that looks like a plot and actually tries to earn your respect while you making you laugh and roll your eyes. <br /> <br /> As contradictory as this work, I still managed to find pleasure here. Maybe you too. <br /> <br /> He gives a rating of 5.2 / 10 on the TV scale Made 4. <br /> <br /> He gives a score of 4.1 / 10 on the TV scale ... < the demon :.
