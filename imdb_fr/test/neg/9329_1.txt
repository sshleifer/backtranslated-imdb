This film was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects. The scenes in which Father Merrin wiggles in his bed and his glimpses of a gimpy native are signs of bad acting and low imagination. Nothing seems to match. The story jumps from stage to stage. The elementary writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense. The woman doctor said at one point that she thought the city would "blow up soon" after all these crazy events. In fact, there was nothing in the movie to make this line relevant. From the terrible work done by the film, I would never have known that there was tension in the village. If you like cheese films, praise it, but if you want to see it doing well, check out Exorcist: The Beginning
