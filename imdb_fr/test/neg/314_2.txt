Jack-O (1995) was really a bad movie, we're talking about 100 dollars, no entertainment value, no budget, no gore, Z-rated actors, etc., this movie was a terrible addition to horror film industry and not been done !!! The only reason I bought this movie was because I knew Linnea Quigley was there and she's doing her nude shower scene mandatory, which is lovely, yes. <br /> <br /> But as for the film itself .. ...... I fell asleep at the 40-minute stage and had NO desire to finish it, it is just OK. <br /> <br /> I like horror movies, I'm a passionate fan, a MASSIVE fan, I love low-budget horrors, I love everything, but I hated this garbage, so I think that it will tell you everything you need to know about "JACK-O". <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2/10, the "2" is for the 2 minute Linnea shower scene, the movie itself is a total of ZERO !!!!
