It's a cheap movie! A stripper continues to be attacked and raped by zombies and no one believes her. She goes to the police who also rapes her. She finally finds a child who has also been attacked by the zombies and they trace the zombies to "The Zombie Master". The fact that Stephanie Beaton plays the role of the stripper is the only reason to watch this movie.
