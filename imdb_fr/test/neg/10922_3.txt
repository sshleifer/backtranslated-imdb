This movie was extremely boring. I only laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatner's name on the cover. Everything revolves around this little boy who gets caught all the time by his classmates. While wandering the streets in search of old ladies, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called Playground, where he befriends several pimps. When Mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to resume pimping, Lil 'Pimp has to go to bed for his pals. <br /> <br /> The animation is not very good in there. Looks like it was done with Macromedia, which I'm sure. It's not bad, it's the kind of unstable flash animation that people have become used to in recent years. The humor in it is not very good, I did not think it was funny.
