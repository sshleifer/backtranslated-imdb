Leatherheads is a fitting title, but a leather bracelet would be more useful for self-flogging after buying a ticket to witness this harmful entertainment attempt. Clooney's attempt to belittle his humor comes up against a thud as his behavior implies that he is anything but safe. Perhaps with another actor playing the role of Clooney, the film might be slightly acceptable. Sorry George, I doubt there will be Oscars this time. George Clooney is definitely a fish out of the water comedy (unless you talk about politics). Anyway, only the most ardent fans of Clooney will enjoy watching Leatherheads, all the others will long the time of the silent photo.
