I have had more boring moments of 80 minutes in my life, but none comes to mind at the moment. Hell Ride is based on the 70s retro cult theme that Tarantino brought back and did well in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride is that, unlike PF and RD, the story is sordid and the development of the character is an example. How many movies does Bishop think he can steal flagrantly? The brief case in Pulp Fiction, the air gun in No Country, etc. etc. Speaking of Bishop, what does he do as an actor in this movie? I could not help but laugh at those scenes where he was standing in front of his pelvis, desperately trying to look like a hardened biker. Nothing in this film is credible. And why Dennis Hopper? Did they really need the Easy Rider pattern too? I blame Larry Bishop for his horrible plot and dialogue, not to mention his failed lead role attempt. Do not watch this movie, it's a waste of time.
