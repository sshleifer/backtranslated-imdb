This film is waste because, for various reasons, it is based on Mark Furman's book, which is also a waste. let me say that Mark Furhman is a racist pig who is simply looking for another way to get into the spotlight - and others who, with regard to this type of waste, belong to the prison. because the film itself, based on the book, was also horrible. the only reason that this murder case has become such a big book and movie is because the guy is related to the Kennedy family by the marriage of his aunt and it is ridiculous that people still believe that This family has the ability to kill - they are just a family and America in the middle needs to overcome the obsession. this poor guy and his family were harassed by the police for years, they could not be beaten so they sued Micheal. It is astonishing that he went to prison with all the proof that he did not do so, besides the fact that the limitation period, among other things, should have prevented this trial from being resumed after TWENTY years of love for god, do not look at this garbage
