I was on a British Airways flight between London and New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could fall asleep. The scenario was very fine and the editing team did their best to stretch it as long as they did. <br /> <br /> Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such an incredible character that I struggled to be in favor of him. Andy's acting talent is good but not enough to make up for the poor writing of this movie. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell performed very well Linda's role, Gary's romantic interest. I can not say anything wrong to Andie, I always enjoy her. The problem here is that the romance between Andy and Andie is so hard to get and amazing. Both do not make a good pair on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The end of the film was almost as disappointing as the film itself. A nod from the pope and everything is forgiven, come on. The event that allows this film to have a happy ending and that writers expect us to accept it is pathetic. Gary does not change and it is only at the death of a dear friend that his situation improves. <br /> <br /> There are tons of great movies that should be seen before this one. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br />
