* POSSIBLE SPOILERS FORWARD * <br /> <br /> I will only say what has not been said here (and I will pursue it for the rest of my WWF / WWE comments). <br /> <br /> If you want to have a match for the women's title, make it at least interesting, rather than just a squash to replace the current champion. I guess Moolah could not stand an intense match, but they wanted to have the caption in a WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> I thought the Killer Bees were wasted in WrestleManias, especially here. I became a fan in 1989, about a year after the departure of B. Brian Blair and the return of Jim Brunzell. So, I did not realize for a moment that they were a top team, even top contenders. <br /> <br /> But I liked to see Bill Fralic participate in the royal battle. It really took off here, creating a bold heel character in a pre-match interview and even making an elimination in the royal battle. Besides Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene, he is the only professional athlete of my generation to have respect for the fight (someone remembers Dennis Rodman?). And what was there with the ridiculous green tights of the Hart Foundation?
