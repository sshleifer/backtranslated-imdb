Imagine Diane de Cheers, the character centered on self-centered individualism, imagine now that she was trying to make a film moir√©. That would be it. If you only look at some of the no sound plans, you might think that ... it could be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Now, if you turn on the sound and listen at all times, you quickly realize that the person who made the movie knows nothing about movies beyond what they read in a book. I kept thinking if this movie was alien, it was so bad. <br /> <br /> If you do not remember Cheers, think of Mr. Beans Holiday ... remember the character of DeFoe who created the awful film ... well, imagine this horrible movie without Mr. Bean. That's what this movie is. I'm not saying anything about the film other than it's an attempt to make a dark, gloomy movie about a hitman coming home ... at least that's about all I could get out of it.
