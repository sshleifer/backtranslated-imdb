This is one of those movies that is so bad, it's great !!! He has everything a film in the early 80s needs: Flared pants, Big Mustaches, Chicks with Farrah Hair and, more importantly, NINJAS !!!! I have a few moments of choice to retract for you. Cole's army buddy has a strange face that looks like a monkey and still seems to be talking without moving his jaw. He gets his butt off just about every other scene by thugs who want his land, so he gets drunk all the way through the movie. At one point, his farm workers finally come back after being mowed down by bandits hired by a gangster. Frank, I think his name is Frank, is so moved that he shouts to the whole group "Lets Have A Cock Fight !!" and they are all heading briskly to the farm's rooster fighting area to begin the festivities. It's fun at all possible levels. Whether you take it dirty or literally, it warms my heart. Another fun thing is Sho Kosugi's little grunts and ninja-style animated movements. I remember this guy from my childhood and he used to say he was the only real ninja in the world (he had advertisements in martial arts magazines), if I remember correctly. My friends and I were a little crazy ninja during the release of this movie and I remember seeing it several times at the local theater. I was wondering when I looked at Starz last night why every type of shady American gangster still has a fortress in the Philippines and wears Steve Martin's white suit. In fact, this guy goes far beyond imposing all his thugs to wear a white suit of Steve Martin. There is a scene where it seems that 20 imitators of Steve Martin tackle a model of underwear Sears of the 1970s (Cole). As we get closer to the final battle, Cole gets clumsily into the villain's headquarters and is immediately spotted by a secretary who in turn alerts a guard who fires a shotgun at a distance of less than ten meters. bad guys. seems to notice or pay attention. Cole, dressed in a completely white ninja outfit, sneaks up a staircase and then turns around in the area where all the villains are. The second leader tells him that he does not need to kill everyone because they were waiting for him, then leads him into the huge Cock Fighting arena of the wicked. Do not ask me why Cock Fighting is a huge part of this movie, but it is. When they arrive, Cole always wears his ninja mask, even though everyone involved knows what he looks like without him. The final battle approaches while Cole killed everyone and now, Sho, as I like to call him, reveals that he has kidnapped Cole's wife, Frank's wife, and that they meet in the the fiercest cock fighting arena you've ever seen. Sho then, very politely I could add, release said lady and the battle is about to begin. They bow and begin to encircle, both masked by the path. When they join the battle, it seems that Cole becomes someone else intermittently like "Finishing The Game", a funny parody to have completed "The game of death" Bruce Lee. Cole eventually wins, Kills Sho, who dies of honor being decapitated and all is well. Then we see Cole, having ruined everyone's life, he's about to divide the city again, but not before announcing the brutal death of a fat guy with a hook, then he winks eye inexorably towards the camera, freeze frame, credit, finished.
