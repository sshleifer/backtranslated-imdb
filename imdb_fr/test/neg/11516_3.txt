'Be With Me' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie. Just let it run in the background. talk to each other and come back whenever you want and at some point it will end. </ b> </ b> </ b> </ b> </ b> </ b> <b> </ b> <b> </ b> <b> </ b> <b> </ b> </ b> alas, when I looked at it alone, and so I felt like I was looking at almost the worst pub in the world, the longest and the most sentimental, when I managed to keep eyes open at the end credits obtained; and then I managed (just a) a few extra waking moments to attend a thank-you to the movie's sponsors, including Asia Pacific Breweries. Aha! Methought: How amazing * is it to see all the shots of Tiger beer interspersed throughout this most memorable collapse of a movie? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the dialogue starts between individuals who sometimes have deep stabbing, but there is usually no particular progress in advancing the history of the movie. It is as if you could go out at any time and come back later and you would not miss anything, which would have been a possibility not to be missed, or part of its plot, with regard to the overall progression of the film. So, the ultimate "wallpaper movie"! <br /> <br /> Well, I wonder ... Which movie were watching those who commented positively on this one? I wonder and I keep wondering ... It certainly could not be so artistic, to the point of pretending naive and Singaporean to the rolling of a camera. Supposedly, Be With Me is supposed to be articulated around the themes "love, tragedy and redemption". But all I witnessed was boredom, a half-cooked scenario with a handful of ruthless text messages, and the only buyback was what happened at the end of this film totally useless. What a waste of time nostalgic! It was also said that the characters in this film were fictional, with the exception of Theresa Chan, a "remarkable woman who overcame adversity ..." Well, no disrespect for Ms. Chan, but given that she was such a wonderful and amazing character, why did the script have to involve the stories of other characters without the most tenuous attempt to connect their lives? Still, the film was still unbearably boring. Rather than linking the fate of all the characters, I really felt that the film ended up trying the impossible and that it obviously fell between the stools with regard to any engagement of the spectators. <br /> <br /> I am usually an art. movie buff and do not generally oppose the slow pace (which here it does not miss, believe me!). I hate movies like 300, Transformers, Fight Club, but I consider Eric Rohmer as an excellent filmmaker. So I hope that puts my critics in perspective. Nevertheless, in the design and diffusion of the film, there was no usable feature, which could prevent the eyelids from slowly lowering each minute of "Be With Me". Watch this movie if you need to waste time. Otherwise, your life would not be richer for having missed it. 3/10
