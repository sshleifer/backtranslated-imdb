SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I do not go in high tech movies, I do not expect them, they are 100% accurate on everything related to computers. But anyway, even the average user "I have a computer" is supposed to believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) An IT professional with a top secret, special data <br> /> <br /> 2) Keep the main copy of this data on a floppy disk 1.44 <br /> <br /> 3) and absolutely NOT SAVE this special secret data <br /> <br /> Even high school students do their homework goodness. <br /> <br /> It's also the worst representation of a computer nerd. Even if she is super cute, we are supposed to believe that she has no friends, neighbors, extended family members or coworkers who can identify her. Even the disarming had a family that could denounce him. <br /> <br /> END SPOILER <br /> <br /> These are not just minor errors that do not affect the film. These are the major plot. points that fueled the plot. The characterization was awful, the plot absolutely amazing, and if you have not seen it before, do not bother.
