I've seen a lot - maybe too many movies directly on the video, no slasher films on the budget and I've developed a taste for the "good guys", or the ones who are less succulent, as ridiculous as that may seem, hahaha. DR. CHOPPER, that's what I'd like to call "absolute shit". Nothing is nice about it - the actor's game is nil, the characters are nil, the killer is nil, the coolness is minimal ... and no one. This is a group of friends at a university who visit a newly discovered family cabin owned by the parents of one of the children. It's supposed to be a relaxing retreat, but they do not know that a former, seriously ill plastic surgeon who has become ill, and his two assistants, are looking for tissues that can be used to save the doctor. His name is Dr. Chopper because he walks around on a motorcycle and of course chops. This is just a terrible movie, do not deserve anyone's time. Enough said.
