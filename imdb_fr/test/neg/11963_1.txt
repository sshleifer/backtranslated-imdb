So me and my friend caress our local movie rental store and look for something to buy to accompany Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so why not choose the third installment of the series Scarecrow!?! Remember, it's not just Scarecrow Three; that is, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now we had both seen the first two Scarecrows, so we felt compelled to finish the job. Let's start with the DVD cover first. We first notice a photo of Ken Shamrock ("The most dangerous man in the world") on the cover. Apparently, he used to market the film as a "main actor". By the way, he has the least time on the screen that a member of the class credited. Then we notice an image of a very attractive woman and very poorly dressed in the middle of the cover. I can assure you she's not in the movie ... at all. At the time of the rental, we had supposed it was to recall the fact that the scarecrow "was unleashed". In the background, we noticed a big carnival on an island in the ocean. I can also assure you that the carnival is not in the film ... at all. Looking back, my friend and I should have known something was happening. I mean really, who the hell is putting a carnival on an island. Let's move on to the film now. We start when a young man is inexplicably fused with a scarecrow in the middle of a cornfield. Do not ask me how they merged, but think about when Brandon Lee woke up from the dead at The Crow. It's just stupid. But in defense of the scarecrow, he has "become wild". Anyhoo, the Scarecrow, who now lives vicariously with the young man goes to the local beach to brutalize those who have wronged him. Because, in the world of The Scarecrow, the beaches are ideally located in the same general neighborhood as the cornfields. To shorten a long story, the Scarecrow kills all those in its path without warning, except brand whistle scarecrow that signals a shoe shot. However, it is hard to believe because the mouth of the scarecrow's costume is clearly sewn. Several follow-up plans that would then tip Kubrick into his grave, and we have one of the worst third installments of all time. Well, except perhaps the third matrix. As Joel Siegel would say: "This scarecrow is terribly bad."
