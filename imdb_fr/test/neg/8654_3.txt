I agree that this film talks about sex without any seduction or love. In fact, sex seems so boring and I wonder why bother us. In fact, I do not think at all that it speaks remotely of how the second generation of Indian Canadians thinks sex. Anyway, did you know that the first idea of ​​a hotel or drink was a copy of a Korean film, Yopgijogin gunyo, produced in 2001 or so? This Korean film has been brilliant as a comedy, but at the same time compels the public to think about the complexity of male-female relationships and the difference in experience between men and women. I mean most Neal N Nikki / bus hotels were imitated by outlet. Can not the Bollywood filmmakers create only originals, please? Seriously, I have never enjoyed a Hindi film that is a copycat. Those I appreciate have always talked about Indian feelings through Indian cultural means.
