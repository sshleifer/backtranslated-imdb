I attended the screening of "The Cooler" at the Toronto Film Festival this year. While other reviews I've read seem to be generally (and mystifying) positive, I have to tell you that nothing bothering me to think that this movie is incredibly bad. The very brave and candid performances of William H. Macy and Maria Bello have been horribly poorly spent for what is probably the least refined and most clich√©d scenario that has been given the go-ahead for years. I do not know how bad the brown rabbit was, but I'm sure he could not have reached the Dante-style depths that she had. As brave as their performances are, perhaps the bravest of these otherwise brilliant actors was to confide in such a dreaded director and a terrible scenario. <br /> <br /> It must be pretty good in the conference room, because it should never have been allowed to be within a hundred meters of a camera. The dialogue is so embarrassed and clumsy that I found myself blushing during the screening. I am mortified to know that Macy's talents have been totally wasted in the hands of someone whose direction is as incompetent as his writing. <br /> <br /> Watch talented actors like Alec Baldwin mingle with Kramer's appalling scenario and brazen leadership. looked like watching a baby seal become clubbed to death - I felt angry, helpless and sick at the same time. Although I am always happy that there are investors and industry professionals willing to take risks with original scripts with interesting premises, this picture has been a total fiasco. Kramer could not have been more cruel to these actors if he had himself taken a steel pipe on his knees. I hope that for their good, they can all avoid such humiliations in the future. Macy wisely sketched out the side door and did not even pass the projection. Unfortunately, it seems that the bad luck of the main character has collapsed in the worst way. Anyone who is accustomed to quality independents will probably find it completely unbearable.
