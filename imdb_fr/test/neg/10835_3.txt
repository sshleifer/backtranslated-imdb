What a terrible movie. The effects were mediocre, especially by today's standards, but it was forgivable. What was unforgivable was the terrible recurrence of all disaster films caused by a flood or a dam in that trash. The game was horrible and I mean AWFUL. The point in the story where Michelle Green stopped to rescue a dog from the approaching stream was hilarious. They see the water approach and run to save their lives. (By the way, they had to find a very big old dog so as not to make Mrs. Green unsuitable). They manage to overcome the water for a while before taking refuge. How fast! Later, a car that drives too fast is not fast enough to escape the torrent. My god, she and this dog ran fast! If you want to watch a good movie about breaking a dam, that's not it. Porchlight Entertainment produced good family movies, but this time they simply missed the mark.
