Like the previous poster, I come from northern Vermont and I was inclined to love this movie. However, not since "Red Zone Cuba" I have seen such a confusing plot. The things that bootleg people make sense. Two of the gangs cross the border and send a second person in a car. Uhm, why? Then they meet two other people and arrive at night in the hiding place of the villain in a luxury Packard. - Would not two people in a flatbed truck be more logical? Then, parked in front of the garage that holds the target hooch, the four fall asleep! When they wake up in the morning and start whiskey, they are spotted and shot, losing part of their precious cargo. Then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and passed it over the border. Again, why? Someone whose grand-uncle has actually smuggled into the area, he tells me. It was enough to drive a vehicle that could overtake the United States Border Patrol, which at the time had a fraction of its resources. <br /> <br /> And do not get me started in the last half hour, which makes no sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about the movie is that Kris Kristopherson has actually developed a bit of charisma over the years.
