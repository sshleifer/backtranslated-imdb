A friend of mine showed me this movie yesterday and I was really surprised someone could make such a terrible movie! <br /> <br /> Shuffle the ugliest and most clich√©d dialogue, with the most boisterous actor game you've ever seen, with the most famous cheese special effects known to man, and you'll get this beautiful beast! <br /> <br /> "Vampire Assassins" is funnier than most of the comedies I've seen, it's awful! <br /> <br /> I was angry during the scene where the ex-cop / vampire assassin's character is having a coffee with the internet journalist. Look at it and you will see what I mean! <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not believe anyone did that with serious intentions. <br /> <br /> Tragic, but really funny. We must see it before believing it.
