In New York, on a morning near Christmas, a father and a mother of the upper class go to their BMWs in a private school to see the game of their daughter. Then they go shopping and later they return to their luxury apartment in Manhattan. In the night, they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood, where they prepare the drug for distribution. On Christmas Eve, when buying the Christmas present for their daughter, the father is kidnapped and his wife tries desperately to raise a large sum of money to pay the ransom demanded. "R Xmas" is a misleading film by Abel Ferrara. The main characters have no name, are anonymous and may be intended to say that within a family near your building, there may be drug traffickers. or that drug traffickers can also have families and be loving people; or that there are a lot of dirty cops, probably worse than criminals; or is it a mere excuse for crime? It does not matter! However, this humanization of criminals is a horrible message and I really did not like this movie. In Brazil, for example, many drug traffickers and criminals help their communities, due to the absence of the state in poor neighborhoods and slums, but this procedure does not make it a model citizen. In this film, we see in the day a loving family of the upper class who provides drugs as a means of livelihood, but the story does not show the destruction of members of other families and it is impossible to feel sympathy for the characters. In the end, I wished them death. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Gangues do Gueto" ("Ghetto gangs")
