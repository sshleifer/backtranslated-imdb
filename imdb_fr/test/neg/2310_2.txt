I should really consider "Sex is Comedy" as one of the worst dreck scenes I've ever seen. The film inadvertently presents those who are the worst aspects of France, or at least the way they are stereotyped, narcissism, snobbery and the pseudo-intellectual. I am French Canadian myself and I am a little ashamed that the creators of this film belong to the same culture as me, it should give you an idea of ​​the seriousness of this film! We did not watch this film so much as to suffer torture, there was a total lack of humor and it seemed to me that the whole film was a documentary interviewing people who were neither famous nor talented, like to celebrate something which never happened to start. Instead, why not look at the Spanish Inn, Happenstance or I love you ... to madness, three fantastic modern French movies.
