Join any movie lover and ask for the title of the film directed by Robert Wise, directed by Yakima Canutt and Sergio Leone in the second unit, designed by Ken Adam and performed by Max Steiner, with Sir Stanley Baker, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Brigitte Bardot were shot in Cinecitta in 1955 in color, in vision amplifier and in stereo, with a thousand extras - and they will tell you to go away and stop being ridiculous. <br /> <br /> tell you that this film does not exist. The names you quoted have NEVER worked together - they were not even contemporary. And you have just chosen the names of a random movie publication and you are trying to confuse them. <br /> <br /> You can then direct them to IMDb and show them the cast and crew of "Helen Of Troy". They will be surprised! This lesser-known epic of swords and sandals bears ALL of these names and more - Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott and the good old Harry Andrews. <br /> <br /> And it's definitely a quirk. After the war, 1,000 Italian extras cost about $ 25 a day and toga dramas were a staple of Italian cinema. The orgy scenes were shot twice - one with highs, the other without (you can guess which version were provided by Britain and America). I think even Sophia is an extra in this one. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the name is called STAGGER. But it's really just a coincidence. All these names came just at the end of their career (Canutt, Steiner) or early career (all others). <br /> <br /> Only Robert Wise and Niall MacGinnis were on the way. <BR /> <br /> For the record, Leone was not credited and learned his trade - Adam had yet to invent the descending circle in the ceiling decorations (a brand he would put in all the first bonds) - Baker He still has to play and help produce films like "Zulu" and "Robbery" - and then run a Welsh television company called Harlech - and then die tragically young. <br /> <br /> While Harry Andrews would continue to become one of the favorite British actors - Janette Scott (Thora Hird's daughter) would never make such a match, but who can forget about it in "Day Of The Triffids" "(even if its title was added later - for padding and a happy ending)) or" Crack In The World "? <br /> <br /> Sir Cedric was a theater, but knew how to play in a movie - and Bardot ... was BARDOT, for gawdsake! <br /> <br /> But what did these stellar people do in this camp an old nonsense? Do not ask me. The two main stars were nameless Italians - Helen wore a mustache and Paris was pretty - while the British were only there to get help. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I think you can just mark this one as major FLUKE. In stereo. To be honest, if I had not seen it - I would not believe it either!
