Was it supposed to be funny? It's one of those movies that just does not work. The first, Bruce Almighty with Jim Carey, had some very entertaining moments. This one did not have any. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrell, who was brilliant in Bruce Almighty, fails to deliver here. His performance is very ordinary and he can not win as Carey did. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this is that I only paid $ 1.95 to rent it. It's a children's movie ... very young kids who only saw about 4 movies in their short lives. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to note that Jim Carey is playing in a movie and doing a sequel. without him, it's usually a huge turkey. Does anyone remember Son of Mask? (IMDB Worst 100 movies of all time) Avoid fans of this movie.
