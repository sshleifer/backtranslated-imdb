Richard Donner shows his liberal credentials with this ridiculously over-cooked, simplistic attack on South African politics. It's not as if America were the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love - and the fact that the film takes place in the city that was Rodney King's home and glorifies the police department that did so much for community relations with their brutal racist behavior. So, Donner's salt and pepper couple who clearly fell in love with his late adolescence is doing his own work ignoring the rule of law or the rules of evidence, and nobody cares because the bad guys are white South Africans. a disturbing example of police racism in itself? In Rudd's (Joss Ackland - eminently hoardable) office, the set is designed and lit up to look as much as possible at the Fuhrerbunker and just in case stupid moviegoers miss their point, his men and him would be called "Nazis" at intervals. regular. . For me, the only good thing about the film was when Mel Gibson showed up for an anti-apartheid demonstration with a banner bearing the inscription "End Aparthied Now". Joe Pesci, an extremely irritating man, is introduced into the franchise to lighten the burden of boys by following them constantly yapping like a poorly trained puppy. It would be bearable if there was any chance that he would end up in a concrete mantle, but unfortunately he survives to irritate another day. Miss Patsy Kensit seems to be in a world all her own, maybe not believing her chance to be opposed to Mel Gibson who has no trouble getting her back to bed in her mobile home that seems to have been stranded Somewhere on the beach.Only after having consumed them this case is blamed on them by a number of helicopters that are firing enough shells into Mel's caravan to keep the US military in Iraq for six months. Fortunately, he has a dog who is not afraid to cause coitus interrupted when he leaves for a few seconds. His barking warns them of the imminent attack. I hope he will have a special bone as a reward. The film culminates (without interruption from Mel's dog) on ​​a freighter to Nazi Germany (sorry, South Africa), when Mel and Danny murder so many members of the masters race that I I lost the account. Although moving like Bonnie and Clyde under Under the effect of a shower of bullets, Mel survives, snuggled in the arms of his partner like a small child with a wise and benevolent father. Take it, Apartheid!
