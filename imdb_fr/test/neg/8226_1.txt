I have no qualms about saying that the movie does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I'm coming from there). Well. It does not matter. I lived there long enough. I do not need to see a movie that captures the garden state. <br /> <br /> I have scruples about how bad this movie is. Let's make things easy for you. We will use bullet points. There are probably spoilers that follow. (It's not that you can not predict the movie anyway): <br /> <br /> - The placement in the music was forced and condescending. Example: Large: "What are you listening to?" Sam: "The Shins, never heard of them?" "No." "Listen to this song - it'll change your life!" And then they keep playing that Shins song that was in a McDonalds commercial. (You do not like when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you - the viewer - how to react to something? I love it! Hey, they should have put subtitles in various scenes asking us to " laugh "," Say 'aaaaaw' "" crying "" feeling inspired "etc.) <br /> <br /> -The scenes were so bad. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: the entire movie. But no, really, for example: they are in the rainy quarry near the ark. In the pouring rain (oh it's so torpedoed!), On big machines and SCREAMS! Oh how moving! But wait! This is Sam and his friend (the drug addict addict), and they all cry !!!! BUT WAIT!!!! OH MY GOD!!!! It's coming! THEY EMBRACE !!! LONG, DEEP !!!! IN THE RAIN !!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> - The dialogue was so bad. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They leave the ark and Sam says something like, "Hey good luck exploring the infinite chasm." And the guy says back: "You too." Oh ... Oh my God! I never realized ... could it be? Oh my God, that's it! Large's life looks like ... ohmigod ... AN INFINITE ABYSS !!!! Another example: Large and Sam at the airport. Sam says something like, "Is this a goodbye?" Not enough for you? OK, Largeman says something like, "It's not a point at the end of the sentence ... it's ellipses." And guess what happens when he tries to get off the jetway and go back to his life in LA. You know what? Do not guess. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> - This is a Grade Z scam movie, Wes Anderson. When he is not busy being melodramatic and cliché, the film spends a lot of time with wacky characters. Hey, Sam's brother ... thanks to Zach Braff for including it, because it really made the movie more textured. Also tear Anderson: the dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in a bar. Walking friends, "the vagina!" said one of them. Then they see him sitting with Sam, so one of the friends says, "Sorry, I said vagina." And Sam says, "It does not matter." <br /> <br /> -Inventive cinematography that is not inventive but useless and embarrassing. Give me a break with the acceleration / deceleration of the film. Once again, Wes Anderson does it effectively in his films. And it was done well in "Donnie Darko". But, really, it was useless. Sensational. A crazy party where people take X and sniff coke. Better to deploy all the stuff! <br /> <br /> -You can count the good moments of a hand (even if you are missing fingers). That's what makes it even worse. The delayed quarter ... well, it was good! The little thing he says (largeman) as they are about to enter the quarry (something about the breathlessness of turpentine) ... it was good! Oh, wait, that's about it. <br /> <br /> You know, Zach Braff is, I think, always a little too cute. But, he's nice. But, man, it's forced, pretentious, melodramatic (you've already understood?), Too cute, too much. This film is terrible. Apparently, I'm outnumbered because this wasted time is currently rated at 8.0. <br /> <br /> Please, however, if you are looking for something really poignant, subtle and unique. DO NOT. RENTAL. THIS. MOVIE.
