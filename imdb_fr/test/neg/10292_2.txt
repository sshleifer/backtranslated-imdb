Important spoilers! <br /> <br /> It's a sick and disturbing film, just like the sick and twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch, who also wrote it. I do not even know why I gave this movie a score of 2. It's not the actors' fault for sure. The actors have described their roles well. This is the way this film was written and the way the characters were written, which was the reference of a really sick mind. <br /> <br /> I know I will never watch another movie that was written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She's a sick, a crooked, a dirty mouth and a disgusting thought. She looks, speaks and sounds like a biker with her drugged brain, who has spent 20 years going through difficult times. You can clearly see what kind of person she is by looking at her in the special features section of the "Watchdog: Watched People" DVD. You can see it and hear it for yourself. It was just as bad as I had imagined since writing this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not shocked by foul language, although this director certainly speaks like a sailor. It goes well beyond mere foul language; worse than any movie p0rn. The level of sado-violence and implicit perversion that she incorporates into all the characters she writes is of the kind that is even illegal in the face of personal norms. This perverse and disturbing thought is clearly apparent in his own personality and his words. Another reviewer found the description I was looking for. This is a snuff film. <br /> <br /> Be sure to listen to her narration on deleted scenes and alternate ends. This director / screenwriter is really a sick person. I can not believe someone would entrust her to a movie, let alone pay her. You can rest assured that I will never watch another film to which it is affiliated. Of the thousands of films I watched and collected, only a few filmmakers and screenwriters deserved this kind of boycott. She is offensive beyond anyone I've ever seen related to filming before. There were some bad directors and writers, but none could compare to his sick and twisted mind. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, it was a deadly murder after another. Once past the murder of the hotel ... then the sick cops pulling and brutalizing the drivers for kicks ... the family vacation with the bad parents (who had nothing to do in the presence of children ) ... followed by the drug addicts .... the film then went to deviant serial killers (even more) twisted. <br /> <br /> When I saw the serial killers reveal themselves, I began to wonder what kind of really sick mind had written that. movie. These were my real thoughts as I watched this movie. I was intending to discover which writer had such a sick mind ... because this writer must seriously engage in long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, it was the director. When I saw and heard what she had to say on the DVD, I realized that my appreciation of the writer was accurate. On the DVD, it was the twisted and sick person I had imagined writing such a disturbing film. <br /> <br /> While the little girl (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins really stole the show ... I can 'I do not think that her parents would have tolerated that this ill and villainous director is close to their daughter. <br /> <br /> This film is troubling, sick, offensive, twisted and the director-writer needs serious treatment in a psychiatric facility. <br /> <br /> As for the end of the film ... the alternative ending, should have been the result of this horrible ordeal. The death of the other character had no interest or benefit for the film, the story or the unfolding of the film. I'm stunned that any studio has actually distributed the film. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason the film seduced the audience was because of the clever wording and creative description on the trailer. This trailer is not representative of the movie you will see. <br /> <br /> Aside from the child ... every character in this movie was a sick, murderous, twisted, perverse, violent monster and their characters are reflected. the spirit of the author-director who created them. But if you look good, even the relatives of the family on vacation; sick cops taking broken pots; serial killers posing in alternative roles; cops at the station; and even the station dispatcher ... each of these roles had a perverse, twisted and violent pervert. I'm not too sure that some actors, after watching them, talk about the shooting of the film and the Canadian city in the "Special Features" section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> This writer-director has a personality so personal deviation that no matter what she writes, every character role contains these same carbon copy stamps. The only character who did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. Look closely and you will see this in each character. Then listen to the director-writer's speech in the special part of the DVD and you will understand what I tell you about her mental state and her psychological problems. She would not be tolerated in too many decent homes if she did not come from a family of Hollywood filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch does not have a lot of filmography ... just a few of the things. As she carbon copies these disturbing traits in all her roles, I do not think we'll have to see many movies written or made by her, unless her father, director David Lynch, helps her. I would advise you to stay away from all the films in which she is involved ... and I'm not sure that her father's films would be better. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.
