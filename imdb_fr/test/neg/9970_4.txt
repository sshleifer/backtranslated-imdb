It seems to me routine with regard to TV movies. I can believe that this is based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by anyone with narration skills. <br /> <br /> For example, the good old John Ritter (now a rather bulky and bearded villain) poisons his wife enough to make her sick, then accuses her of being psychosomatic and immediately marries another young person wife. Fourteen years pass before the story begins again. Why fourteen? I suppose that even if the story does not require it, history does not ask for it. <br /> <br /> Some of these scenes are however so cinematographic so apt that they have almost certainly been imagined by a writer. Helgenberger, Ritter's first wife, stumbles into an attic and discovers an old electrical device. She has one of those black-and-white flashbacks with bites on the score. She suddenly remembers when she discovered Ritter shaving selenium filings 14 years ago. since a rectifier, by collecting them carefully, and putting them in his shampoo and lining for eyelashes (or what it's called). Later, he realizes that he also put it in his coffee. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I do not think so. Nor do I believe that she had this particular epiphany in the attic or that Ritter put selenium chips in her shampoo or eyeliner. In the film, selenium is called a "toxic metal" and I suppose in sufficient quantities, but it is also an antioxidant sold over-the-counter in pharmacies and swallowed. Someone will have to demonstrate - as no one in this film - that it is a topical poison. Many people have tried the nicotine patch and have failed. So why does a little selenium in his shampoo give Marg Helgenberger immediate and dramatic headaches? And her eyes become as painful as boiling when she wears makeup? I think the anthropologist E. B. Tylor called this simple idea "nice magic", but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I divide. Be that as it may, Ritter obviously tries the same feat with his second wife fourteen years later, although no evidence of deception has ever been produced when she falls ill with the same symptoms. The number two woman is taken to Mexico and apparently cured, but suddenly falls dead shortly after her return. The circumstantial evidence accumulates against Ritter, who plays the role of the villain with all the obstacles open to him - when his first trial is rejected, he resists at Helgenberger, who launched the investigation. <br /> <br /> You see, Helgenberger was good friends with Ritter's second wife and was terribly disturbed by her demise and manner. (I bet.) And she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the rich young woman who seems to line up for third place in Ritter's matrimonial agenda. (Of course.) The best performance is given by the guy who plays detective Mauser - Lawrence Dane? Everyone acts by the numbers. They project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railway crossing. But Dane does little original things. "I'm told that you want to report a murder (long pause as he sits and waits), then suddenly turns his face to Helgeberger and asks him in a reasonable and curious voice:" So, who was murdered? " I suppose, except for Nothing stopping the characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life.Ritter is still in jail, found guilty of murder and the character of Helgenberger is dead. I hope that the forensic information has been clarified.Ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals - let me see, selenium, cyanide, a massive dose of chlorine and maybe something else - that I I was baffled by Not that I was looking for Ritter, here is a mathematician with a doctorate who insists that people call him "doctor." He corrects even the people who address him simply as "professor." Most Doctors have this narcissistic problem, behind them very quickly.
