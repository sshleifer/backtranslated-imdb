It was really the most painful experience I've had in a movie theater for a long time. I will give up criticisms as easy as "maudlin" or "historically inaccurate" or "horse poop" because simply our sympathies would go immediately to these words. If a director makes an epic of grand love, then it is for God's sake. MAKE IT A TRUE LOVE MUSEOUS OF GRANDIOSE! Why bother with ridiculously unconvincing second-rate harlequin romances and boring exchanges between characters who are completely mocked when the most decisive battle takes place on Canadian soil? And for pompous people who say to themselves, "Well, this story must be character-centered!"
