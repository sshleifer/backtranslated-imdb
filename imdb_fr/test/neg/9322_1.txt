Do not get me wrong, I like most of Paul Schrader's films. It was therefore with extreme enthusiasm that I was able to attend the screening of "Rolling Thunder" at the Paris Cinémathèque with a surprise movie on December 17, 2004. Of course, The Surprise Movie was The Exorcist and most people were there for that (I was too). The film was then finished but the score was complete, so P Schrader used excerpts from The Return of the King and another movie I forgot (was it Conan?). Anyway, other than that, the film was finalized. The few happy people who were there (perhaps 200 people) were invited not to write on the film on the Internet or in magazines, as this could jeopardize his chances of being selected for the Cannes Film Festival. Then came the film, then realized that the film might not be selected for the Festival because of its quality: never in my life I had experienced such discomfort in the public, skeptical people starting to laugh at the bursts at the show full of pity. I could not believe how much the author of Light Sleeper, Mishima, Blue Collar and Affliction had fallen to the ground. <br /> <br /> Forced to play hard, stupid ending, stupid end, moral black and white, perverse effects, worse taken on Schrader's Christianity ever, not even suspensive, just boring like hell (no play of words) and no surprises at all! Some good sites but unfortunately badly used or at least not meeting the initial hopes! In the end, I'm 100 times more satisfied with Rolling Thunder written by Schrader and I wish 2 hours back. <br /> <br /> Do not believe the hype, even John Boorman's movie is more exciting and original. Oh, and the cast of Billy Crawford, the poor guy is doing his best, but what are you waiting for? It is now part of the small club of the worst casting errors of all time! I give a 1/5 to the film just because I did not leave the room, but I should have done it.
