Just read the list of actors and credits to salivate in anticipation of this DAVID COPPERFIELD, but, alas, alas! So many great talents of actor and director could have turned one of the richest tales of literature into such a monumental BORE, it totally exceeds me. It's nice to watch with beautiful pictures, especially Yarmouth footage, but, JUST PLAIN DULL !!! No need to continue! Do not do it and take a look at the Selznick or the wonderful BBC miniseries of the 1980s.
