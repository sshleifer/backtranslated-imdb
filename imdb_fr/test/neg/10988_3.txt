I will recommend it in one aspect. It was innovative. Innovative does not mean it's a good movie, it means that it can give you an idea of ​​what you can take and implement in your own movies. <br /> <br /> The simple plot is ... well .. simple. I got to the point where I did not care whether they destroyed the building or not. If I had to hear that girl's boring laugh again, I swear I would throw the DVD out the window. And there is also the protagonist. They try to make him kind, but he's a pervert! Sniffing girls' bra, looking naked when she's naked, putting her bra on her eyes when he sleeps, putting her bra on an erotic doll (she removes her panties when he sleeps and slips them on her doll .. umm) <br /> <br /> What irritates me even more is this shitty hue. In the DVD's photo gallery, you can see what the film looked like before switching to gray and putting it in a color tone (also digital). The film looked MUCH better without effect .. so they sacrificed it so that it was good movie just to be artistic ... well. I could understand using gadgets like that if the quality of the movie was shit. <br /> <br /> I think most people who liked this movie liked it just because the girl was naked for 5 to 10 minutes. This does not compare to Delicatessen (as so many people are trying to do). Delicatessen has characters in which you can come in and love. These people just growl and chuckle. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would also like to point out that it was also an attempt to look like a German impressionist film such as old silences. One of the problems of most foreign films, especially artistic ones, is that they focus on the artistic composition and forget the "space" of the scene. As a result, viewers do not really understand what is happening because they do not perceive the surrounding space. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's hogwash. The short film on the DVD, Surprise, was much better.
