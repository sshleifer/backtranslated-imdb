I had never heard of this project before I announced it, so I watched it with a totally open mind. And, of course, the cast is full of good players. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately. . . it's horrible. I do not mean that it is not good; I mean it's extraordinarily bad - sometimes ridiculously, but it's mostly boring. Its major attraction is the presence of people as naked as television on the American network allows, but it is nothing more than substance, and the fact that the nymphs are backup characters can not justify several hours bad television. <br /> <br /> are two fundamental problems that the distribution can not overcome. First, the script is * horrible *. Yes, making changes to the myth of Hercules (which is certainly not a single monolithic story at first) is traditional, but this version is relentlessly dull and far too often mute (and sometimes outright weird), with a terrific survey, pieces borrowed here and there (and several parts apparently belonging to different films), and a really awful dialogue. The dialogue is often unbearably bad, to the point that you feel embarrassed for the actors. Sean Astin, apparently now ranked in the banana category second, seems particularly cluttered by a dreadful series. There is no consistency of tone or mood and little cohesion in the plot. <br /> <br /> Secondly, most of the special effects are really bad. Really bad. Sometimes there is a little CGI decent, but most importantly, again, you feel really embarrassed by the actors. I have no idea of ​​the budget allocated to this project, but it certainly looks like shit compared to "Clash of the Titans" or even to "Hercules: Legendary Journeys" and does not even compare very favorably to old Lou Ferrigno and the Italian 'spaghetti' Hercules movies. Just painfully miserable. <br /> <br /> There are many other problems: the story is unnecessarily complex and can not keep up, and Hercules himself is not presented as a very interesting character. Almost all those who do not have a European accent try to imitate one, which is not just amateurish and dated, but has never made sense in the first place: the drama does not get better just because the actors use British accents, after all. But the appalling scenario and the equally appalling effects flow naturally. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, "Hercules" was apparently conceived as a four-hour mini-series, but truncated (for this broadcast, anyway). a three-hour TV movie. I do not know what they cut, but the changes may have made the situation worse. I do not think you can make "Hercules" good by adding them, but that does not mean that continuity, say, has not been affected by network changes. There is no way I'm looking at the American version to see, though.
