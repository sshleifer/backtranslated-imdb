It was a film that could have been great if there were not so many useless historical inaccuracies and if the actors had been chosen or made up to look a little more like the real characters (not very difficult). Sissi did not go to Mayerling to see her dead son, nor did she die in the street; they took her aboard the boat and then back to the hotel, which was much more dramatic. I'm not sure about the wedding night, but I find it exaggerated that a maid of honor undresses the empress and leaves her naked (and that in the 1850s) or that the emperor announces very proudly "yes, I finally asked her "at the assembled court. As far as I know, this was done from the first night and no one rewarded her as if she were a prostitute. The saving grace of the film is really St√©phane Audran, excellent actress and faithful to the character.
