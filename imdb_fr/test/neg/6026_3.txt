I seemed to find the trailers better than the movie. They did their job and interested me to look UNKNOWN. Interest declined early. A simple premise in the landscape. Five men wake up in a chemical warehouse without knowing why. and even less to know how on earth they got there. Confusion and paranoia lead to fear and mistrust. The men learn that a kidnapper is about to kill his hostages. Now, men are trying to figure out if all are victims and who could actually be one of the kidnappers. The cast includes Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Bridget Moynahan, Barry Peppper, David Selby and Adam Rodriguez.
