I m 35 years old. Bruce was the man of Evil Dead and I still like watching ED1 and ED2. It was also cool to see him as the king two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep, in which he showed versatility and great acting talent. But this Screaming Brain adventure is certainly not for the first fans of Bruce. Either I'm getting too old for this sh17, or I'm no longer part of Bruce's target audience. I am convinced that children aged 9 to 13 will love this movie. But this morning science-fiction comedy too long contains about 5 minutes in total of interesting moments, and the rest is just awesome humor. Campbell would do better to talk to Sam Raimi seriously and gather their brains for a last picture of the Evil Dead meeting to regain my interest. At least there would be a good director behind the camera ... Sorry, Bruce, that's not enough for me. Take care.
