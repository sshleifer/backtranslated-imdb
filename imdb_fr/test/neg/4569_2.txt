I'm not usually a fan of high school comedies, they rely a lot on bad taste humor and rarely get away from clich√© stories and characters, and frankly boring dialogue. However, I had my share of guilty pleasures, especially when I was still in high school. Seeing the teacher's figures, so recognizable, being kicked up my buttocks comforts me and occasional laughter could also be the case. These movies only work if at least one of the characters is immediately friendly, this was not the case in "Cheats", especially not the protagonist. Of course, that did not help that the actor in play was one of the most irritating, unskillful, and arrogant kids I've ever seen in a comedy. <br /> <br /> Playing in a comedy, it's no joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery must be perfect or the material wasted. In this case, there were not many good things to start with and the jokes that were half funny were professionally spoiled by the cast. <br /> <br /> This film lasted 3 hours, the director has never heard of stimulation obviously. Stay away from this one, there are many other teen comedies such as 10 things I hate you, Who's Your Daddy and Superbad.
