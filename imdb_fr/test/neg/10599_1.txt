I heard what people were saying, but I ignored them. Being in a hurry at Blockbuster, I took a copy of this movie and ran away. <br /> <br /> After 45 minutes, I fought to stay awake. There are some attempts to keep the movie interesting, but it was just bad. A lawsuit is underway, but it was long and long - the perfect time to prepare a snack. At the end of this movie, I did not care how it ended, I just wanted it to end. Enter and leave my room to check if it was finished. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a clich√© ', the characters and their relationships. The twists of the plot are predictable, as well as the end. The actors made the most of really terrible roles. All I can say is that their clothes were beautiful, but the film was bad.
