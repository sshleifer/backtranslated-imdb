I watched this on cable because I was a big fan of Leelee. Big mistake. What a horrible movie. You do not care at all about the characters in the movie. Chris Klein plays a completely idiot type in the film and steals Josh Hartnett's longtime girlfriend. If the writer knew what he was doing, this film would have followed the tried and true formula and would have made Hartnett a donkey, and Leelee, the girlfriend trapped in a bad relationship, from which she is saved by Klein. But Hartnett is a really cool guy, who shows a lot of emotion and love for Leelee. <br /> <br /> You hate Leelee, because she cheats Hartnett with Klein, who is a fool for everyone in the city trying to help and who is really stuck. <br /> <br /> It's also really campy, and the characters do it all except run in the kitchen, dance and synchronize the lips and use hairbrushes, spoons and fake microphones (although be very close). <br /> <br /> What a horrible horrible movie. You do not even care what happens in the end, because the director never lets you worry about the characters.
