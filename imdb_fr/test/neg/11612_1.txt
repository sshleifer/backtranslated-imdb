The scenario seemed to go well, the actors seemed good, the film should have been good <br /> <br />. But that was not the case - it did not lead us anywhere, the scenes <br /> <br /> are strange. It may be to create something new, to make us think. At least he did: Where is the rest of this movie? For me it was a waste of money, time and talent. Someone may want to check this <br /> <br /> curiosity, to see if they can understand it. Personally, I would not recommend it personally <br /> <br /> to anyone.
