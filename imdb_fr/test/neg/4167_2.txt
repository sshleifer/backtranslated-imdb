I found the code 46 very disappointing. I thought the concept was good and so it had great potential as a film, but I found that it was not effective. Code 46 lacked thought and structure and the scenario was not flowing well. I thought that Tim Robbins' character was not well developed, for example. I thought there should have been more information and thoughts in his family life and not completely ignore them as I thought. When they started breaking code 46, it was suggested not to know that they were genetically linked, but all the technology they had, he took his fingerprint and therefore genetic details when he was investigating the code. fraud. I constantly found myself waiting for something to happen and the plot was developing, yet it never happened. I felt that the film had great intellectually stimulating potential, but it turned out to be the opposite. Code 46 tried to be too intelligent and ended up lacking imagination. I would not recommend this film to anyone, the only good thing about this movie is that it was relatively short.
