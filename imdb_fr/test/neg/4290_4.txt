A respected Western author, Budd Boetticher, is sadly out of place with this restless history of cops and thieves suffering from a profound lack of emotional credibility. Boetticher seems to have given up the rehearsal time and contented himself with the first catch, with Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming making little effort, providing flat and powerless replies. <br /> <br /> Leon "Foggy", a gentle and respectful employee, Poole works as an internal man in a bank job that goes bad and has his wife killed in the process. He escapes from prison and immediately begins to kill the wife of the detective who killed his. Hundreds of cops are mobilized to prevent him from going to the addressee's home that was moved but what did you not know in the last moments of the film, we have Foggy dragging behind the victim (who thought in some so the return home was a smart move) while a cop company was watching and bickering about what to do. Does this sound absurd to you? You should see that. It's all that and more. <br /> <br /> Lucien Ballard's work in the camera does a decent job of bringing suburban darkness, but the editing is devoid of meaning and formless and drains the film of its suspense and rhythm. As Poole, Wendell Corey is the best thing in the film, which manages to arouse great sympathy as he moves from the soft soul to the murderer. These attributes aside, Killer consistently fails in construction and execution, which makes his message clear. Go Western old Budd.
