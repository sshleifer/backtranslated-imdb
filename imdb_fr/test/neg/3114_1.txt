A ridiculous film, a terrible editing work, a deplorable scenario, a ridiculous acting game, a completely incomprehensible story ... <br /> <br /> If God had to decide whether the films should continue to be made, Judging by this one, the global film industry as a whole would be dead ... <br /> <br /> A wonderful film that shows that cinema should not be made by people who think they can make movies . <br /> <br /> I still wonder who are these two gypsy girls who appear in the film for more than half an hour and who are never presented to us ... <br /> <br />
