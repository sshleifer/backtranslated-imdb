I can pretend not to know the cinematography or Mr. Angelopoulos. But I know Greece and I love its people. In July, my 14 year old son and I went to Cappadocia, Turkey, in search of remains of the neighborhood where his great-grandfather Iordanis lived until the great exodus of the Greeks from Anatolia in 1923. Reading of the summary I thought I might be able to learn more about the forced migrations of the modern Greeks. If I did not have a home in Rhodes, if I had not been to Greece 28 times in as many years, did not I know dozens of islands and cities in Greece and if I did not never appreciated the friendship of these people full of drunkenness I could have believed that this lamentation had something to do with modern Greece. As a teacher at a New Jersey State College, let me assure you that I am very familiar with the story of the period covered by the film. Indeed, my wife's uncle was murdered by the communists during the communist conquest of power. My mother-in-law lived the Italian invasion and the German occupation ... hardly. These characters on the screen speak Greek, they listen to Greek music but who are they? No, they are not even vaguely Greek. Of course, they are not people at all but simply allegories. This is what the artist invents when life is not quite up to her perception of what she was or should have been. All of them represent an aspect of post-World War I Greece as larger external forces doomed to a fate they did not deserve. As we joked at the end of the 70s in America: "The revolution did not take place". For an ideologue / artist, it's not a joke. It's actually a motive for us to suffer two and a half hours of torment. And all because the different powers (the monologue of "guards" in uniforms of different colors of Eleni) did not allow the generation from the "aristocrats" of 1919 (Spyros) to follow the call of the peace and freedom (the music of Nikos and his friends). fellow musicians, that is to say the Movement, the cause). This dark and surreal revisionism undermines the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to maintain their thirst for life through the tragedies of the twentieth century, to allow more than its Balkan neighbors to have become so politically advanced and integrated into the world .
