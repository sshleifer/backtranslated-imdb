I meant it was really useless and needed a big facelift, it might have been passable, but for the most part, I did not like it. It was not like other children's movies. of those movies that wanted the parents (who grew up watching the cartoon) come with their kids to see them, I'm neither, so the film did not catch me less of the world. I do not think Jason Lee was the right voice for Underdog, it made him look sloppy and really unintelligent.Then, it was really predictable, which made you tired and crazy. Humor was really what drove me crazy, c The only thing that bothered me the most was to say how much anything that came out of Underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude.The acting was passable but required a slight If you have children, they could enjoy it, but if all means see it you might like it unlike me. 3.4 out of 10 stars
