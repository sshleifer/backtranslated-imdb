For those who could send me nasty emails, push them. There is a trend in Hollywood where those who create excessively bizarre movies are instantly insensitive to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Of course, Zach Braff, star of a rather overestimated sitcom, surprises people with a certain talent behind the camera, but that does not justify the kind of praise a film like this has received. The story is often too thin and superficial to give a real idea. People have compared this film to The Graduate, but these types of people are the ones who are trying to over-sell independent cinema. Independent films are subject to the same mentality as studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there were many more bad independent movies than good movies. Garden State is not atrocious, but it's not great. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie is too fast, resulting in a fairly fast reappearance of Large in his old life. After ten years, people tend to act as if they never left. Where is clumsiness? Of course, the situation is still solved by a scene of fast drug tasting (which, I would say, has been described with enough precision). The film seems to present many emotional inequalities, giving us the idea that the emotion will manifest later in a deeper and more thoughtful way. However, he fails to keep his promises on these fronts, leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments was quickly resolved (such as Peter Saarsgard's looting tendencies). It was not completely abominable, but maybe we should stop praising the movie.
