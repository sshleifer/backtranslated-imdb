From time to time, I will watch a movie that will surprise me completely. An entertainment that comes out of nowhere. A pure pleasure from the beginning to the end. Well, when a stranger calls is not this movie. This is an amazing and stupid and far-fetched remake of the much better classic of the 1979 horror camp. Our main heroine, Jill, is forced to babysit after spending all her minutes on the phone and is harassed by the phone calls from a mysterious caller. All the clich√©s of the world are used here, stupid cat-jumping out of a hidden place to the car that does not start at the killer can be anywhere, anytime. This movie is bad ... not even bad in a "so bad it's good way" more in "such a bad it's annoying way". Ignore this monstrous movie and save your movie for something else. You'll thank me later, trust me. Grade: D-
