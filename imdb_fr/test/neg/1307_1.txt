I usually like these dumb movies / without brain activity, but it was too stupid. There were too many clich√©s and the plot did not really make sense. There were many loose ends and the end was extremely poor and abrupt. We did not even see much if the big master plan worked. We have only seen too much the main character sobbing on his dead farther away, the teacher (who died because of stupidity (see below)). <br /> <br /> A scene particularly annoyed me. Why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went manually to the dam? And if they only had oxygen tanks containing 5 minutes of oxygen, why did not they bring two or three? So he would have survived ?? it was really stupid. The movie is full of such stupid things. I can not recommend it at all.
