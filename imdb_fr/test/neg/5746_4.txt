Dude, this movie has stunk! It is obvious that this film helped eliminate the need for Hollywood to produce tired suites to please the masses. First of all, the film came out too quickly and, secondly, it did not have the same hipness that made the original film so successful. No new land was found, and it turned into a rather mundane effort.
