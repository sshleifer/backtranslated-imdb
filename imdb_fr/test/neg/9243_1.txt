Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this movie. If it was to turn my good day into a night of troubling memories, I guess he was successful. <br /> <br /> I know that big questions have been raised in this film, namely: who are we really, what are we? here for, is there really a God. All the right questions, but I really do not think it's funny if you have the questions facing such a tragedy. I am all for real life being portrayed but go. It's never funny when a woman is raped, someone kills herself (and her family and friends find the body) and people die for unexplained and unnecessary reasons. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is the location was filmed. There are many beautiful places. <br /> <br /> I'm not a film student or even know everything about it. I admit it, but I know that when I leave the theater with a feeling of disgust, then it was not a movie I would recommend to anyone.
