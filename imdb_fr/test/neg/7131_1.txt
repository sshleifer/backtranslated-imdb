It was a loss of 9 dollars. the movie was terrible. all the "scary" parts were useless and sadly repetitive. Apparently, all tense parts could be completely predicted and did not seem to hold the public's attention. In addition, the plot did not progress at all during the entire movie and it was only a big installment for the grudge 3. When it seemed like the movie was about to make a big step forward in the plot, a useless scene. these filmmakers must follow the example of Hitchcock: each scene has a point. In principle, 90% of the scenes in this film could have been left without changing the plot. Final Opinion: Do not waste your time, your energy and your money !!!
