1st seen 29/07/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): Ted Turner's animated group, animated by a fast and frenetic animation movement, plays a lot like TV cartoons and lets Much to be desired in the field of friendly characters, but definitely ugly extremely incompatible. I do not even know why children would like this film because there are so many references to old movie stars that children know very little or nothing at all. Effort mediocre at best despite the raves on the box comparing it to the efforts of Disney like Aladdin and Lion King. Do not let this fool you - there is no comparison in history or quality.
