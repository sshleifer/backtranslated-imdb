At the beginning of this film, I doubted it would be a science-fiction movie typical of B. But as I progressed, I began to get interested and I finished everything. The premise is interesting, original and has the makings of making a classic. Alas, it has rather resulted in a mediocre film, made according to the usual factors that turn a good movie into a bad movie (bad game, low budget, etc.). I'm interested to see how it would be if it were redone with good actors and a big Hollywood budget.
