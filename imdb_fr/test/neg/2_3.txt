It seems that since 1982, we get every two or three years a film that wants to be "The next officer and a gentleman". There is still no film that lives up to this claim and this film is no different. <br /> <br /> We get the usurped scenes of OAAG ("I want you DOR", the instructor gives the The character of Richard Gere has overdosed exercises in the hope that he will stop , Gere's character returns to the girl, Gere's character realizes that the instructor is awesome, etc.) and this film is as predictable as the rising sun to the east is horribly miscast on top. Costner plays his usual "wise teacher" character, the only character he can play, and you really have an idea of ​​his limited acting abilities. Kutcher is terrible in the character of Richard Gere, just with actor skills barely a notch above Keanu Reeves. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this follower of the OAAG is that the two main characters are so incredibly one-dimensional. do you care less and when the character of Kutcher will turn around (as Gere did in OAAG), you just have to go "so what?" The film leaves no plot and never seems to finish as if to say "oh, wait, we forgot to close the story of his girlfriend, or what happens after the story of his graduation, or the other six points of the plot in the film ... "What's more disconcerting is the good" critics "I see here, and the opinions of the general public continue to surprise me.
