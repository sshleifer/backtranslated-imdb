I can only think of one reason why this film was published. Enjoy the fame of Guy Pearce. This film has no merit and unnecessarily destroys the memory of Errol Flynn. The homosexual encounter was pure speculation. The disdain shown for Flynn in this film is palpable. An easy way to slander an actor who died years ago. Horrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Do not waste your time on this trash. Look at my mean ways if you want to know more about this beautiful actor or read his autobiography. This film is not the way.
