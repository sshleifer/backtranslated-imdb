I bought this DVD movie entitled Evil Never Dorme, it is featured on the cover of Carrie Ann Moss, but it plays a character so minor that I did not really notice in the film. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to consider this one of the worst purchases of my life. The dialogue was overheated and the delivery in wood, I found the acting game to be disconnected from the plot. Graham's performance seemed to me like someone wondering if she was leaving gas at home. <br /> <br /> In summary, my wife and I found this film painful to watch, and it's not a valuable addition to my collection, look at your own peril, but spend 90 minutes to having fingernails drawn would probably be a better way to spend your time.
