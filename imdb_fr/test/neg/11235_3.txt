So, when Bob and Marion Boxletter see a guy in a hotel, Marion thinks it's his brother Brian, who's been lost for so long, but when she approaches him, he seems to be someone else with exactly the same face. Marion manages to get her fingerprints and takes them to the police. When the identity is confirmed, it is actually her brother Brian, she and Bob, who leave for New York after finding his location. They grabbed Brian, but he still does not know what they're talking about, but the whole couple really wants to know where Brian, his son, Joey, aged 8 to 9 is ... and even when they see Joey, he does not do not know either. The plot thickens and they find themselves one day thinking they are somebody else too. Experiments made on people only to make perfect assassins, but the question of why they would embarrass themselves to put Bob and Marion in the same building of each other is beyond me. Personally, Gregory Harrison played his two roles very well, but I have no idea what was wrong with the other actors, they looked bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a little suspense yes but that's it.
