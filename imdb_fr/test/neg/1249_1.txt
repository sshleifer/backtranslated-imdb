It may be the worst movie I have ever seen. What a waste of Michael Imperioli's obvious talent. Disgusting film from beginning to end. All I can say is that this director is not an author. We never get into the game, the character's head, the incredible talent with the numbers that the real Stuey had. The coke scene is hard enough to throw your shoe on the board. It may be a fantastic scene if it was shot for movies and not for the stage. the drama goes far in the background. The scene where he wins the big league is just ridiculous. This should be shown in Movie 101 - What not to do to take pictures.
