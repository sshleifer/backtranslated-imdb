Savage Guns (video title) is a Western spaghetti barrel background in which the survivor of a massacre hunts the bandits who killed his brother and left him for dead, catching them in a town controlled by their crooked leader. <br /> <br /> Despite a lot of violence, it manages to be both dull and colorless, with bad characterizations and almost no imagination or humor. <br /> <br /> The lead actor Robert Woods lives up to his name with wood and incharismatic performance that generates no heat or sympathy whatsoever. In other words, the viewer never really rooted for him despite being the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The worst scene (in my opinion) is the boring scene of a dance hall where a woman sings in a heavy and awful way. Unsexy German accent. It was the worst scene of Blazing Saddles and the worst here!
