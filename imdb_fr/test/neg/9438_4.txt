I know this movie was shown on local TV when I was a kid, but I do not remember if I watched it or not. seeing it now, considering how forgettable it is, I still do not know ?? so I counted it as a first look! The main character was filmed in several films, a creation of the visionary French author Jules Verne; These include: 20,000 LIGUES UNDER THE SEA (1954, with James Mason in the role), MASTER OF THE WORLD (1961, Vincent Price), MYSTERIOUS ISLAND (1961, Herbert Lom), CAPTAIN NEMO AND THE CITY OF SUBMARINE (1969, Robert Ryan) and CAPITAL NEMO'S MYSTRY ISLAND (1973, Omar Sharif). <br /> <br /> This version is performed by the Oscar winner Jose 'Ferrer. However, even if the premise itself is not half bad ?? awakened from the suspended animation in his submarine, "The Nautilus", and finding himself in modern times, Nemo uses all his ingenuity to help the US Navy defeat the megalomaniac scientist Burgess Meredith ?? it is also easy to see his most infantile adventure! For example: five seconds after the beginning of the film, Meredith's assistant? to put on a mask of steel ?? that "the world will be ours!"); the zealous gesticulations of the vest similarly decorated in the same way are equally hilarious. It's up to him to set fire to the teacher's important "Delta Beam" - and what about those android-like henchmen aboard Meredith's ship who never seem to do much? ! <br /> <br /> Ferrer manages to maintain his dignity, but Meredith is embarrassing (in what is practically a retreading of his description of Penguin from the TV series and BATMAN film of the 1960s) where the budget was so tight ?? Mostly invested in bland production design and shoddy special effects, no doubt, and both obviously influenced by STAR WARS (1977) ?? that, apparently, they could not even afford a decent suit (he looks really stupid to wear a tie in a submarine)! The secondary cast includes Mel Ferrer (played by Saboteur in the role of Joan Fontaine from another Irwin Allen production, VOYAGE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA [1961]], and engages in a swashbuckling routine with his namesake in the engine room of "The Nautilus"), Lynda Day George (unsurprisingly, she is the only female character of the moment) and Horst Buchholz (as king of Atlantis, whatever the reason, Nemo is obsessed with the location of the famous lost continent). <br /> <br /> By the way, after being reduced to a three-part mini-series for a theatrical exhibition, the film seems obviously fragmented ?? although we can still discern where one episode ends and another begins.
