Corben Bernsen made a horror movie about the release of a chemical weapon at a sporting event and turning everyone into crazy monsters. We watch the staff of a radio station write reports. <br /> <br /> This has moments, but most of the time, it looks like a horror movie for life with breasts and blood. There are some great ideas here, but they just do not work. In fact, the ideas of the film are better handled in a film called Pontypool, which works practically and creates tensions by showing us nothing. It shows us stuff and it just seems cheap. If I had the choice, I would look at Pontypool again rather than watching this movie again.
