I saw this film two weeks before going on a snowboarding holiday, so for me, it really was to put me in mind for my holidays. The film boasts some soft skills in snowboarding, throughout the movies in the action scenes. These moments were great, like watching extreme sports channels. Unfortunately, the story was honestly horrible, as the acting of the actors generally went well, with a relatively small cast. This film is apparently a comedy, at least it tries to be comic, but it looks like the comedy and the screenplay were written by a teenager. The story lacks depth and purpose and the comedy has a hard time being anything but a little sneer a few times during the movie. It may be worth renting just to see the snowboarding action, but again, there are many films entirely devoted to snowboarding and not involving a badly written story by the UN.
