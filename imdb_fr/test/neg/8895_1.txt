I was a fan of Buffy and I hoped it would end well when Angel has only one season left. But when the end approached, I was moved to see that. And what did we have? This episode titled "NOT FADE AWAY" was the last. <br /> <br /> This episode really disappointed me. This is absolutely the worst way in this series. Why could not he have a happy ending? Why are some of the main characters dead? Why did not Angel become a human and was he reunited with Buffy again? Angel must sign this bloddy piece of paper that he will never become a human. What a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> And the end is a cliffhanger. <br /> <br /> What could have been worse? The Buffyshow started so well, like Angel, but the universe of the hole ended so miserable. Someone should cast a spell on the man who wrote the script for this episode and make sure he gets lost in hell. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about watching this, it's too serious, it hurts! Totally 1 out of 10
