First, the twins are exactly the same. there is no one who is a girl and a tomboy (Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate though) and their boyfriends are not even French, so it's a shame because they pretend accents. Lamo It's not so bad, not their best. I'm a big fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley, do not get me wrong. the scenario is OK and it's funny to watch. it's not the type of movie you would watch again and again. But hey, when they made this movie, they were still new overall, making their own movie. The girls also act as if they were over 13, but if you're a young spectator, it's a good movie. It's not good if you're over 13, unless you're a parent watching a movie with your kids. So it's good. Good luck MK + A with your future movies!
