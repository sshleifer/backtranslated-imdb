After reading the reviews, I am so relieved to know that I am not the only person who has been very disappointed with this movie! I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, I have read ALL of his books, most of them more than once. Of course, I loved the notebook and a way forward ... I have not seen Message in a Bottle or Nights in Rodanthe yet, so I can not say more about these ... <br> /> <br /> But I did it. Go see dear John last weekend and I was terribly upset! The movie was not good at all! When we watched the film alone and did not think about the book at all, it was always a terrible film. This film did not give me the breadth and depth of the emotions that other films I enjoyed, including The Notebook, pleased me. I did not smile and laugh and cry and I was worried and scared ... never! From the beginning, all I noticed was how they changed everything! The only thing about this movie that looks like the book is that there's a guy named in the John army and a girl named Savannah who is not ... the part about the fact that his father is obsessed with the coins is pretty much the only other part that went with the book. Everything else was totally off !!!! First, in the book, Allen was Tim's little brother, NOT his son! WHY they had to change that, I do not understand. It made a lot more sense to understand how it was in the book when Tim was just a little older than Savannah and growing up together. Allen was Savannah's inspiration for wanting to work with horses and autistic children ... that did not happen in the movie ... and ... in the book, they spent a lot more time together than these two weeks initial then 1 night ... why did they leave these moments out ??? I could go on and on, but then I would run out of space! Basically, if you're a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, do not waste your time or money in this movie ... just read the book ... because it's terrible and the book is like nothing!
