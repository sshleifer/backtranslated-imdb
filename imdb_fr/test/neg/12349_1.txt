All the professional commentaries on this film claim that the film is balanced. This is their main justification for giving the movie a high rate. But a film is not balanced when the principal author analyzed is given the last world in each subject. The director herself admitted it during the first screening of the San Francisco film festival. She justified it by saying that she could not lose her chance to access Fujimori. This may be true, but by showing as many views of Fujimori, the film becomes clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced. I challenge other commentators to prove that this is false Tip 1: Claim that Harvard professors, intellectuals, and Latin American diplomats agree that it does not help your argument (use logic). Tip 2: disagreeing with the director does not help your argument either (the director says that she thinks Fujimori is charismatic and patriotic and therefore portrayed her this way)
