Before seeing this masterpiece, I would have never imagined that a devastating and hideous contagious virus could be defeated by the use of Lutheran prayers ... and "erbs". Ralf Moeller's performance is gigantic; incandescent realism. I was so inspired that I would go directly to Zambibwia tomorrow to prepare the pesto and serve the prosperity of the third world. God bless this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'm going to have to watch Troll 2 and Anus Magillicutty just to believe it's possible to put together a much more clichéd dialogue. He is so tortured that it would be better to go through a cup of cheese. The only subtlety that he manages to achieve lies in his barely disguised racism, as the poor islanders turn to an ineffective mute collective prayer that ends in nothing until the übermenschlich, a Teutonic hero in the linen shroud. Moeller, can transmit a blood sample on which Yankee scientists whistle can get to work and save the unfortunate natives. This film is nil.
