Another fiction film for teenagers based mainly on effects of synthesis, an industrial soundtrack and medieval images. It is unfortunate that the legend of Beowulf is used so uninspired. I am a fan of Christopher Lambert, but I have to admit that he is getting worse as an actor and that his films too. Rent it if you are a teenager only.
