After spending 2 hours of my life watching this movie on TV late at night, I went back and re-read some of the IMDb content to remind myself why I had watched it at first. In hindsight, the only thing I can think of is that I like the genre generally. But this movie was a total loss of effort. It fails at all levels, and seeing that it is described on IMDb as a comedy really leaves me helpless. I do not remember more than a couple of laughs. There are more laughs in all the episodes of Law and Order than in The Last Man. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Too many interactions between the characters just did not seem to me to be well-founded, and therefore very improbable / unbelievable. <br /> <br /> If that had not been the case for almost free bikini shots, well, what can I say? Avoid this movie like the plague. Or tap it and move quickly to the bikini pictures. Do not even spend $ 1 to rent it.
