I was surprised after watching this piece of shit, if you saw an episode of TOM and JERRY in which Jerry poured him a liquid and becomes invisible as you risk seeing the same cartoons with besides EROTIC surmounting a man becoming invisible and doing S * i * is the conclusion of the film. to involve too much sex in a movie on the subject of cartoons does not increase its value :(, and above all, I was surprised when the same cartoon end was used to display the Mr.Invisible and that it was really awful, I must say, Mr.Invisible flour drops becomes visible "Look ZACK and MIRI make a porn" I bet you will not be bored, <br /> <br /> 1/10 of me
