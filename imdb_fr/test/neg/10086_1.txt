Tyra Banks must teach these girls that it is not enough to be beautiful outside. The interior also counts for something. Most of the winners from previous years looked semi-decent, but they are terribly cruel and create problems for other girls. I see Tyra less involved with girls every season. Mr. Jay Manuel is the only thing worth watching Top Model. Tyra recently had a candidate who was a pre-operative transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage him. It was obvious that she had doubts about her original anatomy, which was reflected in her feminine appearance. Tyra should have given advice or maybe she would have sent Trannie resident, Mrs. Jay, to help the girl. Instead, the candidate received severe criticism and not enough positive reviews. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first 3 seasons. There is a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons on DVD and Top Model only has one on DVD. It's called taste. Top Model is in serious need of reorganizing a little more humanity.
