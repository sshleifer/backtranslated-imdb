An inexpensive crime thriller and policeman, made bearable by a few strands of humor, the beautiful chemistry that separates them and especially by the satisfactory turn of James Remar as narcissistic villain, psychopath (and naturally indestructible). Obviously, a low-quality image, both visual and dramatic, with a Burt rather resigned, but not unassailable. (**)
