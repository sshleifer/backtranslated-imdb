Although there is very little intrigue and all that exists is only improvisation, it was a good start for a new director without any financial reserve and a judicious choice of Andy Warhol to make his productions cimetas more marketable and friendly. In any case, this story of a street prostitute relies too much on showing Joe a completely naked man (almost all the time!). And the creative use of a flashy edition really fades after the hundredth time and the interruption of the dialogue becomes really boring halfway. It would have been much more entertaining or even dramatic if they had made a documentary of the daily life of a real prostitute or a scammer, instead of letting the actors compose a non-sensual conspiracy and a dialogue of their own.
