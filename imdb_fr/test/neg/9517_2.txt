I saw this film without knowing too much. The split screen device was immediately irritating and things did not improve once the title sequence was over. The plot, the characters and the dialogues were extremely clich√©s - a poor guy from an abusive family is thrown out of his home, wants out of his "fate", reinvents himself, changes his voice, dresses others , is adopted by a gay A man he forgets to take to be part of an international set of British aristocrats addicts. <br /> <br /> The estate of Patricia Highsmith (the talented mr ripley) should sue the authors of this film. For me, the triple screen, associated with a duration greater than 120 minutes, highlights the almost inexistent installation. You can not decide which image is the most powerful, why not show three and hope that you will get the right answer with one of them. This gadget removed any link or interest I had with any of the characters. An important dialogue was repeated 3 times on each screen, as if to say: "It's an important / moving / profound moment, all right!" <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. <br /> <br />
