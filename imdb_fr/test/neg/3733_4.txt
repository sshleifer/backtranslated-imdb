It's not even been two years since I saw this movie and yet, I hardly remember anything about this movie. Needless to say, I found it VERY forgettable. From what I remember, nothing is particularly good. A talented cast is wasted in what I suppose was supposed to be a dark comedy, but if it does, it fails miserably. At best, this film is slightly interesting. At worst, the seemingly ubiquitous skies are more interesting than the plot. If you like watching movies where it always seems wet and cold, then I guess you might find something that appeals to this picture. Just try to ignore what's going on because it's barely visible.
