Schoolies is a useless exercise ... Go to Gold Coast, drink and make love. Desirable ambitions perhaps, but not very intellectual. The plot is as simple as a few sentences assigned to each character and nobody is helped by the clich√©s distributed here. <br /> <br /> Something that would help is the casting. Everyone looks too old. These characters are supposed to be innocent people who start alone in adulthood, but they all look too old to be credible in the role. <br /> <br />
