I watched this movie only because it was supposed to be another David Dhawan artist. <br /> <br /> Bad Bad comeback from David Dhawan.He has already done a lot of fun movies that made no sense, but none of them was a shit bag !! Donno why the actors agree to make a film like this. <br /> <br /> There was not the least bit of practice in this movie.The film is below Bollywood standard and potential a. <br /> <br /> The only thing to watch in this movie was Katrina but we do not need to watch a movie like this to see it! As a remake of the Hollywood movie Hitch, it is clear that Bollywood filmmakers can not even make an appropriate remake. I consider it the worst movie I have ever seen. Horrible 1/10
