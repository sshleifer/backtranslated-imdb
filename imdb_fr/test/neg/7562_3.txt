I have seen the film many times, and every time I am more and more disappointed, which is a shame because the films of EX YU are generally very good. The shame is that Holiwood tried to film the place and people that he has no idea. Myself from the Balkans (Macedonia), this film was disappointing. Quite simply, the Bosnian characters are not really understood and are not really described. To understand the mentality of an EX YU person, you must know its origin, its way of life, which makes it cry and laugh. And the director of the film did not take this as a guide. When we shoot movies (EX YU), many symbols are embedded in them, which makes the characters recognizable and likeable, and represents mostly the truth (if based on a true story). Movies like "Pritty village, pretty flame", "Tito and me", "Underground", "No mans land", "Before the rain", "Black cat, white cat", "Otac na sluzbenom putu", (When his father was on a business trip), "Ko to tamo peva" (Who sings there?) Rare is the masterpiece of Balkan cinematography, and nothing can be compared to him. Not the half-cooked story of Holiwood Studio. As someone from the panel mentioned I'm sorry, but when the film is shot, it's not just for American viewers, but also for the rest of the world, and some of them live in the Balkans and in Sarajevo. At the wound, half of the things are shot in Bitola, Macedonia where I come from. Imagen, my shock when I saw the Broad st of Bitola at the opening In the scene of the film, when the bride is pulled from the sniper. And what is the insertion of true images of the news in the film? Anyway, very disappointing because the truth is far from the film. Too bad no one has ever seen the real people about how to live in Sarajevo under fire, before shooting the film. the book is one thing and the real life is another, and this film drops both.
