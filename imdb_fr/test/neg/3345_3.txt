I hope that Depardieu was able to finish his book and see it become a resounding success. At least he would have found something. <br /> <br /> The film seemed useless, disjointed and very elegant, like some other recent French films. Do not hit him. The most recent American films are useless and disconnected and have no style. We should be grateful, I suppose, for the photography evoking a European city in the heart of a leeward continental winter, and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> But it is possible to be too much of a good thing. Golubeva stumbles by the sea in the middle of the icy night, pursuing with a keen focus on dreams and the like. (There are some dream sequences that include things like swimming in a river of blood.You'll love it if you're Vlad the Impaler.) A lot of people are dying. Catherine Deneuve dies in a motorcycle suicide. I do not know why. Golubeva's daughter is dying too, and I do not know why she is dying either. She is slapped in the face, falls on the sidewalk and dies. <br /> <br /> There would also be an explicit sex scene. I will have to take my word for it because, although photographed in style, it is photographed with style in complete darkness. Do not worry about children who are in shock. In any case, they will probably be asleep at this time. <br /> <br /> Depardieu is not a bad actor. As we see him deteriorate from a handsome, well-groomed young man - good, beautiful except that his nose does not seem to be able to get out of his way - to a lame, deadly and hairy physical wreck, we are sorry for the guy. Golubeva has a pretty face, with enormous half-eyelids and wide cheeks, like a doll. His next film should be a remake of "I walked with a zombie" from Lewton. Then there is this mysterious guy who runs a group. I guess it's a group. As far as I know, the group is composed of a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing the electric guitar. All viewers will find the resulting sound interesting, but non-cultured listeners who adhere to "easy listening" may not enjoy it. If you do not like music, there is an advantage to pay because the sinister composer and leader is having a headache with Depardieu's cane. <br /> <br /> I must say that it was not worth lingering. (And it's also a long time.) Sometimes it was as if you were waiting in your car at a railway crossing while a long freight train was stamping slowly, sometimes stopping completely. I wish he had some jokes.
