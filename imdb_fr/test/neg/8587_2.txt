This film about the noisy and dizzying football of director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well, everyone except William H. Macy, who could have attacked the role played by Mr. Stone, the doctors of the team or the "fruitcake" selling cereals. If you're a fan of dirty mouths, you'll find funky, thirsty, dragging, profanity phrases that you can try on two-faced friends and way-ward followers. The film is sometimes a good party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; it even features scenes of MTV style video clips. <br /> <br /> ** Every Sunday (12/16/99) Oliver Stone ~ Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, Jamie Foxx
