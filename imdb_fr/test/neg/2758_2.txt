A dull morality on a high school student who is pretty much the nerd now stereotyped. He is smart but has no friends, no social skills and a lazy loser of a father who borrows him money. A pretty girl hits him (he should have known she wanted something - he's supposed to be smart, right?). She manipulates the poor, desperate fool to write her text on Shakespeare, which the teacher immediately knows she could not have written. He loses the girl (not that he has ever really had) from the confidence of his teacher and his university scholarship, all in one fell swoop. <br /> <br /> Marv is so stupid and desperate in love that he decides to rob heroin traffickers who put everything in the warehouse where he works. So maybe the little trash slut will be impressed and want to marry her. Sad, really sad. Marv is such a pathetic dope (and rather bewildering, for a so-called intelligent guy - I mean, trying to steal drug dealers - was this kid screwed up?) That you stop complaining and to receive the terrible desire to hit him instead, in the ass. <br /> <br /> The girl, of course, tells her boyfriend about the robbery she's boasting about, and asks him and his friends to steal money from Marv and his company. They try to do it and manage to shoot several people. The cops arrive at the same time and the fool Marv is trained, a total shame forever. I know this thing was meant to encourage teenagers to behave by showing them the consequences of bad behavior, but all that that really illustrates is the consequences of stupid behavior. What is the premature end of your film career, of course. Bye, Marv, we never really knew you. And thank god for that.
