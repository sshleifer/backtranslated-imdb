Another movie with a star of the fight. So far, I have noticed that wrestlers can not play on a movie screen. This film is no exception. <br /> <br /> The action is terrible. That makes you laugh at what they say, and they can not be serious, they try to act in fear but they fail and look stupid. The acting is horrible, maybe from the wrong director. <br /> <br /> The plot was stupid ... Some people are placed in a hotel because they are criminals and they are killed at random. The movie is stupid from the beginning, making it one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only thing to think and that's why I give it a 3 and not a 1, it's because of the way Jacob Goodnight dies. The bar in the head and the stories of him diving were awesome. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is really horrible and you certainly should not waste your time with it.
