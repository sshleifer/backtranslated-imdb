Another horrible movie about hockey. If I had never watched hockey and seen the Hollywood version, I would hate the game. This film does not make Canada look so good. I can laugh at it and not take it too seriously. Nevertheless, this film is awful, with everything you can put in a film from the 80s. In the end, do not even watch it on TV. 4/10
