I can not forget how lazy the director is with this movie. Instead of creating scenes in a creative way, he relies on old boring zombies. <br /> <br /> Where the two unarmed protagonists have to go down the college steps into the van, he surrounds them with zombies but none of the protagonists is bitten. It can not be bothered to lead a decent fight scene, so we see the tracks spinning down the stairs. <br /> <br /> Sometimes zombies drink and others run like the wind. It's really convenient for the director, because he can install everything without worry of continuity in the behavior of zombies. <br /> <br /> With careful planning and a lot more inspiration, this film could have been so much better.
