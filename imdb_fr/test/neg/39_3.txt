It's a difficult film to evaluate. Although he really deserves his 3 (or maybe even two), for an Al Adamson film, it's exceptional - and practically the best of Adamson. Indeed, unlike many of Adamson's films, NURSE SHERRI sometimes seems almost competent. But, being an Adamson movie, you know that sooner or later, sadness MUST stand up! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a strange cult leader from a huge congregation (six) who is trying to resurrect a dead man who looks like being made of blue cheese. However, in the process, the cult guy has a heart attack and goes to the hospital. He apparently dies, but it also seems that many scenes of this hospital are missing and some appear much later in the film. In other words, when you see the movie, he seems to have healed - only to learn later that he was dead. Because the guy is the b.f.f. of Satan, however, his perverse soul can not die and he both haunts one of his henchmen and owns Nurse Sherri. <br /> <br /> Now, Sherri is obviously a very disturbed woman - demonic possession or not. Sometimes she acts like a zombie and sometimes she is violently homicidal. So I ask ... "why did not his boyfriend (a doctor) think it was, maybe, problematic ?!" In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he does not succeed in getting an exorcist or trapping him! Oh, and talking about crazy ... this movie is not the tetan sex defeated her title and the posters would indicate it. Although there are some naked breasts here and there, they are not relevant to the plot and are seen only very briefly (about 1/2 second) in all but one scene. So, if you're a pervert, this movie is not for you - although a few places in the movie (like the nurse undressing for a patient) give the impression that the movie MAY be designed for time. porn movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a bad movie buff, you will have enough to open your appetite. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many players to deliver lines that do not look like zombies - and I'm not even talking about Sherri. One of the final scenes is particularly remarkable. I have never seen or heard play and dialogue in a scalded way in my life. And that includes Ed Wood's movies! There are also a few less expensive touches, such as the bad animation of the "green thing", the doctor finding a nurse murdered and continuing his investigation in a house where the walls are covered with blood (I would look for a cop ... better again, an army of cops). <br /> <br /> So, despite these problems, why do I think it's good for an Adamson movie? Well, the story is not so bad and he was very good at creating tension. Many false alarms quickly made my heart beat. In addition, the car accident, although irrelevant, went well and was a pretty big budget for Adamson. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a good movie and most people would be bored watching them. However, fans of Adamson or foolish films will love it - it offers some entertainment in a nerdy way that will provide some laughter.
