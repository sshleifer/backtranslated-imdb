Ho humm - - - Nothing more. If you're a long time fan of Rush, you know what this video contains: hateful songs from the past, the "BIG 3s" of the 80s and their "ultimate" efforts to stay contemporary. They manage to make fun of themselves by beating critics to the elbow by posing as "dinosaurs". Unfortunately, they can not protect themselves from embarrassment. The close-ups of their faces only add to the fact that these guys were. <br /> <br /> If you follow (as far as you can bear) the band for a few decades from the 70s, then you know there is no new material here. Even old, still the same OLD: 1) Neil avoids the press, 2) not really backstage (Geddy loses his shoes ?! Give me a break! Even HE thinks it's absurd!) 3) No new ideas . <BR /> <br /> A better video would have been to show the configuration of the CREW for 3 or 4 hours ?? just let the camera work. And stop changing camera angles every 2 seconds! I understand that the director wants to try to do something artist. But then, offer a full concert version of 2 or 3 shots that the viewer can choose. We know what the group looks like? Let's see what we REALLY want to see. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a big favor: RENT this movie first.
