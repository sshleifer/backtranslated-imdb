'Take Fame' and 'You Have Got Served' and grossly scramble them together and what do you have? This God movie made to measure for dull and normal teenagers. The plot follows very closely "You have been served". Three Afro-teenagers from the ghetto, located this time in Baltimore, John Water District, not far from the Peckers' home, spend their time performing poorly in school and dancing in decrepit century-old buildings with hoochy mamas. To finance their expensive tastes of baggy hip-hop clothes, they stole cars and delivered them to the local tobacco store - not unlike John (Tony Manaro) Travolta who worked at a paint store in Brooklyn to buy his disco clothes in polyester. <Br/> <br /> Tyler Gage, one of the three black musketeers, gets caught up in the local Fame high school and is forced to do some cleaning. He meets Nora Clark, a 26-year-old white student, and discovers he is American-Irish, much to the chagrin of his black friends Mac and Skinny. <br /> <br /> As in "You have been served" "The crime does not pay and Skinny, the youngest member of the threesome gets shot by a Bad Bad Leroy Brown guy - but that does not stop the music - and its breathtaking finale.
