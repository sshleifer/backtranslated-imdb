this movie was really bad. It has this quality that many independent films have: moments of humor filled with long, completely boring spaces. Any fan of BAM magera will love this movie, but this is the only person who will see it again. Someone gave me this movie to watch knowing that I am a fan of Jackass and a fan of Viva la bam, before the scripted nature of this show is thinner. To explain why this movie does not work, I just have to say that the premise itself is revealed <br /> <br /> as a guy who lives with a girl who is horrible to him. And just about all the movie, you have this guy Ryan Dunn who moans and Bam magera who hops like a merry doer of nonsense. Dicamillo's performance is odd at best. It's a small humorous and humorous French-Canadian accent that is largely due to the extent of its performance (basically, it's funny for 5 minutes, then it looks like "ok, we're pretending we're already pretty stranger ") <br /> <br /> Maybe It would work if they bet, but all they managed to do was make a movie with an IQ of 0. I like it Toilet humor as much as the next guy, but it's not even serious, it's just stupid. It's like the only humor to get from this film is completely inside and the public, even the most savvy of Magera and his company, is excluded from the joke. <br /> <br /> The next time we give Magera a bag full of money, let's hope it does not blow on a lousy animal project
