Much has been said about the theft of documents from other comics by Carlos Mencia (Mr. Holness, excuse me). Heck, even before Joe Rogan had an explosion with him on stage, I knew that Carlos Mensteala was slipping images of Cosby and Kinison and a host of others. <br /> <br /> To aggravate the crime of his theft, he repeated these comic geniuses joke BADLY. <br /> <br /> And it's a crime he continues to perpetuate in this series. I'm sure the writers in the series have to share the blame - it must be hard to write jokes day after day ... but that's why people are so well paid they do it! These series writers need to resume their burgers or anything before they embarked on an intellectual flight career. <br /> <br /> Not to say that he steals all his equipment. You can tell when he himself crafted a joke when what you look at transcends what is simply horrible and goes straight into the terrific horror territory. <br /> <br /> Because he likes to call people b *** h on his show, children of ten years call him a genius. They'll grow up one day, Carlos, and when they do, you'll dry up and leave.
