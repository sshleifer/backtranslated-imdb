Hey, do you remember when Hal Hartley was brilliant? What time was it? I would say that the Book of Life was when things really started to deteriorate, but I will say that at least he went up by this one. A movie that looks like it was filmed on someone's mobile phone would not have to be a bad thing if it had an interesting history and dialogue, but alas, those are missing, as well as the sober and unusual dialogue of Hartley. In their place, there is a tedious exhibition on the themes of the end of Christian times and a trivial story of a modern Jesus struggling with a dilemma, presented in a modern world where everyone tries to be fashionable, where everyone looks like someone from a Hal Hartley movie. Even if it takes a little in its second half, it is never pleasant, nor particularly reasonable. What happened to you, Hartley?
