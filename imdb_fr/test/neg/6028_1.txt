I was also the wife of a violent husband, although in my situation the attacks were psychological and not physical. He presented a very respectable, responsible and generous personality to whoever saw us together, which, unlike me, resulted in others treating me as boring and unstable. At first, I was so incredibly flattered that anyone, like Gus (who worked in a bank and was very confident) even gave me the time of day and I fell completely crazy about the ideal of his idea rather than himself. it was. If I had had my head upright and had already known him better, I would not have married him. However, it's my mistake. It's not my mistake to be abused. I did not deserve it and I did not see it coming before being plunged into games of the mind, criticism and isolation. He acted as if I had no reason to have a different opinion of his - he even went further. If I did not agree, he would assume that I did not understand and simplify his wording more and more ... by the time I finally lost all respect for myself, I was unable to recognize the difficult situation in which I was and I had to be shaken to reality by outside influence. My father said that Gus called me a bitch. Well ... it was another year and a half before the rage that started at that moment finally exploded and I packed some stuff while he was at work and I left. ... and I still had several months left before I could understand that I had been abused and that it was not my fault that he had done so. ..... so please, anyone who assumes it's the fault of the victim, THINK !!! If a cruel owner kicks a puppy while, in an anxious situation, he has an accident on the carpet, do you blame him? at a time when the violence in a relationship reaches an obvious level of violence, the target of the violence has been so hurt and depersonalized (a bit like in the Nazi concentration camps) that it is almost impossible to judge the situation with precision, because at that moment, the victim believes the horrible things vomited by the aggressor. Have heart, people. To say that victims of abuse are stupid fools is like kicking someone who has already been terribly beaten. -------> and that helps how ???
