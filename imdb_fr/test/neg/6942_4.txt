Marlene Dietrich is beautiful in the role of Concha Perez, the temptress who drives all men to despair in "The devil is a woman" by Josef Von Sternberg. His performance has nothing to do with the "game" in the conventional sense of the term, but it is incandescent, a true star who mastered his subject perfectly. But she is the only good thing about the movie (she's so good that she keeps looking at this slag, I doubt if another actress could do the same). <br /> <br /> The story is a frightfully lame melodrama, (Pierre Louys's novel was certainly better), in which the primer of Dietrich Concha ruins the lives of two friends played by Lionel Atwill and CÃ©sar Romero with a stiffness grazing petrification. And for Von Sternberg, it's an ugly film, (perhaps in harmony with its ugly subject). Bunuel, on the other hand, has thought enough to redo it as "This obscure object of desire", putting more emphasis on the surreal aspects, consisting of putting two different actresses in the same role. Neither film is the director's best time and although Bunuel's version may be the best film, it's Dietrich's "performance" that you remember.
