... I normally hate word games, but this seems to be the only appropriate summary for "Barnyard". I suspect that I am not the first. And I'm sure there are a lot of comments about idiocy bulls with udders. It certainly bothered me from the start. But there is much more trouble in this film than a fundamental lack of knowledge about the functioning of mammals. <br /> <br /> Personally, if I were a parent, I would be irritated by the violent turn of the film. showdown with the coyotes. (Although for me it has at least a little action.) And from a conventional point of view, you could expect the coyotes to play a bigger role in the conflict (you have a cow " widow "... Maybe her" husband "was killed by coyotes? No ... there is a much silly explanation.) And what kind of farm is it? Otis promises to protect all animals, but there does not seem to be a threat from humans. They refer to the peasant being vegan, but why is he raising pigs? In all stories about children's animals - Babe, Charlotte Web, name it ... the reality of farm life is at least evoked. Our friendly farmer may be running a kind of emergency shelter (reference is made to this, but this has never been explained.) But all the farmer receives in return is an abuse by a farmer. horse in a scene supposed to be funny, seriously wondering if he would be buried in a shallow grave behind the barn. And what the heck is the deal with "Wild Mike"? It was like the scene of Gimp in Pulp Fiction without the gag. <br /> <br /> Add to that terrible attempts at emotional scenes, an almost total lack of laughter and THOSE UDDERS, and you have the worst children's movie I've seen in ages. In general, I only post on IMDb to showcase a movie that is less known - not to slam the # 2 hit at the current box office. But this film pissed me off. It took up space in my local theater, a space that could have been used to show something worthwhile. There has been a lot of great family fun this summer. In fact, there were at least two more children's movies airing in the same multiplex. But I'm not allowed to see anything like "Little Miss Sunshine" so Viacom can trick families with an extra $ 30. At least I had a free pass. <br /> <br /> I know that as a 35-year-old man without children, this film was not designed for me. But there is no excuse for such a lazy children's movie and as terrible as "Barnyard" at Pixar's age. The films of "The Ice Age" bored me, but they certainly did not annoy me like "Barnyard". "Shark Tale" was a weak street attempt, but there was a lot of laughter. For that, you can turn on Nickelodeon at any time of the day and see something more entertaining and intelligent - that's why they should be ashamed to put their name on this trash. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it a 2 out of 10, just because Pip The Mouse was sporadically fun and Maria Bamford had some fun lines as a farm wife. Well, not the farmer's wife. Another farmer. They did not really explain who she was. They did not explain a lot of things. Especially not why Sam Elliot - the ultimate "man of the man" - had a udder stirring around. Creepy.
