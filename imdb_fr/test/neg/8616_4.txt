The sequel to John Carpenter, whose name is only the name of this film, takes place in Thailand and staged a sect of evil vampires, who likes to kill people, and a sect of good vampires who do not . Although this is an interesting idea to mount a vampire movie in Thailand, the writers do not seem to do much with the exotic places. This film could have been shot in Los Angeles as well. Which brings me to the next point, that it looks a lot like Blade Lite. We have the rock soundtrack, the martial arts fight scenes, a bleeding dance club and, of course, many vampire pointed objects. What we do not have is the budget and the talent. Yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, too bad that his acting is not as good, and there's a lot of work over there, and tons of reinforced fighting sequences, maybe too much. The problem is they just do not have the same impact as Blade's movies. It may just be that the film has an impression of "being seen". <br /> <br /> However, for me, the biggest problem was that the filmmakers had not taken enough time to establish the relationship between the lead role, played by buff and fade Colin Egglesfield, and his little friend. She gets caught at the very beginning of the movie after a sneaky exchange with her boyfriend. We have no personal interest in his well-being at the moment and no reason to believe that his boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her. Now this is a major drawback when it is the main focus of the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end, you could do worse than lose 85 minutes of your time with that, but I can think of a lot of better things to do with your time, like renting a movie Blade.
