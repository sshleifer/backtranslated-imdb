This quirk contains touches of Bunuel, but does not maintain his interest. A 10-year-old girl walks into a bizarre American with a stolen Mustang, while suspects of mainstream cult movies (Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Susie Tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy. Like AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS, the scriptwriter likes to make you feel uncomfortable. I stayed unaffected, because of the wide action. You know that you are ready to play when the meatloaf and fleas give the best attractions. (And what was this kid's screen test like?) It's unbearable.) Recommended to the dozen fans of SONNY BOY (1987).
