I first went to see this myself to make sure my boy could see him. <br /> <br /> God be praised, I certainly would not leave him because I would not allow any young child to see him. Why? Violence, death, funerals. If you are not ready to explain these concepts to your children, move them away. <br /> <br /> Why are these topics addressed in a children's film - especially one with the slogan "The original party goers". Maybe as well put a gang performance in a Hello Kitty cartoon. <br /> <br /> As for the laughs, they were very rare. For my part, there was none. The cows looked remarkably like the comic cows of The Far Side. I guess this film is nothing new except for the addition of ridiculous violence and anti-social activities to the delight of young children.
