Lowe returns to the nest after, again, a failed relationship, to find that he has been assigned to jury duty. It's in the plans to get out of it, when he realizes that the defendant is the girl on whom he has a serious crush since the first year. <br /> <br /> Living in the past telling other people Lowe remembers her feelings for this girl (played by Camp) and does everything in her power to rid Camp of any attempt to murder, while avoiding the real bad guys and managing to create a hit movie at the same time. <br /> <br /> I heard that St. Augustine is the oldest city in the United States and I know it has links with Ponce de Leon. Context is a good starting point. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing about this movie. The local police are incompetent, the judge is an idiot and the defense lawyer is doing everything in his power to pretend to be Joanie Cunningham! I do not know whether to blame the director for the wrong direction or for simply allowing the cast to make such an unfortunate effort. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was so boring that I could not even sleep through it! 1 of 10 stars!
