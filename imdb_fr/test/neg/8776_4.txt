I loved this movie on its first release (but I was just 12 years old at the time - and I forgot that this movie existed until the day I found a used copy for sale in a I bought it and I could not wait to watch this film that I loved when I was a child and when I saw it several years later, it struck me ... Why, in the world, did I like this film like a kid, I saw it again as an adult I realized that this movie was horrible, what is saddest about this movie is that they had everything in place to make the biggest western ever made and they bluffed it !!! the costumes are perfect, good actors, there are 2 scores that the orchestra note is beautiful and remains faithful to the classic spirit from old Lone Ranger, the second score is a series of country art songs such as Merle Haggerd and The Statler Brothe rs, as well as songs like "The man with the mask" What is the strongest in this film is that he had a brilliant screenplay, and one of the best Western movies. It's fun to watch John Reid regain his health after being ambushed with his Ranger comrades. His pleasure to see him evolve in his new life and his identity as Ranger solitaire his identity, and undertakes a race of revenge for the gang to be responsible for the murder of his brother and all his rangers with whom he has mounted. But unfortunately, if the story is excellent, Merle Haggard ruined everything. Tell it all as you watch it happen (for God's sake, why did they do that?) Between Merle Haggard's narrative and the Statler Brothers singing silly (silly) songs like "Ride little cowboy" being in the background make this film impossible to take seriously. I would love to see a very good producer take the same scenario and the same story and redo this film, because at the heart of this silly movie, there is a big western .--- I would describe this film in the form of a beautiful woman dressed the ugliest clothes. I give it 4 stars out of 10 - if you're 12 and I do not know better then you could love it.
