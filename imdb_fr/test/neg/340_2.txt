Even with its small budget, this film could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here. It all started well enough, and quite engaging and believable. The actors and characters were interesting although there was not much character development. My favorite scene was when they ate all their rations. Some seemed to hate him, and some seemed to think it was not too bad. The story begins very hermetically. And then ... <br /> <br /> And then it plunged into a little horror that is usually a death sentence for most sci fi. Suddenly, no scientific basis for anything that happens. No real credible end game for the bad guy? No real explanation of what is happening. Generally, if a movie is to use the word F for all other words, it also follows. I am always offended, believe it or not. I often wonder what inspires people to do bad sci-fi? Is there not a universe of good stories fantastically? Do not people feel like wasting their time and those of others when they publish these things? Why do we have so much mediocre science fiction like this? No actor / female character either? Not at all? It had the merit of being another "predator" but alas, it fell far away. <br /> <br /> My last comment: bad assembly and finally budget too low to build a bonfire? Which give? <br /> <br /> My advice to low-budget science fiction film production companies. Before you start, make sure you have a good story and remove the bad effects. It's better to see nothing but something that seems wrong or ridiculously vague.
