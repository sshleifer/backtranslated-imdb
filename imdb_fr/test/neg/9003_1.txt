Know him as a cameraman who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950, then for Warners Bros and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, it's a shit. Of course, it would be nice to show it to your favorite friends at a party at home, but trying to sell it on a DVD is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I've seen bad acting in my time but it's not a role. The hero is almost laughable and he really thinks he's judging from his observations on the specials. I hate to see his fan club. Old movies did not work with action in many scenes. What was this garden scene with three of the worst actresses? I have never seen a garden on a boat. They could not even be moved. It would not bother me if they could play once, but the only one was the guy with the translavan accent. I'm sorry but it's not a smart movie as some people say. I think that horror moviegoers would be insulted by this movie.
