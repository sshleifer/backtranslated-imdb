"Get Shorty", "Out of Sight", "Jackie Brown" (and even "52 Pick-Up") - people were finally right about Elmore Leonard, making good films with his work. Thus, despite the warnings of my students about the seriousness of this film, I could not resist renting it. I thought, how can it be bad? Oy, what a mistake, especially after reading the book, which was lame (and too circularly self-referential too) compared to the rest of Elmore Leonard's books. Still, the book was better than the movie. Leonard triumphs again weak and unskilled writers who try to take back his book. The written dialogue for Steven Tyler was painful to watch. And the lyrics of the first song of Linda Moon's character? My college students write with more depth. Sad sad sad. Why even give him a star? Because Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman are always fun to see on screen and Andr√© 3000 did not make a fool of himself.
