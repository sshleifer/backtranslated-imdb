This film stinks. IMDb needs negative numbers in its evaluation system to correctly evaluate this turkey. The actors play is either in wood or on the top; the film was apparently not written by anyone in particular; and the monster scenes were mediocre at best. Even as a film based solely on monster scenes, these shots were so disappointing that they could inspire no sympathy for the rest of the film. I want the 80 minutes of my life that this movie has stolen.
