This is strictly for Pryor fans. It's not because he's a good funny guy that it's more than a B-Movie. The scenario is dreadful, he is content to constantly ridicule the crime and prisoners of war. He balances between comedy and melodrama and never ceases to appear, not doing justice to either one or the other. <br /> <br /> First, there is 30 minutes of Vietnamese prisoner of war uninspired and uninspired ?? the guy is playing basketball at some point ... How can you please your audience? ... This jail time is boring, unconvincing and can easily fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Back in the United States, the guy, for no real reason, is considered a "war hero". Yet it is of course quickly forgotten by the public and seems to stumble in all kinds of mischievous mishaps. Where are they really? We will soon know it. Yawning. There are boring clich√©s: his sick mother, his little girl he never meets, a fucking luxury that falls in love with the hero, and so on. It is very strange to see how this film constantly switches from tragedy to clumsiness. It does not work at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's actually a bad comedy that hurts prisoners of war. This type of comedy, which has played in some good movies and died of multiple sclerosis is not a reason not to be bored by this idiotic comedy, unconvincing and without conviction. But if you love Richard Pryor, you'll probably be delighted with his 3 hours reading of Dadaist poetry.
