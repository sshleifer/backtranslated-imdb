I can not believe how stupid this movie is. The script (written by Keira Knightley's mother) is what ruins the movie to the extreme. it's simply dull, absurd, and it makes absolutely no sense ... <br /> <br /> this film has dragged on for the most part, especially at the beginning. The story kept going about their daily flirtations, which sometimes looked like a trio. in this film, you have a boring couple of bad payers (the poet and his wife) who are completely drunk from the beginning. the woman sleeps with other men to make ends meet, while the poet is a pervert who feeds on boos and cheap women. the woman, who waaayyyyyy quickly becomes friends with her former childhood lover (played by keira), suddenly becomes jealous, knowing full well that both have been lovers since childhood. Something does not seem right here ... I mean, come on ... go with the lady of the program! what were you waiting for? <br /> <br /> In summary: the old lovers find themselves with a new wife who kisses her, then becomes jealous, then an old lover gets married and her husband becomes jealous, bombs the house of the crazy and drunk couple, a crazy husband calls the police and they end up going to court for the charges of attempted murder of the man. it's summed up in a few words ... <br /> <br /> This film had such moments as the quality and the good interpretation of Cillian Murphy, but other than that, I can not believe that I I watched ... I complained during the movie and some family members watching me fell asleep. I decided to give him a chance and I should have stayed true to my first instinct.
