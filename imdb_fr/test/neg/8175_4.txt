A year after the release of "Singin 'in the Rain" and "High Noon", this stuffed turkey has somehow won the Oscar for best film. Half of the movie is nothing but circus performances. The other half is a soap opera and a melodrama. Heston and Wilde are both overworked, although they are models of restraint compared to the boring Hutton. By playing the role of an egocentric trapeze artist, Hutton behaves like an overzealous high school student in a badly produced drama. Grahame is the only actor to have achieved a decent performance. DeMille has no interest in telling a good story, but only in creating a show of very long duration, even if it is dull.
