Well where to start, there was a lot of potential for this movie with such big stars playing a role. But the whole story was ruined by a horrible plot. This film did not succeed to be what I expected, the nice guy comes out alive, I mean, nobody wants the good one to succeed. The end was worthy of the name and very clich√©, I do not think about anything, YOU HAVE THE TERRAIN ALL FALSE, BAD MECS ARE MEANS TO SUCCEED. If you want to lose 1 time spent doing something else this movie was the epitome of CRAP. I really think the actors made this movie for quick money in Vegas without a doubt. Save your money watching a better movie.
