Yes, I spelled well. This film is so predictable, the word itself needs additional letters to illustrate predictability. From the moment the main characters and the situation are presented, it is impossible to determine where this plot will take us. The prefiguration was as subtle as a mass of two tons. You could take many pieces of dialogue and predict the role this would play in the end. <br /> <br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in easy-going roles and Abigail Breslin played the nice role. It's just that the film brought absolutely nothing new to the genre of romantic comedy. The romance was lukewarm and the laughs were weak and few. Of course, it's an OK movie if you have nothing to watch, but you will not miss anything by missing this one.
