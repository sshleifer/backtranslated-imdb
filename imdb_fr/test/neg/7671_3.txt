My Take: The stupidest AIRPORT movies, and probably one of the worst disaster movies of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Like to make the most of the franchise, the producers of this third sequel from AIRPORT launch more action, stupid secondary intrigues, free appearances of stars and more zany elements. CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79 is the worst, and probably one of the worst disaster movies of the 1970s. With its poor box office results, it is not surprising that the genre has stayed too long in its home. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a rather catchy score of Lalo Schifrin, supported by some impressive shots of the plane holder. in his former glory (the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in July 2000). But then, the credits appear and we see the cast "All-Star", composed only of faded Hollywood stars, television actors and actors B little popular. The plot is more stupid than ever: George Kennedy takes over the role of Joe Patroni, now pilot of the Concorde (co-piloted by co-pilot Alain Delon) en route to France after the Summer Olympics. Journalist Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) has just discovered that her boyfriend, the famous arms manufacturer Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner), is selling his weapons to a terrorist. To prevent him from revealing the news to the world, Harrison sends his most advanced missiles and his best saboteurs to prevent the Concorde from landing. <br /> <br /> The actors / subplots are more stupid than ever, even more stupid than an alcoholic Myrna Loy or a singing nun. We have Cicely Tyson carrying a human heart living in a cooler (!), Martha Raye as a woman suffering from bladder problems (and the character does not go beyond that), JJ Walker, pot smoking saxophonist (no doubt the most annoying character in the film), Eddie Albert married "old woman" Sybil Danning, Avery Schreiber in the role of Russian coach with a deaf girl and finally, a love affair between journalist Jon Davidson and gymnast Andrea Marcovici (to the enthusiasm of coach Mercedes McCambidge). In addition, the film is much closer to the LOVE BOAT episode than ever before with the dumbest cameos of Charo (and his pet Chihuahua) and Bibi Anderson. Camp enthusiasts will undoubtedly have a real kick in this ridiculous entry into a long line of disaster movies of the 70s. This is, beyond the meaning of the word, a real disaster. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 out of 5.
