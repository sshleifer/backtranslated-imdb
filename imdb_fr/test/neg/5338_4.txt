Oh, that's it, I'm really fed up with all those generic Japanese horror movies about long-haired female ghosts and ghostly kids. "Ghost Train" is no exception. He is clearly influenced by "Ringu", "Ju-On", "Shutter" and "Pulse". Two years ago, I was in such modern ghost stories, because they generally managed to give me goose bumps. Unfortunately, nothing in the movie "Ghost Train" is interesting or cool. In fact, the movie is really boring.Noriko disappears into a subway tunnel looking like a primary school mate. Nana must investigate a mystery of multiple disappearances, with the help of a young conductor and another mother of the "missing" child. The film offers slightly scary moments, but the CGI effects are laughable and the climax is illogical.
