If there was justice in the film world, director Lewis Schoenbrun would never be allowed to set foot on a set. It seems inconceivable that anyone who has spent two decades in an editing room, where LS began his film career, may be as devoid of theatrical sensations or dramatic staging, but this film is overwhelming evidence. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, it's fascinating. From the opening stage, where a nurse is dressed in a suit suitable only for a porn film or a sketch of a Mexican variety show, the viewer is forced to see how low it can be. The answer is not far off: we then move on to a funeral parlor, where the next sensational fashion statement is that of a sexy black dress put on one shoulder and worn by one of the mourners. <br /> <br /> The aggressive and inappropriate costume is not the only flaw of the film. Dialogue is a treat for connoisseurs of bad writing. "You turn my tears into wine", is an example of a gem. The actor deserves an Oscar for making this one with a serious face. <br /> <br /> The director reinforces each cheeseball scene with what is perhaps the most schmaltziest soundtrack score ever recorded, which goes from the embarrassing scene to the dialogue. groovebox wannabe rocknroll in transition scenes. <br /> <br /> The script presents characters without rhymes or reasons and the story beats are dropped as with a broken ladle. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget it's a "horror" movie, though. Our characters find themselves in a forest in which hides Dr. Chopper and his two "scary" maids, who are supposed to be a kind of French creatures but exactly like those of Valley Girls with fake blood buffered under their shampoo Supercut. Honestly, I saw a scary makeup on eight-year-olds at a Halloween party. <br /> <br /> And again, we feel the smell of the smelly work of the costume designer, like Valley Ghoul One. in a polyblend pseudo-victorian blouse while her boyfriend wears an indefinable ensemble that could have been almost fashionable in the cooler corners of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Dr. However, Chopper made the Fashion Affair and looks like a Crisco cowboy who got lost in the woods with his big black Harley, dressed in black zipped leather S & M. <br /> If that intrigues you, by all means verify . There are many divisive and elaborate dialogues (such as the precious scene of the "Elephant Graveyard" or the "intellectual" speech on Ginsburg). <br /> <br /> To be fair, the cinematography is good, considering what has been put in front of the camera, and the actors strive (with extremely extreme results) to do something of a bunch clich√©s and inanities. You must be wondering if they were really stupid or blindly desperate, not to leave the board after seeing the ridiculous naughty with their 99 Cent Store weapons.
