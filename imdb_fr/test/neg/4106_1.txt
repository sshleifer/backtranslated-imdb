It's horrible! There is no other way to say it. In fact, it's ** SO ** bad that the only reason I'm losing my words on this is to warn other reasonable viewers who want to be entertained intelligently. You will lose I.Q. points to look at this. If you think about it, it's not even suitable for visualization without reflection because of the irritation factor. There is no guilty pleasure in looking at something so incompetent. <br /> <br /> Reasons to avoid it: <br /> <br /> 1) Horribly scientifically inaccurate, to the point where it's no longer science fiction, it's just a lazy fantasy and lazy Girl. <br /> <br /> 2) It has exchange effects that are incredibly stupid. Not even the kitschy cheese that winks and nods like the vintage Doctor Who, but just cheap and of poor quality to the point of being insulting. The FX are so bad that they are not even laughable. They spent about a dollar for that, not more. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction is so weak and stupid that the only way for the actors to reach the end of shooting without sinking into the final depression was somnambulism in their roles, although Catherine McCormack still makes an effort, probably on principle and despite the director. Moreover, this is not the only bad film of Peter Hyams: his failures are much more numerous than all the hardly recoverable films, of which Timecop was the last, and which was already 15 years earlier. he had not had anything decent since (End Of Days was just as slippery, Arnold was the only draw and he needed a much firmer direction than the one offered by Hyams). Hyams continues to make it more and more pointless to think of giving him more work. <br /> <br /> And finally, <br /> <br /> 4) The stories of Ray Bradbury deserve to be treated much better. Refusing to watch this movie sends this message, but Hollywood is listening to you. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. If you do it and you completely remove the movies, you can only blame yourself (and the Hyams) because you have been warned enough.
