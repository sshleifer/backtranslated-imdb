One Night at McCool's wants you to think it's a cool and smart black comedy. He pushes his "weird" characters and his "scandalous" situations to the viewer as a crack merchant who works overtime. The premise is about a woman in gold, named Jewel, who asks men to steal and even murder them, so that she can have all the possessions of the world she desires so desperately. You know, it would not be a bad strategy if she pursued the rich. This film really wants to make believe that a Foxy scammer would waste time going out with bartenders and Andrew "Dice" Clay. Please. This major loophole in Jewel's scheme is really the only entertainment found in this scavenger (and it's not intentional). Looking at it, it's not hard to believe that there could have been a good movie somewhere. One Night at McCool just could not decide where to go, so sit in the middle of the road, like a dead armadillo. He tries to be sexy but no clothes are removed in front of the camera and the few scenes of the head are terribly pedestrian. There is a recurring scene where a hired killer asks the protagonist (played by Matt Dillon) how is sex with Jewel. It seems that Matt does not know it, any more than the viewers. Why was he dating her anyway? One Night at Mccool's also wants to be funny. Sorry, weird coincidences and misunderstandings did not even work with Three's Company. What's worse is that this movie really seemed to go into a dark atmosphere to accompany its comedy. A bit like a sophomoric film of the Coen brothers, but his superficial script could not play subtlety, any more than his dismal direction could be knocked out by any shock. There is still a movie in the audience that seems busy trying to please everyone and lose all interest along the way.
