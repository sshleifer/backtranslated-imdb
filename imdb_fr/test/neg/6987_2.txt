This film must be the worst movie I have ever seen. I only watched about half an hour and I just turned it off. The cars in this film look like two geo-metropolitan fronts smashed together. This film is not even good for laughing. The only time I laughed was when Dante kept saying in a funny voice, "No one can beat Dante, Muhwa hwaa." I said holy God and I closed it. Bad, bad movie. 2/10
