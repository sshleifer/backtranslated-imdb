I do not understand the exaggerated good reviews about this film, except that many Venezuelans are naturally very enthusiastic, which explains the fact that the Venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind compared to other countries in the region have. <br /> The film is initially too repetitive, many scenes are almost identical for each of the two main roles, which gives the impression that it is a time factor. A refill time is also a good point, because this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes, you will start to get tired after a while and watch the clock. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very bad, except for the Venezuelan guy Edgar Ramirez, who brings some slapstick and plays the role of the Venezuelan rookie "Pedro". <br /> <br /> By the way, this is not a representative film about the locals (Caribbean area), it tends to ridicule them.
