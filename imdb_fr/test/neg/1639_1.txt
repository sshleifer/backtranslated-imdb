It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is not the worst, Manos in the hands of fate holds this honor. <br /> <br /> This film poses many problems. For starters, this whole movie is a cheap scam of Conan movies. There is the baby wearing a little dress dressed in a hubcap, the silent Asian warrior, the cutter of naughty cookies, the almost stupid solidarity, etc. There are many continuity errors in this movie. Some of the stupidest mistakes I've ever seen are in this movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, when I watched this movie, I saw the MST3K version. Joel and the robots make the film visible, otherwise I probably would have turned it off five minutes after the beginning of the movie.
