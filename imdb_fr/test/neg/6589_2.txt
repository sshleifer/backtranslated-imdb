First of all, I'm sorry for my english. Second, the true story of this episode: 39 soldiers, operation "Magistral '". 6 soldiers were killed. Hundreds of insurgents have also been killed. In 10 years, the Soviet army lost less than 15,000 people and killed more than 900,000 insurgents and civilians. The war veteran: "Traditions: There are no traditions in this film, there is no military oath, no first jump, no farewell to the battle banner There are no awards and medals, there is nothing sacred, there is only hatred against the Soviet army, and being in this area under investigation, we have revealed shells of departure. The exact location could not be defined, we also covered the subject, by two minutes, here was the reality of the fighting, so there was no feeling of "forgetfulness". These feelings then appeared, already in other wars and in another state (Chechnya), others were children, more more humanly, and "prapors" were like fathers, good and culmination fight - complete orgy Shooting in anywhere.Mental attacks the young Ben-Ladens, not killed both not broken through.And complete absence Mutual aid, that there was an essential part of this war: even the Americans accused us of inadequate application of force against the insurgents. And here it's direct on the contrary. In the summer of 1981, I am firmly resolved about myself, this should personally fill a minimum of 50 insurgents. As a result, the accepted "plan" was under-executed and during a demobilization, I left with a contused and malicious attitude, as shown in fig. After the return of the first few months, there was a feeling of not having been at war until the end, no business there. There was no wave, but an oppressive feeling of dissatisfaction with himself and a caustic irritation. Such night ideas can be and not be out of place. The officers really in the movie are absolutely not present. On this occasion, how much time did they spend with the staff? The fighting is constant. New Year on the fights. Where did they get beds? In the mountains? And so on ... "<br /> <br /> If you want a fairy tale about the war," 9 rota "and" Shtrafbat "are for you.If you want the truth, you have to see" Come and see "or" Battalions ask for fire ".
