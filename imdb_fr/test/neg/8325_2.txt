This is a documentary about homeless women. It was interesting in that it targeted women who are socially engaged - having a job and lasting friendships - but in situations where they can not afford housing. <br /> <br /> I found some of the women covered interesting, but there was little concentration or progression in the story. Management and editing did not catch my attention. There were of course differences in the stories of these women, but the message was essentially the same and could have been conveyed by focusing more on one of them more deeply. <br /> <br /> I reached it until the end. of the movie, but it was a rather boring trip.
