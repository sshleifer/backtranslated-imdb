It was perhaps the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Forget it is clear that no research has been done regarding Detroit (forest in downtown Detroit! Bwahaha !!). The writing was awful, the premise completely implausible and, frankly, the characters were embarrassing. I can not understand why seasoned actors were falling so low and participating in something horrible. Now I have never seen the original and I do not know if this film pays homage to its original form. I understand that the original was not placed in Detroit. Why they would deviate from this without looking for details on the decor tells me that it was more than the cast that was trying to pay the rent. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this junk, unless you're from Detroit and want some comic relief.
