I had to watch this movie with my 5 years old. He did not laugh once during the whole movie ... and he loves dogs and will laugh about almost anything! This film was horrible in all its aspects: a mediocre scenario (even a G-rated children's movie), mediocre production (the flickering camera shots made me feel nauseous for the first ten minutes), mediocre play (they were maybe being "directed" to comics), and even poor sound quality (there are places where the audio level looks good, so you can not hear what the next actor says). I'm willing to endure a lot when it comes to watching a kid movie, but it was worse than having a stick in the eye. I did not like to hurt my head with the thing of divine belief either. In all, it was the biggest loss of 90 minutes of my life ... and I lost a lot of time in my day!
