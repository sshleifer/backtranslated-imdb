I saw this turkey at the theater, but I had a lot of fun. Special effects are not worthy of primary school production. A toy ship, representing a freighter, moving at the speed of the outboard on calm waters while the wind-driven fog was blowing in the opposite direction. The red and blue flood lamps add an extra dramatic touch. Whatever cache that Vincent Price was supposed to bring as a narrator, he is completely overshadowed by a terrible production work. To call it a documentary is to call Britney Spears a musician. About 20 minutes later, something seemed very funny to me. Perhaps it was Price's overly dramatic intonation in the often-used line "They disappeared into the Devil's Triangle!" [Cut to black, next story] Once I started laughing, my friends joined The next time Vinny said the crucial line, The back shouted "Well!" After that, he laughed almost as much as a Marx Brothers movie, and no one stayed for the terribly serious second film. "Chariots of the Gods".
