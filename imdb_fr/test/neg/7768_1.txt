Terrible, superficial and materialistic nonsense. How can women (and gay men?) Benefit from this waste, it's beyond me. No self-respecting man would ever want to be with one of those neurotic gold diggers. What is even more disturbing is that many reviewers say they have relationships with women on the show. If this is the future of women, Lord, help us all. Showing your independence and being respected as equal to men should not be about spreading your legs every three seconds with a different man. I think that lowers women and does not do them justice. But this criticism is not a diatesis against women. Fans of this show say it's "hilarious" and "riveting", but every time I watched this show, I tried to stay awake. Despite the story of the woman journalist, at no point in this show, there is even something that looks like something that could be considered rational thought. So, it's not fun, and it's not informative, so why would you bother to watch it? One star in ten.
