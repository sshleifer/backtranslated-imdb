I know that so many critics of IMDb are extreme, critics praising either a film thoroughly, or tearing inarticulate manner. I do not find any of these criticisms useful, and I do not give this film the terrible criticism I'm going to make lightly. The film is a science-fiction genre of the worst kind, disguised as a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailers guide you through what appears to be a consistent conspiracy, but in fact represent only a small part of a series of deliberately confusing events that are never solved properly. I like films that defy the viewer and I do not need to be spotted. My complaint against this film is not that he is too intelligent. No, the movie is just terrible. As the credits unfold, you will feel a real anger after wasting time with Cameron Diaz's wooden actor and a shaky plot. To avoid.
