This episode is nil. In recent years, I have watched all episodes of "Next Generation" and "Voyager" and I am now watching "Enterprise". <br /> <br /> I am completely attentive enjoy this series. Until this episode. I stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment. It's more like a burlesque attempt. <br /> <br /> This does not build the characters but throws them on a limb - and leaves the audience speechless. It does little to build the series. <br /> <br /> Why has this ever been allowed to be broadcast amazes me? Was it writing? Was it the staging? Was it the producer? We will probably never know. <br /> <br /> But a bad apple is not bad, I suppose. I say I hope it's one.
