A conversation about the lush nature of Jan-Michael Vincent led me to foolishly revisit this entry of digital television in the mid-90s. A child is traumatized when he sees an ice cream man shot in the 1950s and that he becomes a psycho-ice cream man (Clint Howard). Something happens and people disappear and end up in the ice. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Director Norman Apstein (nicknamed Paul Norman) made a career in pornography before returning to the sequel. That's what you get for all murders to happen off screen. And for making a skinny kid like a big kid and having him wear a big suit. Just throw a big kid! In addition, there is a scene where Vincent reacts stoically in front of a group of escaped loonies that surround him. He was either completely drunk and scared of his life, or the filmmakers had captured his "Did I really sink so low?" shame thoroughly. Although it is low-budget waste, he has gathered some good names, including David Naughton, Olivia Hussey, David Warner and Doug Llewelyn, THE PEOPLE COURT. How you can make a boring slasher with this cast is beyond me.
