The dreadfully abused and verbally abused head of a film studio directs his ragged-eyed male assistant, holding him firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment; after a year of terror in the office, the hard worker breaks down. Writer-director George Huang may have had more trouble chewing here. His book "Swimming With Sharks" is not a diatribe against Hollywood, nor a tribute to the underdog who works hard ... it's more like a stunt film with a twist, a pony with a tunnel vision . The surroundings do not look like Tinsel Town (perhaps because of a limited budget), and we never realize this stressful environment as a film production entity (it could be an office real estate broker in the valley, for all to know). Director Kevin Spacey, who was also one of the producers of the film, gives a controlled and targeted performance as a crazy mogul whose ego is uncontrollable. he does a good job, but the character does not sound right. We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high-ranking status fail to imitate what we see; to whom does this man answer? What drives him beyond the humiliation of others for sport? What projects does it juggle apart from the only script we see past? The film is so emotionally stunted and underpopulated that it begins to look like a staging for the big screen - yet without enough characters or motives. Maybe Huang wanted to keep things simple, but his film is more like a half-cooked project that required a lot more insight, humor and atmosphere. ** from ****
