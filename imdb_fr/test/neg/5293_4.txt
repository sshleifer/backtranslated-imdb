Travolta, Thurman, Rock, Vaughn, Keitel, etc. We should think that this parade of great actors could really warm up this film, but no. Travolta takes over the role of Chili Palmer, but this time we have already seen the gangster who is trying his luck in the tough world of cinema, it's not funny anymore. This is a typical problem in Hollywood, they think that if the first was good, the second will be twice as good, NO, the first was original, the second can not be, Hey Hollywood tries to understand the originality can not be duplicated, you have to do it give us a new twist, not just the same movie redone with a larger budget. I found myself constantly. I did not laugh a lot while watching this movie, but there were always a lot of cool actors like Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Vince Vaughn and The Rock and just for that! <br /> <br /> 4/10
