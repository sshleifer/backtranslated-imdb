George Burns returns to the role of the Almighty after having a great success with "Oh, my God!" In 1977, an optimistic fantasy made possible by the sudden need, in the 1970s, to move from devil-inspired thrillers to comic redemption (even if it brought in original money.) Was more in line with the comedies "Topper "of the 30s that a return to religious cinema that is good). Here, God appears to a girl (Louanne, who had previously played in a theatrical production of "Annie") and asks her to spread her Divine Word, only causing him problems from adults. The strange and family-oriented film seems to be quite warm, and Burns manages to play with a nice dam of twisted jibs, but the writing is half-awkward and half-serious, the adults considering putting little Louanne away, all that makes God seem more of a troublemaker than an old friend. Louanne is another problem: a happy kid with little dry eyes, she is not trained to play on the screen and sometimes seems embarrassing. The medium-budget production has a gloppy televised movie appearance, with some graceful touches. The final scene mimics the climax of the first "Oh, my God!" in that it brings a nostalgic feeling to the mix, which is welcome. This is the most subtle moment of the film. ** from ****
