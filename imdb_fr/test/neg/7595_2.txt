This film is a clumsy mishmash of various conventions relating to ghost stories and suspensions, none of which are fully realized and all of which are rather irritating. The script was superficial. The acting game, idem. The scary FX was mostly laughable except for an exquisite seat jump that frightened me even though I saw it arrive a mile away. Now, explain to me somebody why you would need ghosts, AND black magic AND arcane ritual artifacts, and conspirators of Count Crapula CG, AND psychic investigators, AND family curses, AND Irish superstitions AND milk bowls left out for the supernatural, AND possessed, all in the same movie? With all this, you would expect more than a good moment of horror, but this movie is lame, lame, lame.
