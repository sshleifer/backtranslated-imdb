This remake is titled "That Darn Cat," but D.C. the cat is more marginal than the main character. Patti Randall was not friendly at all in this remake either. She reminded me of one of those high school jerks you saw in high school and who are angry since their day of birth. They end up opening fire on the rest of the school one day. The federal cop, Kelso agreed, but not as good as that of the original. I guess Disney was trying to make Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (or whatever his wacky name) a star, but they do not hold the candle to Hayley Mills and Dean Jones in the original. I am an animal lover and a cat lover and I do not blame D.C. for the remake, which is so inferior to the original movie. After all, they almost eliminated it from the whole movie. Overall, a very poor remake.
