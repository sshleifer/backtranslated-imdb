After watching the first movie of BCI's new Aztec Mummy Collection, it's hard to believe how excited I was about the game and how upset I was when the release date was postponed. I have seen a lot of Mexican horror in recent months. Some big ?? The curse of the crying woman. Some entertaining despite obvious flaws ?? Night of bloody monkeys. And a little cheese ?? Choose any Santo movie. One thing that all these movies have in common is that none can be called "dull". Well, that's not the case with the Aztec mummy. It's been a long time since I've looked at anything that causes sleep. I did not expect or expect a good movie, but at least have fun! The Aztec Mummy takes all situations that might be interesting and aspires life through repeated scenes of people doing nothing and then extending these scenes for what looks like an eternity. I guess that's what happens when you make an 80-minute movie with only 30 minutes of material. Extra padding! For example, for all who have seen the film, what is the purpose of The Bat other than to bring a type of masked wrestler to the screen and extend the run time by 15 minutes? <br /> <br /> I can only hope that the two other films of The Collection will be more entertaining than this one.
