So boring that you will fall asleep after the first 20 minutes. Sorry Mr. Boutonnat, I admire your work (all those beautiful "movies" you made such as "Tristana", "Without logic" etc ...) but here the plot is extremely ... vain! Except the beautiful photography, everything seems stupid and there is no desire to know what will happen in these "average" actors. Moreover, the dialogues are minimalist. The famous question "where are the children" is repeated so often that it looks like a joke. Believe me, it's a waste of time (about the plot), and 3 hours is very long. Certainly the real reason for this total mess at the box office!
