"Embarassant" is the only word to describe this ridiculously awful production. From the blatant indifference to the source material (which will surely delight all those who are familiar with mythology) to the insufficiently predictable production value, this whole mini-series is a train wreck. <br /> <br /> The cast (which includes actors, which I pity) delivers the illogical dialogue in the same generic "European" accent so common to bad epics. Worse still, the lack of originality in almost every other aspect, from costume to scenography (blurring styles across time and space) to score (which seems to mimic many of the recognizable classical melodies as well as than "The Lord of the Rings"). . The most offensive of all is the visual effects, which prove by themselves that if you can not afford to do them well, WRITE them. <br /> <br /> It pains me to see yet another legendary tale built by a cheap "adaptation". Maybe someday, someone will do it right.
