As a children's movie it's great. For the family, it sucks. I was really hoping for something like The Goonies, which is a great movie for all ages. This movie was too child-oriented with the silly script and the characters calling each other names like breathless. ??? Alan Cummings was a delight. And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie ... the fact that there's a theme song that looks a lot like Willy Wonka's song does not make this movie something like Willy Wonka
