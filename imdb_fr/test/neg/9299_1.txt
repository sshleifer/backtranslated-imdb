I went to this film full of hope. With so many capable and humorous actors led by Sir Ben, I thought it was going to be a treat. <br /> <br /> Oh, I wanted to tear my eyes away as credits passed. That I had wasted 93 minutes of my life, this movie was clearly DOA. This film poses real problems and it will probably be easier to list them. 1. No jokes, I'm not particularly hard to do with comedy - up or down front - but there's really no laughing in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Sir Ben mumbles across each line if he's supposed to be drunk or not?!? 3. There is no effort to start, let alone to develop the relationship between the love interests in this area. Two people jostling each other randomly in the street would instantly have more relationships. <br /> <br /> 4. All the acting talent that is assembled is completely lost. Do not be fooled by looking at this because of the names. <br /> <br /> 5. For a cold hitman, he wiped out more people in Gandhi than that flabby loss of time (a tinted beard looks really terrifying). I was hoping it was a slow burner, but in the end, the only thing that could be injected All life - and justice - is that Frank gets out his 9 and distributes all the actors, starting with Tea and ending with himself - sorry, it was so serious.
