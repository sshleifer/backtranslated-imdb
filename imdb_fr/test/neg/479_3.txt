Written by, directed by and performed by camp champion Bruce Campbell. It is easy to say that this is a limited budget for a small business; shot independently in Bulgaria. All I can say for sure is that this idiocy is not always funny. Campbell embodies a wealthy American businessman with an unfaithful wife (Antoinette Byron) and tries to close a commercial transaction before his assassination. He hires a taxi driver to take him to a strange little town; not knowing that his wife "continues" with the taxi driver. Moments after Campbell was clubbed; the taxi driver is killed in the same place. A mad scientist (Stacy Keach) conducts an experiment putting the taxi driver's brain in the head of the American. With huge stitches on his forehead, Campbell frees himself and scours the streets in search of his wife; All the while, he argues with a strange voice in his oversized head. Campbell challenges his rubbery face with silly expressions as he wrestles with himself. So, Bruce does what he does best and his many fans will certainly be delighted. I have the impression that it must have been written as a pure comedy. Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev complete the cast. Watch for it on the Sci-Fi channel.
