Oh yes, this one is certainly a serious contender to win the contestable prize of the "worst slasher of the 80s ever won". "The Prey" has all you usually want to avoid in a horror movie: a routine and derivative plot that you've seen a thousand times (and better), unbearable characters and terrible performances, a total lack of self-control and suspense, blurry photography and non-original places and ?? the most irritating of all ?? the greatest amount of useless refill sequences you've ever encountered in your life (and this is not an exaggeration but a guarantee!). Aside from the seemingly infinite amount of footage from National Geographic, which I will develop later, this film is shameful enough to include a full banjo interlude (!) And two occasions in which characters tell mundane jokes that are not even funny! The installation is as rudimentary as possible, with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with human cries from OTT. Nearly forty years later, a senior couple camping in the same area is trapped by something that is breathing heavily off the screen. This should be enough for you to know that someone survived the fire so many years ago and has been around since. Enter three intolerable couples of about 20 people heading to the danger zone with only sex in mind, without knowing that they are sitting ducks for the harassing and panting killer. "The Prey" is an irreducible boring film. Apparently it was shot in 1978, but nobody wanted to distribute it until 1984 and it's not hard to understand why. In the case where you would filter all the really relevant content, it would only be a short film of 30 minutes duration. maybe even less. There are countless sequences on nature and wildlife, sometimes on animals that, in my opinion, do not even live in this type of area and seem to last forever. The only thing that is missing, in fact, is the National Geographic narrative providing educational information about animal habits. The animals in their own natural biotope are undeniably enjoyable to watch, but not in a so-called naughty, old-fashioned film from the 80s, for shouting. The last fifteen minutes are finally worth it, with some powerful killing sequences and pretty makeup effects on the monster (which turns out to be Lurch from the movie "The Addams Family"), but stupidity always wins out? the scene with the vultures is too stupid ?? and the last shot is just bursting with laughter. As mentioned above, "The Prey" easily makes my personal list of the worst slashers of the 80s, alongside "Rendezvous with Fear", "Berserker", "Deadly Games", "Do not go into the woods "," Hollow Gate "," Stay awake "and" curfew ".
