Have you ever watched a very bad movie and blamed yourself? Even a movie for which you did not have high expectations? Well, I just rented the movie "Dead Line". This is the American video title for "Interferencia". Now, I've seen a lot of bad movies and a lot of "B" titles, but it's in another league. It has been put on the label "The Asylum", and whoever rents a lot of movies directly to horror movies knows this video. When you rent one, you know what you get. A lot of acting horror low budget, but still pretty good. Not this one. The game of the three leaders was beyond evil. Even quick transfers could not help. The slogan on the front of the box says "... in the tradition of DePalma's Body Double.The courage to compare that to this classic movie.The only real comment is" The screams you hear are real ". if you rent this.
