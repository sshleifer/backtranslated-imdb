C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many films since his heyday in the '80s as an accomplished young actor. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD because it was cheap and partly for the internet-related plot and to see how much C. Thomas Howell is older; I do not remember having seen it in any film since the 80s. <br /> <br /> In a few words: what a big disappointment. I give a chance to some low budget movies, but this one started lame. In the first 15 minutes of the film, this elusive woman chats with an Asian in a chat room. They are essentially stimulated by their own conversation, then insists on meeting the participant in person. She meets him, makes love, attaches and murders him in cold blood. The plot then deteriorates further. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin and fragile and the acting is very stiff. Do not bother renting it unless you buy it, even if it's in the basket of $ 1 DVDs. I plan to take my copy of the DVD to Goodwill. I am really surprised that previous critics have given a bad rating to this film.
