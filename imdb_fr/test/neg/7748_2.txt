This film had a very complicated plot and a very artificial framework, which I could not follow, which is surprising if we consider that the actors' game and the dialogue could only have been the product of a gardener's handwriting. . If you like Kathy Ireland, then you might want to see that. The movie was probably designed to try to get her into Hollywood, but if that was her goal, I'd say I hope she did not put too much money into her production.
