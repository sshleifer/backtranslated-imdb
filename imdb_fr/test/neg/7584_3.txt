Qualified professionals live in an exotic and dangerous place. They get drunk every night. They smuggle opium. They drop pigs in parachute. They fly in extremely dangerous conditions. They dress strangely and make it weird. They are iconoclastic, scandalous. They violate all the rules of command and despise their employers at the CIA. They are irreplaceable. <br /> <br /> Nope. It's not "Only angels have wings" and it's not "M * A * S * H." It's a worrisome mix of both that, unfortunately, seems more stupid than funny. <br /> <br /> It aims to shock, amuse and educate, but does not really achieve its goals. <br /> <br /> As for its shock value, well, we are now foolish, are not we? Does it really shock anyone who drove many frequent pilots on secret missions to Laos in the 1970s? No, it's not shocking. It is not even educational at the moment, in our present circumstances, when it would be interesting to learn that a paramilitary excursion was NOT buried in a file titled National Interest, Defense of Touch. Its good. So we were a little awake and we are not so shocking or stupid anymore. <br /> <br /> The problem in this case is that the film depends on these very qualities for its power of distraction. Without that, the film implodes. A group of drunken and drugged CIA pilots sit in a cat house, knocking out girls, throwing light with a silent pistol, killing lizards with the same gun. Robert Downey Jr., a beginner pilot, said, "When you do that, does that mean there is something to celebrate?" Answered another, cheerfully, "No, that means it's night." It could be fun if we expected the renegade pilots to be as straight as the rest of us. If we do not, the gag, like the movie, falls flat. <br /> <br /> There are action scenes naturally. Anything that can possibly happen in or to an airplane in flight happens in or on a plane in flight. People fall out, luggage is thrown at random, engines break down, they suffer damage from AAA, they are torn in colliding landings, but we have seen most of these things elsewhere, often better. . <br /> <br /> Some might find it funnier than me, and the acting is pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. is particularly effective as a right man. Check out the other reviews and if they describe a movie you might like, then watch it well. There may be bursts of laughter that escaped me.
