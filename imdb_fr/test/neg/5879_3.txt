I chose this film because it caught my attention as a film about Jewish comedy - something I had never seen before. <br /> <br /> I approached this film with an open mind and I'm interested in how it started. The opening is well prepared and the first half of the film gave me a lot of reasons to laugh, and that's good. <br /> <br /> However, the humor quickly became repetitive, the plot became confused and tense, and I realized that I did not appreciate the film anymore. I tried to avoid saying that, but the film became rather "cheap" - it's not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up, but it was not. I admit that I may have missed a bit of humor, not being Jewish myself and having little experience of Jewish culture. However, given the density of humor in this film, it is unlikely that I missed much. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, and maybe if we thought about it a little more, the film would have been observable all along. I wish I could give the film a higher score, but strictly speaking, it would have been better as a television series or as a series of sketches. There simply was not enough fresh material worthy of a complete movie. <br /> <br /> One thing to say about the cast: the main role seemed to have been designed for Ben Stiller, but I do not think the film would have been worth it if it had participated.
