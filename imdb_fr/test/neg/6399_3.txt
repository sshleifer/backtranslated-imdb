I just finished watching this movie and found it largely as a waste of time with little or no redeeming factors. I really do not understand where all the positive reviews come from - the animation is clumsy and unrefined, the plot is meaningless from an objective point of view and there is no sense of intrigue or suspense in trying to pass. himself off as an intriguing film and suspense. I have never read the book, so I can not say if the film was true, but as in most film adaptations, it strives too much to store as much information as possible as soon as possible. The result is an incoherent and illogical scenario that does not really allow you to understand or relate to the characters, or even anything. Overall, I felt completely detached from the characters and the plot to the point of not being able to worry about what had happened to them, and the only way to see how this animation could be considered beautiful is if your level of animation is a cartoon of Scooby-Doo.
