I like a good novelty song. No, I get that back. I like a good novelty song. On the other hand, I absolutely despise GGROBAR, and since the first note I've heard. When I discovered that someone had created a caricature, my head nearly exploded. Now that I saw it because my children craved me, I would have liked my head to explode. That would have saved me from the awful misery of this crispest. First, doing a one-hour show based on a three-minute novelty song is a ridiculous idea. Stretching a song like this, which must have been crazy just to be so long, in an hour, is even more ridiculous. It was badly written, animated cheaply, misinterpreted ... the list goes on and on. Dear God, is it always bad?
