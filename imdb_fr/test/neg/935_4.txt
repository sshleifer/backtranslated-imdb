I saw this film consider this movie as a normal Hollywood movie, but I realized it was a movie designed for a TV channel. On the cover of my DVD, on 2 critics, one of the critics, the critic stephen farber of moviline, called it the best film in the world. Year .. <br /> <br /> All the characters were simple and decent except the character of Brain who never leaves room for the director who wanted to keep the mystery until the end. The police officer and the main culprit having a lesbian affair seems to be a totally stupid idea. God knows what happens to DAVE the main male character. <br /> <br /> The other criticism of Mr. Brown's Movies said that Shocking and Effective, but does not really match all the hype ... that I saw after watching the movie. For which I partially agreed ... I should have read it before taking the film ..
