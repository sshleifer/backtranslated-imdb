For all intents and purposes, Showtime was the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Why? Because having Deniro in the casting adds an immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie. I also made the mistake of recently watching 48 hours and Beverly Hills Cop before seeing Showtime and, for some strange reason, I thought Eddie Murphy was still funny. Well he is not. In fact, he almost seems to have been sterilized. Watching this movie, I was surprised that Deniro decided that this script was good enough to give it its name. No chemistry between him and Murphy whatsoever. A horrible writing, horrible jokes, a movie you think should be good can not be worse than that. Shortly after missing the miserable Showtime, I stumbled upon National Security with Martin Lawrence. The movie had its funny roles but was not so great. But it was still 20 times better than Showtime. Please, if your Deniro fan does not watch this movie!
