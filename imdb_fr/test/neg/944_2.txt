Seriously, I do not understand how Justin Long is becoming more and more popular. He has either the best agent in Hollywood or recently sold his soul to Satan. It is almost unbearable to watch on screen, it has little or no charisma and horrible timing. The only movie he tried to wet and enjoyed at a distance was Waiting ... and it's almost only because I worked in a restaurant. But I go astray. In addition to its terrible lead, this movie has loads of other debits. I understand that this is supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that does not mean that it has to insult our intelligence completely, and have writings so incredibly ridiculous that it borders on the offensive. The considerable talent of Lewis Black is also wasted because he is the most incendiary of his time when he is unbridled, which the PG-13 rating will certainly not allow. Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to the fans of the recent Superbad because of the amount of weight he lost in the meantime) is the only asset of the film. His liners were sometimes funny, but certainly not enough to make it bearable. If you just want to completely extinguish your brain (or better still, do not have one), then maybe you will appreciate that, but I can not recommend it at all.
