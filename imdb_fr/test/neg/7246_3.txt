I saw this film this morning on TCM. Very bad acting, low budget and mediocre plot are the impressions I felt watching the movie. The only highlight of the film was watching the young and tender Rita Moreno, 23, playing an Indian teenage squaw in love with an older man in his fifties. She reminded me of an earlier version of Sue Lyon under the name Lolita (1962), with the exception of a more innocent Lolita. She bounces like a bopper from the 1950s, as if she could be expected to chew on chewing gum, falling on that old man, ready to give everything to him, because he plays it as if it were bothering him. Any man in his fifties who had a beautiful virgin teenager eager to do ANYTHING for him and who would be his fianc√©e would be crazy not to enjoy it. It is unfortunate that the censorship commission that reigned at the release of this film does not allow the expansion of a character like that of Rita Moreno. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is the appearance of Rita Moreno in the movie.
