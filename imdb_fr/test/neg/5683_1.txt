I had never heard of a zero-budget "author," Neil Johnson, before seeing "Battlespace" on DVD at Hollywood Video. A few minutes after the beginning of the film, I realize that it is not a bad thing. Like many sci-fi movies that are directly video-oriented, this is a film dominated by bad effects and a constant parade of pretentious science-fiction concepts that fail to create a story. <br /> <br /> Spectators are tortured with an introduction of religious-sounding text, then a spoken introduction followed by a narration by the main character's daughter. For me, it looked like a smokescreen to hide a movie with ugly militant visuals and a void accent. Some people here seem too willing to take this film seriously and have swallowed its seemingly new line of messages and weight. These favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can deceive themselves into thinking that "Battlefield Earth" was a brilliant film or that Shasta is just as good as Coca-Cola. <br /> <br /> attracted by the art of cheesecloth, one can expect unhealthy games (in small doses, spaced from long blocks of people who do not speak), to computer-animated effects rotten (at very large doses) and irritating talking computers. What you will not get is excitement, emotional stimulation, a memorable dialogue or a good story. <br /> <br /> "Battlespace" is an impenetrable bull and the constant irritating narration proves it. True science fiction, hell, movie making are characters and their dialogues, not special effects and boring predictions. This is just down with similar direct to sci-fi video like "Cl.One" and "Recon 2022". If the boredom of "Strange Horizons" and "Alien Visitor" is something you are looking for, by all means, watch for the situation. If you like to tell stories and you hate fake flares, you'd better watch a real movie.
