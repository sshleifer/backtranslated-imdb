Back in the cold and goose bumps of the early '90s, a show called "Family Matters" appeared and became an instant classic. The trick was to buy a textbook in classic family situations and their solutions and to insert some sarcastic remarks. a nice little flight, it's wrong, the parents are right. Bickley-Warren had a new ambitious plan: to redo exactly the same show. <br /> <br /> Here's the difference: "Family Matters" had Urkel. "Step by step" to the guy of these "Kickboxer", which no one has seen. He says things like "dudette" and "the Dane-meister," and in one way or another, the public is still not supposed to hate him. I mean seriously, "dudette"? How can you even get that between your lips? <br /> <br /> The rest of the population consisted mostly of white versions of the entire Winslow group, combined with other one-dimensional or null characters, such as dumb dude (JT Well, Eddie), girl Smart (Laura) and a pretty girl who spends her days being pretty (in theory). The development of the character was awful in this show. Grover and The Cookie Monster have more depth than the Lambert family. Everyone just milked their stereotypes for what they were worth. They were not worth much. <br /> <br /> Animated by a huge band of laughter and joy stolen from something fun, this show was broadcast for 7 years, which was humiliating for the competition. It should be noted that we live in a time when family sitcoms were almost all great successes. Everyone just ignored their craziness because it was the '90s. Another crappy show did not hurt.
