Let me tell you something ... this film goes beyond all of Troma's movies of laughter and sadness, because it really tries to become a serious movie. From the terrible acting game ... "I knew it, I knew she was possessed!" ... to the priest accepting sexual favors and taking showers with naked teens ... this piece of dung takes the cake. I try to compare that to another film just as badly. It may just be in a class of its own. The kicker is the one who is supposed to have some cardinals supervise the production to make sure that it is true to the actual situation. I did not know the Backwoods USA people behaved like fools. I do not know if I am upset to have rented it or if I came across a jewel of comedy. It was a very guilty pleasure ... so horrible that I was looking at my eyes half the time (while I was not laughing so hard I was crying). The end simply did not make sense, uniting everything perfectly. If you want to watch something as horrible as it is funny, here is your movie. If you want a horror movie about exorcism, move on.
