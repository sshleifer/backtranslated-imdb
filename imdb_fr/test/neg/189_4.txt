In 1904, Tangier, a wealthy American and his two children are kidnapped by Berbers, murderous desert pirates who despise the Moroccan government and, in doing so, remove the "American plague", which attracts the attention of US President Theodore Roosevelt . The fictional historical epic is less of a grand adventure than a somewhat exhaustive retrospective to 1940s desert sheikh movies (with a bit of "The King and I" interjected). Sean Connery and Candice Bergen could play in two entirely different films (neither of them seems to know how far to carry the elements of the camp of their characters and their dialogues). seems singularly without proper direction). The various recesses and anecdotes (and anonymous) that occur are arbitrary: we do not know any of these victims, and the big action scenes become blurry, noisy montages of violence swept by sand on horseback. Highlights: a highly praised score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar nominee, but a loser of John Williams' "Jaws"), a good shooting and a cinematography. * 1/2 of ****
