"The James Dean Story" is presented as "Another type of film", explaining: "The presence of the main character in this film was made possible through the use of existing film material, tape recordings of his voice and means of a new technique - dynamic exploration of still photography. "The only" recordings of his voice "notable are a short recording of Mr. Dean during a visit to his family in Indiana; he wanted to record all the family memories of his great-grandfather, Cal Dean, intrigued by the fact that he had played the same title "Cal" in "East of Eden". Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art and learns that the parent was an auctioneer. James Dean was interested in art and obviously had a warm relationship with his family. This is the only 100% accurate revelation of this documentary. James Dean was interested in art and had a warm relationship with his family. <br /> <br /> An incredible "screen test" / "movie release" of "East of Eden" appears near the end of the film. It's a black and white scene between Dean (Cal Trask) and Richard Davalos (Aron Trask). Dean is at his best hypnotic. If this scene only appeared here and no film "East of Eden" was finished, this documentary would be an essential and high quality film. But the scene, a perfect "10" isolated, must be considered as an "extra of Eden". Dean's "Road Safety Film" is also worth a visit. <br /> <br /> Scheduled interviews with family and friends are expected. My favorites were the guy (Lew Bracker) who was handling a box of things Dean had left with him and his family. There was not enough aunt Ortense and Dean's letter to his little cousin was very kind. Further reading of Dean's letters would have been welcome. Dean's unidentified writer friend seemed to have a better thesis for the film; filmmakers may have considered developing it as a primary goal. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman's direction to read Martin Gabel's screenplay for Stewart Stern is daunting. What were they thinking? Maybe filmmakers can be forgiven because of the proximity of Dean's death. Do not expect "The James Dean Story" at all. This film talks more about the effect of Dean on people (fans and filmmakers) than man. This is very clearly one of the first pieces of the "legend" of James Dean that created a myth. Tommy Sands sings "Let me be loved". The story refers to Dean as "he" with an air god. The photos of Dean's family seeming to "know" at the time of his death are really miserable. <br /> <br /> ** The Story of James Dean (13/08/57) Robert Altman ~ James Dean, Martin Gabel, Richard Davalos
