Steven Seagal has played in many action movies. Most of them were bad but not bad like The Patriot. This one is a low budget action movie of the Z series. After the Delta Force operation, Act of War, The Substitute 2, Plato's Run, The Base, Drive, Sabotage, etc., comes the Patriot. Now, Steven Seagal is sure to be considered a bad actor like Mark Dacascos, Van Damme's Jean-Claude, Treat Williams, Scalia Jack, Gary Busey, Chuck Norris, Michael Madsen and many others. The screenplay was full of holes and the characters were not realistic (maybe because of the very bad actors) and the $ 4.25 you spend renting The Patriot is called Lost Money !!! I give him 0 and a half (for laughs) out of 5.
