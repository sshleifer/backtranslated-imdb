Yes, of course, it's Friday, December 13, but I have no problem with that. It's a good effort, the murders are not so bloody but a girl's game is wearing the movie, what a shouting queen, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie, the effects are well done, okay, sometimes you can guess how to do it. Some people have problems with the use of the camera, I do not see what's wrong with that. It's so strange that so many people do not like this movie, I really enjoyed it. Of course, the script is not original, but give me a template, I mean, a lot of slashers are made in the woods. it may be quite predictable but it's worth seeing, I've seen a lot worse, I can tell you that
