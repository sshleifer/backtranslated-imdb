When I saw the first Octopus movie, it was funny to see the unhealthy game and its awful effects. This film seemed to compensate for the acting, but not the special effects. After Jaws and Piranha, why not shoot a movie on a murderous octopus? The octopus invades the waters of New York, where 2 police investigators try to stop the wild beast before July 4th. <br /> <br /> A nice plot and descent events although the octopus is appalling, it's beautiful to see. they did succeed this time, but it looked like a piece of plastic ... Better yet, with a big budget, this movie could have been a good watch. There are a lot of mistakes that would not surprise me if they did not do research on the octopus lifestyle ... <br /> <br /> Look at this if you like cheap DVD suites otherwise you'd better watch Jaws.
