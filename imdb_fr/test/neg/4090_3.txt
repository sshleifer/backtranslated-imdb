This film was a failure as a comedy and film in general. It was a very slow-moving movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a clich√©, a hopeless mess to begin with. This film tackles a shameless environmental point, even making self-rush to destroy an SUV and promote Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> Looking at me, I could not help but notice that Steve Carell had no more than one really funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically qualify this as comic is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes. His character gets frequent lines and worthy of nibbling where they do not fit at all. <br /> <br /> Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blows all his record budget on special effects machines that are barely moving forward the plot. The film passes the first half of the construction of Evan's ark, but in the end we learn that the ark had no meaning, and that the plot was no longer used to contain only stupid gags and even more stupid messages. The film ends when we learn that the whole ark, the floods and the animal gatherings were only a weak political declaration of none other than God. Yes, God was trying to influence politics.
