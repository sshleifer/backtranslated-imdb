I looked at him with great apprehension and it was well founded, it seems. What was the film about? Knight? The season? The players? What? It was everywhere all the time. There was no tension (sorry, we all knew that Bobby was going to curse and throw things) but Brian Denehy, a good actor, appears as a mailing in anger and zero tension. Shooting cheaply, like an episode of MacGiver. Contrast this Thanksgiving main course with the work that HBO did on Don King's "only in the US" movie to show how to do sports biopics, warts, etc. Note that ESPN promoted hell out of all this and never showed it again?
