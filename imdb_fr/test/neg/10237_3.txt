"The Racketeer" features Carol (private "e" who usually appears at the end of her first name) Lombard is a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violin (Roland Drew), since becoming alcoholic, she is torn between his love for him and the interests of the crime king of New York, Robert Armstrong (upscale). It's almost a digest of what was wrong with the very first talkies: rigid steering, stationary cameras, slow play and ridiculously slow line delivery. At the time, the sound crews told the directors to make sure that their actors speak each line and not to start talking before the former actor has finished theirs. Made about five years later, the film might have been interesting, but director Howard Higgin scrupulously follows the dictations of his recorder and systematically defeats the talents we already know from Lombard and Armstrong. "The Racketeer" was manufactured in 1929, a year that despite the problems of transition from silence to sound has nevertheless given us some legitimate masterpieces ?? "Alleluia!" From Vidor! "Mamoulian Applause", "The Heroes of Hell" by Wyler, "The Ladies of Leisure" by Capra ?? all from directors with the will strong enough to tell the dictators of the soundboard to stuff themselves and let their actors speak and act in a naturalistic way. Too bad that Howard Higgin is not that strong; As such, watching a fast-paced, natural actor like Armstrong sneak through the role of the ridiculous way he was charged, one can not help but wonder where this 50 foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs him.
