The worst part of all is the weakness of the scripts, leading to a superficial game. <br /> <br /> Dreyfuss's character is extremely repetitive and boring, and Dreyfuss himself has a boring face to match. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter's character is overly egocentric, and Hunter herself abandons herself to serious passions, as usual. <br /> <br /> Brad Johnson was in wood. John Goodman made the most of it. <br /> <br /> In addition, everything related to death / ghost has since been somewhat exaggerated and now seems rather lame. <br /> <br /> Barely observable if you like old planes.
