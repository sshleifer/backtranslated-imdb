it's probably one of the worst gay-themed movies of all time. Who told one of the so-called actors that they can act. Bad sound - bad scenario - gestures so excessive that they defy reality. A nightclub scene with a single actor and dubbed crowd scenes. <br /> <br /> After seeing other low budget movies in the same way, I prepared for something innovative - but not quite pathetic. <br /> Parents and friends should really encourage no one to make such guts. <br /> <br /> And the DVD - No access to the menu; it's worse than a VHS tape. Once you've started, you have to watch everything - luckily the fast forward button works - with this movie and this DVD, nothing else.
