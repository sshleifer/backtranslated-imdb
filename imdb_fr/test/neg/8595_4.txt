If you can watch a movie without worrying about intrigue or nerdy acting, then Backdraft is definitely the right one. <br /> <br /> However, if, like me, you like watching movies you can believe, then Backdraft has some serious flaws. It does not offer anything new, and hundreds of action movies of the 90s follow identical formulas, without being so clumsy. <br /> <br /> After two exchanges of fire, I tell myself that it must go elsewhere, how many big fires there are in a city? Are firefighters surely doing something else, like taking cats out of the trees? I was wrong and the repetition continues over and over until the end. <br /> <br /> A good aspect of the film is the fire itself, well filmed, and I must say that I felt very hot watching this, suggesting that two hours spent watching the fire without story or game would have been more suited to my tastes.
