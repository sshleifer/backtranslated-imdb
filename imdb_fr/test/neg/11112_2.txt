Chupacabra Terror: 2/10: The Navy Seal team has tipped the balance between poor quality movies and bad movies. Until then, there was a lot of bad luggage but the seals ?? They wear bicycle helmets painted black. You know those with ventilation holes that make every adult wearing them look like a complete tool. Of course, the wolf fishing boat they took to host the cruise ship could have been another clue (he would not manage to cross Tampa Bay without talking about an ocean) ?? and their tactics would have no influence on a third-class XBOX game. <br /> <br /> Does director John Shepphird have pictures of John Rhys-Davies in a compromising position with a Hobbit? Because I can not think of any other reason why he would be in this movie. The other actors have a good excuse. These are hacks without talent and without charm that could not be hired for an infomercial. The plot is that two men are trying to introduce the mythical Chupacabra (love by saying that name) aboard a cruise ship and it comes off. <br /> <br /> The set consists of a horrible cruise ship fakery a small apartment), the monster killings are at the bottom of the barrel, there is no nudity and a lot of really bad actors refuse to finish their death scenes. The gigolo character of a 60s film by Doris is particularly annoying. <br /> <br /> The distribution bleeds ketchup while the Chupacabra bleeds green day in the black blood. (Why does a Mexican mammal who eats a goat bleed if everyone bleeds, but the red does not pass me.) <br /> <br /> Every B-movie has a turning point that makes it a fun time eaten is his own eyeballs) or not so amusing (Did they just call those forty overweight people wearing a biker's suit and helmet, the Navy Seals?) Chupacabra falls into the not-so-fun side of movie B with a thud.
