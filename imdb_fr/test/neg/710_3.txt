Oh, why did it end like this? The latest film by Laurel and Hardy, ranging from the theme of the cuckoo roughly staged (with a false credit to Hal Roach) to the last "Nice mess" / "I could not help it" schtick is the duo like a grotesque parody apart. Between the two, their relationship is now only built of uncertain acts, asin dialogue and heartless stick. People are a king of New York, but Chaplin's last dismissal was far from being so outrageous. <br /> <br /> What really hurts someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the appearance of the two comedians. The video jacket that I hold shows at their best, all their boyish smiles and their glowing skin, with a text on the back saying "The picture on this cover is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film "Necessarily? He does not even come near. The film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photographs that adorn the cover, with Ollie, who is overweight. It's not funny, nor comically, fat, as it would normally appear, but frowned upon and on the verge of obesity. He would have died seven years after the making of this film, after a series of blows. Stan, meanwhile, suffering from a prostrate problem and dysentery, looks macabre while his weight has fallen sharply. Whenever something bad happens to him, like getting caught between a lifeboat and a table, you fear for his life. Even Ollie giving him a traditional slap makes you terrified, he could be killed. After the end of this film, it will last another fifteen years and will eventually die of a heart attack in 1965. It is disturbing to think of such cherished artists aging and dying of painful deaths. And it is heartbreaking to see their screen deteriorate both in terms of health and performance. When I, and almost everyone, like to think about Laurel and Hardy, I think of Way Out West, Busy Bodies, or Our Relationships. To see them in such poor physical health and perform disastrous routines at the end of their career is a scourge for my happiest memories. <br /> <br /> The precursors are clear from the opening credits, which list not only four writers, but also someone to propose the concept and a credit for "gags". So, if Monty Collins wrote the "gags", what were the other four writings? And in that case, why did Monty Collins pay a fee, given that there is no evidence of a single "gag" in the entire movie? More than 40% of the film is dedicated to traveling on the island of the same name, during which we experience some of the most painful scenes ever experienced by boys. When I saw the bat scene, I wanted to curl up and die, it was so great. child unfitness. Yet, what kills the film is that all actors are dubbed, unable to speak English. Not only does this make the film disjoint, but it also exhausts Stan's and Ollie's reactions to their co-stars. Rather directed with horrendous movies and an absolutely atrocious editing, that totally denies the 2 million dollars that would have been spent. Frankly, it sounds awful, and even though a DVD output might clean the image, the sound and image quality is far below that of their work for Hal Roach. <br /> <br /> The "friends" of Stan and Olli, Giovani and Antoine are non-charismatic guys who stand out from Laurel and Hardy's obsolete repertoire. This is another major problem of the film, in that none of the supporting characters are funny or integrate the innocent mentality of the boys. The doubled hardness shown to L & H ("you-the-fat") makes them stand out as isolated social misfits, rather than adorable sub-anarchists. There is evidence of a darker political satire - although this is not the case with Duck Soup - and the concept of an island without rules is an interesting subject. Perhaps more relevant than ever, a film that examines the problems of immigration and the US Constitution suddenly becomes the most relevant topic in 2003. Unfortunately, beyond a fun scene where Stan is elected " the people ", that really go anywhere. And that kind of black humor has its limits - or is a Laurel and Hardy movie where rape is directly involved and where Stan threatens a man with a bottle, only to accidentally put someone in the glass, your idea of good time? After all the years Stan and Ollie shared a bed, we also have a specific reference: Stan accidentally kissed him - Ollie wipes the kiss in disgust. The fact that Antoine and his illegal immigrant friend, Antoine, ends his life with a lion, is also worrying. Mind you, I never thought I would see a Laurel and Hardy movie where they were to be hanged. The need for an intrusive and not funny narration is a further sign of the confusion that reigns in the American version (the same version available on video) pirating 16 minutes in vain to improve it. <br /> <br /> Almost completely unassailable, this horribly merciless film only serves to tarnish the reputation of Stan and Ollie - to be avoided at all costs.
