Of course, when I had the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a film, my expectations were rather low. They were not low enough. Professor Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow acquired the production rights of the Marvel comic characters in the late 80s or early 90s, and passed it on to Oley Sassone, whose directorial work was largely broadcast in television series like Hercules and 'Vip√®re'. With an estimated total budget of $ 1.5 million, the film was produced, shot and briefly broadcast on video, then sent to the wasteland of the forgotten film. Here it should have stayed. However, like a banana peel in a vaudeville issue, these "Fantastic Four" remain in the ether waiting to cause a real failure for those rare people unlucky enough and crazy enough to cross it. <br /> <br /> If you've ever heard of these comic book characters, you know what to expect. The authors of this film were very loyal to the source, and that's the only thing they deserve credit for in this fiasco. This presents the origins of the heroic group that develops superhuman powers when the shielding of their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes' Mr. Fantastic'. His girlfriend, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) may become invisible, and her brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood), can spontaneously cause a fire in her body. Finally, Ben Grimm ("credited" by Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Ciafarlio) receives superhuman strength when his skin turns into a stone-like hyde and is then called The Thing. There is a prologue in which a former Reed classmate, Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp), became their enemy, Dr. Doom, who orchestrates the sabotage of the Fantastic Four spaceflight as revenge for the wounds. that he blamed Reed. . There is the setting up, then the discovery of the powers, the revelation of the villain and finally a decisive fight. The poorly written script contains more details, but they are negligible. <br /> <br /> It's a film that was created simply because the creators (I use that in the technical sense of the word, a lot of creative imagination at work here) had the legal rights to do. The plot will undoubtedly be reflected in the planned release of the big budget planned by Tim Story in 2005, but tackling a major project like this one, without comparable budget or qualified actors, is an act of cinematic madness. . Existing special effects are mainly hand-drawn or simple camera tours that have existed since the time of the first major train flight. When half of the decisive battle comes back to a full animation, you are almost relieved to see a cartoon instead of the poor actors who have been condemned to be part of the project. There is also very little style consistency in this mess. Most scenes are shot flat in bright or wild primary colors, and the only dressed up sets are the most obvious science fiction pieces. There is some camera work, but it's mainly about keeping the characters centered on the screen and providing a minimum of information to the audience. Editing involves leaving extra lines and using obvious wipes (at one point, there is even a transition using the number 4 center). The editing tricks are even used to supplement the mediocre special effects when transforming The Thing. The only scene in which morphing technology was used was shocking only by the quality of its work. <br /> <br /> The limited work of the cameras is not unforgivable. In 'Clerks', only the most basic camera movements are used and there is almost no style. It worked for this film because it was about people whose lives did not have a style and that was consistent. Kevin Smith never let his reach go beyond his reach. "The Blair witches project" has caused some motion sickness in some audiences, due to the jerky manipulation of this pseudo documentary. In the end, it was an effective job on the terror of getting lost and being consumed by a scary situation. There is no sense of history or theme here, either visually or visually. With this 'Fantastic Four', you never risk accidentally laughing at the fact that filmmakers and performers seem to be competing with other comic books with this poorly budgeted entry. <br /> <br /> Every film requires a lot of time and work. It's so sad that so much has been invested in a project like this. If you are one of those who participated in this, it was probably done as a stepping stone on the road to a career in cinema (hopefully improved). Everyone knows how to take jobs to make the most of what seems like an opportunity. For those who are curious to watch this movie, my advice is to only do it with a group of friends (so you can all point fingers and say "you've watched it too") knowledgeable about the experience (so no one gets hurt) of shock), and maybe you can imagine a drinking game to relieve the pain between accidental laughter. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
