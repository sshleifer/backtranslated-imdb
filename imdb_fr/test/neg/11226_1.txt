I guess they reward the stupidity today because the one who proposed the concept of this film was not shot in plain sight. <br /> <br /> It's a pure delight. The worst stereotypes of all ghetto and high school movies are dragged and made even more unbearable. Each character in this film has a sob story that goes beyond sympathy. Pray for a remake where the whole school is destroyed. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** how does such a dilapidated school already have internet?
