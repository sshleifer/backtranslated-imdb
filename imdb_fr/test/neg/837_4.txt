The film begins with a dandy shootout, where three bandits are quickly gunned down by a bounty hunter - a bounty hunter who is not limited to a superficial man to the unnamed man of the Clint Eastwood trilogy (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR THE FEW DOLLARS PLUS AND THE GOOD BAD AND THE OLD. <br /> <br /> Immediately after, you see this man in a gold train filled with Union soldiers.Of course, the consignment is attacked and the soldiers are all fighting like blind men, so they are quickly neutralized, but one of the bandits cheats the gang leader (Gilbert Roland) and wins the gold, and soon Roland makes up for it and is about to find out where gold is hidden, but at that moment the army arrives and kills the traitor, but the candidate Man With No Name thinks that Roland knows the treasure and that a medallion offered to Roland by the traitor is the key A strange banker is also thrown into the mix. want gold and all three seem pretty macho. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not a particularly distinguished West. This is largely intrigue, especially because George Hilton (a Uruguayan despite the American-sounding name) is not as interesting as Eastwood or some of the other stars in the Premier Spaghetti Western group, but most of time because the soundtrack is just nil. Very often, the music does not even match the actor and seems almost randomly added. Plus, it's just not very good. This is clearly not the work of Ennio Morricone - a master of music of the Spaghetti genre. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just a time-saver - and not particularly good to start.
