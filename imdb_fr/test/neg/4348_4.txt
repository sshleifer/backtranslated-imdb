It's a shame to throw such a good idea. The main idea of ​​the film is to travel in previous lives which - thankfully - is not a trip back in time, but a journey inside the man who has nothing to do with the past or the past. 'to come up. (Maybe they should not have been called past lives in the movie now that I think about it ... another minus, I suppose). Everything is in the present, in a different space ... Very interesting without causing much religious sorrow. <br /> <br /> However, the music is totally repetitive, melodramatic, sentimental and misplaced (not to mention "western"). There should have been more variety and reflection on where there should be music and which should not, and the romantic back-and-forth scenes take a lot of time and space. The acting is not bad, although the language has prevented me from better understanding. <br /> <br /> I think the idea required a little more thought, development and interior scenes might have better background settings, because in many cases they seem unreal, overall I would say that this movie leaves a lot to be desired ...
