I have watched this movie twice in the past six months (what I experienced so you do not have to). The first viewing left me half crazy and babbling.The second viewing at 5am, a rainy morning, was a little better.I <br /> <br /> Seems that Pocona (the Aztec mummy) had a crush for a certain Aztec princess who was "supposed to keep her young daughter". Obviously, they gave themselves what they had to do and were sheltered from death for her. (Now, it's serious!) But before they are finished, the film tries to kill us with an Aztec ceremony that is heard. The song will bleed your ears. <br /> <br /> usual nonsense of reincarnation. Not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate and a bracelet kept by this slob, Pocona.By this time, Pocona appears to be on a bender 2000 years and after the profaners of his grave. bad revenge case of Montezuma (or he read the script of this movie). This will silence your breath. <br /> <br /> An evil Dr. Von Krupp seems to want the Aztec treasure (possibly to finance drama classes and screenwriting classes) His name is The Bat because in The Curse of the Aztec Mummy he He wore a bat like a cape, a hat and a kind of ski mask on his face. He's better than the Fat Man who laughs. <br /> <br /> The bat in the fashion of crazy scientists wants to rule the world. He emphasizes this by rolling his eyes, laughing manically and chewing the landscape. He paved an invincible robot. It seems that the bot was made from a garbage can, a chandelier and a grill. Buick from 1957. This will make your eyes bleed. A company even takes credit for making this tin! <br /> <br /> The powerful confrontation between Pocona and the robot takes place in the new crypt of the mother, who became homeless sooner. <br /> <br /> About half of this film is from "The Aztec Momia" never released in the United States in its original form but in a jealous atrocity of Jerry Warren (see my article on "Attack of the Mummy" maya ") and" Curse Of The Aztec Mom ". The robot is frankly stupid, as are most characters. If that does not happen and the plot does not make you scream with laughter, nothing will. <br /> <br /> My first impression was so bad that she would have one. But after seeing "Mayan Mummy" (a movie that deserves to be burned) and watching "Robot" again, he gets a 3. You have to look at this without any waiting. Then it can be naively pleasant.
