I have never commented on IMDb, but since I saw this movie, I can not be silent. I just created my account here only because this horrible movie. in a nutshell, this film is PURE CRAP. the film does not make sense! Nothing makes sense in this movie. Watching this movie was painful to the end. I do not understand why Val Kilmer agreed to make this film. He plays a minor role as gang leader, says a few words and he is there for a total of 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD only because of the name of Val Kilmer on the box and interesting pictures on the cover. <br /> <br /> As stated in another review, Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back !!! The title of the film itself has brought the slightest idea of ​​the note that everyone should give it: ZERO
