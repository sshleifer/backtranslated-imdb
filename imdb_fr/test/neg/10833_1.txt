Even a horrible 1 is too much for this movie, everything from start to finish makes you cringe. I do not think it would be possible to group together too clich√© moments in one and the same piece of mind numbed by anesthetic film loss. <br /> <br /> Prisoner H cell block meets the Thunderbirds. than his son. <br /> <br /> I have not even finished looking at this and I'm here now ... Oh no, applause to cheese from 3 actors and a backdrop made by a child adobe premiere. It's really the end of my phase "I started and so I'll finish watching it". <br /> <br /> Oh, the credits came to save me. (and relax)
