The plot - in the future when almost all men were killed by a virus targeting the Y chromosome, a genetic engineer ("hot") "creates" a man in a chemistry lab - intrigue. Despite the somewhat promising premises, the film falls flat in almost every respect. The dialogue is laughable. The characters are very fine. The exploration of a unique gender world is superficial. The most difficult part of all the film is the Asian detective who delivers lines so nerdy and artificial that you'll want to throw up. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how this junk was produced. Most of the film is masculine bashing. "All men are violent." "All men rape women." "Men are only animals." All women - even "isolated cases" - seem to show their anger, fear and hatred towards men. If you want to see a sci-fi movie in the sense of its premise, you'd better look elsewhere.
