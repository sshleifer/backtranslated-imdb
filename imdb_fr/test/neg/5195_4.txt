If I had known what I was submitting to, I would have fled the theater. The film is appalling, in the literal sense of the word. In spite of striking images, fascinating places and a subject that could have been fascinating, the film is dead. <br /> <br /> I did not know this period of Greek history and I was ready to live a great movie. The filmmaker's hand is heavy. it is not enough to see a train go by; we have to watch it from a distance, we have to watch it by car, we have to see the smoke, we have to see it slow down and we have to see it stop. The director's approach is didactic. Similarly, the characters he creates never develop, they never change. They are so stereotyped that we wonder, are they supposed to be all the time? All the girls? Everyoldmusician? Does this allegory make sense? It's the most pretentious movie I've seen in a long time.
