I must admit that I enjoyed the previous episodes, but probably because I was younger and stupid at the time. I was a little excited by the family member's return until I saw the "new" shit they were going out. No surprise, it was just like old shit. All the lame jokes were there, including the flashbacks, except this time they added a joke about an old terrifying pedophile who seems to be part of EACH EPISODE. it's one of the boring gags of the family, and for some reason people are watching it. it's not funny, it's just boring. let him die. <br /> <br /> Maybe the family member was funny at one point and the cheap laughter and gags were fresh and original, but it's just not funny anymore. if you actually find a funny family member, you must be delayed or slightly delayed.
