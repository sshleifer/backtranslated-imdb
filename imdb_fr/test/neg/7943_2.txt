This film definitely made me laugh but that does not mean it was really funny. Once again, my friends and I had a lot of fun watching them. <br /> <br /> I doubt that this movie did anything that was shot at least twice before, just like the plot. All characters are cardboard box roles of overused movie clich√©s that do not even require acting skills; as a result, these skills are not delivered. We have the corrupt policeman, a ruthless killer who claims to care about his men and their families without worrying about the people he fires on his forehead so close that he has blood on his face. We have the "cop on the edge" so well indicated on the discussion forums of this film; we have the former policeman of a day who has almost everyone must have immediately recognized that he was the most likely man on the inside because he had the most to gain and he did not utter a word trustworthy throughout the film. As clear as a glass house on a sunny day. The great king of the black gangsters was a copy of all the great kings of the black gangsters in the history of cinema (they could have called it simply Marcellus Wallace), but a little harder and more ruthless, because it must be emphasized that we we also know Laurence Fishburne from really good movies. Finally, we finally have the doctor HIGHLY EDUCATED who finds it unreasonable to do as soon as the situation differs from his ordinary life and who spends most of the film in a corner trying desperately to find a way to hold on. the weapon she was given. NOT USED. <br /> <br /> The whole history of the seat is neither interesting nor original (having already been used twice before), and this film adds absolutely nothing of interest. There is the initial investigation, then the setting up of the seat, then the assault, then the attempts of escape. Meanwhile, stressed, stressed and panicked policemen and thugs manage to retain a police assault team with high-tech equipment and the significant advantage of VISION. Again, in the deep night, because of the power outage and a snowstorm, there is certainly a lot of light coming in, so who really is interested in night vision. <br /> <br /> But the best side of the night comes. just at the end. In the first scenes showing Precinct 13, we see that it is located in a suburb of an industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it on all sides. From there, the besieged walk maybe a hundred meters into a sewer and where do they end? A lane ending in the forest! A FOREST! Where does this forest come from? Who decided to plant a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? How is the forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill overlooking the city in question, while in the scenes inside the forest it looked falsely FLAT? <br /> <br /> From here, I leave you judgment and your common sense. Go see this movie if you are looking for a good laugh involuntarily, I can really recommend it.
