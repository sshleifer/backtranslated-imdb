I had high hopes for this one until they changed the name to "The Shepherd: Border Patrol", the most clumsy movie name of all time, which was wrong with "The Shepherd ". It's an action movie by the numbers that tilts the scales in many of Van Damme's classic films. There is a bit of action in a bar that made me think of a difficult target and a universal soldier, but led without intensity or flair, which is a shame. There is an excellent phrase about "being drunk and wearing a rabbit" and some acceptable action scenes left behind by the low price of it all. Often, the dialogues do not match the character's mouth and the stuntmen fall dead for a fraction of a second before being shot. The final fight is one of Van Damme's best fights, except that the director tries to go a little too far, John Woo, and also fails by introducing flashbacks that nobody really cares about hinders the action, which is the very purpose of the film van Damme. <br /> <br /> Not good, not bad, just a generic generic action.
