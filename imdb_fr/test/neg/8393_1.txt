If it's an art and essay film, there is not enough art, let alone the essay. <br /> <br /> If it's a thriller, there's not enough thriller. <br /> <br /> If this is the case of a teen drama, there is not enough drama, and as far as adolescents are concerned, there is not enough NOFX and too many Nino Rota. <br /> <br /> I thought it might be a trailer for Tony Hawk's upcoming movie, but there's no Tony Hawk, so I guess I was cheated: it's not is not the biographical film of Tony Hawk. <br /> <br /> If it's an action movie, it misses explosions, which would have added extra interest to it, or at least it would have had to blow up the sleepers on their chairs. <br /> <br /> Most characters seem to be dead inside, but it's not a zombie movie. In fact, if it is a film, the plot is insufficient. If it's not a movie, it's too long to be a music video. <br /> <br /> If it's a music video, well ... it's an album I will not buy
