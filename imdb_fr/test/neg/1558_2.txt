Zarkorr is a bad movie. That does not even mean that his good category is bad. It's just bad. From (lack of) stage set to acting, to special effects, everything in this movie stinks. For starters, the film seems to have been shot in empty rooms, with some added accessories to make it beautiful. Then we play so badly that a high school play gives the impression of being an Oscar nominee. And to top it off, there are the special effects that are so serious that they look like an amateur who ripped them out of their garage. The cities that the monster is supposedly crushing look like my nephew's train. So, obviously, they simulate that they shout at the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is the monster costume. It's just too bad that they spent all their budget for that and left nothing for the rest of the movie. And maybe a decent script would have helped too.
