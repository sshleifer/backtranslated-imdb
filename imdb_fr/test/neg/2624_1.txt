Lazy movie directed by a lazy director. The characters are grotesque. Despite the tragedy of this war, there is no emotion in the film. The symbolism is artificial and ineffective (and an old Bosnian woman giving a picture of her son in Arbor will "concretize" his will, wake up the sleeping super-mother in her, a corpse devoured by worms to show the horror of the genocide .. too much is sometimes worse than not enough). <br /> <br /> This film is just an advertisement, an empty elegy for a woman who is not a hero. She worked for the United Nations. Remember that the UN failed to protect civilians in Srebrenica. Who are the true heroes of this war? A Canadian judge at the head of a post-mortem trial for atrocities that occurred mainly because her organization failed to prevent them? Where is the criticism in this film?
