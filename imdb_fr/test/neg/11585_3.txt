Another low-budget science-fiction television show ridiculously lame and insane ?? but in fact it's rather fun ?? type of?? in a rather undemanding manner. Am I sweet? I do not know why they offer these titles. Yes, there is a komodo. And yes there is a cobra. But what is the problem with 'versus' between the two? Of course, they come to blows ?? in just two sequences (one recapitulating one incident and the other being the shady culmination) and some rather boring exchanges that I could add. This gathering is the same old program of scientific experiment that consists of losing control of an isolated island (no dinosaurs), and innocent bystanders (ecologists wishing to denounce animal testing) find themselves there. This sees a komodo dragon and a cobra become a gigantic statue, the government wanting soon to destroy all kinds of evidence (including witnesses) of its existence by exploding the island. This leaves the survivors running against the clock to find a way out. There were well-known clips: CGI video games, hack script, some dubious decors (although the scenery of the tropical island was nice to look at), disposable characters (but I found the performances well kept) in using the same repetitive shot of the victim who was standing right there, terrorized, implying that I was waiting, please, eat me now, I'm not going anywhere and finally, they were swallowed whole? second puff to finish them off or just to save the worries by crushing them stupidly) and a very hysterical edge with some kind of miserable message among the acts of survival. Director Jim Wynorski seems to be on control of the cruise throughout. Michael Par√© has fun with his wry dialogues and Michelle Borth has added much needed sparks. Renee Talbert is there to pout, with great success too.
