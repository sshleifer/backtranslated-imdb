This film was pure torture, slow and painful. Not being a fan of slasher, and preferring the classic horror, I may not be the best judge. Slasher fans may appreciate this as an early entry into the slasher genre. I would really like the 90 minutes I spent watching that. The only reasons to look at this are 1) a young Vanna White (who has already spent about 3 minutes of time in front of the screen). 2) an early role of Queen Screamer Linnea Quigley (with nudity) and legendary beauty EJ Peaker as a school secretary, which added a bit of humor and sex appeal. Otherwise, an 80's band called Felony makes an appearance that, although interesting, hangs out too long. Just like the movie ..... I had to check how much time I had left and I could not wait to "get" a better movie.
