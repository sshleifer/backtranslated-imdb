How was this character hired by the post office far beyond me? The test that postal workers are doing is so difficult. It's impossible for such a stupid guy to work at the post office. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and that's probably the purpose of the movie. How they could spend all their lives without seeing an elevator is also disconcerting. I did not take this movie too seriously, but it was so stupid. Then he tries to start the car without his keys? Many horrible scenes and horrible actors and this movie is not funny at all. It's just a stupid and stupid mess. However, I liked the dress of the moms. <br /> <br /> Send it to the sender as soon as possible.
