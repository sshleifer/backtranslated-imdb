This film was produced by the biggest producer of Costa Rica. Although their writers boast about it as the greatest Costa Rican film ever made and that their actors even dare to say that they did not get an Oscar nomination because of their political relevance to oil (he he is right) ... Well, all this is a lie. This film was supposed to be based on a book by Carlos Salazar Herrera on a love triangle (about the super-clich√© type soap opera) and his secondary story is about an oil problem on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica with an American oil company that wanted to explore the oil fields on the area, but in the end it was never approved by the government. Now he can have some nice pictures on the beaches, but that's all; nothing bigger than that ... everything is in the camera. Most actors are void except two or three. The rest lacks sense of what it means to act: they react too often. The story is quite common and cliche, worthy of a cheap Mexican soap opera, as I said ... because the team announced it as a protest movie about oil, but that 80% of the film is based on a stupid love triangle. The script is not impressive, it is very simple and dialogues are not very thoughtful. There was also a problem of editing on some changes of scenes ... but in addition, it is rather correct. The director did a decent job, I mean, he does not look like Oliver Stone, but he did his job with the resources he had. I would like to ask him why, instead of using a Costa Rican actor, he spent most of his money on foreign films. I mean, after all, they boasted of being a 100% Costa Rican production ... that's what you'd expect at least. Finale the end is not well done, there are flaws and details that do not match or are useless. In addition to being the most elaborate film in Costa Rican history, I think it's mediocre. You can create more interesting and better images with less money. Ever heard of "Pi"? Anyway, if you are curious about Costa Rican or Central American movies, this one will do the trick, but you will definitely miss nothing.
