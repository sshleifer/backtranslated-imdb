The first two thirds of this film were not so different from the American mummy movies of the 30s and 40s. Two lovers of ancient Mexico dared to defy the law and were sentenced to death. One of them became an Aztec mummy responsible for keeping the sacred treasure and her love. And the lady was reincarnated nowadays and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. So far, it's all the typical film of a mummy ... although it's a little slower and duller than American versions. Oh, and of course, the Aztec mom really looked really bad. <br /> <br /> However, in this standard but boring film, there is a super villain. Why? I do not know - it did not make sense to have one. It seems that this villain wants the treasure and manages to hypnotize the lady and show him where is the Aztec treasure. Why does he need the treasure? Well, to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots, fictitious! But he must first build a single mummy to defeat the mummy, because it was so far unstoppable. <br /> <br /> You must see these "human robots" that look like huge clumsy. Flash Gordon robots and other series BUT they have inside a rubber head of a supposed death! They really look hilariously funny and see the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting in the rest of the boring movie. Both are fighting in super slow motion as if they were bathed in the shot ... and this is so naive and silly, which will certainly cause chuckles - certainly not chills. <br /> <br /> the film is terribly dull and confusing clutter - especially at the end. However, for bad moviegoers, it's a must - it's bad but unintentionally funny and it's good to watch and laugh with friends.
