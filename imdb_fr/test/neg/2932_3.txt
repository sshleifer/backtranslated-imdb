I guess in 1997, Hollywood was not quite about to openly celebrate homosexuality. That is why it might be useful to give credit to those who edited this film for showing a little courage. We just want them to be credited for making a great movie and, in my opinion, "In & Out" is not eligible in this regard. This is the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) - an English teacher in a high school in a small town who, on the eve of his wedding, is being criticized by an Oscar-winning alumna who must then go through what can be described as a period of self-discovery when it comes to accepting to be homosexual. For me, it was the first problem with this movie. Howard did not really need to be gay. The film would have been funnier (and perhaps even more provocative) if Brackett had remained challenging, despite the stereotypically gay aspects of his life and the city's belief after his Oscar speech that he was gay. (In fact, I thought that identifying him as gay given the presence of these stereotypes could have been rather insulting to the gay community, as well as to heterosexual men who love poetry and who believe that it is necessary to Kline was pretty decent in the role and largely carried the film. In addition to him, most other members of the cast (although good actors) were people who were not really known for their success on the big screen. People like Tom Selleck, Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors but not big movie stars. In fact, I thought the most funny (albeit very small) role in the movie was the super model Sonya, played by an actress named Shalom Harlow (Speaking of stereotypes, I loved her so much stereotypical line style " I promised to do this photo session this afternoon, I have to shower and vomit! ") In the end, what really shocked me in this film is the ridiculous end, starting with the ceremony (and, to be honest, even if someone decided that it was really necessary, the film should have stopped there rather than continue with the totally useless wedding at the end.) <br /> < Basically, I had some laughs, but nothing more. 3/10
