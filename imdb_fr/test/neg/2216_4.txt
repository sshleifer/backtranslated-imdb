Of all the screen adaptations of E.R.Burroughs that Doug McClure performed in the 70's, it's the most disconcerting of all. It's so serene that you can taste the dust of the sets and feel the warmth of the lamps above. It looks like a very, very big budget school room, or even a very very small budget action movie, which is what it really is. It has often been said that this was the last entry of its kind, and I hope that was the case. The genus did not die peacefully, but in a horrible agony, in the middle of a lot of smoke, false blood and unpleasant sound effects. Peter Cushing must have felt like a boy again, like a crazy teacher whose shirt is white as snow after the men drag themselves through the muddy holes of Hell. What sport he was, to accept a role in this hodgepodge and wear it with so much courage. <br /> <br /> Entirely shot on a sound stage and accompanied by a synth soundtrack then in fashion and now unbearable, main anti-attraction of this film are the cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always monsters of this type in an adaptation of Burroughs, but they rarely manage to be so ridiculous, helpless, or devoid of credibility. On a few occasions, during the high action-fight scenes in which Mr. McClure heroically attacks creatures, you can almost hear the empty hollow sound as his head hits the flank of a triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, the animals explode and ignite the minute they stumble and fall. Indeed, there are many unmotivated explosions as the film (and the genre) moves towards the final. And the beautiful Miss Munroe loses her supernatural accent. <br /> <br /> The triple bill, currently on the market, presents this film and two other films - The land that time has forgotten and The warlords of Atlantis. The first two are pretty strong entries, especially the first one, with a lot of money invested and sometimes even fascinating script tricks. Do not expect any of these qualities from this movie. Get drunk with friends and laugh shamelessly at what you see. After all, the manufacturers were not ashamed either.
