This episode had potential. The basic principle of a woman living next to an empty apartment (but a constantly ringing phone) is somewhat interesting. And when she explores noise, tension and fear are real. But the stupid writing ruins any promise of the episode. <br /> <br /> First of all, the woman willingly admits having seen things that would make most of us run the other way (for example, "It's funny closed even if it "There is no wind;" "This door is seriously damaged and was not there a minute ago;" "The door opened by itself, without touching it," etc.). Considering these supernatural phenomena and the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, would not she take a precaution before entering? Maybe she could investigate in the day. Or maybe she could investigate the apartment with someone else. Or maybe she could turn on the lights !!! Moreover, while she was in the haunted apartment, she decides to make many phone calls to the operator and argues about who has the power to unplug the phone, then they begin to discuss the details of the suicide. . JUST DISCONNECT THE PHONE! The telephone company does not need to be involved. Approach the phone and unplug it. The case is closed. <br /> <br /> Finally, showing the phone in the air as if it were alive was simply comical. If the director wanted the woman to be strangled by the phone card, he could have done it in a way that did not look like a cartoony. Brave little toaster someone?
