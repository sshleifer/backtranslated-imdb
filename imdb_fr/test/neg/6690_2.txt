The first two Bring It On movies were very good in their own way. The first was serious enough, the second was successful satirical - and the third was for the usual stupid idiotic comedy we always see in the totally brainless teen movies that Hollywood has created. The essential point of this film was that cheerleaders are raw heads who barely know enough to conduct a common conversation, and this is the full extent of the comedy of this film. Ha ha no. <br /> <br /> There is not the slightest hint in this movie, no theme, no subtext, nothing for anyone with a half-brain to entertain (and of course, I could not pass next to all that). If you're the type to be distracted by jokes about the worst, this movie is for you. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
