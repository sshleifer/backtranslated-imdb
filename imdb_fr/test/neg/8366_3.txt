I guess saying it's a terrible movie would be unfair, but it's really bad. The sub-Disney scenario involves dogs who play football and fall in love (oh yes, how cute!) The acting is not bad, but could certainly be better, especially that of the young Canadian actor Kevin Zegers, who, throughout the movie, embarrassed, as if he did not even want to be there. Anyway, kids will love it, but parents should be wary!
