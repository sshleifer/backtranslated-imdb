After the death of an astronaut in space, he is brought back to a military base. Inside the man are discovered extraterrestrial embryos - he is host to what could be a terrible extraterrestrial invasion! This film comes from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed "The Attack of Giant Leeches" (see separate review), but perhaps best known for his work on "Columbo". The executive producer was Roger Corman, known for being the creator of much better films than this one ... especially in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This film is corny and poorly constructed. What seems interesting is the mediocre effects, not the film itself. A scene shows a close-up of the extraterrestrial embryos and it is an embarrassing cartoon. Even for 1958. And then, when an adult alien appears ... you will wonder why he wears shoes. If you are really insightful, you will wonder why you saw the extra-terrestrial combination in other films. <br /> <br /> This is by no means the worst sci-fi movie you'll ever see. And you almost have to give it credit: the extraterrestrial host beyond a basic military idea precedes both "The Thing" and "Alien" for many years. I do not know if these films were inspired (I doubt it), but at least it was ahead of its time. Beyond that, the film collapses and is ideal only for the ruckus drinking. I did not see the "Mystery Science Theater" version, but it's a movie worthy of their insults.
