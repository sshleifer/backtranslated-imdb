Eric Idle, Robbie Coltraine, Janet Suzman - it would have been almost impossible to be wrong. Of course, there are fun times - the shower scene where Robbie Coltraine echoes Lon Chaney Jrr's woeful werewolf line "I can not help it" is hilarious. But in the end, the plot, scenario and direction are like a pancake and as tired as a 90 year old nun after 180 "Hail Mary". When I was a child, Carry On's movies were a little better than that, which is a really sad indictment of a movie with such a promising cast.
