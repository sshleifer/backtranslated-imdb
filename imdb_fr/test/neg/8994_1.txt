Ram Gopal Verma usually prepares a crazy fare, taken from a Hollywood movie. All his films after Shiva are in the style of the cookie cutter. From time to time, it makes a really horrible movie like this one. <br /> <br /> During the first 55 minutes, we discovered the two characters, a struggling gymnast posing as a talented dancer (understand!) and a budding actor trying to get rich in Bollywood . They fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer / gymnast does not have a break, gymnastics, anguish, usual grief, more gymnastics, anguish, song, dance, anguish, more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before that you know it, you 'll fall asleep fast. And this despite the warm body of the lady-gymnast-prominent dancer. <br /> <br /> But hey, you're not alone !! The editor, the director, the photographer, in fact, all the actors and the team are asleep for the duration of the production. The only difference being that they were paid to sleep while you were paying money for this shit, so you lose. Ha, the joke is on you. Do not feel sorry for yourself, but for our poor maid who is improving every day in her penthouse sexiest jerseys and sportswear. Puh-Leese, when will the poor have a break, is it STARR-VINNNG ?! <br /> <br /> Antara Mali can not act. RGV lost its marbles. Abhishek did his best but failed. No land. No story. Nothing. She had to pay RGV generously to do these crazy things in addition to free gym classes on her couch. What a great deal. No need for an acting career. <br /> <br /> Such waste can only be "Made in Bollywood"!
