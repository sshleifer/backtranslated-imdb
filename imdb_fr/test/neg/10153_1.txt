I got it on a dual function DVD called "Scream Theater" and it's probably one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. And I saw some very bad ones. The school is over and three girls (whom I would love if I eat my hat) talk about "feast without stop", so of course, they all go to the girl whose parents are the strictest a slumber party. Meanwhile, a psychotic has escaped the local insect house where the father of a girl works and is on the run with sharp objects, green scrubs and wide eyes ... I guess it's to show that he's crazy. Of course, as he has a bone to pick with this particular doctor, he goes to his home, the location of which is apparently notorious. Meanwhile, some types of idiot-jock are dropping beers and trying to scare the girls. Of course, the bastard shows up too and begins to slit his throat. And that's about it, as heavy metal music moves into the background. Or maybe it's not that, but really, that's all you need to know. Unless you spend your time being stoned or drunk, you will find little interest here, and even if you are wasted most of the time, you will probably find that your intelligence is insulted. 1 out of 10
