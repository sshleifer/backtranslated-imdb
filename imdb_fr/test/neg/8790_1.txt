This film was obscenely obvious and predictable. The scenes were poorly written and acted even worse. After the horrible scenes was the terrible scenario filled with useless and poorly designed lines. I would never suggest this movie to anyone who would make sense of watching decent movies. This film not only had the same ideas as the Bachelor and Bachelorette show, but also contained many parts in which you would know what would be the next move and the next line without ever having to watch the movie before. The cast was good but the actors played horrible characters there with more drama so should have been used and said the lines were for you to change the chain quickly. Please note that do not watch this movie.
