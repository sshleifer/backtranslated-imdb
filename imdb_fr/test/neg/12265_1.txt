This film proves a theory I have had for a long time - in Australia, as long as a movie is about the right topic, it will be a success, no matter how serious it is. Aussie Park Boyz could not be worse - the acting is more than terrible, the plot is basically a poor Warriors fight, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea of ​​the ethnic gangs in Australia (an Irish gang in Sydney in the 21st century)! The last time an Irish gang was in Australia was a hundred years ago, at the time of the DIYers!). But because it is about ethnic rivalries, one of the four topics will guarantee success in Australian cinema (with families in trouble, minorities and the biography of a famous Australian), he has won numerous awards academy. I have always suspected Australian critics of throwing away all the trash that deals with these issues, but part of me thought, or at least hoped, that it had its limits. This film proves the opposite. So, dear aspiring Australian filmmakers, do not think about your film, do not choose people who can play, or do not correct the facts; just write a scenario where a poor family is trying to make ends meet, or someone of foreign race who comes to Australia and has to deal with prejudices and racial stereotypes, or, if you want to take a sheet of the book of these people , an ethnic gang fighting another ethnic gang that is not plausible in your film will be rewarded by five academies, regardless of its pathetic state!
