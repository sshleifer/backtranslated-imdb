The pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while testing a plane - but nothing is displayed on the radar. Then planes and ships begin to disappear and reports of an increase in UFOs. It turns out that it is a giant monster that attacks and kills. But what is it and why is it here? <br /> <br /> This has all the good elements for a classic. His script is rather amusing - I never got bored. The acting is good (for a movie about the monsters of the 50s). Morrow does not exaggerate the role of the macho hero and Mara Corday is very good as a needed female lover. She is also strong and takes care of herself, even though she decided to buy food and coffee for everyone during the movie. The problem here is the monster. Dear God, it's terrible! It looks like a turkey disturbed! He has a long neck, a hilarious and stupid BEAK, teeth, a few strands of hair on his head and claws. And - oh yes - it squeaks! Do not roar - scream! The actors had no idea what it was like - it was added after production. Actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw this in a theater. Morrow said his audience had burst out laughing and had left the room quickly before the end of the movie! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for that. He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster of all time. And you can also see the wires that move it! This gives only 4 stars because Morrow and Corday are really good and the script is well done. The pathetic monster does not get stars - wait to see the attack that obviously hits a miniature train! Worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what must be the most stupid monster of all time.
