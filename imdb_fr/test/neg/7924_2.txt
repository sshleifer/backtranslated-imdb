This film is ... horrible and wonderful at the same time. I saw it for the first time when I was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has a lot of nostalgic value for me. In this film, CÃ©sar Romero plays the character of Octavio, the man who "discovered" Santana. There are also two other actors, Monte Markham (plays Sam, who tries to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (plays the priest), who have big filmographies, and these are the only shows that are suitable. The rest of the game and the movie itself have all the qualities of movie B that some of us cherish. <br /> <br /> I recently spent 2 years trying to acquire a copy of this film, which hardly exists. . I suppose it was interrupted very soon after its publication. But I finally found a copy and paid a nice penny to buy it. If you come across Judgment Day in a video store (undeniably with a "satan" green cheesy cover), count yourself among the lucky ones who live near one of the few video stores that still have a working copy . A must for those of you who like to laugh at the ridiculous attempts of a horror movie.
