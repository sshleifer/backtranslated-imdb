this movie is about people living in a trailerpark. later in the film, it becomes clear that these people are unemployed humorists, mostly elderly men. well, they stay more or less seated around the movie and talk about cum. but never there is any action, just those people who speak. At first, I thought it was perverse redneck-cool, but after a while, it was getting boring. I mean, how many versions can you think of saying f *** ing, d ** k & c ** t? of course, this can be funny - maybe half an hour, not 80 minutes. but it was fun to see these people trying to act. I'm pretty sure that they often read their text on a sheet while playing. but it does not bother the movie, it's cool like that. because these people seem so poor, raging, discouraged, that the style suits them perfectly. their wooden reading and defenseless texts creates a great atmosphere, I fell in love with the characters. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** later in the film, the comedians (laughs on the fuck) with just as public and applause imagined. then they receive a notice of eviction and then decide to defend the trailer park and to enter their roofs - armed with weapons. so they shot. fin. It sounds like action, but it is not. just a homemade trash camera takes. *** SPOILER END *** <br /> <br /> but the film is totally consistent in its style and I'm sure that's exactly what the filmmaker wanted to have. it is the portrait of these f ** k-up in a domestic steel camera style with characters who can not play but who seem interesting personalities, so they are nice to watch. but the texts on - you know what - all the time become boring after a while. <br /> <br /> pretty young director who also seems an interesting person, since he played in teen movies in popular movies / TV series but now, I've had more horror movies that are more his cup of tea I guess. and this, his first directional effort will be distributed by Troma now. I do not know anything about an outing, I got this one as this year's "Advanced Scouting Tool" that says "For Counterfeit Purposes Only".
