Nicely lame and awful slasher about someone killing track team members after the death of their star runner at a competition. <br /> <br /> Christopher George makes a hilarious performance as a track team coach. I do not think SOMEONE has taken athleticism as seriously as Chris here, not even at the Olympics. It is a typically divine performance, and if you are a fan of the man / legend, you should rush to take a copy. <br /> <br /> But we are looking at slashers for the killings (you know that's true), not the performances, and Graduation Day fails in most cases (there is a very good kill). The real horror comes only during a performance of the band "Felony". Never heard of them? Watch the graduation day and find out why.
