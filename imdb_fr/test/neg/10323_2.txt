Wait until you've watched most of the other movies ever, wait a year, and then watch it when you're ready for something with such low production values, that will not challenge anyone's imagination. <br /> <br /> I agree that anyone who regards this film as a ten-star production must do so to distort the data. Something above 8 would be strange. <br /> <br /> It's good to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair since the beginning of her career, even if she has accented the NY accent too much, but she also has NC) sneak through. Ancient story for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD I rented included two bonuses, an organic mini-section that only featured Sandra's bio-taken in extenso in IMDb. There was also a bonus quiz - 3 questions. I hope you all have them!
