Besides the fact that this guy is a liar, he's also an idiot and a thief in the world of comedy. Once, when I tried to watch this excuse for a TV show, I think I actually threw up a bit in my mouth. I can not help but feel a little silly every time I see one of his awful commercials while I enjoy great central programs of comedies like Reno 911 and American Body Shop. This shows that it worries me about the continued existence of humanity. It's hard to believe that even Joe Rogan can give the impression to a fool. Please, start praying now for the Central Comedy to make its mistake and finish this show as quickly as possible. Have not we suffered enough?
