Ok, now I'm pretty sure that my summary caught your attention and that I comment that Zazu Pitts is Satan is not unfounded. Let me explain. The film initially appears to be a dandy film B about an evil organization called "The Twisted Circle" and their revenge vow to murder a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes. Although this is very strange (especially the idea of ​​a club of private citizens who solve crimes) and may have been interesting, this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of known support actors. Why? Well, because Zazu Pitts (who has never been one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie complaining, just like Olive Oyl, who has a toothache !! While murders are committed, people are kidnapped or whatever, you can always count on Zazu who moans at full volume - almost like an odious 3-year-old who wants everyone at a party to watch her! At the same time, it is not an integral part of the film, but it is at the top of the list. Why she's even there is beyond me - I guess it's just to moan and scream. As a result, I found the film virtually unassailable and it was completely ruined. Now you probably know why I called this actress to dubious talent "Satan"! I'm sure when the actors in this movie saw the final product, they also felt pretty much the same as me in the face of its horrific overdevelopment and amateurish performance. This film is in the audience. domain and can be found as a free download on the Internet. I can see why.
