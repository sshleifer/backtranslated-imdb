The four Fedoras policemen driving in a big black convertible seem slightly absurd and even more ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, the stupidest of the lot, is at the controls. The writer never manages to create a camaraderie among the members of the team and the director does not manage to tear off the articulation of the mountain-man Nolte. Foprget questions someone. Nolte's character lights a cigarette, gets angry and beats the interviewees to death. His methods do not lead him anywhere, until one moment of the action, he moves away from one residence to another, his mouth open and his brain closed. He crushes an FBI squad and throws two army officers off a plane in flight, with only a vague anger report against HQ and no punishment. At the end of the film, he is as helpless and muscular as at the beginning. How he managed to bring down a beautiful prostitute deeply in love with him is a mystery, as is the eternal devotion and tragic sense of treason expressed by his unemployed wife. Two interesting snapshots of the photo: one of an atomic explosion, the other of a gigantic crater, apparently caused by a bomb. He is almost as destroyed and swollen as Nolte's face.
