I started to get interested in the movie. It turned out that it could be a serious tragedy, dealing with death, sorrow and healing, with some realistic human conflicts. Unfortunately, that did not hold. <br /> <br /> credible characters. Too many characters in this film have been described as extremely gullible and incoherent. Listen, I know it was not supposed to be Shakespeare, but hey, I need some quality in the script and the characterization. <br /> <br /> The acting game was good, not so much writing. At one point, James Brolin's character is reprimanded for coming to an underclothed picnic. He declares that the commander will not work. His new wife says that if he goes home and changes, she tears up later. It's a howler. This film had some unintentionally funny lines. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to worry about the character of Jame Brolin. When he gave his new wife's business so easily to his new wife, even leaving his daughter to be snubbed, I lost almost all my sympathy. Who really cares about what happens to him. I must admit that I did not finish the film. If it's 180 in quality in the last 45 minutes, let me know. It was just unpleasant to watch and so predictable that I did not need to finish it.
