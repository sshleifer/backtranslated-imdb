I'm looking forward to watching "Wirey Spindell" since I went through Schaffer's "The Fall". Unfortunately, I found that "WS" was a bunch of trailing toads, which did not seem to engage, which is apparently Schaeffer's signature, a mix of history, narration and poetry. The film tells the sexual and other experiences of a man from Manhattan about to get married through self-told flashbacks. Like beads on a string, Schaffer apparently chained every little experience of sex life, while neglecting to deal with the beauty of the necklace. The result is a disjointed and disjointed story about a boy growing up, who does not develop empathy and leaves the viewer disconnected, unsatisfied, and with an unpleasant aftertaste that tarnishes the mechanical end of well-being. A mediocre actor and a step back for Schaeffer.
