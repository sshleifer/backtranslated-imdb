The first time I saw this, I thought it was a joke. All I could think was, "You got the 8MM camera, I'm going to get my little brother's monster toys, we're going to make a movie!" Why would someone in a modern era like 2001 have made a sci-fi movie like this, it looks like it was shot in the early 80s. With actors as wooden as one? Indian cigar store, a screenplay written by the director's 4-year-old son, a camera stolen from a pawnshop, special effects of misery rank, a director who thought that doing this shit would make them famous. The final result was not spectacular, with a disjointed dialogue and continuity. It's fun to make Venus and I'm sure everyone had fun with their little silly movie. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10 for a valiant and hopeless effort. <br /> <br />
