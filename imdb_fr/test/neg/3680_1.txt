If they had a zero out of 10, I would go in there. Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed to take money from the public. I do not know how movies like this come out Video or Pay Channel. I am disappointed by Vincent Gallo. Val Kilmer spent about 8 minutes, so I can not get mad at him. Only the person who has listed him as the star. It's like Marlon Brando in Superman. There is no plot except Gallo who seeks and finds his friend in the catacombs. Why they were looking for the gates of hell that only the director knows. They should keep this film in Moscow and burn it to keep all the homeless extras warm for the night. There is nothing more to say about this movie than all other critics have written. I wish I could forget that this film hurts my brain.
