With such a promising cast and a director of whom I have heard a lot, I was completely disappointed by this film. It started with the signs of a great epic tale of gangsters and turned into a completely confused mess with many unanswered questions and completely ridiculous and useless scenes (and yes, I watched the full version). I love Robert DeNiro and, as usual, he did a good job as an actor, but in all his other gangster movies, no matter how many people he kills, I always had respect for his character, but in this movie he was a lowlife addict. rapist without worry of anyone except himself. In addition, James Woods, another good actor, wrote completely ridiculous scenes. I thought that the parts where Robert DeNiro called him crazy and that he turned out completely out of the left field. Towards the end, the authors add this random comment about his father's death in a nut house and that's why James Woods did not do it. like being called crazy. So many things have not been developed in this film. In addition, we never find out who the first men are who try to kill Noodles and we never learn more about Joe Pesci's character. It seems that writers have collected about five different stories without ever completely explaining any. The only quality that redeems the film is the story where the characters were young children. The story went well in this part of the film and the kids did a great job as an actor. Overall, I was deeply disappointed by this film and I do not see how anyone can compare it to Godfather 1 and 2, or even Goodfellas. I'm sad to have lost four hours of my life watching this movie
