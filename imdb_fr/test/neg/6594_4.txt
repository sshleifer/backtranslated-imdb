Where the hell did VH1 find the scriptwriter for this movie ??? Outside high school? This film tries so much to show sympathy to Michael Jackson, but turns it into a horrible and old-fashioned caricature. All the lines are full of clich√©s but surprisingly, the acting was not bad. As usual, it's a bad movie with very good actors. The actor who plays Michael Jackson, I feel sorry for him! I think he did his best with the weak script. It did not bother me that Flex did not look like Michael Jackson, I thought he was doing his best, but later, when he was made up of white, oh man, he looked disgusting! The other actors who played Debbie Rowe, Priscilla Presley and Elizabeth Taylor were pretty good. Except that the actress who plays Liz Taylor looked too young and healthy to play Liz. The actress who plays Diana Ross did not look like her at all and I could not know who this woman was until much later in the film. <br /> <br /> This movie hurts everyone. on the Michael Jackson side, or against Michael Jackson. It does not change the opinion of anyone. In fact, the only opinion that anyone will have after watching this movie is, oh my God, this movie is really, really bad! And where the hell is the wonderful music and songs of Michael Jackson? There is none to find in this movie. Anyway, I love the soundtrack of this movie and I will probably buy it if I could. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's a very funny and funny movie! It's a great waste of time if you want to look at something light that will not bother your brain too much. I will probably watch it again, because it's so much fun!
