Greetings from Lithuania. <br /> <br /> This is the first question that comes to mind after watching this "movie". <br /> <br /> You know, I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life, but after looking at this one, I only had two questions: 1) Is this just a parody (parody ) <br /> 2) How could people create such a thing !? <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this "movie", you REALLY do not know what a REAL "bad" movie is. I mean BAD. The script - Are you kidding me? Playing is so horrible that I think "actors" are just having fun in this movie. I know, it's a movie "B", but go? Should this be a reason to be such a trash? <br /> <br /> Oh! And what an end !!! An end must be missed! Just when you think it's the worst thing you've ever seen, wait until the end - because THIS kind of ending you've NEVER seen (and I hope you'll never see). <br /> <br /> Avoid this "movie" at any cost, and do not say I did not warn you ...
