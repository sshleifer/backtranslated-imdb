Historical films always take liberties - conversations are concocted where no one can know what has been said, customs are adjusted to be comprehensible to the modern public, etc. This film does not. The only scene I really remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who breaks into his room at night. He confronts the dangerous intruder with: "I do not remember having used room service". The main value of entertainment lies in its wickedness; I recommended that my local video story be placed on the "Turkeys" shelf.
