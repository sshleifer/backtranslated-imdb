The film opens on magnificent landscapes of the North-West countryside. Clay fence posts, a freight train crossing hayfields in the distance, clouds, small roadside structures, a motel or a restaurant in the middle of nowhere. Above it plays a languid but mysterious Twin Peaks piano arrangement and everything is sufficiently moody and atmospheric in a kind of American Gothic. Thanks to this, however, director Jon Jost continues to interweave awkward images, blocks of letters, opening credits with distressing sounds, color frames that announce "BLUE", numbers that matter to "12 steps towards a conclusion "announced in the opening credits. From the first minutes, it is obvious that, even if Jost is more than able to capture the landscape and atmosphere, he does not care. He does not have the affection for Terrence Malick in the Badlands nor the time nor the inclination of David Lynch of Twin Peaks to weave the mystery and the intrigues around a given place. <br /> <br /> The sequel to the movie is more frustrating than Jon Jost with experimental tricks that serve their own purposes. The use of the split screen is interesting, I particularly like the way we get the first image of Ricky Lee divided in two, one telling childhood memories that count only for him, the other cursing and banging his head against the wall, then In the movie, the second Ricky Lee wins, the macho hipster with pitiless and stupid hues. On the other hand, the animation in stop motion and the choice to play the majority of the film in narration in voice-over do not work. It happens sometimes because Jost writes and shoots static shots of the small American town of Nowheresville, but Beth Ann's monologues, delivered in an extremely flat nasal monotone, a voice that resembles the computer speech program crossed with a roaring horse are so squeaky in the ear that it defies the purpose of paying attention. <br /> <br /> Each of the couples tells us about their past experiences, their little triumphs and follies, their doubts and their past relationships that led to nothing. They say very little and say what they say with empty faces. But they work like rabbits. This seems to be their only means of communication left open, perhaps the only one they can trust safely. Jost clearly chooses his main characters in Frameup among the naive and delusional, those who are bitten by an American dream that went wrong, but he does not place himself above them. He is not condescending nor sufficient in his portrait. They may be misguided, but they are full of moments of humanity, as awkward as they may be. We are called to empathize and show affection rather than pointing fingers and laughing. It is the Frameup that succeeds the best; the characters in the movie come to life even when their expressionless faces do not show up, even when Jost gets in the way of his oversized framing and intrusive camera games. <br /> <br /> Then we return to furious speeches about the destructive effects of money When you play on a dollar bill inserted, you get a strange psychedelic sequence in which Jost's camera slides under large leafy trees that quickly turn red beet while Beth Ann meditates time and time again about "redwoods" in dubbing, we even get a couple The couple Beth Ann and Ricky Lee, losers in small towns having nowhere where go and nothing to hold them dead, arrive in California and decide to steal a 7/11. The film does not rise to an emotional crescendo following the sloppy work of the 7/11, as one would expect from a road movie as a couple, it stops slowly and you look at the window to see that he does not really have anywhere in particular. Parts of the hike were hypnotic and almost touching and fun parts, but all the rest was mostly annoying.
