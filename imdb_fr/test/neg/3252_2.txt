This film should never have been done! It stinks, it's awful, it's not good, it's bad, it's terrible. You start to see a pattern here? Jackie Mason is certainly not Rodney Dangerfield. Ted Knight and Bill Murray, who, along with Dangerfield, were essential to the first film. It seems that the three of them (the stars) knew every scenario when they saw one. The one who did not have the good sense to get away from it was Chevy Chase, who was hanging around but who, in my opinion, was a stranger to both films. This movie is just not funny. He does not have other endearing qualities either. This thing is very much dependent on antisemitism and works to the detriment of it. I hated this thing. A waste of time for everyone.
