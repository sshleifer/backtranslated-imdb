I finally rented this video after looking for it for several months. Initially, I only wanted to see it because I am a fan of Neil Pearson (Patrick, Isobel's boyfriend, the lead role). However, the film resists very well without Neil (although he is doing very well in this film, he is eclipsed by the three main female characters). It's a strange and intense film, the kind that the British do so well - definitely a "chick movie" of the house and its secluded setting giving the movie an almost "Wuthering Heights" aura. The film is full of tension and the end, shocking, but somehow inevitable. I'm glad I watched it, it was worth the wait
