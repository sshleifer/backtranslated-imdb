I'm a fan of bad horror movies from the '50s and' 60s - movies so ridiculous and stupid that they're good for laughing. So, for that reason, it's natural for me to choose this film - especially because John Agar was virtually guaranteed. Unfortunately, even though it was a bad movie, it was the worst kind of bad movie - dull beyond belief and not very funny. At least with stupid and exaggerated bad movies, you can laugh at awful monsters and terrible direction and play. Here, we never really see much of this monster (mainly because of the darkness of the footprint) and the acting, although bad, is more and more low energy ... without energy and dull. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some young adults who go to Satan's Hollow up to the neck. Well, given the name of the place, it is not surprising that they are then found chewed in pieces! Duh ... do not attack Satan's Hollow !! Well, there are reports of an object crashing from the sky, so what will teens do? Yes, have a dance party - a very slow dance party where children are dancing in slow motion. It is therefore up to the sheriff (Agar) and his men to ensure that teenagers can dance in peace without fear of being chewed. <br /> <br /> As for the monster, this is a guy in a gorilla costume with a silly mask. - a bit like the monster in ROBOT MONSTER. Not quite original and not really high tech. To make matters worse, it emits snoring and moves very, very slowly - so slowly that even the most stout teenager could easily surpass it! It happens to me badly to kill several times. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's too monotonous to love, even if you're a fan of bad movies.
