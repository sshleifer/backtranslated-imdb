While walking to buy cigarettes, professional dancer Daniel (Tom Long) is abducted and forced to have naughty sex for several days by three hooded women. When he is released, the director of his company Isabel (Greta Scacchi) has already replaced him in the game and his girlfriend gives him a cold welcome. Daniel disturbed and humiliated leaves the dance company and travels, obsessed with the search for kidnappers. Daniel has sex with many women whom he suspects to be the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> "The Book of Revelation" is a strange film with a promising beginning that loses its initial power and becomes a kind of erotic soap opera or soft-porn chic too long. The production is elegant, the cover of the DVD is great but the characters are not well developed and the trauma of Daniel seems excessive, because most men fantasized with the dream situation to which he had been subjected. become sexual object of three sexy women. The melodramatic development with Isabel's disease adds no value to the plot; the open conclusion is very disappointing and there is no explanation for the women's motive or title. It is very clear that the scenario about a man's feelings was written by a woman. It was good to see Greta Scacchi again, always so beautiful, and her makeup at the end is impressive. There is a saying in Portuguese that could be translated into English as follows: "If rape is inevitable, relax and come." Daniel should have done that and spared me from watching nearly two hours of a useless story. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Livro das Revela√ßes" ("The Book of Revelations")
