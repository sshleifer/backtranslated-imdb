Note that this is not supposed to be, but it is. When I was little, I watched this movie at the theater (being a big fan of wrestling and a fan of Hulk Hogan). All I can remember from the night is that we were the only ones in the theater and I did not like that much. </ B> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p245> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> our kind, "Gymkata "or" The Pumaman "you also world of professional wrestling. Well, maybe the stakes are not that high ... and frankly, I feel dirty about calling these people "professionals" of anything. And really, except for the first scene, there is no fight strictly speaking. So, I guess the film talks about the unambitious world of the amateur-pound *** game. Sounds good, does not it? <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan plays Rip, the WWF Champion (Hulk Hogan is never said to have been broadcast, while films like Thunder in Paradise have shown how he challenged himself with deep roles who really pushed the limits of his talents). Essentially, he plays himself, but with a wardrobe more black and blue than Hulkster's red and yellow. He also has this gesture of the hand he makes. It's a bit like the ozzy devil sign that people make at rock concerts, except that you leave your thumb in the air and fold your index finger. My friend claimed that it should look like a "R." Try to see for yourself. If it sounds like an "R", then, Mars needs women. Anyway. <br /> <br /> Kurt Fuller, with his detector obviously over-activated on the fritz, plays a television director with his slightly homoerotic heart about to make Rip, which is obviously bigger than Elvis, on his network. He will not have any more (and will come out of the office with a triumphant hand gesture, except for the camera), and the film follows Fuller who tries to improve his notes and return to Rip. He does it when he creates his title "The battle of the tough guys". Marketing genius, this guy. <br /> <br /> From the many hand gestures to the rather idiotic battle scenes (everything is played as if the fight was very real and deadly) to Hulk's too frequent shooting in clothes, this movie has everything you would ever want in a silly movie. It's frivolous, not too painful for the mind, violent, and includes the phrase "What is this smell?" "DOOKIE" "Dookie?" <br /> <br /> A classic for all times.
