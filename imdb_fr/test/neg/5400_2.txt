A unit of the Delta Force Army, tasked with finding a group of wicked green berets missing and known for their complete disappearance, will fight for survival against a masked skeleton man, the alleged spirit of a former Indian warrior who was revived archaeologists disturbed his grave. The skeleton man rides on horseback and has the ability to move using a type of dimensional portal. He does not seem to be affected by bullets or explosives. The skeleton man's horse leaves no hoof prints and he can ride behind and around his prey in silence. The point of view of the film through the eyes of the skeleton man looks at his prey with a different color. In other words, he is apparently not human. How can Captain Leary (Michael Rooker, as grizzled and intense as ever) and his band of commando suitors stop this threat? For some reason, the skeleton man kills employees at a nearby chemical plant. What are the motives of the skeleton man to slaughter endless human beings? And why is a blind Indian living in the forest that our commandos live spared if the skeleton man, as a human being, massacres all his tribe to prove himself? <br /> <br /> As completely stupid as it may seem. Simply incredible horrible. This is the kind of movie that can lull the brain cells. Casper Van Dien gets the second place of the credits just under Rooker, but is confronted by a ridiculously underwritten character who leaves the film soon enough. Rooker deserves better than that. If I were an actor, I would not want this film in my CV. The Skeleton Man is an offshoot of the Knight Templar from a film by Ossorio. He has a spear that can simply knock down some people while blowing a woman's head under the impact. An arrow drawn from the bow of the skeleton man destroys the propeller of a helicopter plane. For nearly 99% of the film, bullets are fired at the skeleton man and he can enter and exit this portal, but in the end, suddenly, he becomes vulnerable to attack. Oh, and the horses are changing too, the skeleton man moving freely in the forest from this portal. The film is written and edited by clowns. The attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters, who are supposed to be experienced pros, make very bad decisions throughout this movie. The spirit goes beyond with this film. Good for some laughs and some gory scenes make this piece of pure crap observable as a trash movie.
