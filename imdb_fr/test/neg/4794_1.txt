This movie is as bad as possible. If you like logic (or lack thereof) in the National Treasure and if you act badly too, it could be a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, spend your time in the sun and your money on a beer. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is a promotional image or demonstration poorly designed to promote the people involved (actors, special effects, etc.). They accidentally produce very badly by exposing their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> In a case like this, the film company should be required to repay money to customers who are not satisfied with the product. <br /> <br /> It's really ugly.
