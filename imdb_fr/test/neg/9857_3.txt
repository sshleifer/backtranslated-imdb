Kasparov vs. Deep Blue is without a doubt a fascinating story, but I do not think you would know it by watching this movie. I think that puts too much emphasis on the conspiracy theory that IBM cheated ... and what is the theory based on? The idea that at one point, the computer made a gesture that "looked human" I'm not a great chess master or a computer scientist. And although I do not doubt that the gesture seems human, it does not seem impossible to think that the most powerful chess computer ever created can make a surprising gesture ... or that such a machine can beat even a genius like Kasparov. The film draws too much space from this theory and not enough of the personality of the people involved ... it could have made it a much more interesting story. The direction also relies too much on the vanity of an unnecessarily murmured narration and on the imagery of an 18th century chess machine that looks like one of those animatronic Gypsy adventurers you see at the carnival. In addition, many empty shots of Kasparov revisiting "crime scene" have slowed down the situation. I have no doubt that Kasparov and the chess community have found IBM's vexing behavior, but I do not think it's different from what you'll find at another big company. At the end of the film, you have the feeling that Kasparov is a huge cryobaby baby and that the Deep Blue programmers are victims or cheats. I think that if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe in the conspiracy theory (which he almost certainly did), he should have presented much more evidence. In fact, more evidence would have been a good idea in the first place. All this left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.
