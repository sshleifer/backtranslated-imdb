******** SPOILER ALERT ************** I lost 85 minutes of my life watching this "movie". First of all, we think it's hilarious that the producer would appear in the film as the autopsy doctor with an incredibly incredible horrible accent - what was it anyway, Romanian? And how is it that in Denmark no one speaks Danish except for the creatures of the peat bog? (Note, the director of the Scottish camp ...). ? And who does the shopping for the creatures of the peat bog? Their pants seemed to have been bought in Banana Republic. Very well dressed to be 1200 years old. This one was worse than Scarecrow Slayer (we did not think it was even POSSIBLE). We have essentially advanced rapidly in 75% of the film in search of gory, deadly or frightening moments. Nobody is found. Rent the DVD just to watch the two-hour "Behind the Scenes of Bog Creatures" featurette. Who are these people? Are they serious? And the filmmakers are about 60 years old. I think it's their holy grail and it's pretty pathetic in itself. <br /> <br /> BEST LINE of the film, hands down: "Not bad for a girl who has never even gone to higher education ..." My blind grandmother, who has children, could do a better movie.
