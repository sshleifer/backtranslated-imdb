That's exactly what the title tells you ... an island inhabited by fishermen. The wrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and his crew land on the island. They are either kidnapped by the fishermen or fired to work for Richard Johnson, a crazy treasure hunter. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who thinks he has found the lost city of Atlantis, holds the deprived scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach hostage so that fishermen can discover a treasure under the sea. Cotten, of course, is a complete fool . Bach and Cassinelli have a great chemistry. This madness was led by Sergio Martino and is not, surprisingly, without merit. It's fast, reasonably well done, and the fishermen look pretty convincing (although it's unlikely someone can prove that these things do NOT look like real fishermen). There is an excellent score of Luciano Michelini.
