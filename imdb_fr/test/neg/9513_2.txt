This is by far the worst version of William Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece I have ever seen. It seems that the filmmakers did not read Shakespeare's text. No, they just took what they wanted from the Olivier Lawerence movie. The plot is out of order and reduced to its simplest necessity. However, the suspicion of incest created by Olivier, non-canonist, between Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Could we have had the bit "Something rotten in Denmark"? The casting is another problem. I understand that Branagh's much superior movie had its weaknesses (we think of Robin Williams and Charlton Heston), but this one has very few good moments. I like Laertes and Polonius, but the rest of the cast is out of date. The frightening stubble of Mel Gibson is irritating, and one often wonders if he has any idea what he is saying. Many actors just seem to have memorized the role - they know less about what is said than the sophomore students in high school. <br /> <br /> If you want a version of Hamlet, go see Kenneth Branagh or even Lawerence. Olivier. To be honest, even the hamlet of Disney is better.
