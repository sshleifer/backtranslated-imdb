Has anyone ever noticed that this version is essentially a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version, with some scenes deleted? It makes me less think of a movie that does that, showing a real lack of creativity. In all honesty, I tend to favor Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the film seems to be a cinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was nice and pleasant, although a little awkward in the presentation and the transition sometimes, and then this version took the script, the music and even a good part of the blocking scene of the previous version. I do not understand the interest of redoing the film while the method of redoing it was to basically redo the film of George Cukor with the same thing except the people who work there.
