I saw this on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and even that show could not really make this movie bearable. I could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures. Of course, you expect terrible special effects with such an old movie, but I've seen silences that were better. The scenario has huge gaps that make you understand why they are even on certain scenes. Apparently, the cameraman does not know what a tripod is and has drunk too much coffee or something harder perhaps because the camera is ALWAYS shaking. I could not even follow the plot, but let's just say it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: I saw "Epic Movie" some time ago and I decided to give this movie a 2. This is NOT the worst movie I've ever seen have never seen!
