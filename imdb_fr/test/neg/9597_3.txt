Although a lot of Billie Dove fans are thrilled with her work here, I have to move on. As a socially prominent member of the British malign ensemble, his British accent is virtually non-existent and his line readings sound exactly like, well, line readings and his emotion seems like a trance and heavy. Basil Rathbone, usually a good actor, seems to be completely off-beat and speaks with some sort of strange accent - in his case, something like Italian, although we can not be sure. The script manages to keep his precise ethnic secret. The scenario, which gives him one of those old diseases of the film, something that has something to do with the nerves, requires a surgical intervention that hinders him more. The only real distraction is provided by the illustrious Kay Francis, wearing a lacquered square with the depraved cheek that ruthlessly devours men, including Rathbone, and spits them out. She gets away with her unique strength. She is the only living thing in this dead sea of ​​a movie.
