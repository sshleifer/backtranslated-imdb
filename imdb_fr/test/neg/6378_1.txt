Comedy works best when it comes to real things. But even as such, efforts are needed to make jokes that everyone loves and even the most grumpy viewers can crack a smile. When I look at the Daily Show, I see the whole thing "it's funny because it's true", but I do not see the effort and often I do not do it if they're funny or just trying to do a point (I notice this mainly in the segments of the interview). The Daily Show started as a parody of news. By definition, they make fun of the way the media play their own news by pretending to be inept and stupid journalists and news presenters. Stewart came ... and everything went to hell. The first years of Jon Stewart's reign may have been golden brown. I thought it was so funny, but 2004 started and that's when you start to notice a huge chance in the series. The humor of the series has become obsolete, Colbert is gone, Steve Carell is gone, many of the best presenters in the series are now and now it's mostly Jon Stewart. here and there. For those who have not seen the show and have a hard time knowing what to watch on the cable, I'll give you a brief description of its content (at least until 2009): -Bush, Cheney and all Republicans (except they also share an opinion shared by Democrats) are stupid, perverse, corrupt and hypocritical; anyone who relies on conservative beliefs is also perverse, corrupt, and hypocritical; People who doubt the artificial theory of global warming are diabolical and stupid; -vote democrat; There, I saved you 25 minutes of your time, go look something else. At first, I thought the producers had hijacked the series for their own personal political agenda, but when I see the interviews, the content of the series (which I mentioned above) becomes perfectly clear, but I will come back later. moment. Frist off, humor in The Daily Show according to Jon Stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote, told by Bush, Cheney or a random Republican Humor, because, well, because. Jon sets up the joke, placing it in a context specific to the authors and expects the random quote to produce somehow the punchline. So unless you understand the context, it's totally useless as a bankable humor. The Daily Show also expects you to laugh when you show the montage of a talking politician and in another separate video that says something else, and that puts back into context that the writers expect from you that you understand, what makes him funny, why? Well, because Jon said it. Now, imagine that The Daily Show uses this formula several times a week, for years, and you will begin to understand what was once a festival of laughter that now consists of 25 minutes of silent looks (yes, even in the Lewis segments Black). At first, these jokes were the subject of a decent effort, but now much less. And the interview has the strangest sense of bias I have ever seen. Jon Stewart calls Bill O'Reilly a bully, but what does it do to him when he sucks all the actors and Democrats (John Kerry before, Obama today) who appear in the series and despise respected Republicans and accomplished conservative journalists like Weekly Standard's own Bill Kristol? He makes them appear in court, as if they were charged with a crime. Often, anyone in the series who defends Bush is described as delusional, as if that person was disconnected from reality and expected to speak. for the majority of the United States, this is the de facto treatment of the Conservatives unless they share the same view as the Democrats. In this case, it is a festival of endless love. But no matter, in Jon's eyes, you've made a mistake before entering the series and you're always wrong afterwards. This is the kind of treatment you receive if you are something far right. Now, you have to wonder what this could have with humor. One wonders what will happen if the Democrats win the White House ...
