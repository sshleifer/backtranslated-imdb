This movie is more about CGI I mean science fiction really they did it the original '' BATS '' is better it does not use CGI as a result. in this movie, it's the simple people fleeing mutant killer bats. and really beats in Afghanistan ?! the plot implies that US Army soldiers find a terrorist and are attacked by bats and die <_ <but the reason I attributed to this 3-star movie is due to the fact that the camera makes a zoom on the soldiers. the acting is bad and it does not even look like a horror movie. All in all, this movie is a pretty good TV movie for a science fiction channel. but if you like sci-fi movies, you'll love this movie because you just like channel 43 oh and if you fall asleep during the movie, do not be surprised. oh sorry i think i give it 2 stars instead.
