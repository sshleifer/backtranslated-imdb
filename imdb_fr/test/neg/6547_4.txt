It was the first action movie made in a forbidden form in the style of the US Hollywood action. It's not even close to the Hollywood action movies of that time. The plot is childish, the staging is mediocre. This film was successful because it was the first of its kind in Russia. Even though I watched it several times, I have to admit it was a bit naive and I did not like it. This is not the best example of Russian action film. This is just the first experience.
