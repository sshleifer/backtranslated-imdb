Sorry, but I usually like French thrillers - for example Chabrol - but it was a brilliant shambolic mess. The fact that it is based on a book by Harlan Cohen is revealing, because instead of being a French film (imbued with psychology and character), it is rather a roller-coaster of John Grisham-Esquire with twists and turns ridiculous, flashbacks that update previous flashbacks, a predictable villain (as soon as his name is mentioned, you think "hmm, he'll be the villain!") and sets of mysterious stereotypical characters that seem to inhabit different movies. At the end, I hysterically laughed at the uneven tone of the film (the scenes in which the main character is helped by two gloomy characters are hilariously hilarious), the completely confusing plot, the absurd coincidences and the makeshift shots (by example, guess password for an e-mail account) AND yawning in an uncontrollable way (I thought I had misinterpreted the time of 1h50, because it seemed to drag for 3 hours and 50 minutes).
