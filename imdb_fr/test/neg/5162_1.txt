It's great to hear about 3 comments, which highlight what "Footballers Wives" means for women. The title alone eliminates any alleged equality of women in the media industry or society, reducing them to two-dimensional cartoons illustrating how men should behave. It's a silly post-modern joke. It could also be called "Wifey footballers who stay at home and know their place". <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it could actually be a kind of parody of the British press, Gutter Trash. celebrities and their role in maintaining a patriarchal society. Thus, women can undermine stereotypes by acting like these stereotypes and possess the image that was created to them by male desire. No, it would be ironic and intelligent. I also think I should praise it. <br /> <br /> Zoe Lucker is just too camping and overflowing to be taken seriously. Just like a Cruella De Ville even cheaper. She just needs a little manic, condescending, but at the same time self-evaluating laughter to show off her true range of actors. Oh, does she do it? Right. In any case, it sums up who it is for. Either "intelligent" journalists, who think it's a flight of vaudevillian proportions, or people who think it's "real". "Best actors"? OMG !! Stop watching this after-birth of a pantomime and earn a living. <br /> <br /> He is so sexist and of a quality so poor that those who appreciate it think maybe they are "in" the "joke". Do the actors really care or understand what they are communicating? It's so humiliating for women and men. Not all egoistic, selfish and football-loving materialistic jerks think that women are just another trophy to present to the public. It's so humiliating. I'm sure Ms. Lucker would easily defend them in her "real" life and twist them on her finger as it is so easily done in "Footballers Wives". <br /> <br /> But of course, that's not the case. really important. I mean, this is just a TV program after all. So please let it stay focused. It is appalling and one will observe it only in the same incredulity that one remembers so much of 'block of cells of prisoners H'. <br /> <br /> How did it happen to exist? It's certainly not subtle or complex. It could only come from the same mindset that read the magazine FHM and that thinks it's "good" to watch soft pornography, and to "make" so many women who bow to their "will" and sing patriotic and racist comments every time "football team loses / wins.It's totally rude.
