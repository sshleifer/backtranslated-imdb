"Graduation Day" is the result of the success of "Friday the 13th". Both films are about bloody and creative murders, rather than suspense. If you like this type of movie, I would recommend "Graduation Day". Otherwise, I would not do it. There is nothing new here, but the same murders. <br /> <br /> Even though I gave 4 out of 10 to the film, I will say that it is not a disgusting movie. It is visible if you are curious about it, but not creative.
