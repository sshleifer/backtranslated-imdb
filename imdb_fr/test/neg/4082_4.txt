The creative team behind Evan Almighty should have been able to make a better movie. Tom Shadyac, director of Ace Ventura Pet Detective, will feature one of America's favorite comedians and expects more laughter than the one shown on the photo. Hell even Steve Oedekerk, who wrote and directed the horrendous Barnyard movie last year and gets a credit in writing, did a better job. The fact is that Evil Almighty is not the worst image of the summer season but it is perhaps the most disappointing. The title and the creative team behind the photo suggest it's a sequel to Bruce Almighty's (2003) film. In this photo, Jim Carrey was in the lead, and although Steve Carell and Carrey are both cool guys, it's the guy who's the best guy for this type of gear. I heard that this suite was offered to Carrey before anyone else, but the actor refused to declare that he saw no other place where his character could venture. This is how Shadyac moved to Carell's, who since then took a fun part in the 2003 original and became famous. After sleeping at The 40 Years Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine, the man has become a big business. So it's him rather than Jim who faces the rubber that directs this production in theaters. In this story, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) was elected a congressman. Thus, he and his troop move and declare that Evan can succeed in his work. His wife (Lauren Graham) and her three children doubt, but overall, they show support for Evan, who himself looks forward to the future with optimism. However, things start going fast enough, God (Morgan Freeman) appears to Evan indicating that a flood is approaching and the politician has to build an ark. Initially unaware of the meeting, Evan is quickly given a beard to his dress that refuses to remain shaved and the animals begin to appear two by two. Evan then begins to put the boat under construction, but the neighborhood is not happy and no political colleague (John Goodman). Anyone who expects the far-fetched laughs of some of Tom Shadyac's other films to be left completely cold by this movie. Ace Ventura, Liar Liar and even Bruce Almighty's hell were pretty funny pictures, but all these projects have one thing in mind: the presence of Jim Carrey. Shadyac did not make a film worthy of interest without Carrey at the helm, he worked with Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and now Steve Carell, but only Carrey seems to have managed to blend with Shadyac. After the disappointing box office and critical critics, Carell will no longer want to work with the director. Now that Carrey is realizing more serious projects, Shadyac should quickly find a new comic face. Carell himself is pretty boring here. Whoever believes that his role in the first film (despite the fact that it is quite amusing) deserved a feature film should be resumed and shot. I think after Bruce Almighty's draw, it's Universal Studios themselves, but you know that a good comedian can not do anything with a character, so the scren persona is a failure, and that's is exactly the case with Evan Almighty. Lauren Graham does not fear anything as Evan's wife nor do any of the children take the good note. Freeman lets everything fall like God in another fun and icy performance, but he sporadically seems to wear the piece. Indeed, the most constant source of laughter is Evan's secretary (Wanda Sykes) and fellow goblin (Jonah Hill), who made me laugh twice more than any other character in the project . Oedekerk's writing was worse (Barnyard) but also better (Ace Ventura when nature calls it) than his work on this production. His script contains some really fun moments, but he's also full of naughty familiar moments and the humor is never weird or offensive. The film easily gets over religion when it has to shred the concept. Indeed, the opening sequence of the church in The Simpsons Movie shakes religion harder than any of Evan Almight's 95-minute run. With a little more audacity and heart, it could have been a much better picture. I do not doubt that this film will slightly entertain the basic audience of the family, but if they are satisfied, the question is quite different. There is a dividing line between observation and value, a line that Evil Almighty is always on the wrong side. You may be able to watch movies on the cable when you're bored and you can afford to watch movies on the cable, but I can think of much better ways to spend my time and especially to my money than to watch this mediocre comedy.
