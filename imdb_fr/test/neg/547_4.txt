I thought it was an extremely disappointing version of a charming story. I thought the acting game was pretty good overall. Reginald Owen painted the landscape well, as other people have mentioned, but I found it moderately amusing in his brief scenes. TCM became a fan of Ann Harding and I thought she was fine, as usual. Jessie Ralph had a busy day: the old battleaxe, which ordered everyone, and Frank Morgan has, as always, played Frank Morgan with a wink. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem was the script and / or editing. the transitions were clumsy, the motives obscure. The film was too short to tell the story! I felt completely disappointed, especially since I had such good memories of the later version.
