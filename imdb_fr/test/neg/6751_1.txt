it was bad enough. pedestrian work or worse. I do not think it was homophobic, but really bad. if it was really amateur, like when you're 14 years old and you discover for the first time cursed words and skin magazines. <br /> <br /> The main point of this film, romance, really falls flat. I can not help wondering if the writers have had serious connections before this movie. <br /> <br /> The conspiracies and rhythms are horrible, they go nowhere. one minute, we watch these guys catch cheaters, then we're in a gay club, then we're on a date. from nowhere, the girl apparently likes comics, then they sleep together. none of this is real, like a Shakespeare production in a primary school if Hamlet was written by a fraternal boy. <br /> <br /> The end was a kind of goosebumps on the fantasy of supreme revenge of a loser who gets dumped by a girl. Useless and rather disturbing. <br /> <br /> You must nevertheless look at it. Why? <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, the director's commentary is hilarious: what kind of professional talk is he talking about "hitting" or "hooking up" with actresses? the dialogue was nil, relations lacked chemistry. you will be on the floor laughing at this pretentious fool.
