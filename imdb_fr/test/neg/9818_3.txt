It is essentially a non-distinguished film B, mysteriously directed by one of the major talents of the golden age, Fritz Lang. Even with the stellar names of Lang, Walter Pidgeon, Joan Bennett and George Sanders, get ready for a ridiculous scenario, a bad action, seemingly fictitious sets and a broadcast error. For reasons of transparency, I must admit that I am a fervent admirer of Walter Pidgeon, who was fortunate to have found a niche in MGM's artificial dream factory. He is wildly misguided, acting in a shredder, the 1930's comedic comedy tone, Ray Milland, in a role where his life is in danger and where he is hiding. Joan Bennett's cockney accent is excessive, but her lacquered hair, perfect makeup, and elegant outfit conceal a street girl, Cockney. George Sanders is unable to act badly, but disappears after the sneaky opening finds Pidgeon pretending to shoot Adolph Hitler. Fritz Lang is surprised by the uneven tone. I found that the film was hesitating between casual suspense-suspense moments surrounded by light comic interactions. Hitchcock totally reversed the ratio using comic relief to sometimes calm the suspense. There is a reason why this movie is unknown. It has not served or propelled anyone's career or reputation, and is forgotten because it's a surprisingly bad movie from such a small group.
