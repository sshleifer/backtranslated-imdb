On the verge of being unbearable. I was somewhat interested, but was it because I really wanted to know what was the "secret" (which, I should say, is rather obvious) or because I was hoping that Scarlett Johansson would put on a sexier outfit? This film is poor and moreover it is a shame for all the solitary teachers and alcoholics of the literature of the South. Travolta wants his Oscar so much that he is ready to cry drunk in the bathroom after urinating blood. Sorry, buddy. . .You were more believable is "Staying alive". Not everyone can shoot a Peter Fonda in "Ulee's Gold". If you want an Oscar of the kind of brave anti-hero, you must, uh, act. . Not just the pout on the screen. Stop this director before he / she (name is vague about gender) directs again!
