This film is of interest to fans of the famous rock band "The Band" in which the singer / keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in several scenes. It seems to me that the film would have been shot a few years before 75 years, judging by the appearance of Richard. Interestingly, Jones would later play with The Levon in a much better movie, "The coal miner's daughter." Anyway, you really need a special reason to survive this hard-to-watch movie. Alas, the famous sensible man would commit suicide. I never heard how he ended up in a movie. Four of the five members of the band would appear in another bad movie "Man Outside".
