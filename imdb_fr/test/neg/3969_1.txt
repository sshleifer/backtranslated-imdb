SLOOOOOOOW, lukewarm and poorly produced, the 70's schlocker made moore cowvincing because of today's headlines; however, this film is worthy of catch-all because of its unconvincing interpretation, its absence and its idiotic clothes of the 70s (unfortunately, the MooCow remembers the time when the clothes of Adidas were in the mode ...). This gives the same feeling as some of the best science fiction movies of the 70s, namely "WestWorld" and "Logan's Run". While the premise is interesting (the rich are cloning themselves to keep a supply of body parts to keep them alive forever forever), the movie makes the mistake of pissing off with Richard (Tim Donnelly), a clone to both boring and irritating. . Hollow, Donnelly's staging does not solve the problem, but fits the rest of the cast perfectly. Even B-Illuminaries like Dick Sargent (TV series "Bewitched", "Ghost with 1,000,000 Eyes"), Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "The Dark", "Laserblast") and Peter Graves ("Beginning of the End", "Killers from Space", "It Conquered the World") offers only the warmest performances Produced, directed and mounted by a group of nothing, it is not surprising that "Clonus" can not horrify Anything at all Less than keeping the attention of anyone! To tell you the truth, nothing in the film will please all schlock fans - I want to see really bad and fun movies from the 70s, directed by Greydon Clark "Clonus" is not a bonus, says the MooCow even the MST3K version is a yawn, so proceed at your own risk !: = 8P
