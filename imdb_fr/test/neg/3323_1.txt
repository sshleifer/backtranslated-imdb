Why did they start this movie about us? Looks like they've decided to make this film a total slap to Anne Rice and all the respectful Vampire Chronicles fans. He ignores the basic work of Interview with the Vampire, mutilates the plot of the novel and tripping Stuart Townsend intoxicated. <br /> <br /> Stuart is not our Lestat! Our executioner prince, our adventurous rebel with the most damned sense of humor. Stuart is a boring dracula scam in black leather. He did NOT read the books or know the character ... is he illiterate? Tom Cruise is dyslexic and he still wanted to read the books, to know and to love Lestat. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled, this is not a vampire movie "Stand Alone", it's a pure thing.
