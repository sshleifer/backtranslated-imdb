"The Next Karate Kid" is a perfectly predictable movie, just like its predecessors. Predictability often creates a sense of impatience in the viewer, who often wants the story to advance a little faster. Despite its lull and extreme familiarity, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost exclusively because of Morita's presence. He does not seem tired of his role and he brings life and humor into the film, becoming the best reason to see him. Not horrible, but not much either.
