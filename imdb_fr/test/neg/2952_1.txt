The opening scene makes you feel like watching a play in high school. But I saw high school play with better acting! Each line was so obviously delivered that I felt like watching actors work instead of seeing characters. I found the development of the character mediocre and the game very forced! I discovered that in 25 minutes in the film, I did not care anymore about what had happened, because the plot was too obvious and I was bored. I stayed in the room, waiting for the film to redeem itself, but it never happened. Sister Thérèse was too kind, even for a nun, but seemed impulsive and slightly manipulative. Overall, I was very disappointed.
