Have you ever wondered why these guys - Seagal, Stallone, Willis and others - were able to survive all these gun battles in which they were outnumbered? I think I understood it. Enemies still miss him, and the hero does not. <br /> <br /> Here, Seagal has a pistol and exceeds half a dozen soldiers who shoot him a few meters from him. One of the heavy ones has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them have. It does not really matter. There could be a thousand shotguns fired at him and Seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to mano a mano fight - forget it. The thieves may or may not be armed with swords, knives, or blunt objects, but Seagal, with his skill in aikido, tempura, sushido, or some other game, removes some disdainful blows. Not only does he master these skills perfectly, but his physical strength is Herculean. More than once, it breaks someone's long bones as easily as we would break a toothpick. One, he breaks a guy's spine over his knee. <br /> <br /> I will tell you something. (I get into the spirit of the film here because Seagal uses the following sentence: "I'm going to tell you something", several times, as well as "What is it supposed to mean?") Guys totally deserve the extinction of any good Xenophobe Handbook. They are all black, speak with incomprehensible accents of Jah-MAY-can, wear dreadlocks that seem to need a shampoo, they torture and murder with aplomb, and here is the worst. They are not Christians. It is true. They practice voodoo. <br /> <br /> The voodoo element is becoming the most interesting element of the film. They understood very well the components of the ritual - cigar smoke, rum spit, sacrificial chicken. They have only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer. They should have read MÃ©traux on voodoo. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the plot follows the usual conventions. What was done to Jaqueline Bissett by voodoo practitioners in "The Deep" is done here by a friend from Seagal. What was done to John Wayne when he was stuck between trucks in "McQ" is done here in Seagal himself. At the very beginning of the film, when Seagal made a brief speech about seeing too much unnecessary violence in his DEA career, he is now happy to retire. When we were introduced to his friends and family, I tried to keep track of his affiliates to see if I could choose which ones would be horribly murdered or maimed to spark his quest for revenge. <br /> <br /> The action does not really require a lot of comments. But Charles, the Jamaican cop, played by Tom Wright, is really good. Wright has a considerable reach. Here, he is an associate of questionable allegiance, rather sinister. But in "The Pentagon Wars", he has a comic part that he under-exploits perfectly. <br /> <br /> Jamaicans have never flown like villains. I do not know exactly why. It's a small cinema market. And if you go to Jamaica, stay in Montego Bay. However, if you want to see Jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavyweights, and if you fancy another typical action movie, this should be a satisfying sight.
