A rather mild horror film; without some sex scenes, it could easily have been a TV movie. Plot holes abound (an example: why would there be a secret passage of the 18th century leading from the upper floor of a house burned and a new building set up 200 years later?), Cardboard, characters doing things that anyone with an IQ greater than the size of his shoe would not do ... <br /> <br /> He has some fun moments, but overall, it's a sub-par movie that has succeeded to get Roy Scheider because his bills were due. If you're looking for an extremely formal and predictable movie that can give you some laughs, it's worth watching. If not, then this one is not for you.
