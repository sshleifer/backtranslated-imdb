Kokoda was inspired by the events on Kokoda's runway during World War II, when the Australian militia slowed down and finally put an end to the pressure of 10,000 Japanese soldiers to move through the land and capture Port Moresby. What they really mean is that the film takes place at that time but it's a fiction and all that's happening is a mix of standard movie scenes from war. The first hour is only one shot after another. Some of the scenes are just there to give the impression that this conflict was horrible beyond comparison, so there seems to be little evidence of that. Both sides fought to control the track and no mercy was shown on either side. Both sides suffered logistical shortages and the terrain was a formidable leveler in this conflict. As the Japanese approached Port Moresby, their supply network grew, eventually leading to their collapse. In contrast, when Australians pulled out closer to Port Moresby, their supply line declined. Some scenes seem to come straight out of the manual of standard scenes to be included in any war movie. The film was lost and highlighted the youth of the production team. Kokoda is a superficial disappointment at a time when Australia could have done away with a great movie about one of Australia's best moments.
