The very strange scenario of Cameron Crowe (following his "Fast Times at Ridgemont High") has little inspiration and unleashes in front of silly gags. At least "Fast Times" had a good deal of satire and sensitivity behind his slapstick (courtesy of a good director, Amy Heckerling, and Crowe's undeniable penchant for capturing the perfect teen as a perfect letter); Here, Chris Penn (Sean's brother, natch) is the jester who makes life hard for Eric Stoltz, an arrow, and the filmmakers seem to think he's hilarious. Jenny Wright has good moments as a laborer in a shopping mall, but Illan Mitchell-Smith is lost in a grueling subplot about a teenager who seems to be in love with an ex-soldier in shock. Queasy, confused nonsense given a brilliant shine and a soundtrack full of pop-rock melodies, but characters that one hopes to avoid. Supporting players Lea Thompson, Rick Moranis, Lee Ving and Sherilyn Fenn are wasted in silly roles. * from ****
