OK, so screenwriter / director Larry Bishop obviously has important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood to produce his own film and fill the cast with catchy names. Good for him! Now, what he always needs is inspiration and talent to come up with a worthy storyplay rather than the convoluted and pretentious shit he's crafted here. "Hell Ride" is not a movie; It's a frantic and desperately foolish fan-boy attempt to pay homage to the notorious 1960s biker movies and the recently re-established Grindhouse cinema formula. With "Hell Ride", Larry Bishop fails embarrassingly in his organization for many obvious reasons. He does not have a story to tell ?? or at least not very interesting ?? but attempts seriously to hide this through many redundant frame twists, tons of free and very unpleasant conversations for women, dialogues too long and pitiful aspiring to be a quantity of senseless and cold violence. The plot seems complex but can actually be summed up in one sentence. The old vendetta between two rival biker gangs breaks out again with the arrival of a new member; a boy who may or may not be the lost son of a long girl who was executed in 1976. That's it, seriously! Everything else, from betraying gang members to recruiting older members, to playing with her nymphomaniac informing daughter, is completely useless and confusing. Another major Hell Ride problem is Larry Bishop's extraordinary and seemingly insatiable ego. He certainly should not have rewarded himself with the role of hard and implacable gang leader, because it seems only incredibly pretentious and limited; especially when there are so many other more experienced stars in the film. Admittedly, Bishop played in two or three real 60s biker movies (like "The Savage Seven" and "Angel Unchained"), but it's been a long time and he's not really good at acting . Perhaps it was simply Bishop's lifetime dream of playing a character that always surpasses his enemies and for which all the sexy guys are sexually interested, and who has just written a whole scenario around this character. Casting veterans, like Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen, do not bother to leave a plausible impression and I can not say I blame them. All this production is lame and pathetic and I can not bring myself to recommend it to anyone, despite the fact that many beautiful girls parade with bare breasts and bare buttocks.
