My mother, my cousins ​​and I are big fans of Jane Austen. We all know the words of the 1995 masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, and we watched Emma on an embarrassing day with Gwyneth Paltrow. I read all the books and I even sat down a few times in Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion. So my mom and I thought it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey in film. <br /> <br /> Bad idea! It's about the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice in the Mirror, or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $ 1 (my previous "worst movies"). The first thing wrong, that you notice in the opening scene, Is the "heroine", Catherine, a macabre and strange imagination, inspired by trash novels that a heroine of Jane Austen would never touch. Throughout the novel, she has dreams (day and night) in which she is carried away by a hideous man with a fat wig, dragged across a field to God knows what-all, and suddenly saved by a dashing guy on a white horse. <br /> <br /> The second thing that any viewer of the film will immediately notice is the bitter music and sharp saxophone that is supposed to be the soundtrack. Here, no delicate classical music or English country country! It is also obvious, almost at first sight, that the actress (for lack of a better word) chosen to play Catherine is completely crazy. Firstly, it is rather unattractive and is rendered even more by its behavior unlike that of Austen. His looks and movements are just crazy! Plus, they are completely touched and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> This sad lack of talent for the game touches almost all actors of the film. Not even Mr. Tilney, the supposed "dashing young contender" is not correct. <br /> <br /> As more and more characters are introduced, filmmakers have a strange taste for costumes. Huge Marie-Antoinette style headdresses collide with (for the most part) Empire style dresses. A French woman, apparently a friend of General Tilney, is all black as a kind of old Gothic nightmare - she bears a striking resemblance to Michael Jackson wearing a black dress. His appearance is made even more ridiculous by a huge half-moon mark of beauty on his cheek. I also wondered about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick worn by almost all women. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly that made my mother and I laugh crying for about ten minutes was the "bathing" scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing together in a big public bath - probably not very likely in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large porcelain plates. or plastic, around the neck with strings. The plates floated horizontally on the water, containing mysterious pieces of ... something. We guessed it was soap, then aromatic herbs, and finally, when the mysterious substance started to disappear between shots, we deduced that it was food. But I'm still not sure. <br /> <br /> And that's not even half of what's wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to all those who plan to rent this movie: stay your hand. And if someone plans to buy it - well, I do not even know what to say to that. <br /> <br /> One would think that when the actors and other people who make this film have received about 1/4 of the way through, they would realize what monster they were creating and stopping. Unfortunately, they did not do it and Northanger Abbey was accepted into the world.
