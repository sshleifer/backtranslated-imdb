Zoey 101 is essentially a girl named Zoey who is transferred to a boarding school for boys during the first year of integration of girls. I admit that this crude plot is a very good idea. Although this show is aimed at children, a five-year-old could probably point out his deadly flaws. First, Zoey is a clich√©, she is very popular, very attractive, very intelligent, and nothing goes; No girl is like that. Looks like the series has been under the spotlight of Jamie Lynn Spears and has gained notoriety. Dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is just nasty. However, in my opinion, she was probably the most realistic character, which is sad to see that Dana is never kind. Nicole is too energetic and acts like a complete airhead, but mysteriously obtains A. Lola seems to be able to deceive anything with her deserving Emmy actress talents. Quinn is supposed to be super smart, and even if she's able to create the most unrealistic things, she's also made to be weird, and she never gets any guys though she's both pretty and smart, while Zoey, Lola and Nicole Get the guys and they are all beauty and without personality. Chase and Michael are very similar and I sometimes confuse them. Logan is incredibly wealthy and distributes millions of dollars. Nobody is so rich. I also noticed that all the characters in the show are mean to this girl from Stacy, who is just being nice to them. It's not funny! It's nasty and it just makes young girls act like totally friendly people. Finally, the school itself adds icing to the unreal cake by offering students 5-star facilities: a panoramic location, a sushi bar, a cozy lounge with free soda dispensers, a swimming pool and jacuzzi, a movie theater and a boys' allowance. and girls. to enter the dormitories of the other sex freely. In most boarding schools, if a boy were to enter the girls' dormitory or vice versa, he would be deported. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few more years writing. process.
