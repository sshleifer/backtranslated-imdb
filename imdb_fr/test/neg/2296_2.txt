To say that this film is a decent or pleasant horror tribute is far too optimistic. Heck, you can not even see a nice parody like this because it's way below average (it's funny, but not "haha-funny, you know), but I'd still like to watch it. By the way, all those who complain about this film in their comments have to blame themselves.When you see the DVD cover of this movie, you should already know that it will not be same level as "The Piano" for example, so do not complain after ... <br /> <br /> Evil Ed could have been something, but all damn in the air. The main idea of ​​this film is to criticize the "cutting committee" growing in the horror of today, and it shows a publisher, Edward, who went crazy (well, not too slowly) seeing all the violence and gore of The big boss is Sam Campbell ... It's funny, no, I personally was waiting for a character named Bruce Raimi. Anyway, this guy became rich by making movies called "Loose Limbs". They include (and I do not make fun of you!) Scenes in which a girl is raped by a BEAVER (?) Then gets shot in the head by a bazooka! Now who can say that horror is no longer an original phenomenon? <br /> <br /> With all the gore and "loose limbs", it's hard to believe but it gets really boring very quickly. After 25 good first minutes, Evil Ed turns into total boredom and never recovers. The only thing left to do then (apart from pressing the eject button, of course) is to look for the obvious amount of references to other horror movies much better. I've seen visibly stolen scenes in The Evil Dead, Silence of the Lambs, Braindead and many others. And there is a huge amount of classic horror posters on the walls to admire as well. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed finds its origin in Sweden. I am sure there is a lot of talent there, very far north (for example, the Danish "Nattevagten") ... but none of them joined the cast or the team of Evil Ed Only to see if you are in a stupid mood and do not want to use your brain at all.
