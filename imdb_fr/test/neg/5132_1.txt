My friend and I rented this movie for $ 3.99 at blockbuster. If I had known how horrible this movie was, I would not have paid a cent. I had no warning for this bs. We can not even call the acting, the inevitable sex scene is embarrassing, and you can say that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing it, and the male villain ... my god , who could not say that he was going to attack Emily And the musical signals ... my lord. This film makes me want to cry. Never rent this. In fact, if you look at it, evaluate your eyes. This film is not from God, it comes from hell. I'm just going to take the last lines to write blah blah blah shiz because I really do not want to continue with this criticism.
