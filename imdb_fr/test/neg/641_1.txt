"Hey hey hey hey, man - look at these aliens, they're like - biting humans and all that stuff! Uh hey hey hey hey hey" <br /> <br /> That must be the worst movies of all time . It is completely ridiculous for anyone with a minimal brain. Of course, you have reviewers on the payroll who give critical reviews and vote strongly for this abomination, but it's easy to know who these sales are. Their criticism is too good. To give a film like this one even a mediocre critic claiming that he had a remedy for the movie B would be a laudatory review! To say that this film is a good film gives companies a boost. <br /> <br /> But enough of that. <br /> <br /> This film had all the bad characteristics that a film can have without being as bad as it is pleasant to laugh. The old movies of Japanese monsters of the 60s had a quality that was missing from this movie. At least in these 60s movies, you could laugh at how bad the rubber monster costume looked. Or laugh at seeing the ropes holding the spaceships, how the mannequins hung on the ropes and how the flames bent upwards. These movies made fun of how bad they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) really seems to be a good film, which makes it incredibly absurd. <br /> <br /> The effects have been terrible compared to current standards. Beyond terrible. However, this is not as serious as the monster movies of the 60s, hence the lack of comic appeal. The plot and the dialogue were about as sophisticated as I've ever seen, even worse being quite predictable. I will not even mention the plot and the logical flaws of it; it just would not be fair for this pitiful plot (plus, it would take too much time to start). Most of the actors were awful; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to accept touching this one. <br /> <br /> SciFi Channel quickly becomes the "chain of the cheapest chills", producing film after film without concept or intelligence in the lot. I can only wonder: why bother? <br /> <br /> Do not bother with these guts. It does not get worse.
