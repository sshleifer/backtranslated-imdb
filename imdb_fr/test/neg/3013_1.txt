this show is bad. I do not even think I need to say it or reason, because judging by the number of comments already, I simply repeat. the keys of the vip are like turning on your TV and throwing poo at you. That is exactly what I feel. I do not exaggerate a little bit. these guys are so stupid, not funny and not easy with the ladies that it's not even funny-casue-it's stupid. I sat for four episodes and want to get my two hours back. where do they find the candidates because they are obviously mentally deficient. If I were the man who had the idea of ​​creating a show and I put it on television, I would do a favor to the whole world and jump from the tallest building I could find. how are such wastes transmitted on television? especially the comedy network should not it at least have a comedy show on a channel called comedy, or maybe be funny so often?
