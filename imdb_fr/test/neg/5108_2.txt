Man this thing bites! I'm sorry I have never sat and watched! Friedkin was crazy to have made a movie to try to win the sympathy of viewers for this crazy. If it were up to me, I would have incited the public to hate this life so low instead of looking at it wrong! He killed people! Very grizzly I could add too! And Friedkin wants you to feel sorry for him because he's "not right"! I say that Friedkin can forget it! I hate the guy on which this movie is partly based and hope they have shown wisdom and gave his sorry juice !!! In short, do not waste your time! It's sick and perverse!
