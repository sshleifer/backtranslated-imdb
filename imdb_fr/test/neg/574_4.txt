"The Love Letter" is one of those films that could have been very intelligent, but they ruined it. Focusing on a letter that wreaks havoc in a small town, the film has a cast of stars who have nothing to do. Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond recently shared the spotlight in the super-hilarious film "In & Out" (which also speaks of a surprise in a small town), in which they were both awesome, but they look here to take drugs. all over. I can not say what the people behind the camera are trying to do here (if anything), but they certainly have not accomplished anything. What a tragedy that a potential riot of laughter was so painfully wasted.
