I understand the draw and I use such a different type of film and I am a great admirer of the movies with little dialogue but still this one absolutely terrible. I went to the Scottish Highlands and found the lack of Scottish accents in the characters disappointing. This plot was strong enough in theory but the inexpensive sets and the lack of a single realistic character prevented this film from taking off. I think the use of silence to create an atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some kind of presence without speaking and these actors certainly can not. If you want a silent movie that captures that presence, try (The Last Fight). There have been very few films that I have not even managed to finish and this is one of them. Absolute dribble!
