This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed and if Jane Austen was alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It is also a commentary on Regency Britain's class structure. This film focuses solely on the love story, thus disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel. <br /> <br /> The historical accuracy of the film poses many problems. In the film, the dance to which Darcy snubs Elizabeth is not the refined dance practiced by the gentry, to which belong the families Bennet, Lucas, Bingley and Darcy, but rather the dance of the lower classes. The gentry would not have danced as if she were in a peasant dance. There are also problems of costumes and hair. The custom of the time required married women to wear white hats to cover their hair and to wear hats outside. The women of the Regency period were not liberated enough to give up the demands of the cap in public. The worst historical inaccuracy is Elizabeth's morning meeting (in her nightgown and cloak) and Mr. Darcy's (without a tie and vest), during which they recognize their love for each other. It is an unforgivable liberty with the novel. No respectable young lady or gentleman would venture into such a state of undress or seek to meet a person of the opposite sex at such an early hour. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this film is the silence of Austen's dialogue and the awful modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue does not need the help of a writer who thinks he can write like Austen. The author of the non-Austen dialogues does not only have the talent of Austen, nor does he have any idea of ​​his style. The juxtaposition of the two styles is discordant. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, the best is done by Judi Dench, who clearly understands the urgency of the aristocracy. Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties to make Mrs. Bennet less horrible than Austen's portrait. His performance is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is a bad idea. His affected British accent is terrible and he describes Mr. Bennet too much as a father of the twentieth century and not as a father of the late eighteenth century. Darcy's portrayal by Matthew MacFadeyn is flat. I can not imagine anyone falling in love with his Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightly is a pretty Elizabeth, but her portrait of Elizabeth Bennet is far too modern. Knightly focuses on Elizabeth's frankness, but her portrayal lacks full understanding of the social mores and conventions of the time. She would have done well to read the novel before trying to represent Elizabeth and do research on the behavior of women of that time. <br /> <br /> If you make a movie, you have to be faithful to the period. This movie needed a historical advisor who really knows something about the Regency period. He also needed a writer who understands Austen's text better. I only hope that Emma Thompson will decide to shoot a film of pride and prejudices soon to erase this abomination from our minds. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is that it contains many beautiful scenes of the English countryside. Chatsworth is well used as Pemberly (as in the 1995 adaptation of the BBC). But the beautiful landscapes and the pretty actors can not save this film. Real fans of Austen will rush home to watch their DVDs of the 1995 BBC's much superior production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth or read Austen's text to clean up this version of their mind.
