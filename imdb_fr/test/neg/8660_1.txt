What a shitty movie! The main character of this film was supposed to be born and raised in Canada, but he had a thicker Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or does Uday look gay in this movie? In addition, do all the girls in Canada dress like sluts? At least that's how it is in this film. All women are dressed as strippers. Do not waste your time with this one! The only good thing about this movie is the setting in the beautiful city of Vancouver. I wonder why Bollywood is going through a crisis? It's because of movies like this one. The good old days when Hindi films were really entertaining miss me! I could not even finish this movie because it was so bad. I think Bollywood should stop trying to reproduce the Hollywood style because it just does not work. They have to stay true to their roots because that's what makes Indian movies fun.
