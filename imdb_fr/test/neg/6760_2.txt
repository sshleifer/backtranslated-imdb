This film is the standard goofy science fiction fare of the 1950s. In its favor, the plot manages to provoke an alien invasion without producing the extraterrestrials themselves. But if extraterrestrials needed energy and could absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why would they come to earth? Why would not they be satisfied with a star !!!! The only credible reason for Kronos' presence is a direct attack on Earth society, not just a collection of energy. Nothing of the kind is even suggested; Kronos may have been built by a superior race, but its activities on Earth are the most primitive. The end of the science-hero project for Kronos is based on pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo. This equates to the "reverse polarity" gambit that has been so used in bad science cases that it has become a joke in itself. Down and here, this causes our unwanted visitor to release his collected energy. No one in power seems to care about the impact that releasing that amount of energy (which includes, among other things, all the performance of a hydrogen bomb) will have on the surroundings. And unfortunately, at the end of the film, the surroundings are in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Thanks!
