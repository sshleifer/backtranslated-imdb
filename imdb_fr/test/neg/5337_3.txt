Oh no, one of those attacks of Japanese ghost girl movies ... I do not even remember how much I saw. maybe he is selling ... but not to me. not scary at all. Japanese horror movies are very similar since the first of these ... also the film that pulls the child. I have seen this scene so often in so many horror movies. The mobile phone scene is not new either ... the tragedy of the guy who got knocked down by a train is a bit lame ... I mean, it was missing everything that is dramatic ... OK, it's for 14- to 16-year-olds who are listening to Japanese rock and think they are so unique ... let me tell you. there is a million of you = D this is one of them. I saw worse, but you will not miss anything by NOT seeing this!
