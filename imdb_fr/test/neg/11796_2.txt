There are many repetitive dialogues in this movie about "cold spots" (signaling the presence of a ghost) and characters begging to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feeling of the film, I will repeatedly mention cold points throughout this review. I've seen worse movies than the St. Francisville experience, but it's perhaps the most "forgettable" of all ("it's getting cold!"). Basically, twenty years spend the night in a haunted house. This is filmed as a so-called true documentary. This is obviously not real, but the house contains some cold spots. SPOILERS- (as if you would not be able to predict the essence of the plot!). There is not much going on in this movie. We have the consecrated horror clich of a cat jumping out of hiding at the beginning, as a scary "practice" to warm the audience. People wander with flashlights, sometimes taking a moment to remind home that they come in peace, that they do no harm to the spirits (or cold spots) that are inside. From time to time, a door closes and surprises someone. Of course, the painting ouija is making its appearance. They talk with a ghost named "Charles". A girl is eating a sandwich with a cockroach in it. More cold spots. Another door closes and a guy goes off about the sound of the door. Scratch, scratch, he says. Oh my god, someone said. "Surround yourself with white light." I admit that there is a good scene in the attic (where a chair is overturned by a ghost) that really caught me off guard. But aside from some pretty funny dialogues, the chair scene (the actual fraction of a second when it's reversed, nothing immediately before or after that moment) is the only good thing in this movie. However, there are still cold spots here. Finally, the film ends. Nobody dies. No more details needed. I was not a big fan of Blair Witch Project, but it sounds like a masterpiece of the St. Francisville experience. You may find yourself not debating whether or not it is a true documentary, but whether it is intended to be funny or not. I still do not know. But whatever it is, it failed.
