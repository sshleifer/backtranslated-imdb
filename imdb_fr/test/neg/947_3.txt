The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal organizes his fairs in "My Giant" is to say that this film is for his career as "Ishtar" was for Warren Beaty - that did not ruin him, but that slowed down ..... .. a lot. Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play in front of a child 2) never play in front of an animal 3) never play in front of someone who is almost three feet higher than you, is as innocent as a child and "acts" like an animal. <br /> <br /> What is this story? A comedy? I guess, but I did not laugh, except in the scenes where Crystal is alone and does not have the burden of her ex-wife (or her role in this movie) or the aforementioned giant. Did I mention that there is also a child in this movie? Well, forget about him. The son is brought to make us feel sorry for Crystal, and we do it, but for the actor, not for the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you do not believe me, watch it in old episodes of "Soap" or "Saturday Night Live". Go rent "City Slicker" or "Running Scared" or "When Harry will meet Sally." <br /> <br /> "Giant" is more stammered than fee-fi-fo-fum. <br /> <br />
