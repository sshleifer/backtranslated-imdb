I am ashamed to have been to the theater to see this film during its first release. Although I suppose that his thinly veiled description of Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy's story is pretty well done, it's a film that should never have been shot; Hence my low note. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a rich Greek business shark called Theo Tomasis, who woos and wins the charming young widow, Liz Cassidy, from a dead American president. Sounds familiar? Yes, everything but names. <br /> <br /> The cast is irreproachable. Anthony Quinn embodies the Greek tycoon to perfection, and at least that's a consolation, as he just read that Ari himself asked Quinn to play the role. Jacqueline Bisset is of course beautiful and sophisticated in the role of Jackie, and James Franciscus has all the American look of the president. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie since. he's out, I do not want to see him again. It seems to me that I remember a rather bad language and some general rudeness. Otherwise, I guess it's a sensational and so-called intimate glimpse of life in the jet of the rich and famous, frolicking aboard their yachts, beaches, pools, etc. Yes, the landscape of the Greek islands is spectacular, the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of this type, that's fine, I suppose. There is no end of TV movies on Kennedys, which I admit watching from time to time, not to my credit. This is basically just another. It is better to let Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis rest in peace.
