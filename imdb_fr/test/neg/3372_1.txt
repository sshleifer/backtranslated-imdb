Jack Frost 2 was a horrible, terrible and sadly pathetic excuse for a sequel to a great movie. The original was a low budget comic horror movie about an assassin who had been turned into a snowman after an accident with toxic waste. And the snowman went to kill people and avoid hair dryers like the plague. This, however, was far from the quality of the original. Looks like it even had a lower budget because for some reason, after an hour in this movie, I still had not seen the snowman. A revenge he gets if he always has the form of ice cubes with a voiceover and a slight jolt of the coolness in which he rests to give animation to the character. Disappointing without conviction, even for a fan of bad cinema.
