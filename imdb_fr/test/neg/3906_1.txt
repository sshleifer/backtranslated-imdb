I saw this movie partly because of positive comments on IMDb. After wanting to find those 90 minutes of my life, I feel that it's my duty to continue myself and say ... Please do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I can not argue the efforts of the actors - they did what they could with the material, but this material is awful. The pace was deadly - slow, winding, and you saw everything happen at about an hour, and it took forever to make that happen. The dialogue was boring, useless, not funny at all. The characters were completely unfriendly. And the cinematography was, in my opinion, very bad quality - the clich√© of "the character uses the video machine at home!" was very badly used. <br /> <br /> Yes, Jeri Ryan is a cool person. Do not let this jerk make you waste your time on this movie.
