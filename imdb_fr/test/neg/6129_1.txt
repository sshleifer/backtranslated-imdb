Oh, my boy. This film is something for lovers of "real" cinematic art. It really does not make sense. It's totally boring, especially because of the "anti-climax". Everyone behaves more than strange and unrealistic. Sometimes, it feels like theater, because in the dialogues, actors tend to face the camera (and therefore the public) rather than others. As I said before, if you like the more artistic films presented in Cannes, go ahead. If you're not, you'd better leave this film alone, because you'll be more than disappointed and, in the end, you'll know you've wasted your time, as I did. Two inches down ...: - ((
