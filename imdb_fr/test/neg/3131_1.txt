It could have been an excellent movie. However, as many others think, it is badly done because of the language transfer. If the whole movie is to be read, it takes away somehow and becomes something else. He has an excellent rating for me and I could not wait to rent it. But, once I did it, it was really disappointing. Here at Boardman, Ohio, I found no similar English version. This film has also been compared to Dark Hours and we will not be able to see it in Boardman, Ohio. It is not available. So, I guess we'll never know how good the movie was.
