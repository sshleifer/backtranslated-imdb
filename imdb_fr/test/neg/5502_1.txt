this movie has surely been hacked by the studio? Maybe not, but I have the feeling that the story had serious flaws that, if not attributed to the editing process, could only be caused by terribly bad, criminal, written and directed things. <br /> <br /> I understand the effect Burton wanted. achieve with a stylized action game similar to Edward Scissorhand's gothic fairytale atmosphere, but here, unfortunately, it falls flat and does not reach the mythical depths of the tropes, but only the offensive guts of the assignment. that is to say, a mediocre acting game and superficial characterization, even for a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> finally not so scary, even amusing, in his attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for the background of the plot was clumsy and unnecessary. the mystery of who is the headless rider would be enough, no need for the myth of a German mercenary, although Christopher Walken has made a dashing but not threatening figure - seeing the rider's head makes him look more friendly than a decapitated man of nine feet spirit as in the original legend. <br /> <br /> no real rhythm nor universal tone has ever been established and not a classic in shades of darkness. raised and cut like my tee shot ...
