For the most part, "Michael" is a disaster ?? Ten minutes of charm and ninety missteps. <br /> <br /> Travolta and MacDowell do their best, often standing above Nora Ephron's banal and numbing scenario. But the film moves like a snail. And even in its imaginary context, the characters behave improbably on a regular basis. (Journalists who consistently leave behind the story of a life - an apparent angel living on Earth?) <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell the romantic comedy maestro Ephron that William Hurt, brilliant in so many other films, is not Tom Hanks The film's "climax" redefines the word "invented." Ephron may be running for Heaven here, but unfortunately, "Michael" is a very long journey through the cinema.
