It's almost Ed Wood's territory. Yes, this ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey buzzard and a bad day at the dentist. And this noise of sound effect makes that the nails of a painting resemble those of Mozart. And why The Giant Claw when the clumsy creature gobbles its victims with a mechanical jaw. We have big close ups of this ugly chicken foot, but nothing more. I guess the producers thought that Big Mouth could instead suggest a comedy by Jerry Lewis. And speaking of comedies, all this gobbledy-gook "anti-matter" is funnier than anything in a Lewis movie. I suppose the writers were stuck for a reason why an ordinary duck hunter could not handle a 1950s flying threat, so they put together a real whopper - an anti-matter from another galaxy. Yes, this fugitive from KFC is supposed to have come from another galaxy behind a shield of anti-matter, as explained in an unsustainable way by one of the film's resident geniuses. In this case, it is Jeff Morrow, a pilot who, when he is out of his working hours, advises Einstein on the secrets of the universe. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is also Morrow who keeps rid of the ridiculous procedure of the infamous Hall of Shame, because he delivers his lines with an impassive face. Moreover, he even seems to believe in them. This is a triumphant film of the first order. To enchant the Oscars, Morrow deserves a medal for fighting past the call of duty in the most extreme circumstances. Watch Chief Lady Corday, then you can measure her strength under fire. She seems to wake up in a bad dream and maybe if she stays still, no one will notice her. I hardly did. Oh, well, the first time I saw this drive-in disaster was because of a beer fog in the last row of what is now a subdivision. I should have learned my lesson and take out another 12-pack this second time.
