There are bad movies and there are movies that are even worse. Saw is just that. <br /> <br /> The movie is just bad on every point. The plot, the acting, the work of the camera, the music and everything else are absolutely terrible and I can not understand how such a trash came to the big screen. <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that Saw is riddled with holes in the ground. The beginning is enticing and leaves much to be hoped, but it does not hold and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and will not leave you a little credibility. People who claim that this movie is bloody, violent, sadistic and scary are sissy girls who have nightmares after watching CSI because that is far from the case. <br /> <br /> I warn you then, do not try to look at this if you have a form of intellect, because you will be disappointed. A real boredom and a mediocre film as one can.
