What was that? My family and I have just lost 2 hours of our life for this waste! There was no conspiracy, no tension, only a lot of trouble !!! My kids could make better movies with our video camera. <br /> <br /> But maybe we just did not understand the purpose of the movie ... oh, wait, my mom did it. She was the only one to like it for the following reason: "At least one film without cars crying ..." If you're looking for a war movie without battles, it's always interesting and captivating and has a strong anti-war message , then you should watch "The Trench". <br /> <br /> I give this film 3 out of 10 because it is enough for a nap and because I am too nice ...
