After a meteorite landed in "Boston" (actually somewhere in the Isle of Man), a hideous and hideous alien monster is released and fleeing to a local girl's school, causing chaos and transforming students in creatures resembling zombies. This film is apparently a remake of the 1986 film with the same name, because it presents the same monster but a different plot. Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was viewable. It's not. Let's start with all the problems - the acting, especially that of the head teacher, was very, very bad. This movie is supposed to take place in Boston (we know it because the filmmakers had the ingenious idea of ​​putting "Boston Police" or "Boston Gas Society"), but everyone seems to have a little confused British accents (did not try to use the accents of Boston, thank goodness). The script is a big imperfect mess. The best example of the stupidity of writing is that it is established that you can convert students into zombies into humans by removing a collar containing a piece of meteorite. Is this what our brave heroes do? No, they run instead of filming the zombie students. Pleasant. The director Paul Matthews, who also wrote and directed the monstrous film "Grim" of 1995, obviously does not know how to punctuate his films. The film is terribly boring in places. The lighting is awful. The film looks cheap and bland. One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of significant gore. 99% of the death scenes depict the creature emerging from a dark corner and dragging someone, while we hear that they are "horrified" and howling in the distance. This convention has never worked well in the past and certainly does not work here. The visual effects were AWFUL. The opening sequence of the CG in space seemed to have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for the sake of God! The "explosion" of the fuel tanks at the end was just as terrible. Okay, I like to think of myself as an honest critic, so I'll give credit for the merit - the creature effects were actually pretty cool. We must love these close-ups of sticky and slobbering teeth! <br /> <br /> To summarize the film, "Breeders" is a dreadful and cheap horror film that should be avoided like the Ebola virus. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
