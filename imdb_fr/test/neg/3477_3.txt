This documentary tries comedy, but never really succeeds. Camp? Ehn, maybe. The most appropriate word everyone agrees with - and will be difficult to avoid in any review - is kitsch. He dripped kitsch. It was as if filmmakers had been afraid that their viewers would take the film too seriously, and went out of their way to insert kitsch and proclaim, "We're laughing here!" <br /> <br /> In short, I felt it was too hard. For example, the sock puppets that introduced each scene were (for me) annoying when I'm sure they were supposed to be fun - or at least (ahem) kitsch-ey. <br /> <br /> Do not do it, however, avoid this movie based on my complaints. Just be ready to revel in kitsch rather than letting go without preparation. If you are interested in the lighter rate, you could do a lot worse. At the very least, the facts surrounding the rise and fall of the Bakers make this event interesting and worthy of consideration. In the best case, kitsch lovers with similar ideas will hound and shout on choice pieces throughout the film.
