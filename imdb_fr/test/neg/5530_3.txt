I'm so happy that I only got this movie for $ 5. The anime is expensive, no doubt. It's been a while since I'm watching this one and I finally saw it on sale. I immediately grabbed her and brought her home only to bend my head in disappointment. This film was nil. I've heard people say how bloody and violent this movie is. It's really not so bloody or violent. I have watched it three times and I think I have ruined my life enough. Demons have a point to be unique and sometimes cool. The sex gains a point since it is almost non-stop. The excited old man gets half a point for being excited and still having sexual desire. And the main character (whose name has been erased from my mind) earns half a point for the cool design of his weapon. I saw important links between this movie and Demon City Shinjuku. Both have an identical style animation, which is obvious because of the director, both have a lame sound that fears like the Antichrist, and both have a terrible end. Avoid this movie unless you are a sex lover.
