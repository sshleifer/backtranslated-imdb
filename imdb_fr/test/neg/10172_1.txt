This film is the biggest bin I've known for a long time. <br /> <br /> It is marketed as a science fiction when it is actually a Christian recruitment tool. <br /> <br /> That tells you a lot about the state of the Christian church, when it has to resort to deception to make you listen to its sales pitch. But again, what do you expect from an organization that would do everything in its power to protect such an enormous number of child molesters in its organization? <br /> <br /> Religion is full of sexual deviants, hypocrites, and merchants of war. Let's not forget that our former delirious president came out and said "God told him" to invade Iraq. And no one asked him if he heard voices or saw things? <br /> <br /> Anyway, go about the subject here. No, this film has nothing to do with UFOs, it's nothing more than a religious production.
