Now, I understand that it took two months to shoot. Really? I'm pretty sure my team could do it in less than a week. This film was so bad that I could not even be very careful. Yet another proof that women with big breasts can not always save you from writing, acting and awful leadership. I now understand that it was a business without a budget, but there was no continuity or any real reason not to turn it off and look at infomercials or foreign information in a language you do not understand. Oh, there are some decent women who show the goods. Yet, there are not enough sexy women alive to justify watching this parody perpetrated in the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. I still helped with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and prepare your weapon because you may want to use it after this hacking job. Finally, the (dumb) individual who left a comment before mine thought it was a good movie and LOVED it. Just further proof that siblings should not create professionally. Ow, BURN !!! - Captain J
