This makes me understand how people can describe this teenager exercise as a movie noir. It's true that there is a gun, a bottle and a lady and that the main role is a private eye, but that's not what makes the genre, the people. It sounds like a heated police TV series - lots of bloody beats and ugly continuity - with a hint of Chinatown memories thrown in. Hard to watch beyond the first 10 minutes. You want a contemporary feel, look at something from John Dahl.
