I think you can not imagine how these people really work ... !! Before coming to the studios to watch the guys working there, I actually thought exactly like you. But since I've seen and done the work the guys on this TV show have to do, I have to say they really deserve respect for what they do all day. It's really not an easy job. And the actors, who in your eyes can be terribly bad, are really great people and many of them can really play! I do not think that the material given to them can really show it, because I think that this material is not very good. But they are really good! So, I do not think that you, before not having seen these guys working there, can judge! And I should not have judged so well before meeting them, but I did it and I'm terribly ashamed of it. So please, do not allow yourself to judge these great people unless you have not seen them occupy this position.
