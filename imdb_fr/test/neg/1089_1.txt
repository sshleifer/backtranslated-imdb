We have given a star to this movie, but it really depends on how you look at it. We are currently watching this on channel 5 at 3:30, and we have not stopped laughing, so maybe we could give it a score of 10 just for entertainment. From the beginning, with the "manic" thoughts of the harasser relayed comically, we laugh. Is it me or this Knott's Landing girl who looks like one of the Dark Crystal characters? <br /> <br /> I will not spoil it for you, however, you will have to be stupid enough not to see it coming, I do not think it's smart enough to make a double bluff. <br /> <br /> It must be the worst / best film we have ever seen, if we had played the clich√© "drink game, then we will be lost now.
