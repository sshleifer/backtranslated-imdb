Perhaps the best part of the show is that it comes right after fans of Conan O'Brien and Late Night suddenly watch the Carson show. Carson Daly can not hold Leno, Letterman, O'Brien or any talk show host late at night, and Last Call seems to miss more than playing in this kind of hit and miss. The only quality of shows that excites her is that she is so short. But I would not call that shit. Carson Daly is sincere and does not hide the fact that his show is not great (this honesty is actually useful here), while some of the skits and material of Last Call seem to be stolen, they still find the mark sometimes. In fact, some of Carson's montages have been quite entertaining, and the sketches sometimes have their decent comedy moments. <br /> <br /> As an interviewer, Carson has no problem, even with a single guest, not with late-night material, but always above the level reached by an AV team of high school. However, he does not have the sharp wit that makes Conan so hilarious. I do not like his musical guests, but it's more because I'm not a fan of this kind of music, so I do not blame him. <br /> <br /> The house band. I do not know the band Joe Firstmans and I would not compare them to the CBS Orchestra, Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleeto and Cleetones are better. But the members of the Firstmans group still make the show in my opinion. Especially the Alto Saxophone player who shows up sometimes (he has long black hair and sunglasses and always plays in the upper register), otherwise watch the show for him, I do it. <br /> <br /> In summary, this show is not worth a bag full of croquettes. But it has an audience and is more appealing to the youngest "MTV generation". If you do not have the cable and are standing at 1:37, there is really not much more to choose from and, surprise surprise, there is worse in this time frame. So, if you wait for Poker After Dark to appear, 30 minutes of Last Call will not kill you during the wait.
