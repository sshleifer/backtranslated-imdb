Uuuuaaa! Barf! Yuk! Yuk! Repugnant! Puke City! The worst piece of scrap ever made. Sick. Bizarre. Horrible. Enough said. Hold your nose. Do not eat After seeing this bucket of sick and insane films, you will not be able to eat your food for a week. But maybe that's good. A new diet has been invented. Go see this film inducing vomit. Fall sick to your stomach. And you will be so upset by all the mess that you will not be able to eat for at least a week and you will drop about 15 pounds. <br /> <br /> Me Me Lay! With a name like this, it's really amazing that she does not have a cult fan. She is considered the worst actress of all time. His films make Ed Woods look like Gone With The Wind. This film is rated minus 10.
