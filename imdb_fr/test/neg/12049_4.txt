The empty shortening of John Irving's novel aims at depth with courage but ends up being absurd. It's a series of odd, wacky and bittersweet sketches that try to explain the growth of a man from his birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him. Garp was born to a great single mom, Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close (three young actors play the different stages of her childhood before Robin Williams takes over as an adult) 'prep school, where Jenny is school nurse, through her passions in high school - wrestling, writing and sexual marriage with her high school love, her kids, her marital problems and her writing career. Meanwhile, Jenny has become a famous feminist, marrying an unorthodox cause. The plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and extravagant adventures. Williams gives a performance to the cherub face. This scenario did not suit his wildness and anarchy and his talent was wasted. He is like a wounded bird spitting out of control. The role of John Lithgow as a transsexual father, conveying wisdom, also makes no sense. This film was able to attract reasonable attention in 1982, due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new entry in the movies. Williams had recently dropped out of Mork and Mindy and was focusing more on comedy and movies. The spectators were disconcerted by this film, in particular by its arbitrary and inexplicable end.
