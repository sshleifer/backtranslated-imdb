I read Dave Robicheaux's novels and consider James Lee Burke as my favorite contemporary fiction writer. I also visited New Iberia and much of Acadiana to better visualize the setting in most of these books. Needless to say, I was expecting a lot to see "In the Electric Mist", especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be great like Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. The story was very agitated; the interaction with the "ghosts of the Confederate dead" was superficial and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was sad, expressionless and hard to understand as a DR. The best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my "idem" to a previous comment from the user, that this movie looked like one of those old movies made for television. I thought Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell would show up anytime. <br /> <br /> The location parameters were accurate, and the photography sometimes captured the essence of smoking bayous, smoked juke joints, and southern Louisiana ground cemeteries. Too bad the inconsistent presentation of the story and the poor performance of Tommy Lee have hindered the unique atmosphere and spicy zest of the region. <br /> <br /> Next Comment: In novels, the nickname of Dave Robicheaux is "Streak". because of the distinct wick of silver gray hair on one side of his head. Tommy Lee had no such record in this film, probably because the editors are fans of James Lee Burke and have repainted the rest after witnessing Mr. Jones' testimony. bad imitation of Dave Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> Final Comment: Although I usually find Alec Baldwin pompous and obnoxious in most roles, he was by far a better Robicheaux in "Prisoners of Paradise" than was Tommy Lee "In the Electric haze. "In addition, Heaven's Prisoners is much more interesting and exciting, with consistently credible performances and an atmosphere more evocative than this new movie. <br /> <br /> "In the Electric Mist" is suitable for watching when you want to "go out". and there is nothing better on television. But then, infomercials are too.
