We saw this in a bargain basket at the local Asda: £ 1.50 for the DVD. reading all the hype plastered all over the cover saying how "hillarious" it was, and that the cast was very good and well established, we thought that this film had to be excellent. <br /> <br /> returned home, inserted in the DVD player, sat down and waited for the amusements to start ....... and waited ....... and waited. .... and waited a little longer. <br /> <br /> Some 90 minutes later, the credits were generated, although it was more like 3 hours. It was the end of this work. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment, even paying £ 1.50 seemed a disadvantage. God knows what Caine, Richardson and Gambon thought when they said "yes" to this tosh. And as for Moran: Although I enjoy Black Books, Shaun of the Dead and his comedy tours, I felt that he was out of place in this film. He was trying too hard to laugh, probably thinking that if he kept the characteristics of his Black Books character, it would work here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he is fired. The gags fell flat after a while, then it became just an irritation. Which is a shame because I think that, if not, he could be a very good actor in a film / character. <br /> <br /> In any case, to summarize: Actors Actors have failed to act! <br /> <br /> ** / *****
