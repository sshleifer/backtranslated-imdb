I did not see this movie when it came out, but some songs shared the title and the term is still used from time to time and I thought there had to be something in the movie, so gave A sight. Now, I would like to have the approximate time and forty-five minutes of my life (it seemed a lot longer). There was nothing particularly bad in the movie, the acting was good, no big holes in the plot, of course, there were not many conspiracies to have holes. There was some chemistry between the two, but nothing convincing in their relationship; Nothing interesting in their history. Toward the end, when he tries to continue the train to catch his fleeing love, neither my wife nor I want him to surprise him. Honestly, we thought they were better together and if they got together again, we did not care. So what does that say about this love story, even when a 25-year-old romantic, like my wife, had no emotional investment in the relationship? I should have left this one in the "failed" category. <br /> <br /> Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html
