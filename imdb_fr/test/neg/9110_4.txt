Airborne has enough talent to keep it going for 90 minutes, although you can not help but think about the weakness of 80's old comedian Steve Guttenburg. in such a cheap production (and play a hard man too!). The plot is simple, the villains have stolen a deadly virus and Guttenburg and the rest of his good friends are sent to recover it, not bad of the kind but not in the same league (obviously) that the films compared also on the cover such than AIR FORCE ONE and CON AIR. The cast is good, with Sean Bean reproaching his character of Brit-nasty that we have seen in movies like GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES.
