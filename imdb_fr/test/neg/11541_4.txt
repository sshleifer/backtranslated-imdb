I appeared as an extra and I was there as a reporter covering "The Dain Curse". My participation took place during the sequences of this film shot in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania (Jim Thorpe was also one of the places of the movie "The Molly Maguires" of 1969). I reported "the action" in the newspaper Emmaus Free Press where I was editor between 1978 and 1980 (the newspaper stopped publishing in the 1990s). I remember the excellent attention paid to the details of the costumes, cars, etc. At the time, I interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a break; I could not interview James Coburn, which has always been a big disappointment for me. By the way, I appear briefly in one of the street scenes with a hat with tweezers and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to "jump in" and it was a real thrill. I still have a collection of black and white stills that I took for the newspaper's production work. One day, they might interest historians of cinema and television .-- Lou Varricchio
