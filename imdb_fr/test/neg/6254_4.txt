CHEERLEADER MASSACRE (2003) <br /> <br /> with: Tamie Sheffield, Charity Rahmer, Erin Byron, Leonard Johnson, E. Eddie Edwards, Samantha Phillips, GiGi Erneta, April Flowers, Nikki Fritz, Tylo Tyler, Brad Beck, Summer Williams, Brinke Stevens, Melissa Brasselle. <br /> <br /> Plot: A group of cheerleaders, as well as their coach and three guys, are about to go to a match when their van breaks down and takes refuge in a cabin nearby. Soon, they drink, have sex and are brutally murdered one by one by an invisible assassin. <br /> <br /> the good: some laughs, surprising killer identity, a cameo from Brinke Stevens, my favorite scene of LE SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE is used as a flashback. <br /> <br /> the bad: I was excited about this movie, I loved the three Slumber Party massacres because they were so much fun and I was expecting a lot from this "Slumber Party / Sorority House Massacre with Scream tones "), but it's just nil! They did too much on the theme "We are nerdy but proud" and made soft-core porn, but with a good pseudonym. <br /> <br /> **
