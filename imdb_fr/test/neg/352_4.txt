This version is very painful to watch. The acting is very overheated, but especially that of Norma Shearer who always plays as if it were in a silent movie instead of a walkie-talkie. Check out the 1937 version with Joan Crawford, Robert Montgomery and William Powell, which is much more entertaining.
