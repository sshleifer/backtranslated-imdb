OK, first of all, who in their minds would like to redo Hitchcock and secondly, who would do it for good? I admit that I did not intend to watch this film for that very reason. The original Psycho movie is one of my favorite movies and it looked like a degrading photocopy. I watched it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed that it was awful less than five minutes ago. First, as mentioned, they did it one after the other. Where is the originality? Why redo an almost perfect movie EXACTLY as it was done the first time? Why redo such a movie to start? If you are going to do something new, redo something that does not work and improve things! <br /> <br /> Second, they used exactly the same script from the 1960 version. The dialogue does not work anymore. It works well and looks perfect for the 1960 version, but seems strange and scalded out of modern actors. Why not update the dialogue? Hitch did not write the script, you could have rewritten it. <br /> <br /> This film had a very good talent and was wasted by the imitation of the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman seemed to play the role of John Anderson's car salesman in the original. All the actors seemed to be the only direction they had been given the characters of the original film. Vince Vaughn may have seemed a little more scary than Anthony Perkins, but you're losing the sympathy you're supposed to have for Norman. Having Norman masturbate watching Marion undressing went too far and lost the innocence of the character Tony Perkins captured so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was way too old to play Caroline. Her lines appeared as a desperate person rather than just young and fun as Patricia Hitchcock's performance. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I saw about the movie is that Gus Van Sant was able to open the film with the shot Hitch had considered. Hitch wanted to open with a long strike on Phoenix but could not at that time, so he had to settle for a series of crossfire. This film concretized this vision with a helicopter filmed in the window of the hotel. After that, the film became an unnecessary celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful movie, look at this, but do not look at it before looking at the original. This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been lit in green. Stick to the master's film, not the imitation.
