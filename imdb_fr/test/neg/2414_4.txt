He begins with some disgusting gags of sexual comedies, but he soon reveals his true colors: he wants to be a clone of "Death Wish". I say "wants" because the script becomes more and more laughable by the minute, it ends up looking like a parody "Death Wish" absurdity! From a love scene in a room filled with candles inexplicably, to "heroes" who disguise themselves as commandos and wave their machine guns because they do not want to be noticed (!), To the bad guys who drive in the city a black van long after being recognized as their vehicle, this movie contains too many ridiculous points to appear in a list. The other major problem is that you can not distinguish most of the characters. Of course, you know who Borgnine and Roundtree are and even James Van Patten, but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in different scenes, and you would not know the difference.
