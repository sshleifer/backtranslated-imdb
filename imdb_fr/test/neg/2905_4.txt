You know, after the first films of Chuck Norris, I was certain that a film had been produced by Golan-Globus, even if I listened to it in the middle, without ever looking at the credits or the title. In addition, I could say that it was Golan-Globus in the minute that followed the screen. Something about the structure of the story, the zany relationships between the characters, the wayward dialogue, the wooden play (punctuated with dreadful and appalling performances), the tempos and rhythms of the scene that gave Albert Pyun an air of John McTiernan, battle choreography not ready for prime time ... Golan-Globus has been incredibly consistent over the years in terms of style, subject and point of view. <br /> <br /> What can you say, it must work for them because they have produced dozens of movies. You go to one of their productions and you know exactly what you are getting. And it's not food for the brain, people. <br /> <br /> "Ninja 3" is another piece of hackwork in a long range of products from the GG Sausage Factory, and offers the limited pleasures typical to moviegoers' palates. You have a Bad Ninja, cutting into pieces cops and criminals and all those who get in their way. You have a good Ninja, committed to stopping him. You have a Westerner in the mix so that we Americans can identify with him (in this case) and be reassured: "We can always beat those troublesome Orientals to their own game." You have a love interest (which is usually also the worst actor of the movie) fencing with the hero. You have your incessant following of assaults, assassinations and persistent shootings of men who gurgle of pain while an arrow or a projected star come out of their eye, their neck or their chest in an unconvincing way. You have your beefy white man / bodyguard in an outfit that calls a Ninja a "son of A B * ch" and throws him a round punch, to get his s * s back. You have one last confrontation between the good guy and the bad guy that lasts 20 minutes and stops like a caricature of RoadRunner instead of reaching a climax or a resolution. <br /> <br /> Ninja 3 is a little different, in that the plot revolves around a ripped-off female sports guy who is possessed by the Bad Ninja, so she ends up killing a lot of cops and criminals as well as Beefy White bodyguards in costume under her spell. But all the other elements are there, as formal in their own way as a Kabuki play or a Noh drama. <br /> <br /> I actually thought that Lucinda Dickey was very friendly in this movie. She is well muscled and curved, she has good cheekbones and an athletic appearance in her movements, and you can actually suspend your beliefs enough to accept that her character can accomplish some of the feats she accomplishes in the film. She can almost, but not quite, wear this thing. Another start for his participation and good energy. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sho Kusugi is here and he dominates pretty much every last 10-15 minutes of the movie. And just to show you how good and uninspired the GG movies are, the director and the editor interspersed Kosugi's last decisive battle with the Bad Ninja scene with many reactionary snapshots of Dickey and his boyfriend watching the battle between expression of a slight disturbance. I am serious ... despite all the emotion and reaction shown during the debates, they could watch a sea turtle in an aquarium in Marineland. I can only imagine what Dickey must have felt when she saw the finished product - she probably wanted to direct the editor with a katana for real, because these responsive shots make her look like a complete idiot. <br /> <br /> A pleasant waste of time ... but it's definitely a waste of time. Maybe if you're a fan of Sho Kusugi, or even a fan of Linda Dickey, you'll find it interesting.
