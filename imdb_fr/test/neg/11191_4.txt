Some movies that you will watch because they will touch your soul or challenge you in a growing way. <br /> <br /> Some movies that you will watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside of your experience; they will not feed you directly, but they will help you to situate yourself in a larger world than you would otherwise have. And after all, the hard times of life lie in what you choose not to accept. <br /> <br /> And then, there are films that do not do any of that, that you will look out of obligation, or because you have a need for historical context. These are rather vain experiences in terms of building a life. <br /> <br /> The problem of course is that often you do not know which of the three movies a movie will come in. You may get some indication from the people you trust, but because life in a movie is so personal, you will not really know it before the blind date. <br /> <br /> For me, it was worthless. Yes, yes, I know for a lot that Bunuel is the quintessence of the sublime and the rich. And you should know (if you do not do it) that some of my biggest cinematographic experiences are very weird, really weird movies. <br /> <br /> It's not that it's neither cinematic nor symbolically deep, or apolitically / politically friendly to the way I think. That's how it goes on there. It's the deviance of a real deviance that annoys me. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is that it is a successful alternative art, which means it is a successful commercial art. Which in turn means that it can be explained simply and that the explanation is not only widely acceptable, but simply abbreviated. All this is surely true. <br /> <br /> When the term "surrealist" is used, it is generally used incorrectly to refer to a film image or a world different from reality or that seems strange. But when it is used correctly, that is to say according to consensus theory, it always revolves around Bunuel, and in particular this film and the one he actually made with Dali. Thus, because they invented surrealist cinema, they define and control the term. That, in itself, shocks me, and I have my own alternative definition that does not come from their philosophy. <br /> <br /> It's because philosophy is totally opposite. This is not a philosophy at all but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. His anarchy packaged, carefully selecting the objects they use and the objects they oppose without clearly differentiating them. <br /> <br /> Everything is fine: against linearity, against narrative, against history, against religion (easy), against deliberate love. But for an illinear linear narrative, to establish one's own story (celebrated by countless film school teachers, what else can they do?); for a kind of "accidental" transcendent love. <br /> <br /> It's his own enemy. If there was a Bunuel alive today when he was selling his image, the first thing he would do would be to attack the church or the unreal. <br /> <br /> My regular readers know that in almost all cinematographic fields, I cling to the Spanish and avoid the French. But as for the surreal, I'd like you to consider the opposite: get your surrealism from Alfred Jarry, not from Bunuel. <br /> <br /> Rating of Ted - 2 of 3: contains interesting elements.
