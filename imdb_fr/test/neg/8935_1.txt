At Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, the Lucky Ducks cheerleader team has to compete with the Demons' tough team of cheerleaders to beat the fierce Falcon who seems to always win at this camp I guess. This is a typical 80s (lame) sex comedy that you think will win? But what's missing in the film is more than terrible. Incredibly bad dance numbers and forced Japanese businessmen who want to buy the camp (on the condition that the male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, remains of course with the camp). Simply horrible, forgettable, and unfortunately, cruelly lacks nudity. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: HBO Comedy <br /> <br /> My note: F (yes, I gave them a good one)
