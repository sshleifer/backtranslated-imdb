It's one of those movies called "Hollywood Social Commentary" that wants to play both ways. And believe me, in this film, both ways are clichéd and stereotyped. STOP-LOSS is a 21st-century film, John Wayne Film, about an anti-war sentiment but ends clearly on the following note: "If you are a MAN in today's society, act in concert and go to war with your friends. " In many ways, the film was a terrific sequel to TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE, in which he described an equally mad and uncontrollable soldier, an almost FRAT PARTY / ANIMAL HOUSE extravaganza mixed with a red-necked Texan universe of compelling evidence. repressed eroticism of masculinity. This film had everything in one scene after another of cliché images. Then Ryan Phillippe, a rebel military deserter, embarks on a "Road Trip" with a best friend's girlfriend, an artificial manipulation of a scenario to visit the families of dead soldiers, mutilated soldiers in military hospitals, etc. . and finally to address the problem of flight to Canada or Mexico. . But male honor and patriotism eventually triumph. As he is beautiful, he just fell asleep on a bus with his friends in Iraq and in a world he had assured a few minutes earlier to everyone he could never tolerate. FULL METAL JACKET meets SANDS OF IWO JIMA. But in the end, John Wayne goes up again! And a Hollywood blockbuster finally manages to keep both sides of his audience in the palm of his hand, at least he would like to think so. As far as I am concerned, it is enough to take me back to the more convincing reality of IN THE GARDEN OF ELAH.
