Franco Nero plays Cole, a ninja who comes to the rescue of his war friend Frank Landers (Alex Courtney) and his wife (Susan George), who protected them to protect them from a gangster (Christopher George) who wants the land. Things get even more complicated when the gangster engages the old enemy of Cole (Sho Kosugi), who is also a ninja. Although having a better production value than most ninja movies, the martial arts martial artist fails to inject life into his environment, nor even to act. A poor effort all around.
