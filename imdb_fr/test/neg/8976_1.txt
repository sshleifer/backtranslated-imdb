Honestly, with regard to the death penalty, I could accept it or leave it. The problem I have with this documentary is that it is a celebration of love for the murderer, with no sympathy for the family. The execution of Wanda Jean, with her completely one-sided vision, only reinforced my view that she should have been executed for her crimes. He tried to argue that she was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video supported this view. She seemed uneducated, but all her family too, but that does not mean they were all delayed. I can perfectly understand if someone opposes the death penalty, but completely ignore the crime, as if it had not happened, and try to place Wanda on top of a moral mountain, is offensive in nature and this is not the side of the problem I would be associated with.
