A woman as rich as unsure of her identity has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdown, helped undoubtedly by a gigolo husband who speaks well and who deceives her openly. Naturally, no one believes it when it claims to have been approached by a giant man who came out of a giant satellite. To the delight of her husband, this could be the incident that finally sent him back for good. <br /> <br /> From the very first scenes, with his ridiculous new shows and his ridiculous satellite encounter, you'll probably be convinced that the only thing that is reductive about this movie is that it's so bad it's funny . Although it is not too far away, it is certainly not true. <br /> <br /> Unlike most movies of this genre, it's not really a sci-fi or horror film, but a serious drama that incorporates a sci-fi script into 'plot. This is not a good or even mediocre drama, but it will exceed your expectations if you did not expect a legitimate drama at all. The game of actors is surprisingly good for such a budget effort and, above all, it is well edited and perfectly rhythmic. It is never boring and manages to generate more than a little interest to see what will follow. Nevertheless, it's still a film strictly for those who can not miss the opportunity to see a 1950s movie with a title like "Attack of the 50-foot woman"!
