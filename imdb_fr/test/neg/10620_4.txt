Sometimes you get exactly what you expect. A film produced and performed by and for a rock band in the middle of a comeback should not be considered a great artistic merit - and in this case it certainly is not the case. In fact, as might be expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the film itself, which, like the rock and roll lifestyle of the 70s it is trying to portray, is characterized by excess, drugs and antics, but unfortunately it is not. almost as much fun. Using Carl Dupre's script as horrifying enough to thrill a fellow writer and spoil Edward Furlong's talent, the only highlight of this rock and roll era piece is music, including the elaborate recreation of a concert. KISS of 1978.
