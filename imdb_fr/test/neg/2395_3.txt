The love and human remains made by Denys Arcand is an extremely pathetic film because it is completely different from the genre of films he has made throughout his career. Making a different movie is not a problem, but the annoying thing is that a movie from a master is completely out of tune, so it's a very bad event. The film starts on a good note because there is suspense created. However, as the film progresses, what is shown is nothing more than a futile attempt to create something meaningful, as Arcand shows us half a dozen strange and whimsical characters whose lives are closely related. Homosexuality and lesbianism have no consequence. What is even more embarrassing is the feeling of guilt related to the characters who are rather in trouble about their feelings towards each other and sexuality. Such a film might interest those who want to see another film by Denys Arcand. All in all, there would surely not many takers for this film.
