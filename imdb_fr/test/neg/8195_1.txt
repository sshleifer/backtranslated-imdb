I remember watching this movie on TV a few years ago. It was so terrible that I can only remember the scenes that made me laugh. The only summary of the plot I can give you (without any spoilers) is a photo of a movie made by college kids who were high. <br /> <br /> (The Spoiler alert starts here ...) When the movie starts, a guy running, being chased by the "demon policeman", when in reality, the man was really pursued by a Halloween costume that went wrong. A car popped out of nowhere, hitting the guy running. He sends it flying over, and what does the driver do ??? Look at the falling man, get in his car and leave. What kind of moron would do that? I would have at least asked if the guy was fine. <br /> <br /> Then, a black guy looks at Demic Cop right in the eyes, then, later, tells reporters, "I did not look well at him." At that time, my sisters and I were almost choking on each other. <br /> <br /> Then there is a scene in an alley where this girl with an afro pulls a machine gun from her teenage-Weeny small purse. He could not have FIT !! I hardly remember certain scenes. It may be because they were so bad. <br /> <br /> The police in the movie do not even know how to jump a fence, and the acting is so much wood that the wooden boards look like better actors. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is ashamed of Hollywood, more than any other flop. As far as I know, you have to see him to believe his shabby cheese plot.
