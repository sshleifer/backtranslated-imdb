One of my friends has already praised that, thinking that since Peter Fonda had played it, it could not be worse. FALSE! It's bad as anything can be. There is so much to laugh about and it's not jokes. For example, in a scene, Hawken walks in the forest and when he comes out, he suddenly wears a completely different outfit! Where was the brain of the "director" when he shot this scene?!? Fonda was probably the same place when he agreed to make this film. It's a shame to see such a good actor turn a deaf ear into this bad excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody can play in this movie. Jack Elam is brought just to show the number of stars here, but all he does is surprised by a very dark scene and terribly filmed in a kind of bar. Not to mention the "Indians", the girl was so pious that I wanted to shoot him to end his misery and mine. If I could give that a 0, I would do it. Too bad this brand does not exist here. It really reminds a bad joke or an amateur sequence made for pleasure. This should serve as proof of the negative consequences that B-series films can have.
