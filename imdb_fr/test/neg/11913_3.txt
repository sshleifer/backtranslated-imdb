Granted, I'm not a fan of Monogram Chan's movies. . The plot, involving the theft of radium in a bank vault, is a little exaggerated and far removed from the atmospheric mysteries produced by Fox. Mantan Moreland and Benson Fong (Tommy's third son) are having fun as usual. But otherwise, there is not much here. Great title that is wasted.
