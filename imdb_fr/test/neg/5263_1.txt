Kate is a jaded young woman who has trouble meeting and dating men. Throughout the movie, you will meet many of his losing boyfriends. And throughout the movie, you are subject to Kate's cynical negative view of love and relationships. This negative view is maintained throughout and presented as the ultimate truth. I had a real problem with that. Why would anyone want to be taught love, life, and dating someone who is obviously so messed up? It would work if it was the joke, but it is not. In order for the movie's jokes (which are neither funny nor original) to work, you have to believe what Kate says: that all relationships inevitably end up with bad sex or not at all, that the highest level at which a relationship can to evolve is when you are able to fart in front of your partner ... You have the idea. <br /> <br /> There is no movie in recent memory that is about to upset the stomach as much as Love & Sex. Why did filmmakers waste their time with such garbage? Every joke in Love & Sex is something I lived in another movie or in my own life. There is nothing original or creative about the story, the production or the style. It's cynical, dumb and useless. Mind numb!
