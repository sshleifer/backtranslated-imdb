Can there be a worse movie? Even Ed Wood at his worst horrible could not find anything so serious. Cheesy, stupid, long-time, absurd ... and those are the good points. I saw this trash at the beginning of the 80s, when I was incredibly bored at first. I sat there doing nothing, blew my brains out, although it probably would have been a more enjoyable experience. I really remembered it because it was so bad. It makes me sad, because some of the best filmmakers started doing TV movies (Spielberg) and it was a wonderful way for them to get their original film to the public, but this shit like this just totally kills process.
