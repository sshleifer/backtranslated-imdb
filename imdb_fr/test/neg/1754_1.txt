Anthony Minghella is another annoying bored who seems to bloom in front of these big super-inflated productions that take more than two hours and a half to do what a reasonable filmmaker would do in ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> The story centers on Inman (a sleepy Jude Law), who goes to the American Civil War after having just started a kind of romantic relationship with Nicole Kidman, a preacher girl recently arrived in the pretty city of Backwater. The story is very contrasted between Inman's trials and tribulations at war (guess what, boys and girls? HELL !!) and Kidman's trials and tribulations at home (which are, very predictably, incredibly boring) . Renee Zellwegger travels to Kidman's farm to help Kidman get back into shape after the death of Kidman's daddy, who died of a perverse illness. Zellwegger acts like a grumpy and authoritarian Granny Clampett-like man, handing out enough hard-hearted love and shrewd wisdom at home to turn the belly of even the most daring observer of Touched By An Angel. <br /> <br />, atrocious. Avoid it as the big nonsense it is, in the case of Bogus Pretentious Literary Adaptation.
