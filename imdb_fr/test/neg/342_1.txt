I was excited about this movie after reading other reviews. What a desappointment! There are so many ways that this movie is bad. Computer images were lacking, to say the least. I found the game stiff and amazing. Look at the sand while the lost "e-pods" (what an original name!) Are found. Where do all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized portions similar to other movies, like Alien, Pitch Black. Come on, a huge ship to transport a prisoner? And what is with the prisoner? Does he speak, can he speak? I was always waiting for something to link the elements of the story, but it never came. If this film was made with a small budget, it shows. The only part of the film I liked was when he finished. I do not mean that I liked the end, I did not do it. I just liked the fact that it was over. A visit to the dentist would have been more enjoyable. In my opinion. Do not waste your time on this one.
