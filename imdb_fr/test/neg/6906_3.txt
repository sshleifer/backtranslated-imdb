I took my 4 year old twins to see this movie today and I would NOT recommend it to kids their age. <br /> <br /> This film included many scenes of fighting, which I found too violent and that my children found scary. <br /> <br /> The subject was above the heads of my children and the scene of death was too scary for a cartoon for children. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because we all looked forward to seeing this, but it did not cut it. If you have children under 7, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the most total thing made me crazy throughout the movie.
