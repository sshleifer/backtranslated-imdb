Well, that's the way it should have been, anyway. Mainly, because of the ridiculous and punchy use of what the director hardly calls a symbolism. It would not have surprised me to learn that it was A) one of Lea Pool's earliest efforts, and B) at least semi-autobiographical. It turns out that A is wrong, although I do not know about B. I'll bet she attended a boarding school and she had a rather terrible relationship of the same sex of some sort. This is the message that this film left us and the short film that preceded it, whose name I do not remember. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the development of the character was awkward (Who introduces himself by saying what his name means? Nobody.) The symbols were about as subtle as a lift all Glass full of teenage girls losing a cable and collapsing in eighty stories. All about a speaker. Honestly, the cry of a hawk when Perabo declared that she was a raptor and jumped off the table? It was ridiculous to parody. And it was just one symbol among too many symbols intended to show its meaning to the most stupid of viewers. And it's because she had a childhood of shit and he feels the need to make films about it, like Vincent Gallo, instead of seeing a therapist, like all of us, who live well. There was nothing tender, nothing sweet and nothing moved in this film. It was a garbage misinterpreted, and the actors could not save Brett Ratneresque over "HEY, IT'S MY POINT IN THIS FILM" using cinematic techniques, writing and playing. Sorry, but it was terrible.
