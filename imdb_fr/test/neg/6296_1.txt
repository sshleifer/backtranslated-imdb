I saw it at the cinema during its initial release and I can only ask "has the world gone mad?" The seemingly overwhelming positive response is staggering for this poorly written and embarrassing clapping trap. <br /> <br /> Stephan Elliot is not a filmmaker of genius, as evidenced by the constant number of bombs he has produced since (see the section 'Welcome to Woop Woop', 'Eye of the spectator') <br /> <br /> I can only assume that making a movie about gay / transsexual culture has people assuming that not liking the movie is an offense for this sector of the population. Are we not smarter than that? What about an interesting scenario and good performances? Ok, so the 3 main films work well, but this film includes the worst performance of a child actor I've ever seen, unhelpful with the dreadful dialogue and the really lame resolution that can be seen from miles away. the. <This film is disappointing and does not deserve the disproportionate reputation it has accumulated.
