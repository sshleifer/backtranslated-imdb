How can such things end up in my DVD player at home? How can it even be packaged and distributed? Is there absolutely no projection of a film (and I use this term vaguely) that must be passed before putting it on the shelf of a video store? I'm all for DIY but go! It does not allow me to gather a group of my friends and family, a poor quality camcorder, a horrible story and put everything in place to create a bunch of crap and call it a movie. And I would like people to stop using the words "Indie" and "Campy" to describe these types of films. They are not either. In no other profession, such a thing would be considered acceptable. If someone tried to sell you a car as bad as this movie, you would bring it back and say it was a lemon. If it was surgery, you would sue the doctor for malpractice. I wish I could recover my time and money after watching this. Shame on video stores that store movies like these. They are a scam for the public. You want "campy"? Go get one of the Friday 13 movies (even those LATER) or Dead-Alive. At least it does not make you want to kill you. It's because of movies like this that people automatically equate independence with garbage.
