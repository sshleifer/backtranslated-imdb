First of all, I must say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie. I was intrigued and curious to learn about Vampires, Lycans, etc. In this last part (hopefully) of the series, I am really sorry for the pathetic pathology of vampires. At least in the first part, you wore tight leather clothes ... now, vampires seem to be besieged victims of a bad pest control problem. They look and act like haughty and pasty humans. <br /> <br /> Some ideas were very clear ... the problem with the human nobility was interesting. Too bad the game is catastrophic. The thing of the slave was also feasible. <br /> <br /> Other things just seemed pathetic to me. Spoilers now. The castle walls that can be skipped in a few steps? Enemies that do not attack during the day? Big bad old vampires who take years to join the fight, and then flee a new lycan leader after a minute or two? Werewolves close to their enemies? Lycans who plunder armories ... for what? They do not use axes, swords, or armor! A vampire leader so inept that he manages to get everyone against him? The romance is so unconvincing that she is sad. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie unless you receive it online or if you buy a very cheap movie ticket. Some of the action is good at OK. The armor and weapons of the vampires are interesting. Otherwise, a very weak script, badly put in place and that uses all kinds of insane twists.
