Just do some research on the making of this movie. Something as simple as a search on Google. It was funded by the US military and promoted just in time for the elections. This is an excellent idea, but I would much rather see a DOCUMENTARY, and not a document published by the Bush administration and telling its reality. The timing of the film's release, its tone, and the fact that MS & L promotes it have raised questions about the intention of the film. "According to MS & L CEO Joe Gleason, he and his colleagues are also passing key messages focused on the war in Iraq to specific groups," Eartha Melzer wrote. "Has the government hired documentary filmmakers to publicize the American people - nobody means who originally financed the film, or how it ended up being represented by the army's public relations firm."
