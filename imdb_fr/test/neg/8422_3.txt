The story of NAKED FAME is interesting for the first fifteen minutes: two porn stars in their late thirties, in an apparently healthy relationship, decide to leave the porn industry to try to sing and play. Colton Ford and Blake Harper are the two most ferocious men. With the help of Kevin Aviance and Marc Berkely, Colton creates a dance piece that is then marketed in New York with the hope that Colton Ford will become an instant star - a unique disco singer extolling his porn star background for public relations. /> <br /> The rest of the film growls and argues and is commented by porn producer ChiChi LaRue and the film slowly sinks into repetition and slump. This is not a bad idea for a film if the depth of revelation revealed by the desire of each character to move away forms a successful career (although this one was greatly influenced by the youth lost by the two characters) by another career. It's just that a song of a note wears out quickly. Grady Harp, November 05
