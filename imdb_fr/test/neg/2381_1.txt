Imagine if you take the myth of Christ, mixed with a good dose of porn, against a backdrop of sci-fi exploitation (another planet similar to science fiction), hurriedly launch after special classes and many kung fu fights really bad. oh and some decent break dance. with an impressive casio keyboard soundtrack. <br /> <br /> and others how they further aggravate the situation. there are at least four scenes of rape, at least one big car explosion, a buff black man who walks in underwear with an Uzi. <br /> <br /> Add alcohol and it's the perfect movie. <br /> I mean a lot, a lot and a lot of alcohol
