This film is a disaster in a disaster movie. It's full of great action scenes that only make sense if you throw away all the sense of reality. Let us see, word of the wise, lava burns you; the steam burns you. You can not stay next to the lava. Diverting a minor lava flow is difficult, let alone significant. It scares me to think that some people might believe what they saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> Worse still, the considerable number of talents which served for the realization of this film. I mean that the acting is actually very good. The effects are above average. Hard to believe that someone read the scripts and allowed all this talent to be wasted. I guess my suggestion would be that if this movie is about to start on television ... look away! It's like a train wreck: it's so awful that once you know what's coming, just look. Divert your eyes and spend your time on more meaningful content.
