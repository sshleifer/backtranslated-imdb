Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last pirates wrote their bloody names on every page of maritime history. This is the story of a captain whose name, for a short year, terrorized sailors and merchants from Caribbean ports to London trading houses. <br /> Hmm, this opening of the movie looks like a hell of bluster, pillage, movie rip, is not it? Well it's not. But it's not totally worthless as a piece of curiosity. Anne Of The Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. The direction is Jacques Tourneur, the score is Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson provides photography in Technicolor. Jean Peters is in the title role of Anne {AKA Captain Providence} and support comes from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice. <br /> <br /> Originally designed to be based on true pirate of life, Anne Bonny, the film turns out to be the story of a woman searching for identity and finding herself in the world of piracy and shenanigans, dominated by men. Filled with familiar shots and scenery, the film also suffers from a cast largely missed. Peters gives the right shot, and Paget illuminates the screen with effervescent beauty. Although Robertson Justice, although underutilized, really looks the part and does not do too much like the rest of the male cast. Some critics have desperately tried to dig the film thoroughly to find hidden information and hidden information, only because it is Tourneur who presided. But there is no depth here, it is simply a job for Tourneur, a recognized professional, but it is very finely complicated and he lacks in fact sufficient leeway to move forward. <br /> <br /> Disposable at best. 4/10
