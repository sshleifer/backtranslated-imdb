A group of teenagers discovers a bootleg video game, but once they start playing, they all start to die as they do in the video game. As they become addicted to the game, they must find a way to defeat the main villain of the game, The Blood Countess, before she kills them all. <br /> <br /> The principle sounds a bit silly and familiar, but the movie could have been a little entertaining. However, this "horror" movie is not scary at all. It's actually more of a comedy than anything else. The film is taken too seriously and the movie is not very fun to watch. Of course, there are sometimes bursts of laughter, but overall, the film is very dull. The horror movies PG-13 can always be good like The Ring or Cry Wolf. Ring and Stay Alive are not really the same type of horror movie. Stay Alive is no longer a slasher movie and since its PG-13 rating, death scenes are very tame. It should have been the main sale of the film and as it had an interesting concept, the dead could have been really good. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a wider audience and the film had to be changed. <br /> <br /> The acting is a complete joke and most actors play terrible performances. Jon Foster is not a very good leader. It lacks charisma to really engage the audience or the public cares about it. His character is not unique, but very bland. Samaire Armstrong actually gives a good performance but a bit too bland to really hold. Frankie Muniz probably gives the best performance in Stay Alive. It's an honor to be the best Houston Texan player. Sophia Bush is absolutely terrible like October. His performance is so hurried and so wrong. The most boring character of the film is Phineas played by Jimmi Simpson. His character is so unappealing that you want to let him die. <br /> <br /> In fact, most characters are pretty jubilant, which makes it even more difficult to take interest in the film. It's hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying kids and it's far more fun to watch if you want the characters to really survive. The atmosphere is the only big advantage of the film. It's a little old but it works anyway. The film is also very short, so it's not too painful to sit down. I would not really blame the actors because they were working with a director and an inexperienced writer. The management is not very good and the scenario is not much better. Stay Alive is actually not the worst horror movie of 2006. That honor goes to When a Stranger Calls. Staying alive is a missed opportunity. In the end, this cheesy and lame horror film is best left on the set. Note 4/10.
