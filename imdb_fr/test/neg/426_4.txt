Jeff Speakman has never really surpassed the lowest ranks of martial artist-turned-actors (lower than Don "The Dragon" Wilson, for example), and with vehicles like "The Expert" you can see why. There are three major issues in this movie: 1) The plot - or should I say intrigues - is ubiquitous, there are characters who have a lot of time in front of the screen but are useless, 2) It There are only four fight scenes in total, some of them are totally independent of the main plot and others are in the dark. 3) The score is too zealous and invasive. Strange as it may seem, it's really the most annoying thing about this movie: the score tries to convince you that you are watching a great epic, instead of the low-budget movie you're watching. That said, at least James Brolin is here to bring a touch of credibility. * 1/2 of 4.
