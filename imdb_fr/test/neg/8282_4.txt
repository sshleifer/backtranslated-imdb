First, I want to target the Troma DVD distribution team, which was stupid enough to reveal the identity of the pivot killer of this movie on the back of the cover! The synopsis mentions at random who is responsible for the massacre on the day of the graduation, for the sake of Christ! I do not care about the severity and predictability of a 1980s slasher; just to mention who made it all the problem! So, a tip if you also buy the double-film Troma containing "Graduation Day" and "Nymphoid Barbarian in Hell Dinosaur", do not do ?? repeat NOT? return the box and read the back! Watching the film is already a painful experience, but reading the back would spoil everything. <br /> <br /> Now, with regard to the film itself ?? Oh man! Personally, I'm a fan of Herb Freed's cinematographic "work". Well, actually, I do not really know if I should admire or pity him! All of Herb's films are rather bad and amateurish, but at the same time, you can say that his direction is lively and full of good intentions! Unlike "Haunts" and "Beyond Evil", he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to take advantage of typical high school slasher movies. Just to offer a minimum of originality, all the victims of "Graduation Day" are promising athletes and members of the same coach George Michaels (great name! I guess Herb Freed is a fan of "Wham!"). In the opening credits, we witness the tragic death of a girl on the field, moments after her victory in a 30-second race. We wonder whether his coach and the other members of the athletics team have not pushed his physical limits too much, but an individual goes even further and begins to sadistically kill all the people that he / she considers responsible for Laura's death. What a crazy little movie! The script must be one of the most incoherent I've ever seen, with tons of red herrings and secondary intrigues that lead to nothing and almost absurd death sequences in words! There is a guy impaled by a football attached to a javelin, others are decapitated with a ridiculous sword and the most unfortunate of them falls even until his death on a bed of disguised peaks! Herb focuses on the ingenuity and fast pace of the killings, to the point that he totally forgets the subplots he introduced earlier in the film! For example, Laura's sister returns home after her military training and apparently begins an investigation into the circumstances of her death. However, halfway through the film, his character no longer appears in the film. In addition, the stepfather of the girls is described as violent drunk, but this interesting data is immediately ignored. Instead of carefully mounted suspense and deceptive red herring, we are given disco-dance and roller skating sequences and ?? of course ?? many pictures of unattractive 80s chicks stripping. Despite being really bad, "Graduation Day" could count on a respectable casting! Christopher George ("Grizzly", "The City of the Undead") plays an important role in the demanding coach, Carmen Argenziano ("When a stranger calls", "The Accused") appears briefly as a detective of the Police investigating the growing number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ("Dead & Buried", "Dracula's Dog") has a very fun role as the school's main stressor. Linnea Quigley and Vanna White are among the teenage beauties in service. Heck, for some horror fans, the presence of these two ladies is already reason enough to count the "Graduation Day" among the most representative slashers of the early 80s. It's a silly movie, but entertainment and laughs are guaranteed!
