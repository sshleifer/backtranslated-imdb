I had this in The Horror Six-Pack of Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. This one is not the worst film of all time, but it is still no one. In fact, this movie was so hard that I did not know how to write this review, especially since 1. I took it out of the DVD player because I could not even watch a second and two seconds. Hurricane friggin 'Ike is coming and God knows how long it will take for this exam to be finished. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a scientist and his wife. The scientist receives a valuable artefact and examines it when this so-called urban legend known as the Skeleton Man kills him, and later his wife. Then ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not really say anything more about this point of sale, unless it does not bother. I'm currently using the disc as a coaster, and if you see that, you might want to do the same thing. Casper Van Dien and Michael Rooker needed money ... BAD! <br /> <br /> PS. I will pretty much review the films in the box and make a new review on Ghoulies IV.
