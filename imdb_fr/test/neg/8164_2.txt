I love movies, all genres, from big shows to small independent projects. But even taking into account this 25-year-old beast and his attempt to pay homage to the 1950s, she suffers almost from the aspect, which allows us to judge the films. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I remembered several "student films", I was lucky to see efforts where creativity is required to fill the gaps when funds are required. <br /> <br /> All in all, there is a good chance that there will be better uses for 90 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> 2/10
