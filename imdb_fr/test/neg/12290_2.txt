I saw that at the video store and thought I would try. It looked like a good story and the cover looked good. That was it. The characters looked good, and the actor who played "Noel" was the most convincing, even though he did not spend much time in the movie. I find it really difficult to give a bad rating to a movie, but it's this one, in a number of minutes, that's worth my book. As the movie progressed, I still wanted it to be better, but to no avail. On the aesthetic level, it was good. The sound and lighting were good, but the game in this movie killed him for me. It was like watching a TV soap opera of inferior quality. I kept saying, "I can not believe they published this movement like this." I stopped several times out of pure disbelief because it was so bad. There are so many things that I want to say, but I'll just say this: everything else was generally good, it was the acting, as the final editing, that really made this movie.
