Emotionally insecure, Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt) reads the secret diary of his sexy wife Leeza (Courtney Lercara) and is appalled to discover that the love of his life has apparently been asleep with every type that she has meet; This shocking revelation sends poor Tom to rock and begins to take a bloody revenge on the men who, according to him, are watching his old lady. <br /> <br /> In my experience, very bad movies can often be as fun as really good, and no movie beheaded by a machete-enhanced ceiling fan should ever be considered completely without value; but even though Killing Spree very occasionally manages to entertain with his inventiveness and his cheap and cheerful gore, I found that the terrible direction, the abominable production values, the mediocre cinematography, the deafened sound, the awful sound, the narrative tedious and silly A stupid plot that is telegraphed from the beginning, plus a useless zombie finale), an uncomfortable synthesizer score, an inept dialogue and a completely amateurish acting game all helped to make this writer's effort / director Tom Ritter an experience practically without joy.
