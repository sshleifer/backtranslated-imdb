Half of the film is flashing lights and a shaky camera. The rest is composed of predictable characters (think science versus government, 'know-how' versus authority, etc.) <br /> <br /> What is the worst aspect of this film? Is it the cars launched in the first 5 minutes, is it the terrible "Russian" accent of the "cosmonaut", are these the uninspired characters, the poorly integrated successes of the Top 40, or the "United States will save the world" vitriol? No, it's the fact that, regardless of the "sad" ending - there's very little suspense in this movie - we basically know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> The only good part of this movie: "American Components, Russian Components: All Made in Taiwan!"
