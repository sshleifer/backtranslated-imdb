I really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the opportunity to live a new life with a young woman if he can accept the death of his wife. I guess it was to play a light romantic comedy but the theme makes me a bit uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> But aside from that, I found that the dialogue was too much like a play, even if it was based on a novel and also, the mediocre acting was embarrassing to watch especially by the young director Vincent Spano. <br /> <br /> I was sort of trying to catch up with all the movies I missed in the eighties that decade. It's my beast of burden that nostalgic fans of the 80s seem to focus on the same hard core of movies usually featuring the actors and actresses of the brat and neglecting other films like Creator who have fallen away . But in the case of this feature, I must say that I can understand it. All these movies of the 80s were not magical and Creator is the proof.
