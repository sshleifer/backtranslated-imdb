It starts pretty well, with the accident and the decision not to return to Los Angeles. But everything is set up too quickly. There is a decent scenario towards the end, but there are so many scenes that do not make sense. Randy (played by Brian Austin Green) comes home angry and ready to face people. He takes the time to get into the club when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere? I do not want to ruin that because anyone decides to see it, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. Even the acting, which was not bad at first, goes wrong towards the end. Do not bother unless you want to see how serious it is.
