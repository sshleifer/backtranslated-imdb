Alien was excellent. Many writers have tried to copy it. They all did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst copy of Alien. Because of the bad actors, the bad effects, the ADB scenario and other bad things (it would take about 3 pages to tell everything bad.This film was not very long and it is a very good thing ( You can not laugh because it's too serious ... it's a bad thing because, in almost every sci-fi movie in the B series, you can laugh all the time. Just watch Alien or Event Horizon ... they are much better !!! I give it 1 in 5.
