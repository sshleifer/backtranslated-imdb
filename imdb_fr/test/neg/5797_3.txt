If a film has a story without imagination and tasteless characters, it must be compensated by its character really, really funny. You can do a lot if you are funny. But, even if there are some fun moments scattered here and there in Grandma's Boy, they are so few that they can not begin to compensate for the hacking work that the movie displays in such abundance. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly not intended to surprise anyone. When Alex hides marijuana in his grandmother's house in a tea box, you know what will happen later and that's what happens. The film seems to have been written by a committee that conducted a study on mediocre comedies and seized all the gags appearing in more than one of them. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting. . The game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for a smart comedy. But make no mistake, this is not a movie about video game developers. It is actually a collegiate film in which all the boys of the fraternity were pushed into a big room to play video games. <br /> <br /> The way the film completely fails to think about its frame and use it as original You can see laughter in the character of JPJP, I think more or less conspired by the creator of Doom, John Carmack. At least inspired to the extent that he is a weird genius who creates games. <br /> <br /> In the movie, J.P. is a strange and obnoxious geek who is scorned and mocked by the game testers of the company. It does not mean anything. If you are one of the most important people in the history of video games (as J.P. should be), then even if you are weird and odious, people will still admire you and respect you. If Stephen Hawking is unpleasant, his associates will still not scare him. <br /> <br /> In addition, game testers are just as likely to be geeks as JP, but in the movie, they are basically boy fraternities. It's funny the normal guys against the obnoxious film Dweebs. And although this formula has worked very rarely in the past, it is absurd to create a gaming company. If you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, you do not just have to encapsulate all the movie conventions of different settings into it. Unless you are a pirate. <br /> <br /> About two-thirds of the road traveled in the film I abandoned. Something happened that I knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events. And I realized that anyway I had not laughed anything for half an hour. So I stopped (although I was fast, just to make sure I was right, they would follow the most predictable clich√©s, which they did). <br /> <br /> Normally, if a movie is bad, I just say it's bad, and then run out of things to say, but this film is so poorly produced that it deserves a long diatribe. <br /> <br /> Shame on the film to attract a good actress like Linda Cardellini, then surround her with people without talent. I will give a point to the film for giving Shirley Jones the chance to be anti-Shirley Partridge.
