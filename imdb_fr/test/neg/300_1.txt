Jefferey Dahmer was a sick guy. There is not much to say about him that has not been said yet, except that the many documentaries and films made about him are probably better than this one. It's ridiculously old-fashioned. It's so cheesy, a guy who posted the whole movie on youtube added some annotations to make the viewer laugh. <br /> <br /> Carl Crew (who is he?) Play the role of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. with a young man, Dahmer just wanted to be friends with him, finally in 1991 with a man with whom he wanted to have sex and eat. <br /> <br /> I did not bother to watch the whole movie. it's basically a documentary that shows all the attacks Dahmer made before getting caught. And since this film was shot in 1993, a year before dahmer was clubbed to death by a colleague, dahmer's death is not shown. but that would probably have been as cheesy as this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
