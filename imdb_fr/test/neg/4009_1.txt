It has a bit of that indie queer edge that was fashionable in the '90s and places an explicit date of sale on the visual style. The characters are uniformly apathetic and morally impassive. Street thugs in Greece wear new clothes without creases or stains. They all seem to visit the same marine dressing table. All uniformly exhibit the same low IQ when entering into clandestine markets without passion. When things go wrong, it is because they are not real Greeks - they are pastoral sun boys captured in a strange world of nocturnal cities. Moaning about disgruntled immigrants, but never bothered to investigate the problems related to Russian / Kazakh / Albanian cultures. If Giannaris had the proper perspective on this project, he could have done a wonderful Bel Ami production. Ephemeral glimpses of your tonic beef-boy is the only spark of this generic gangster programmer.
