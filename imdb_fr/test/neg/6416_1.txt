In a word, awful ... too many holes in the plot ... uh, yeah ... Who takes their child to look for a corpse in the middle of the night? and what's up with his wife stealing the skeleton .. who does that? why exactly did the psychiatrist stab his neck? and all that dog stuff .. I mean, really! Having Sparrow narrated from the beginning also completely destroyed the suspense for me. I mean, if he tells the story, it's clear that he's lived to tell it, so there's no way he'll be distraught ... where's the suspense? <br /> <br /> Of course, you expect intrigue holes in a movie like this. But there are so many that I have completely lost track of history because of them. What kind of name is Fingerling? Or Toppsy? Why did the woman unearth the body? (Who does that?) Or go alone to this mad and scary asylum? and where did all these candles come from? Why does the writer have his postbox in the book? I mean, come on ... And the book just arrives to find its way to the bookstore next to the woman's bakery ?? Too practical ... Oh and happy birthday Honey, here's a book about a serial killer ... What a THINKING present! The book is about 20 pages long, half of which are blank, and you have to panic FOREVER to read it. If he's really obsessed with this book, would not he have read it all at once? <br /> <br /> A little convenient for him to fall on his future wife (with a cake!) About 23 seconds after his departure. released from a psychiatric hospital .. how old was he? 36 ?? <br /> <br /> Was I the only one at the end rooting for the bus to actually shoot the guy? It's not good when you want the protagonist to bite at the end. <br /> <br /> It looks like it was written by a committee .. I guess the first project probably has nothing to do with the number 23 [...] It seems they need to a clever hook to convince the public to think that something supernatural was happening, when in the end it really did not seem to have anything to do. I mean, I did not expect to see the Godfather or anything, but everything in this movie was totally disappointing. Without all the information relating to numerology, this film could have been OK, instead of some imitations of Se7en ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Not scary, involuntarily hilarious and otherwise a total sum.
