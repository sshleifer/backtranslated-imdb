To paraphrase the comments of previous critics, if you are a fan of Stooges, avoid this one at all costs! My basic question is this: being experienced horsemen of the comedy that are Moe and Larry, why did they insist on trying to continue the act while it was so obvious that their home studio, Columbia, did was clearly not interested in giving them serious writers? Veteran comedy directors? This film plays like someone who gives a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how hard Moe and Larry are working to make every little nonsense relevant. Joe De Rita, despite his history of vaudeville, is not up to replace Curly, Shemp or even Joe Besser. If that's what Moe and Larry had to choose from, they should have closed their shop and enjoyed their retirement. Leaving us fans with better memories of much better movies than they had done before. Always let them laugh, this is the motto of comedy and always stop when you're on top. Therefore, Seinfeld leaves the sitcom at the top, instead of staying for the inevitable decline.
