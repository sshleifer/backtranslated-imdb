Sometimes it is difficult to judge the seriousness of a film made in Italy or Spain, as they all seem to use the same stable of voice actors trained at 9/10 ESL to provide English voices in the United States. Anyway, things are always lost in translation - the ideas of dialogue, character and plot written for the expectations of the European public may not go very well with our American ideas about what's funny, trendy or dramatic . I imagine that the team translating the soundtrack of this film into English had about three days to do it from beginning to end, and each of them probably earned the equivalent of an installment on his used Fiat. In other words, a pure hackwork, thrown in one or two takes and never revised or redone by someone who has a real ear for the American language. <br /> <br /> Looking at "Devil Fish", I can imagine that if an Italian was watching this film in your mother tongue, you might find it a little fun. You would laugh jokes and fun drunkenness, you'd gasp in front of the monster and the wicked villains, and you would ogle before the attractive pair of Peter and Daryll Hannah couple on the beach for no apparent reason in the middle of a search for clues about a man-eating monster who has already killed one of their friends. <br /> <br /> But since the sibilant voice and the whistling dialogue Continue to draw from us, Americans, out of the experience of the film, we can not help but notice that editors have a clutter of attention deficit, that nobody on the screen can really act as well as to project an attitude, that the reason invoked for the creation of the Monster has absolutely no sense, that the action sequences have the impact of a bowl of cereal filled with oatmeal and that the director, writers and producers really hate women. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about buying or renting this movie - watch only cable TV on Saturday afternoons with one of the many fist beers, or with Mike's help and protection and the Bots on MST3K.
