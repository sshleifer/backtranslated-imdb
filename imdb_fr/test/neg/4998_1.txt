So, you've seen Romero movies, yes? And you saw Jacob's ladder, did not you? And the latest Hellraiser movies? Well, let's make a film from the three now, but let's put everything together and make a mess, it seems like a good idea? <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Absolutely horrible. Yes, it's an independent film, which gives a shit? Is it a pass for making filmic excrement? The film tries to establish its credibility by emphasizing the interaction between the characters, it's obvious. Unfortunately for writers, they are not good at interacting with the characters. It is not the night of the living dead; the characters are entities that scream their insane lines in a vain attempt to get caught by the microphones of the board. The dialogue is never interesting. For a film that puts so much emphasis on the interaction between the characters, one would think that the characters would have something more to say than "WHAT WE WILL DO" "I do not know" "WELL, WE MUST DO SOMETHING "" Well what are we going to do? "" I DO NOT KNOW. " "We should go." "ACCEPT JUST OUR FAILURE." "No, we have to leave." "WELL LEAVE THEN." "No, maybe we should stay." <br /> <br /> This is not exaggerated, there are exchanges in this film that reach this level of redundancy and inanity. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie? Half of that is a dream, and it really has no purpose. Nothing in the dream has relevance for anything in the rest of the film. The scriptwriters could not decide to make a zombie movie or a monster movie and so they did both. It's downright ridiculous, the cheapest thing in the book, and it's insulting, especially since I'm pretty sure they've stolen the idea of ​​Jacob's ladder, which dealt with the concept of a far more competent way than these jokers could ever hope. make. <br /> <br /> And then there is the edition. Years spent watching MTV and playing horror-themed video games may have inspired filmmakers, but it's probably sad that they do not realize why hesitating montage and obscuration in these media elements has been effective. In this film, you'll often be confused, and not like David Lynch, but the bad "Wait, I thought she'd just been killed, right?" So who the hell was this? this guy? Where? How did he get here? "kind of way. It's constant and always bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a laughable trash and should only be searched if you want to be thrown in the trash with some friends and laugh. <br /> <br /> And as a final note: as for the "comedy" that other people are talking about, everything is unintentional. There is not a single piece of intentional comedy in this movie. All this is supposed to be a great study of serious character, because filmmakers want to have credibility in their concept of horror. Unfortunately, their claims do not match their abilities.
