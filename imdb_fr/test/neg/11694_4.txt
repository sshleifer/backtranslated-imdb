After the praise, I was expecting more of a Korean horror if it should be seen with the same caliber as A Tale of Two Sisters, as other critics have already pointed out. This film is not of the same caliber except in the special effects budget. Think Amytiville horror. With a tree and sparse dialogues. <br /> <br /> If you plan to have a movie with limited dialogue, the plot line and the characters must wear the movie. This film could very well have been told in a 30-minute, 2-hour short film concept with many looking at trees and scenes of terror that not only scare you, but hurt the "Whatever ..." style. do not make a good horror movie. <br /> <br /> Those who claim that this film has left them lasting impressions must literally have a heart attack when decent horror movies put it on.
