1st seen on 3/17/2002 - 2 of 10 (Dir-Mario Pinzauti): A silly master and slave, full of sex, having too many movies about intimate relationships. This movie seemed to care more about sex than about history and somehow worked the story around sex. Laughing dubbing of the original Italian language in the version I looked at with a ridiculous end where the attempt is made to give an anti-slave statement (or should I say a line). What a waste of time for all who look at this trash.
