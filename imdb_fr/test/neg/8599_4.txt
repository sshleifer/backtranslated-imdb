Now, I like Johnny Vegas, which is a good start, I also like the toilet humor <br /> <br /> like Young Ones and Bottom etc. my face. The story follows Johnny after his wife threw him (how he got his beautiful wife and boy I do not know) <br /> <br /> as he tries to fuck everything that moves. Fail normally. I was looking forward to it, but I found it totally boring and a waste of time <br /> <br />. Unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 minutes apart from washing the car then do not worry ..... <br /> <br />
