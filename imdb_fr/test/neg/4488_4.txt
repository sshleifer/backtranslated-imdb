This film had the potential to be a very good film for me, Nicholas Sparks is a great romance writer and this movie was likely to be as great as The Notebook, but what sets them apart is that the notebook had a dream team McAdams and Gosling are in the lead but here the balance is miserably out of balance by the inept game of Channing Tatum <br /> <br /> I felt that many scenes were unequal only because of his performances, a lot of his emotions the scenes are lost because he can not play, leaving an uncomfortable and uneven situation, Amanda Seyfried gave a superb performance before letting Tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the stage can not recover. <br /> <br /> This story deserved to be right, but what he got was a handsome boy who can not play. Tatum should stick to what's good, movies that talk more about his physical ability, even if it's horrible, like GI JOE, step up and fight. The less he speaks better, the better. <br /> <br /> Try not to think of me as a hateful enemy of Channing Tatum. I entered this movie with an open mind, because I was often surprised by the love Adam Sandler in Reign on me. I gave Tatum the same chance. I did not see him here as the sum of his past roles, only because of his performance in this movie, which was unfortunately disappointing.
