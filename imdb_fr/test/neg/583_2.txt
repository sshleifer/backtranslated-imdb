OUR GANG had a chance on a feature film of his 22-year history, and it was the best thing to do? It is boring, forced and useless, and I must respectfully disagree with the other poster of this film; the 1994 LITTLE RASCALS remake was better than that. Almost everything is. Children are subordinated to the procedures of the civil war; it does not look like an OUR GANG movie at all, but a Shirley Temple's humorless second-rate clone.
