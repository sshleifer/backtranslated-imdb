I am a Christian and I have watched a lot of Christian films, but this one is a shame. They try to succeed, but it's too difficult for them, I think. <br /> <br /> - You can see that the film is badly dubbed in many places. - You can almost think that the main actors in this film were the only ones left behind. I think there will be many more. <br /> <br /> - The quality is mediocre and the acting could have been better too. The story is not so bad, but could have been better. The only benefit I give is the story of this movie, but I just can not rate it more than 3/10. Look at "Left Behind" instead!
