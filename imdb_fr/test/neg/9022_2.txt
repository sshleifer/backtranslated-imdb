It's probably Wayne's poorest movie; at least the poorest in which he had a leading role. It's just incredibly bad. The editing is particularly frightful; it really seems like the publisher (if he had one) literally picked up pieces of film on the floor and stuck them together. The opening must be seen to be believed. John Wayne had to crack every time it was mentioned! I know there are "B" movies - but are there any "H" movies? If so, this one is an example. And I say it as a devoted fan of JW.
