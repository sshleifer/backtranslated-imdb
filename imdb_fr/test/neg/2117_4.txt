Joe was released for the first time in the United States in the summer of 1970. Despite respectable ads, a reasonable box office and an Oscar, he disappeared soon after and was forgotten in the 1980s before he to be re-evaluated with enthusiasm, a bit unfairly, in the United States. late 90s. Thanks to this long downtime, his reputation saw him (inexplicably) placed alongside Michael Winner's original Death Wish. Although revenge is a theme, a film about activism certainly is not. <br /> <br /> The plot is not worth summarizing. It is an incomprehensible and bizarre step by step on an accidental murder and the improbable relationship that results. This relationship and the quirks largely based on the class of his two sons are exaggerated in a ridiculous caricature; these two, and their situation, have absolutely nothing to do with reality. <br /> <br /> Almost everything in the film is ridiculous and reluctantly aged, which makes everything completely fascinating. Hippies are portrayed as discrete and exclusive misanthropes, hard drugs require you to sleep or dance maniacally, with lipstick on the face, and most young women are willing to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana at the fall of the fly. It's really a 60s movie rather than a 70s movie, so why did some of the big names begin to include it in retrospective conversations about the beginnings of the new Hollywood wave? It's a complete mystery. Martin Scorcese, of all people, even got involved, although it was probably only to recall the cold and lavatory tones of the sinister urban cinematography, which certainly influenced Taxi Driver four years later. But Joe looks a lot like a furious tirade against Easy Rider and Bonnie And Clyde, rather than the continuation of this insurgent cinematic ethic. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that has a real artistic significance. - Despite Joe's incessant fury at everything in his world, it's still a story about absolutely nothing - but its value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented. Shot in and around the streets of New York during the darkest hours of the Vietnam War and at a time when America (and its cinema in particular) was revolutionizing to the horror of the old guard, the film ends its own completely unconscious and accidental way, saying more about this period of history than many infinitely superior movies that were directly trying to capture it. <br /> <br /> But as a film? Despite a really surprising and effective end of shock, it is actually a Michael Winner film, but not so well done. How does it tickle you? ** Incidentally, if you, like me, an amateur of arbitrary benchmarks, take a look at Harold Steptoe at 1:22:11 in the hippie art gallery.
