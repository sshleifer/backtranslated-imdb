The film was due out in 2002 and was highly anticipated due to the promos, but it was finally released in 2003 after the producer's death. <br /> <br /> The film is good in places, but overall, it's not great <br /> <br /> The scenes between Rani and Ajay are acceptable but the other scenes are not well run <br /> <br /> The film is too similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood and although it was planned before its first release, the originality is lost <br /> <br /> Milan Luthria disappointed overall after KACHCHE DAAGE <br /> <br /> The music is good but too many songs <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks jaded and his appearance reveals that the film has been delayed and his game seems boring too Rani is good Sonali is good also rest are ok
