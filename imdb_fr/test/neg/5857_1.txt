I saw this movie last night, a satire of reality style programs that seem to be turning out for the moment. <br /> <br /> What can I say. I absolutely hated it. As interesting as watching dry painting and with maybe one or two moments just a little fun. <br /> <br /> Maybe it had something to do with the fact that I was certainly not a fan of Survivor and Big Brother shows, it was a video / DVD or if I I had watched alone in the cinema, I certainly would not have endured more than 5 minutes. <br /> <br />
