The first of three films on Aztec Mummies is the only one that, to my knowledge, has never been completely dubbed in English. The film was cut and used by characters like Jerry Warren in other films (he combined it with another Mexican horror comedy with Lon Chaney to cope with the screaming werewolf.) It was featured in Attack of the Mayan Mummy and elsewhere.) The longest of the three films, a good part of this film is the last two films that use it as a basis for backtracking. In the plot of this film, a scientist conducts a regression experiment of a previous life that brings back his subject and discovers hidden chambers in an Aztec pyramid. The group, along with a sinister figure known as a bat, hopes to use this information to uncover a hidden treasure. Instead, they discover a living mom who has other projects. This film has too much action to last 80 minutes (worse, the mummy does not show even before an hour has elapsed). Probably the least of the three films, it's easy to understand why this film was separated, it's the only way to create a film that does not cause sleep. Watching the movie late last night, I fought to stay awake. It was difficult and I found that I had finished scanning until the mummy showed up. Given the choice, I would take a pass and watch the last two movies.
