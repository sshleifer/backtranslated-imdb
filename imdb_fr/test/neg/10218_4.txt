This stereoscopic film (the girlfriend of the hero marries the bad guy) just did not advance fast enough, given the circumstances of the story. Scott seems too old in this one, and too often his character turns away from the decisive action, deflating the scenes. He responds feebly to the death of some of his hands; he escapes from Knox's gang by hiding in a full barrel of rain; his escape into the highlands and the pursuit of John Russell seem superfluous, much like much of the film. The plot could have been tightened. <br /> <br /> Highlights of the film: see "Tennessee" Ernie Ford without a mustache singing "The man with the saddle"; The too brief scenes of Alfonso Bedoya as a cook; the highland color photograph and the fight scene over there with John Russell.
