How to take Charles Darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a girls' movie. His essential and decisive ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are untouched, with the exception of two brief scenes in which he is said to "kill God"; pure demagoguery to make the film emotional. And the rest of the film folds for this purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with very loud music where he is forced to cry. Anyone who reads "Origin of Species" would be perfectly aware of the fact that there was no gap with God in any of Darwin's works; on the contrary, there was increased fear and respect and a revolutionary new way of seeing things. A good film about Darwin could be educational, thoughtful and deeply inspiring, even in the religious sense of the word, but that would defeat the intentions of the soap opera. It is a film designed to make people cry with artificial sympathy and feel transformed without being able to understand why; Darwin's big name is only used quickly as a means of marketing, as if a famous name was dropped at a party to create an impression. Sad that the sets and costumes are so good: the values ​​of production, with the exception of writing, were obviously high. See if you want to cry, for the loss of intelligence in American literature.
