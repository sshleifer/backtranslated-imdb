Stay away from this one ... No, really, I'm serious - I know you might think it's a fun, campy and corny, action-oriented Hong Kong movie. I did it, but believe me, it's not. In fact, the only thing that is accurate in this description would be the words Hong Kong, which would then be used only in a strictly geographical sense. <br /> <br /> Yes, Donnie Yen co-directed it. Jackie Chan has a cameo. Ekin Cheng's Storm Riders plays the lead role. There are vampires. This should be good - or at least fun, charming and action packed. Once again - this is not the case. <br /> <br /> I could stray from the why of this film that fears - I could dissect it, split it into tiny shaky pieces. But where to start? There's so much to hate ... <br /> <br /> To make it easier and give credence to this Hate Festival, let me tell you that I'm usually a big fan of Hog Cinema Kong. The heavier tricks of drama as well as action and / or lighter comedy. Very good movies as well as really tacky ones. I can sit for hours of bad captioning, joking enough jokes to get the freshman rolling. I can treat lovers as chaste and unmarried as conventions of nuns, that is, almost all the average viewer would bump into the metaphorical head to sneak between action sequences. Also, Hong Kong or any other origin - I love when a movie goes wrong to be bad enough to be good. <br /> <br /> But this - Arrgh! It's just horrible, stupid, unassailable junk. So far from being funny or charming, it's painful. If derived from the action, a Bergman film looks like a chainsaw massacre in Texas. <br /> <br /> Why ?! Why spoil such an opportunity ?! It could have been so much fun!
