The original version of George Sluizer, The Vanishing, is one of the most troubling sociopaths in European cinema and one of the most memorable of all time (unabashedly stolen by Tarantino for Kill Bill, volume 2), but he has a lot more to offer than that. Playing with the chronology and reversing the usual clich√©s of the "classic feminine" plots, it also offers superb characterization and strong, underestimated but convincing performances. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can only assume that Sake was so determined that no one else would have the opportunity to ruin his movie when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how much he destroyed his own work. His career has never recovered from this disastrous misstep. <br /> <br /> The main culprit is an amazing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been painstakingly thought through to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his first films noted that Bridges was an excellent instinctive actor as long as you kept him from thinking about what he was doing, and this film is proof of the pudding. Each movement is too mechanical in its precision, making it look like a rusty clock toy, while its voice is a strange mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas of Taxi and a Dalek who have all followed speech lessons from Dok-tah E-city. No banality of evil here, just a money that walks around with an invisible sign over his head that says, "Please leave me, kill, thank you, for your consideration." Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man who ends badly in the hurried scenes of At the gas station, Nancy Travis beats very hard and Sandra Bullock has absolutely no reason to think about the subject of his obsession, neither the director nor the writer Todd Graff. The scenario is particularly weakened. The timeline has been modified. focus on Bridges at the expense of the couple when opening the film. Worse, the film rushes, draining the life and character of each scene of his race to move on to the next. / Low mood changes in the relationship of the couple or the seemingly casual but cautious establishment of the ambiance of the place, we just have some arguments that give you the impression that it is probably better without it. ?? Stan dard woman pursued by nutter in the woods, stuff complete with lame 'let's end it on a joke like a televised cop moment ?? Better not go? which is a piece of advice that goes for all that movie's trainwreck. Even Jerry Goldsmith's shocking, bland and uninspired score can do nothing for this one.
