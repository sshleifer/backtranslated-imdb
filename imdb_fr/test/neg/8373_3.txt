Maybe we Australians have a totally different sense of humor and that's the only problem. I have a database of all DVDs I own (including those received as a gift, which was the case) and so, when entering a new one, I always refer to IMDb for such information that genre, performance, director, tracks, etc. that, I noticed it was a comedy and so I decided to watch it at a time when I wanted something light and laugh. Well, it was neither one nor the other! There was absolutely NO Laughter and a disproportionate amount of gratuitous blasphemy (are there REALLY radio hosts allowed to broadcast the kind of dirt that Steve Jones is telling?) And if a decent child would start to listen to his station?). <BR /> <br /> Rather than laughing (or even laughing a little), I found it all depressing. I gave him 3 out of 10 but, to be honest, I do not know what these 3 are used for! I guess the basics of lighting and sound were not so bad! <br /> <br /> We have a vanquished (Giovanni Ribisi) who still seems able to drive a reasonable car (who pays for the fuel?) and live in what could be a nice apartment (who pays his rent? Given the opportunity to form what could have been a kind of meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a nice girl, he even blew that up! It may be she (Lynn Collins) who earned this film the 3 points! The fact that she works as a stripper rather than a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this film that makes sense ("I win as much in one night as I do in two weeks"). <br /> <br /> Unless you want to be depressed and bored to the teeth, forget about it!
