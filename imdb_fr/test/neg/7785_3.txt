I hate a movie that has no end. I do not care if the rest can be good or bad, I do not like to be left without conclusion. Such broadcasts should insist on a disclaimer ... something like: The film you are about to watch has no end or is so ambiguous that it is inconclusive. <br /> <br /> In the movie, the last scene that we are Dee and Dominic still somewhat disagree and says, almost reluctantly, that it could not be him, because his fingers were either those of a girl, those of a child. THEN IT'S OVER! Of course, the smoking gun, so to speak, is in the hands of Dee's son, but what about Dominic's daughter? I actually thought we could find out it was her! Anyway, unless you like inconclusive movies, I'll avoid this one. Otherwise, I thought the movie was generally good.
