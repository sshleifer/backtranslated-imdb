I had a hard time working - looked at it in bed and it was so awful that I would have gone back to work if I could get up from bed. The dog ran away with the remote control and I got stuck. <br /> <br /> I'm convinced that Hammer was preparing the eldest daughter to become his beeeatch. <br /> <br /> Terrible to watch - made me vomit more than I did anyway. So here it is, the movie they play in Hell's waiting room before going home. Or maybe you're stuck in the film for eternity with the Hart kids. Do not forget to take a gun with you ....
