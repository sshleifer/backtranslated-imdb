In 1994, the Power Rangers became a huge franchise and tv The leaders of USA Network hoped to participate in the action and found the tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters of Beverly Hills, in which the nasty Emporer Gorganus, who looks to wear a homemade Darth Vader costume, and his talking bird, which looks like a rubber dog chew toy, come to earth to invade it with giant monsters that look like releases from a movie Godzilla of the 1970s. Fortunately, Nimbar, an alien resembling a gigantic piece of clear jello, recruits four teenagers to defend the Earth. Nimbar attributes to each a tattoo representing a different star constellation that allows them to turn into polished superheroes who look like dancers from a music video, they could also be combined in a giant knight. Forty episodes have been made. The American network obviously did not have the money to adapt a Japanese series, as the Power Rangers did, and created this series using the budget of a scifi film from the 1950s. The fighting scenes are generic, the special effects are mediocre and some decors seem to fall. The actors pretty much realized how ridiculous the show was and almost ruined it. I can only imagine their shock when the series was canceled.
