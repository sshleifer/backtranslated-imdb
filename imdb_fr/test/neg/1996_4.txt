'Odor -able Kitty' by Chuck Jones is the drawing that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world ?? kind of. There are some essential differences between the Pepe we know and love (or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this drawing. On the other hand, the disguised cat Pepe pursues lovingly in "Odor-able Kitty" is distinctly a male. In addition, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the culmination of the caricature, his French accent collapsing when his wife and family introduce themselves. Pepe is not even the main character here, but rather the endorsed cat who disguises himself as a skunk to make his enemies run away. Essentially, the script largely follows Pepe Le Pew's usual cartoon format, but Pepe's aggressive court lacks the usual taunts and addresses directly to the camera that make him such a great character. He is also far from being as beautiful as he would become and rather animated in a clumsy way. In fact, "Odor-able Kitty" is a pretty ugly and clumsy cartoon. His main source of appeal comes from his concept that was original at this stage before becoming the model of all Pepe Le Pew's drawings that followed. This further development deprived "Odor-kitty" of any impact and, for modern viewers, it resembles a rather dull short film by Pepe Le Pew with a surprising end. As a child, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risky humor, I like the character and most of his drawings. 'Odor-able Kitty' makes me feel like a child again!
