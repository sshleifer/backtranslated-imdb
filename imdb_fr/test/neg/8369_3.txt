I'm a little bit between the gushy magazine and the hate magazine. I am a fan of Lovecraft (and a "purist" of Lovecraft) and, even if this small amateur film was of poor quality, it possessed many reducing qualities. I went to see something worse than I ever saw and wondered if Lovecraft would turn in his grave, but I was shocked to find that I loved him somehow. <br /> <br /> I do not know. I do not want to list the flaws of the film. I will mention only a few that prevent this film from being a "stellar amateur effort". <br /> <br /> Its budget is very small and it was shot in video camera, so it looks like soap operas, but once you get used to it, it stops being a big deal. The direction is quite amateur and the framing and the use of the distance in the shots are rather clumsy. STILL, this movie was actually pretty scary and it remained more faithful to Lovecraftian's intention than almost all the transvestites of Stuart Gordan and Brian Yuzna (my main exception to these films being Re-Animator and Dagon). The idea of ​​being impregnated by Old One recalls Dunwich Horror and Shadow over Innsmouth (which does not mean that this film is as good as these stories !!), so the plot as a whole is quite faithful to the ideas of Lovecraft. One thing that bothered me was that the words of the Bible seemed to make a zombie prisoner upset and scared. I do not know if this was supposed to indicate that the words "of God" upset the Ancients or just this zombie. There was no real answer to that. The rest of the Christian symbolism evoked here reminds me of August Derleth's myth. In a sense, it was an interpretation of Derleth mythos. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film only as a curiosity. This shows how a fairly atmospheric film can be made with almost no budget. I liked the setting of the wine cellars. The outdoor photos were sad, though. Using the same stretch of beach and trees (and almost the same shot) to convey the long journey of 3 characters was really sad. The director needs a whim for that. The acting game was the norm for an amateur film, the blonde zombie girl getting a personal award for "Best Gollum Personification by an Italian Actress". In fact, I think this movie was done before the Lord of the Rings movies. Maybe Andy Sedaris was watching him and thinking, "Dang, she'll make a good Gollum!" <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the director, however. The makeup on the zombies was like bad kids goth. I was upset to see this and I almost stopped watching. I was like, "Oh, that's how we know she's naughty and possessed," but later in the movie, you see a girl doing her makeup on the face of an older woman ( alive). So, it was not an attempt to say "goth makeup = zombie" but rather "goth makeup was left after zombification". However, possessed / zombie matches "blue contact lenses" ... heh. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have always liked this film better than the films of Yuzna and Gordan (with the exceptions noted above). Yuzna and Gordan had much better budgets, but this film was better at filming a Lovecraft story than they did, and on a small budget. <br /> <br /> A quick word for the makeup artist: I know you wanted "claws" or something on Zariah's fingers, but long black pressure nails looked really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> A quick word for the author of the score: I know you could not resist, and apparently no more than the director who approved it, but when the two characters quarrel with weapons for a "duel", play the little hiss of "The good, the bad and the ugly" killed all the atmosphere accumulated by the scene. It was cute, but cute was not appropriate. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers of this film have read Lovecraft and respect him very much. I enjoyed the little nods here and there: the character Carter with bad dreams and the character Pickman who becomes a macabre zombie.
