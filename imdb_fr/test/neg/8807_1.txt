"Hood Rat" is absolutely terrible. This is an urban version of "Willard". I can not believe that this film was made, let alone distributed. Someone at Universal Studios thought people would watch and love this "movie". The only good thing to do here is Ice-T as the owner. He was funny. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hate in movies is the speed of action. Once or twice is bad enough, but the WHOLE movie is like that. Each scene transition is a special effect of fast movement. The director should be banned from making movies forever. <br /> <br /> Trust me, never see this movie!
