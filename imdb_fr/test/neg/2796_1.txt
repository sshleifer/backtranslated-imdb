Now, I will do it without putting spoilers if I can. My cousin and I rented movies last weekend, and we came across this, with the big scarecrow on the cover. It looked cool, so we rented it next to Kungfu Hustle. <br /> <br /> Wow ... just ... Wow. <br /> <br /> For starters, the movie was horrible. Now the art of the box, the opening scenes and the music were decent, but the film itself is dreadful. The acting is mediocre (Sean, the main role shows almost no emotion or effort on the part of his character), the scarecrows are nothing like the cover (false advertising, perhaps?), And shots and angles that of a bad wrestling event. <br /> <br /> And believe me, I'm a fan of wrestling. I know bad camera angles. And honestly, Gigli and Pootie Tang are in the game. It's done so badly that it amuses me. It makes me laugh. So, in a way, this film takes me for a good comedy. <br /> <br /> But, to be fair, it serves as what to do and what not to do in movies, especially the slasher. kind. I recommend people to look at this, just to understand what to avoid.
