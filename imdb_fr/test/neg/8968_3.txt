Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking - and who is considered by the local population as a witch. Kate works too hard to try to convince us that she has the cul-de-sac (called Trigger Hicks!), But you can see that she does not even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario. Always smiling, Robert Young plays the role of a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam that becomes the first crush on Trigger ... but alas, he is married! No amount of white magic can resurrect this formula, based on a game and brought to the screen by R.K.O. with a hill too wide to bloom. It is impious, and almost unassailable. * 1/2 of ****
