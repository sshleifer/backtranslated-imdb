When a Stranger Calls belongs to the group of this year's remakes, with movies like Poseidon on the horizon. Director Simon West (Con Air) directs this updated version, with many relatively unknown castings, that either indicate that the mortality rate is high (it's not), or that established stars have moved away from a potential turkey. <br /> <br /> In 87 minutes, it consists mainly of two acts. The first, which takes a full hour, is the configuration. Our heroine, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), wrote 800 minutes of talk time on her mobile phone (do the math), and as a lesson in responsibility, her parents confiscated her cell phone and grounded it. To pay her debt, she works part-time as a babysitter and takes care of the children of the rich Mandrakis. This is his first visit. <br /> <br /> The huge Mandrakis mansion receives a full visit, as this is where all the action will take place. Lots of room (hides), basin-aquarium the size of an indoor pool (for getting wet, for the treatment of wet t-shirts), and check it out - the motion detector lights , which you know will contribute to fear with the manipulation of lights and shadows. Naturally, the jokes, the red herrings are numerous, which puts in danger the time allotted for this act, but most of them fall flat in the department of the pending business. <br /> <br /> A small trend is emerging: the actors are the invisible, providing and acting through their voices instead. Recent attempts include Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven and Hugo Weaving's V for Vendetta. Here, Lance Henriksen does the honors for the anonymous and nameless psychotic killer, but he falls flat. Why? The script does not give him much dialogue. Most of the phone calls were of a silent nature (masturbatory spirit), which, in my opinion, was a waste - they could also have launched a stranger, but the work will always be done. <br /> <br /> the second act, where the main action takes place, is too little, too late. And the scarecrow, well, is purely a scarecrow. Those who expect blood and gore will be disappointed, because in the end, it is a female show that will catch your attention from the first hour (the pleasure of the eyes is always successful), and this action will allow him to solve everything in one. record time, as shown by Rachel McAdams in Red Eye. Do not expect any form of development of the character, or secondary intrigues that will engage. <br /> <br /> The end tried to be too smart for its own good and appeared as an inexpensive way to finish the film. There is not much goodness to emphasize in this film - no fear, no thrills, no cryptic villain, and lots of security flaws, especially with this door alarm - the only thing for which it is good , is to provide a number to 4D.
