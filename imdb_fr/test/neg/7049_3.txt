Prior to the personal video era, Stan Laurel's early comedy Hardy 'Kill or Cure' was known - to the extent that it was known at all - only because a few sequences appeared in Laurel's compilation film Hardy's, Robert Youngson, directed by Robert Youngson. 20's'. Youngson knew what he was doing: the best gags of 'Kill or Cure' had remained intact in his compilation, while the rest of this somewhat amusing comedy remained on the floor of Youngson's cutting room. <br /> <br /> Laurel portrays a commercial traveler, peddling a patented drug shouted Professor IO Dine's Knox-All: this name is the funniest joke of this film, which does not say much. I want to emphasize that this film dates from 1923, the hock of the prohibition. During Prohibition, many Americans bought patented medicines if they possessed "lousy" (medicinal) properties. Thus, if Knox-All contains alcohol, Stan's work in this film is less desperate than the one he is famous for with Ollie. had in "Big Business", selling Christmas trees in summer. Too bad for this movie that it's not as funny as "Big Business". <br /> <br /> We see Stan (but do not hear him, in this silent movie) delivering an enthusiastic sales discussion to a man who seems to be paying attention ... until we learn that they are standing in front of an institution for deaf-mutes and that this man is deaf. A haughty woman walks out of doors: Stan quickly tries to hold his attention by waving his fingers at her. Of course, she is not deaf and she hits him quickly with his umbrella. I found this sequence shocking, NOT because it involves the deaf (the deaf are not the idiots of the joke), but because it encourages the common misconceptions among hard of hearing people that they can communicate with the deaf, stirring their fingers at random. and play Charades without actually learning the very complex grammar of sign language. <br /> More fun, a bachelor of this movie has a pet canary called Rudolph (as in Valentino), and there is a permit for a man to hide behind a narrower object than his body. I have already seen this camera in several cartoons and real action movies, but "Kill or Cure" is, in my opinion, the first movie to have used it to date. <br /> <br /> Stan Laurel, an underrated actor, doing physical work here worthy of Chaplin or Keaton, in which he transmits his emotions - and a change of behavior - away from the camera, the back turned. But Laurel never really became a leading comedian before joining Oliver Hardy to form the biggest comedy team of all time. "Kill or heal" is only 3 out of 10.
