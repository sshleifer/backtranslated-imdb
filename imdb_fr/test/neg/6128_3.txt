This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol for the screen: the first was "the break" (1970) (the novel "the man with the ball") and it's a shame that no one cares. He is Chabrol's sleeper, and I urge all his fans to see him. <br /> <br /> The spiderweb "The Chocolate" was not a police story as strong as the one I knew at the beginning. I read it 20 years ago and have forgotten everything. The film promises It's a confusing film by Chabrol, mixing elements of the heyday of the time (around 1969), and a lot of stupid stuff from the eighties, like 'chicken in vinegar', not a particularly memorable work. <br /> <br /> Part of the disappointment comes from the cast: it is an extremely painful gathering: Jacques Dutronc plays like a zombie, Isabelle Huppert is revealed a actress a little limited, finally quite vulgar He worked in "a woman business", it is not done here. They are not supported by the young couple: b The actors of the past, for example, St√©phane Audran or Michel Bouquet (both in " the break ") were brilliant and contributed to the unique atmosphere of Chabrol at the time. <br /> <br /> The story itself is not distinguished: beginner as a kind of" serious " "life is a long calm river" (the character evokes besides the very funny film of Etienne C hatilliez), the film hangs again and again like a laughable psychological drama afterwards. We will not congratulate the young people The pianist who, after all that she has learned about her nasty hostess, agrees to drive a car on a dangerous road. <br /> <br /> Because he makes too many films, Chabrol frees turkeys frequently. One wonders why watching one of his films should choose this one among all his products to win. <br /> <br /> It seems that Chabrol's bourgeois satire has finally given way to clemency. At the "break-up," the first medium-detective novel adaptation that Chabrol has completely transcended, should you Audran says "they have so much money!" Here, Chabrol lost his bite, his strength.
