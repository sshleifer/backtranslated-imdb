I was expecting a comedy about the NVA, but it's a travesty. This shows the national army of East Germany in a day that is not appropriate and certainly not true. <br /> <br /> We can do a comedy about everything, as long as the underlying facts are not changed. Even a comedy about the German KZ is possible, as Roberto Benigni showed with "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL". <br /> <br /> The film NVA would be a comedy "OK" because the jokes are globally acceptable. Nothing special - not hilarious, but enough to live with. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the film is a joke and a parody of the NVA. A death machine ready to attack Western Europe with his friend the RED ARMY. An institution that used everything to get the most out of its soldiers. An army that entered the CSPR in 1968 and was ready to march also in POLAND to destroy SOLIDARNOSC. You can not make a movie without showing the least harm, or would you like to make a parody of a KZ, Guantanamo or 11/9 ??? Show Osama bin Laden as a funny guy? 90 minutes on a funny Osama in an Afghan Taliban camp, where he makes jokes and trains his soldiers would be comparable to what this film does of the NVA!
