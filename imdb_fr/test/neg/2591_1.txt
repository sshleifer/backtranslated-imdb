I'm generally quite tolerant of movies and very easily entertained, but this movie was terribly disappointing. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after seeing on the cover that William Zabka was in (The Karate Kid bad boy) and during this movie, I realized that it was the only one reason. <br /> <br /> This film is a huge mess of the talent of the actors. The music and the sound are terribly slamming. I could not believe that of a film made in the 90s! <br /> <br /> I would not really recommend this movie if you are not interested in one of the actors.
