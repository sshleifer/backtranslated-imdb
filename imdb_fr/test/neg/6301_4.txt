This is one of those harmless and slightly entertaining little movies that strive to make you love more. But like so many others, its material is not strong enough to occupy a few hours in a row. <br /> <br /> The ground is promising: three drag queens drive a bus through the Sydney Outback to Alice Springs. They face a lot of problems - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their past. <br /> <br /> The real problem is with dialogue. The tracks are good (though Pearce's continuous camp becomes boring), but monologues and epithets feel compelled to throw them where they should be thrown. The characters should not laugh at their gags. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter / director Elliott also feels the need to cram into nicely incongruous clich√©s of flamboyant drag suits on dark desert bottoms like cheap makeup. For a movie about self-confidence and being yourself, everything seems very unsafe.
