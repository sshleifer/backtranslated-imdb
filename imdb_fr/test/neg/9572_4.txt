I had to lower my rating of this movie to 4 because of the terrible soundtrack. I'm pretty sure it was not a problem for me or for the band, because some actors and the soundtrack sounded good. But most of the voices of actors were distorted or distorted, especially for non-British people. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of cute little twists that would make this movie enjoyable - arriving in Bosnia by mistake is great - but a lot of the humor is lost in the sound.
