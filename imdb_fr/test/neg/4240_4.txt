This show can very well be described as a Bubble-Gum TV show: it nibbles, it tastes good and lasts a long time. But, like Bubble-Gum, it can leave a bad taste in the mouth after a little too much chewing. <br /> <br /> This show offers very simple questions that come in the form of games, such as Hangman, guessing simple expression or riddles on a short list. The callers are the candidates, and everyone can play. <br /> <br /> The questions, however, are terribly easy. There is techno music pumped into the background that is shaped in a continuous loop. It never seems to get old, but it never adds much to the show. However, the hostess, whoever she is, is extremely friendly, quite pleasant to look at and can make very funny facial expressions. I rather like this British woman. <br /> <br /> But there is nothing in this show. It's simplistic and unconvincing, although it can be entertaining if nothing else is.
