For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation might be suitable. But only for them. This is a disjointed version of Mansfield Park's "Cliff Notes", and if you have not seen another version or read the books, it would scratch your head. <br /> <br /> Why was it so difficult to make a good adaptation of this book? That of the 1990s took such liberties that it seemed barely to be the same book - its state of mind was completely modern and prurient. <br /> <br /> Here we have Billie Piper who looks like a pretty girl. She has a charming personality that develops nicely - but she has blond hair, black eyebrows, and - blatantly - dark brown roots - through much of the picture. So much for the intact cousin. It's incredibly distracting and the rest of the cast is in the kind of creased clothing that shows a lack of respect for the accuracy of the period. <br /> <br /> One thing is fine here - Haley Atwell is the best Mary Crawford of all versions. She is perfect, seductive without being modern or suggestive, flippant and completely devoid of any moral sense. Henry here is actually pretty good to be a mild temptation for our heroine. <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave plays one of the most interesting roles in history and manages to make it really boring until her last scene - far too sensitive. It's just a production that has really missed its target, a real low for fans of Austen. <br /> <br /> The only usable version is the one with a funny duck (perfect for the role) Sylvestra La Touzel (despite Henry Crawford gay - it's just laughable).
