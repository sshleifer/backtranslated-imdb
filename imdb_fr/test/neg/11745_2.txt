* some possible mess * <br /> <br /> Of course, we can not expect that this film is as good as the original, the remakes are rarely. But this remake of Psycho, one of Hitchcock's greatest movies, could have been much better. <br /> <br /> First of all, whoever shot the film must have been a psychopath. I mean, Vince Vaughn like Norman Bates! What did they think ?! Unlike the "harmless", almost childlike Bates that Anthony Perkins was able to represent, Vaughn seems to be a murderer. Vaughn ends up getting gay. Many other actors did not seem to be doing their part either, including Julianne Moore who just did not seem to be part of the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to the atrocious distribution, cinematography is particularly shabby, despite the fact that they have redone the film scene for the stage. The only thing they added was random shots of objects such as clouds or a naked woman, between shots of characters being murdered. These shots seemed, in any case, irrelevant to the plot and therefore had no meaning. <br /> <br /> Overall, this remake of Psycho, which could be a decent picture, turned out to be a total waste of time. .
