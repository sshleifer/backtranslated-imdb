I loved all the other Don Knotts movies, but I've never heard much about "How To Frame A Fig" and now I know why: I can not think of anyone who would find it enjoyable. This film seems to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds, but even most of them abandon it. At best, there are brief moments of light amusement, mainly because Don Knotts plays the same nervous and oppressed character that made him famous. <br /> <br /> After the movie ended, I was curious to know if my teenager could understand it. fatal defect of the film. We totally agreed: Prentiss Gates's character was even more stupid than Don Knotts. <br /> <br /> Be happy that the films of Mr. Limpet, the reluctant astronaut, Shakiest Gun and Mr. Chicken are there.
