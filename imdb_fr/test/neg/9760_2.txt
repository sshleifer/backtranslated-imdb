Screenwriter-director Patrice Leconte tackles a universal and potentially groundless subject - friendship - and transforms it into a meaningless, meaningless farce, despite the leading actors, a beautiful cinematography and an elegant decor. Everything is in the plot, and the plot is laughable. "Teach me to be nice," says art dealer Fran√ßois Coste (Daniel Auteuil) to a stranger (Dany Boon), which sums up the situation. We learn almost nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil is perhaps a good actor, but we do not think he could be the egotistical egotist that the scenario depends on him. While we hope the parody is over, Leconte performs one of his usual third cathartic acts, going from one sinister to another. Like Francis' precious Greek vase, everyone in this film is a fake. The only asset of Leconte is Julie Gayet in the role of Catherine, business partner of Coste, very sexy and sexy despite a major problem of haircuts.
