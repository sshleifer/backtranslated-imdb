It's hard to go into this kind of thing because there is absolutely no reason, even partial, to look at it, much less to express an opinion on it. I do not know anything about it - I watched it to laugh and I stayed for the fake tits. Apparently, this is an unofficial sequel to the 1982 "Party Massacre", which I enjoyed as a fun slasher. "Cheerleader Massacre" looks like a late-night soft-core Cinemax porn! And unsurprisingly, girls like Nikki Fritz and Samantha Phillips (prolific T & A actresses) are in the game. A lot of mermaids and not much else ... A group of cheerleaders in their twenties in high school, two guys at random and the big and stupid comic-relief slob find themselves stranded in the country and find a house where they plan to stay at night. The recently escaped "Slumber Party" killer is in the area and starts killing them. There is no gore or originality and I would not say that nudity is a real "selling point", because it's about as boring as a slasher movie can be. Absolutely terrible ...
