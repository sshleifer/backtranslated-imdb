It was a strange film. A bit of horror and certainly a black film. Some fifth chroniclers meet and mysteriously begin to die with a Japanese dagger in their hands after the arrival of Mr. Columbus (Bela Lugosi). <br /> <br /> Soon, the Langer Ranger arrives in the person of FBI agent Richard 'Dick' Martin (Clayton Moore). Martin is ineffective in finding the murderer because he is more interested in the niece (Joan Barclay) of a missing doctor who is part of the gang. <br /> <br /> After the death of the last man, the doctor is horribly disfigured by a strange serum, the true story of the group comes out and that's where it becomes interesting and strange. I will not overthrow him. <br /> <br /> Lugosi was wonderful as a cursed killer.
