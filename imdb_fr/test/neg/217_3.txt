I must admit that I am disappointed after watching this movie. I was expecting so much more trailers. The movie was absolutely horrible. It lacked a real scenario and the acting was not exactly the best. Do not waste your time. The film is not what the trailers bring you to think. I must say I do not usually write IMDb movies (that's actually my first one) but this film was such a disappointment that I signed up just so people would not waste their time and money . The scenario is that of a hold-up that has to happen and it looks like it could potentially be good, but the things that are happening in the movie are a bit far-fetched to be credible. Look at another movie instead, maybe the man from the inside ???
