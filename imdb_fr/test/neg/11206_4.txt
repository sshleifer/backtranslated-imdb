It could have been a very good movie if someone just knew how to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The story was going very well and was heading to this point in every movie like this where the "gray" characters become "good" and the "bad guys" get their just dessert and * boom * ... it's like they're running out of script and the cast just started making things up. <br /> <br /> It was so serious ... if the casting had just continued with the development of the character he had already set up. But this is not the case and the film quickly becomes a clumsy mess. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie until about the last 30 minutes ... then turn it off. At this point, imagine what the next 30 minutes will look like based on what you've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the ending you are proposing will have a much better appearance than this one. . Believe me on that.
