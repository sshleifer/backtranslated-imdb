I watched this movie a few days ago and it was awful! <br /> <br /> Extremely long - even if they managed to spend most of their lives! <br /> <br /> Extremely boring - the roles they included were long, and for some reason, the director chose to cut some of the action and left huge parts of the movie unexplained! <br /> <br /> Absolutely inaccurate - all the "mystic" side of this movie was a joke, and the last time I checked, Ghengis Khan was not really a good guy! <br /> <br /> Mistakenly acted - I found several characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked depth! <br /> <br /> Cinematography has been a grace of the film. That's why I attributed to this movie 2 stars rather than the bare minimum! However, if you want to look at something pretty, I'd rather buy a picture! <br /> <br /> In total, this film was a waste of time and money! Please do yourself a favor and give this Mongol turkey a miss!
