The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity when Liz (Kim Basinger) undresses on the music of Joe Cocker: You can leave your hat! It was the best part of the whole movie. Not because the scene was good; only the song. I'm not saying it was a terribly bad movie, but not very good. In a disappointing way! <br /> <br /> Especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been developed. Instead of dwelling on the dangerous side of lust, obsession and craze, he drags his heels from one idea to another. For example, when John (portrayed by Rourke) manages to leave her at the top of the Ferris wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is unconvincingly moved by John's bizarre sense of humor, but less to his sexual exploits Liz voluntary; and as one reader mentioned, for a woman to enjoy sex, she has to experience the dangerous side, which is not convincing. This "dangerous" side is not sufficiently exploited in the film and one has the impression of being anti-climax from the point of view that all this could turn out badly. The subject of servitude often appears, but only one remains on the verge of danger and all goes well. Does the movie send the message that this kind of "preliminaries" is FINE! If the film brought out the pitfalls of servitude and, by extension, the damaging consequences of sad masochism, then it might be a good moral argument. Instead, the film jumps awkwardly from Rourke's "burning" scene feeding Basinger and wearing a blindfold over his eyes. In a film that could have been good, it falls flat because it does not expand the themes that the film is perhaps trying to relate; so, for me, it has no plot or theme but a mix of ideas.
