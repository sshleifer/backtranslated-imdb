Honestly, I'm not so impressed by that, it's not a bad movie, but it's not a good movie either. There is a story to tell, but it is told in a very incoherent way, which makes it lose its meaning and its ability to intrigue. This film could have been shot differently with an exceptional result, the story is so interesting, but I'm not intrigued when I look at it. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not an amateur film, but rather the opposite and some scenes are very moving. The actors and actresses do a good job, just like the director, but there is something so unfinished in the whole film that I can not put my finger on it. Maybe if you had gotten to know more about the characters, all the "mess" of the movie could have been better clarified and put more action throughout the film, as it had become a bit slow from time to time.
