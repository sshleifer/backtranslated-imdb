Sensational. I watched One Night at McCool's yesterday and all I can say is "Wow." <br /> <br /> And there you are. MAIN SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Do you want a summary of the plot, just to see how stupid and irrelevant this film is? I would never tell anyone to look at it unless I want to inflict pain on them. Anyway, here's a glimpse of the plot. <br /> <br /> Randy works for a bar, McCool's. He meets this woman named Jewel who convinces him to make love with him. Her ex-boyfriend ends up trying to steal them and gets killed. Randy and his cousin and the detective at the crime scene fall for Jewel. As a mascot of stupidity, she uses each of these guys to get what she wants, with a DVD player. Randy hires a killer to kill her, and the detective ends up being killed by the ex-boyfriend's psychopathic brother. The killer and Jewel take off. <br /> <br /> Seriously. That's all. I have left almost nothing, except for some sex scenes and an almost pornographic scene of Liv Tyler in Jewel using a pipe to show his sexuality. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of this film? To be honest, I think it was so that producers and directors could show their male impulses. Which, I think, is absolutely out of place and just stupid. When I watch a movie, I want a plot. I want characters. I do not care about the sexy woman showing everything they could have. Something should happen in a movie, for God's sake. It's as serious as Fight Club. <br /> <br /> The situation is getting worse. John Goodman is the detective devoted to being superior. I myself wondered why Goodman would play in something so outrageous, but then I remembered he was in O Brother, Where Art Thou? as well as. His reputation has weakened. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler was an amazing actress in The Lord of the Rings series. In this film she is nothing more than a slut with no intelligence who wants nothing but her way. For me, his reputation has dropped seven or eight notches. <br /> <br /> I'm stunned, just amazed that people are working so hard to do something so stupid. The music is absolutely shitty (playing "YMCA" while the character of John Goodman is killing himself does not fit), the characters are totally unimaginable, the plot is one of the most stupid ever conceived by man , and to top it off, it does not fit into any genre. Porn comedy is the closest thing. If it was supposed to be funny. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> I think I'm tired of making havoc. But let me just make sure no one in their minds ever wants to see this movie. Unless they want Liv Tyler as much as the characters, that's it.
