It was bad enough already. I really hope there is no follow up. Maybe it's part of the plot to let you know it's open to the possibility, but no, that's really not the case. <br /> <br /> There is really no peculiarity about this movie. The special effect was pretty good, but there was no special riddle. <br /> <br /> There were a few girls in her, including Elina Madison and Alexandra Ford, but nothing to do with people. PG-13, certainly not an R. It also tells you that the slasher aspects were less than spectacular. The shovel in the head was the only thing unusual. <br /> <br /> Scary food.
