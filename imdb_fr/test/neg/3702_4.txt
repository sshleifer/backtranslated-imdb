The movies in the science fiction channel (science fiction channel) have become boringly predictable. The budget, the originality and the plot that seem low. <br /> <br /> In this creation, the government is trying to get a lot of telekinetics and is recruiting a poor soul by devious means to help. There are a lot of over-worked recycled twists on the theme of a diabolical government organization. Black coats, shadows, meaningless lines make these one-dimensional drawings. <br /> <br /> Daniel Dae Kim stands out as a good actor in a small role. He brings a little style of his character "Angel" to the role. It's hard to miss the link between his "Crusade" character and his telepath. This is a movie about telekinesis. Was it a sci-fi casting to try to attract fans of the other series? Who knows. Fortunately, he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> The film is really low budget. It reflects the current model of Canada's location of science fiction channels, few well-known characters, few effects, and a terribly terrible plot and character development. One would think they believe that science fiction fans will see everything that is labeled "scifi". <br /> <br /> If you want a good telekinesis movie, take a look at "the Fury" (1978).
