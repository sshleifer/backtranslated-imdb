If you want to lose a small part of your life, sit in front of this predictable zombie movie. He fails the first post by not being afraid or funny. It's a dull gray movie that, I guess, went straight to the video. Hammy and tongue in cheeks leaving a bitter taste in the mouth. If you want to watch a recent, poor but still watchable zombie movie, watch Diary of the Dead. Poor special effects, school level script. Zombie movies work if they have a moral point or even a political point. This film has nothing, there is no point worthy of zombification. It's as exciting and compelling as a Republican convention; not to regret watching the Republican convention would be a better example of zombie movie.
