Danny Lee's performance as a skeptical policeman is the only subject of interest in this film, even though the cast is excellent, including Chow Yun-Fat, Carina Lau, Andy Lau, Shing Fui-On and Alex Man. CYF plays a triad leader who wants to settle into a life of peace and plenty but Alex Man, a total psychopath who has a lot of grudges against CYF, will not let him. CYF tries to escape to Malacca but to no avail. After her family has been crumbled to pieces, her friends are dead or injured, and injured, CYF returns to Hong Kong for serious revenge. <br /> <br /> It sounds a lot better than it is. CYF is well dressed and beautiful, looks pained, grimaces and cries, but one way or another, you do not care. Andy Lau looks great, but that's about it. Carina Lau has a tiny little part that was nice, but she gets shot in the head early for that to finish. Alex Man is a nasty cartoonist who is so eccentric that sometimes it can be intriguing, but the writing here is so flat that it comes out like a garden nut. <br /> <br /> Danny Lee is awesome though - pity he only has a small flush on the screen of this dark film (literally) and essentially boring. <br /> <br /> Rent it, do not buy it. Or simply skip it completely. <br /> <br /> This is the sequel to "Rich And Famous", although it was apparently shot simultaneously; it was released for the first time due to the box office power of CYF.
