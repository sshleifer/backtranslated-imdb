Downhill Racer is essentially a movie to see only for the superb ski sequences. Although there is a story here, the character of Robert Redford, a skier trying to be part of the US Olympic team, is so bland and unfriendly that you wonder why you care. Gene Hackman, at an early performance, adds nicely, but it's a movie you can watch without sound, and it would not make much difference.
