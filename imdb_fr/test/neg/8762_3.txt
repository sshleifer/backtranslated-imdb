There is not much to say about this one, if it's probably the worst debut of the zombie movies (I'll see another one perhaps, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES [1936], before end of the month). If John Carradine intends to build an army in the service of the Third Reich with them, they do not seem to do much! James Baskett (SOUTH SONG'S Uncle Remus [1946]!) Plays their leader, who also serves as Carradine's valet de chambre. The black comedian Mantan Moreland resumes his role of driver of "shy cat" KING OF THE ZOMBIES (1941), like the exotic Madame Sul-Te-Wan, governor of Carradine. Unfortunately for Carradine, its ultimate achievement ?? the zombification of his wife ?? brings him all sorts of problems: not only do his relatives go to his home / remote lab to investigate his sudden death (which means he has to simulate a funeral service!), but in fact he turns out to be disobedient and indignant finally to "persuade". his zombie comrades get up against their master !! Cowboy star Bob Steele (still known for his role in Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP [Howard Walsh] 1948) plays the role of an American secret agent posing as a Nazi posing as a sheriff! Fortunately, director Sekely would have a much better chance with his next genre effort, THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (1962).
