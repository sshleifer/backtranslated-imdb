I think it's one of the ten worst films I've ever seen! There is like disappearing every two minutes. If it was on television, they would have an overview every 2-3 minutes. But there is a view that I personally appreciated: the blonde is going to take a bath in a boiling water well under the eyes of a man and for about 10 seconds, you see her whole body without a towel! It was the best scene in the whole movie because you see sasquatch playing them, but it's the last 10 minutes that separate us from his whole body. In addition, most of the dead are off the screen and are only screams or roars. And I was expecting the Sasquatch to die. But he does not shoot at him and only 4 or 5 people die in the whole movie. I was expecting 8 to 10 people to die. Do not watch this movie. I give him an F-. Do not waste your time.
