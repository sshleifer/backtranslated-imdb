As a former observer of MST3k, I even found this film unassailable. The terrible attempts of humor-devil the terrible attempts to act. No one needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> I just like how all the positive reviews have been clearly written by cast members or family friends. Just click on their other reviews and wow - they are all commenting on Modern Vampires. Give me a few dollars and I can make a movie better than that. One of the most incompetent films I've ever seen that says anything. Look at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10
