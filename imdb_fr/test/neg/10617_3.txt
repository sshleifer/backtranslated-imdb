I watched this movie which, I really thought, had a promising start, but it just made me feel disappointed in the end. The problem that I think with this film was that the director was trying a little too hard to make this film strange and original. There were too many flashbacks and too many bad effects that bothered me through the movie. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes but they disappointed me in this movie, they could have done a lot better. This film looked promising at first, trailing in the middle and disappointing at the end. The film could never beat Stanley Kubrick's genius for controversy, quirks and originality in the movies.
