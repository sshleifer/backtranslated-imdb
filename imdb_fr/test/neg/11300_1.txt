I have witnessed some atrocities of the cinema. Over the last two years, it seems that producers and directors are keen to make films that bring me closer and closer to madness. Hannibal was no exception. I did not expect much when I went to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the saying "The book is always better than the movie" did not at all assure me that this film would be anything but a junk. But what I saw is a movie that makes all the other bad movies look better in comparison. <br /> <br /> Normally, when I see a terrible movie, I find myself more amused than anything. Unfortunately, I could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that was Hannibal. The film was filmed with promise, I guess. There was Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman. And to lead, there was Ridley Scott. There were films with a lot less talent that were enormously better. There were so many things I could have cut from this movie that I doubt there is anything left. It was pathetic. The scenario was so ridiculous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. The worst part is that the book was even crazier and some scenes were too extreme to be included, which is sad in the case of a movie where <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD * ** Ray Liotta's brain was cooking in pieces. This scene more than any other made me want to cry, because it has tarnished its predecessor on such a monumental level. Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite movies of all time. But Hannibal was a joke more than two hours. This film should only be watched if people want to learn not to write a good movie.
