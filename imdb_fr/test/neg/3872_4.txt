B. Kennedy tried to make a follow-up by exaggerating and amplifying a gigantic Westerner of left (not as leftist as the continuation of G. Kennedy, posterior to this one). <br /> <br /> This is the ugliest film of both suites? very ugly. It's a slap. B. Kennedy amplified it, but without the genius. Hundreds of peons, hundreds of Mexicans, hundreds of women, a desert, bare landscapes, a storm - the largest scale. <br /> <br /> Everything in this clumsy suite, which is only oddly funny, is phony. <br /> <br /> The film itself is very ugly. Brynner, who played the best role in the first film, is not very handsome in this one. <br /> <br /> Rey plays the role of a priest; he will be a political leader, Quintero, in the next sequel to the franchise. <br /> <br /> It is true that when you have so many characters, you may not need a very interesting scenario. sometimes. For example, Brynner meets McQueen; then they choose other 'compadres'; or B. Spencer meets Coburn; etc. It's fun to see where and how they will meet the rest of the team, etc. But you need at least these several characters. Unfortunately, the payment of Burt Kennedy is not very good at that. <br /> <br /> The Return of the Seven (1966) begins with a bullfight. Vin and Chris meet there; they decide to save the third survivor of the original Magnificents, Chico, who belongs to a huge group of 300 peons kidnapped by Mexican bandits. We discover the name of the attractive woman of Chico - it's Petra. Chris must be a small army again - and here we have a treat Dirty Dozen - Chris chooses his men from the convicts. Another member of the commando is a womanizer, who will take good care of women left without a husband. Sexual humor is particularly unpleasant and unpleasant in this film. He strives to appear intelligent and spicy; it's just rude and stupid. <br /> <br /> The choice of members of the small army was one of the greatest joys of the film McQueen. Unfortunately, in the first sequel, there is the most immutable of the three crews gathered under the name of the Magnificent Seven. <br /> <br /> Robert Fuller makes a lousy "Wine"; In this simmering attempt, a Mexican revolutionary leader has a gigantic plan: he kidnaps 300 peons and uses them to build a village and a church in memory of his lost sons. (Needless to say, this crazy Mexican revolutionary does not equal Wallach's role in the first film.) B. Kennedy is betting exclusively on the camp and all that's best: ugly landscapes, a thunderstorm, a gigantic flash, a desert. An enormous battle between the emancipated peons and the revolutionary vaqueros. Of course, Return of the Seven (1966) completely abandoned the good sense of the film McQueen. <br /> <br /> What is particularly shocking is that this sequel came pretty soon after the original film - though, everything has changed in the meantime how to make westerns. <br /> <br /> Both suites look weird.
