A frustrating documentary. The son of Louis Kahn, who saw his father very little during his childhood because he was a member of one of three separate families his father had created, is trying to learn more about his father. exploring his architecture and his life. This seems like a good idea for a documentary, but it ends up becoming flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the fundamental problem is that Kahn's son, Nathaniel, is not only one of the protagonists of the film. is also director, writer, producer, interviewer and narrator. Nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and perhaps too close to the material to play one of these roles well. In addition, although he seems to be a kind enough guy, he does not have much on-screen presence, so the fact that he is the only constant film begins to wear. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel also appears as an amateur interviewer and unprepared --- there are several situations in which an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and where the camera switches to a photo of Nathaniel offering a little more that an empty look and a kind of "uh-huh" shy, as if he was a little panicked to have to find something to say in response. Sometimes I felt embarrassed to watch people who might have some really interesting things to say about Kahn (or at least better things to do with their time), seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to count on them. lead the conversation. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel's dual role as a documentary filmmaker and lost son seems to do more harm to the film than to help. We feel that some of the interviewees are somewhat hesitant to talk about the negative aspects of Kahn's personality and career, probably because Nathaniel does not know if he's trying to dig the truth or if he just wants to hear beautiful stories about his father - - preferably those who will confirm his hope that his father cares more about Nathaniel and his mother than he seems likely. His passive approach as an interviewer may be a direct result of this conflict. The only person Nathaniel pushes is his own mother, but these conversations tend to sound a bit like a teen drama (are not you upset, Mom?) And do not offer much to help (or Nathaniel ) to understand Kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him. <br /> <br /> What the film is sorely lacking is shaped by an experienced and independent hand, not to exclude Nathaniel but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience, an independent filmmaker might have moved away from the document, thinking more about what the interviewees could do, and hopefully remove the parts of the documentary process that simply do not work, such as the strange segment with the guy who claims to have seen Kahn die (which gave the impression that Nathaniel had just been caught red-handed) or all that there is to do with the first cousin Kahn, who had nothing to add on Kahn or Nathaniel. Too often, Nathaniel makes us see him stand up. or near a Kahn Buttonholi building You must tell them that his father is the designer. (Ahhh, huh, Thaaat is nice, sir, Umm, I have to go now.) I understand why these things might be important to Nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting, but it's one of these examples of the documentary may be too personal. <br /> <br /> By the way, I thought the score written for the movie was excellent! (But, one of the strangest moments of all this was for me when, when visiting the Kimball Art Museum, the voiceover quotes Kahn making a comparison between architecture and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. played the same way Beethoven's Ninth Symphony: an error, an error, who knows, it made me laugh.) <br /> <br /> Kahn was a great architect and it was clear he was a He was an unusual human being and led a fascinating life. story. There is definitely a good documentary about him. One is sensitive to Nathaniel's search for a father he did not know, but I'm not sure it's an interesting story. Neither works so well in this movie.
