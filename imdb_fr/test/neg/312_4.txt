On Halloween, a city is terrorized by a madwoman with a big pumpkin as her head. A bad acting game, composed mainly of local talent and laughable special effects, makes him a baaaaad. The queen of movie B, Linnea Quigley, seems embarrassed to be part of it and even her considerable charm that has helped so many of her films can not help her. If you're looking for a good horror movie for Halloween, rent "Night of the Demons", which is also performed by Ms. Quigley.
