It was a rather boring movie, actually. I think the problem with a French horror film is that the French must be easy to scare, or something like that, because this movie was not only scary. The special effects with the ghost of the mummy seemed not to belong to the film, as if someone put them in the post-production to spice them up, because the actors did not react there almost. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit like meandering, which is the opposite of the actual narrative. I guess it was based on a French TV series, where they had to sum it up in a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a mummy is out of storage at the Louvre, which apparently has such a weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can enter several times. (This is how people continue to steal the Mona Lisa!) The boyfriend and the policeman of the 1960 version of this film get together and try to exorcise the demon. <br /> <br /> So I'm not sure that Mom was supposed to be a bad guy or not. He kills two guards during the movie, but he just wants to go into life after death.
