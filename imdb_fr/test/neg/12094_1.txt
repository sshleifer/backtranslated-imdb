I have not looked at anything here for a while, but having had the misfortune to go through this garbage under the pretense of entertaining myself, I had to express my thoughts. <br /> <br /> Normally, whatever the problem, there is a part that redeems, whether it is a player who was well, a passable scene, an attractive actor or a moment of great satisfaction. Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as the film begins atrociously, with a ridiculous shootout, which was so poor, I thought it was a practice, and two half-sisters, otherwise known as boys in blue chatting next to a school. One of those idiots was Daniel Baldwin, who not only starred in this film, but also directed this garbage, and unlike his brothers, he can not act for butterscotch. It's not that he's alone here, because everyone seemed to belong to the theater school of an experienced chimpanzee. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, for me, I watched this masterpiece for an hour or so. The DVD would not work, and was probably made by the same fools that produced that. So, if you have nothing to do but look at dry paint, watch it because it is just as boring and ideal for getting rid of unwanted visitors.
