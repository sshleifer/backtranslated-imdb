He missed the movies, but was always slightly constrained. I found it in the trash bin of my local video store for a paltry two dollars! Will I now give it to someone who wants it? Probably! No deliberate plot, one-dimensional characters, plastic world snatched from many much better movies, no decent dialogue to speak of. Do you know that feeling of emptiness when you come down from ecstasy? It's this feeling here. What is sad is that Australia I know is heading in that direction, without melodrama and simple answers. Interesting only to see the older Australian actors (who had to act in their day to get by) against the new Australian actors (who have to look good to get by). Like a horribly loud narrative introduction to a movie clip that never really starts ... Poor Kylie also began her acting career ...
