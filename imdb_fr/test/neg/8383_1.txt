This film is a nightmare! The feeling you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same one I had when I finished watching this movie: "Uff? OK, it's over, what a relief!" I had a hard time watching this movie, so it was serious! It's a low-cost movie from the B series, for sure, but I think it's not an excuse to be so bad! I watched brilliant films at low cost, with beautiful intrigues, a beautiful production, a beautiful interpretation and above all the substance! This one did not have anything! The plot is hilarious, it almost sounds like an "American guide on how to turn ancient Chinese mythology into a ridiculous teen movie, with kids playing with occultism" ?? I do not know if the Chinese tale present in this film is real or not, but if it is, the "damage" is even worse! The production is simply horrible, an absolute zero (What "special effects" are they?). There is no suspense. The supposed "scenes of tension" are a complete failure. The acting is not better; and what about dialogues? Oh my God! A film that has several dialogues like: "I'll go later, OK?" OK, okay - OK? " OK, all right, goodbye, so "I'm sure he does not deserve more than a 1/10 score! <br /> <br /> Too bad it's true!
