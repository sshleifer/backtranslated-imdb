The worst movie I have ever seen. The sound quality was bad, the cut scenes were even worse and above all, it was not logical and it did not have speed ... <br /> <br /> I first thought: "Oh no, I do not want the track that proves that poor Patrick was an innocent killer ". But that turned out to be even worse. Generally, in this American movie, you get a great clue or no clue. I want little clues that lead you to the killer. The public is not involved. And now, when I do not get any hint, you can expect a sweep at the end of the movie "He's the killer". And that's not all. ah ... It's hopeless, put an end to that ... <br /> <br /> In one word: disgusting .. <br /> <br />
