I did not have the opportunity to see the previous movie, but from what I read in other articles, it was supposed to be worse than this one, although I doubt it is possible. I am a big fan of the "Zombie" genre and I am fascinated by the psychological aspects of observing creatures, which are for all practical purposes human, like an atrocity that deserves only to be filmed in the head. That said, HOTD 2 carries the movie "Zombie" to its lowest level. <br /> <br /> Without giving big spoilers (which I really should do, so you do not waste your time watching this movie.) I would like to express my total disregard for the way the writers of this film describe the special forces of our countries. Gomer Pile would probably have survived longer than the soldiers of the "Spec Ops" in this movie. For shouting aloud, they should have called them special education forces instead. If you write a scenario in which you send an elite team to deal with a zombie outbreak, at least ask the soldiers to be smarter than the walking corpses. I understand that you have to kill some or most of the team, but you can find a better way to do that than to let them put their machine guns and walk to put a soft hand on the crazy man's shoulder. turning around. in the corner of the dark, terrifying basement. <br /> <br /> Writers are trying to move the zombie to the forefront of technology by making it a virus for which they seek a vaccine, and the idea has merit, if it was not stuck at middle of such a ridiculous display of capricious film production. I mean, come on, zombie movies are not really "great art", and the viewer expects tasteless head-to-head sensations with gore and chills, but HOTD 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the canal with disgust. and fear of the sheer stupidity of the characters. If you're a fan of zombie movies like me, do yourself a favor and stay away from it.
