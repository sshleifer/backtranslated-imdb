Ok, where to start. I can not believe how many good reviews I have read here. I watched this (year 2004) and I had to fight not to press the stop button, I decided to continue just because of all the good reviews I had read. After watching it, I felt it was my job to inform the world about it. First of all, the film never seems to start, the plot only happens about 30 minutes before the end of the film, leaving the viewer wondering: "when will it start," never call this is a "revenge movie" because revenge does not even begin until more than half of the movie has already passed. In addition, the film tries to make you believe that this is a post-apocalyptic Australia. I'm sorry if showing half of the movie on dusty rural roads and a twisted letter on a sign did not really convince me, even in 1979 it was not science fiction. So anyway, add this above a randomly placed homoerotic subtext and you'll have yourself a shitty movie (I do not have anything against gays, it just did not need it ). The only good thing was the first hunting scene, good staging since 1979, and another good thing is the way he killed the last one. So, basically, I recommend watching the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes and you'll have a lot more fun than if you were sitting in the middle of everything in the middle, which could cause you to slit your throats. eyes. Do not say I did not warn you.
