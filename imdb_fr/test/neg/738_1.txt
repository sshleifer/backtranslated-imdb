It's hard for a Northanger Abbey novel lover to watch this BBC adaptation and not project objects onto the television screen. In fact, if Jane Austen saw it herself, she would be a little amused and eventually sidelined. Maggie Wadey's adaptation turned Northanger Abbey into a satire of her gothic romance (and Gothic novel readers). <br /> <br /> The role of Catherine Morland in the adaptation is described quite closely by Catherine d'Austen, an open character - a generous and generous girl whose imagination simply flees with her. But Henry Tilney's novel is not a Gothic novel hero who takes tobacco, handles sugar cane, and makes a sandy line. He's a tease, an almost handsome man with a messy, living room (that's right, Henry Tilney is an ecclesiastic, a charm that's completely removed from the script). Some of the best romance scenes, when Henry, completely impassive, outrageously teases Catherine over her literal mind on diction, the newspapers, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc., are not described in the adaptation. Much of Henry's personality is lost when these scenes are not adapted. Also, Peter Firth's appearance is not accurate - Henry Tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25, black hair and brown skin, not 35 or 40 and a blonde. <br /> <br /> There are so many other absurdities in the adaptation that invite surprise and disgust: who is the Marquise and what does she do in the story ?! Why is John Thorpe less a dunce and more than an intriguer? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? Catherine of the novel, with her romantic visions, awaits hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to discover that Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable, modern home, another element of satire! Why depict General Tilney as drunk? Why does Catherine have these strange visions of Mrs. Allen putting on her finger, etc.? Catherine's imagination leaves her only with Northanger, with Henry to gently correct it. Finally, why have so many facts about the Tilney family and Mrs. Tilney's death been changed unnecessarily? To make the story more horrible? All these quirks and more simply are too strange to be neglected. <br /> <br />>
