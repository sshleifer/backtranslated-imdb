I love the work of Stephen Kings and the book was excellent, but I was very disappointed when I bought this movie on DVD. It was one of the worst B movies I have ever seen. It looks like they had a tight schedule and they only took one shot per scene, even if it turned out to be bad. Where did they find the actors?
