I do not see how commentators could consider this a decent Westerner. Or how a commentator said that the plot was more cohesive than most. Nothing could be so far from the truth! This film is a huge non-sequestrant! It's an affront to the noble Western movies of the 30s in the West. I've seen a lot of Wayne's first Westerns, Lone Star and Republic, and this is easily the worst. <br /> <br /> The villain is known as The Shadow - for shouting loud! Initially, The Shadow's project is to keep the diligences open. At the same time, his band grazes all the cattle on the territory. Then they decide to switch to bank robbery. To do this, they must aim the city with a machine gun - no explanation of the need or the way he had this little toy! <br /> <br /> No plan is revealed with enough detail to suggest a plot here. The Shadow is obviously just a generally bad guy with all kinds of generally devilish ploys. <br /> <br /> He transmits his instructions to his gang through a fake secure wall. (Toc-toc, who's there?) He's apparently clairvoyant, because every time his henchmen need to talk to him, they knock on the wall, the safe opens and - PRESTO - he's there. (I can only imagine that he met them face to face and he said, "I have some secret and harmful instructions to give you about our next evil act - find me on the wall and I will give them to you. ") The reason the Shadow needs the safe to communicate with its outlaw army is never explained, like most elements of this mess. <br /> <br /> He has a nice tunnel to the old hollow trench across the street from which point of view, many of his villains carry out assassinations.He also has a hidden sign NOT in his secret lair behind the fake safe, but in the main room. <br /> <br /> When he's not behind the safe, he stays in his ranch without a cow and pretends to be a rancher. murdered the real owners of the ranch - two brothers - and assumed the identity. died recently arrived in New York in the 1930s (judging by her wardrobe) and she apparently never met her real uncle, because he fooled her too! <br /> <br /> If you thought that the bad guys always wore black hats and good white hats, you should see this movie. Here, the Gentiles give up their hat in favor of a white band that gives the impression that they were all wounded in the head before shots are fired! It's like an improvised basketball game - only Wayne asks them to tie their bandannas around their heads instead of just taking off their shirts. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the strangest of all is the end. Immediately after mastering Shadow and his gang, we jump far enough into the future to see Wayne and his wife (the niece before) on the porch of their home. (No matter how little romance there was.) Over there, Yak plays with Wayne's 3 or 4-year-old son, dressed in injunous attire! (Hiyoo, skookum fun!) <br /> <br /> No, thanks to this nonsense, Wayne has become a legend on the screen. Only a super star (packer or not!) Could overcome this entry in a movie resume. Long live the duke!
