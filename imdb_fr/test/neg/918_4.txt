This experimental silent film, produced in Switzerland by an independent British production company, is mainly considered as Paul Robeson's first film. It's very artistic, with plans that often seem meaningless for the story, which is difficult to understand anyway because of the lack of sufficient inter-titles. From what I understand, Robeson's wife, Adah, is in a story of interracial love with a white man named Thorne. It does not bother the owner of the bar / hotel where Thorne drinks the cigar (and she seems to have a lesbian relationship with a waitress), but an old lady expresses the point of view of the city in an inter-headline: "Si I could get by, we would not let the Negroes here. "Thorne is also called" Negro lover "by someone in the bar. Adah attempts a reconciliation with Pete (Robeson), but eventually leaves him. Astrid, Thorne's wife, goes to the bottom of the water, brandishes a knife, cuts Thorne's arm and cheek, and dies in one way or another. Thorne had to be charged with murder because we learn he was acquitted. As for Pete, he receives a letter from the mayor telling him that it is better for everyone to leave the city. So the film speaks more of racism than anything else, but on a positive note, the owner says to Pete, "What's sad is that they think they're right, that's who we are. " The meaning of the title is a mystery. This may refer to the fact that Adah has fair skin (a marginal nigger) or the limiting behavior of the main characters.
