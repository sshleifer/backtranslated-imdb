Although inevitably linked to the 1970s, the concept of "exploitation cinema" is almost as old as the cinema itself. In addition, Universal Studios has virtually coined the term with its cycles of long-lived monsters Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and The Mummy. At least all the original classics have spawned some sequels and, after a while, they even had the idea to make a real monster stew! "House of Frankenstein", released a year earlier and also directed by Erle C. Kenton, has been a success, with interesting ideas and enthusiastic performances, but "House of Dracula" is a bit too wacky for me to recommend . The plot suffers too much extremely irritating "irritating" situations, contortions and forced dialogues and ?? mostly ?? an execution time much too short to elaborate the personalities of the monsters as they deserve. Onslow Stevens does not receive the honors, but plays the most fundamental role as a miracle: a doctor whose mission is to heal Count Dracula (Carradine) of his thirst for uncontrollable blood and to repair Lawrence Talbot's illness. turns into a hairy wolfman when the moon is full. During a nocturnal walk in some caves, they also pick up the remains of Frankenstein's monster and the good doctor himself finally undergoes a Jekyll / Hyde metamorphosis due to a bad blood transfusion. The last invitation to the messy party is a female hunchback (but not Notre Dame). Something is not right at all when you watch a movie that is literally full of horror icons, but the only character in the movie that can make you flipper is an ordinary villager named Siegfried. The current monsters are drab and their funds, once fabulous, are completely drained. Count Dracula is a whining romantist, Talbot is a pitiful and whining old martyr and the creation of Frankenstein ?? Well, his part in the plot does not even deserve to be mentioned. This Universal film is sorely lacking in atmospheric decors and nifty photographs, especially in relation to all their efforts, and the brutal climax is a disaster.
