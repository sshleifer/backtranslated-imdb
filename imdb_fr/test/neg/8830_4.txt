It is a good plan for a study of corporate power and dichotomism between the required public life and the need for privacy. Company Chief Burl Ives asked Robert Taylor to replace him as a substitute son. He sends her to England to negotiate an agreement, where Taylor is surprised by the ethics and morality of the men with whom he deals and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he works there. He comes back helpless after doing his duty but after telling the truth to the English about his motives. He tries to marry the refugee rather than the niece of his boss and thus begins an attempt by Ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive. It could have been more grumpy, meaner and less romantic - the time spent in romance diverts the film from what he's trying to argue about business ethics. <br /> <br /> One way or another, the costume has been nominated. ) for an Oscar - all the costumes and the two women in the film dress conservatively - the studio politics at work again, no doubt. <br /> <br /> What is striking, however, is the CinemaScope cinema in black and white which is excellent - it deserved the name Oscar. (It was the first film "Scope" in black and white of MGM). <br /> <br /> Not as good as it could have been but not so good either.
