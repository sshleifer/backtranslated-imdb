I'm not one of those who regret every time a movie based on an old TV show comes out. Instead, I used to go out and see him (if I had watched the series) and try to become nostalgic. But if someone wants to shoot movies based on old series, this is Exhibit A (so you can really say something other than "McHale's Navy"). "Mod Squad" is sad, tiring and lethargic. At least the original series was distressed long before anyone realized that teenagers could be so bad, which made it revolutionary. It's just tedious. Claire Danes is nice to watch, but does nothing but change mood and sneak around to spy on the bad guys. The role played by Giovanni Ribisi in this film is that Droopy the Dog looks for an hour and forty five minutes. And Omar Epps seems to want to flee the scene, but the scenario's chlostraphobia has trapped him. Of course, the production is pleasant, with the action sequence of opening the nightclub "rave", apparently mandatory, and shootings galore. Oh, and the children scream and annoy each other and their superiors. It's as if you decide to use the mysterious Scooby Doo machine to go on a Hollywood family vacation with your teenage children whom you and your spouse need intensive treatment and medication. I really wanted to love this movie, and there were promising moments, but the next scene was going to delight my life. You can hit another remake of Spelling, "Charlie's Angels", whatever you want, but at least this movie knew he wanted to have fun with himself. "The Mod Squad" makes you wonder where did the inspiration of the original series go.
