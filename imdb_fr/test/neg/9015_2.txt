Another winner of this era of the 50s-60s that I love so much for the comic value they give to each viewing these days .Corman never drops you with these movies, they take themselves seriously and they have a very low budget, a recipe to look good. for sure . Ed Nelson, a very competent actor, has started with Corman and many other favorites who are appearing in Superman and many westerns of the day. The costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien talking, well the reverb was a bit off but that's the beauty of it. Make the film for love, do not seek perfection, but dig the action, it goes through. These movies are a moment of pleasure! Even better is the MST3K version !!
