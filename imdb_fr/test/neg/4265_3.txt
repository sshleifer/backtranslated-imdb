There is nothing wrong with showing an old man who falls in love with a girl. Lolita did it. American Beauty did it. <br /> <br /> But. They did it subtly. From the beginning, they did not clearly indicate that the director was preparing them to fall in love. Not as naturally as two people (Age no bar) would do it, but force them to rub shoulders as if they were FUCKED to fall in love. <br /> <br /> In total, there should have been chemistry. That would have solved the biggest problem. People with reservations against the subject would also have been absorbed and perhaps convinced. It would have become the perfect love story, no matter how impractical. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time believing Jia's character at times. What I found more difficult to understand is why Vijay - a photographer and a seemingly serious artist - was interested in such a frivolous girl. Unless he himself has some frivolity hidden in himself, which is not released at all. <br /> <br /> It is very common to use Dutch angles or angles in which the frame is tilted. It is usually used to show something unnatural or something that could lead to something wrong. So, RGV calls itself this unnatural relationship. <br /> <br /> The angle of the camera, the background score, the editing and even the juxtaposition of shots and the symbology accentuate and accentuate their relationship. Is the Indian public so stupid that we have to understand something in 10 different ways for us to understand? Especially when they were dancing together ... it was obvious what was happening. What was the need to slow down the scene with dramatic background music? I think the subject was very well chosen. But Verma should not have made the film, always keeping in mind that this is a controversial subject. If so, handle it gently, why not you?
