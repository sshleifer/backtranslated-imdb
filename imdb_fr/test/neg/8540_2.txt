Good old Jess Franco! The choice of director always reliable in case you were looking for the joker, unscrupulous exploitation and 200% free. Once again, Jess has really outdone herself with this "adventure" in the jungle. Let's face it, this film is just a pretext to make sure that the beautiful actress Katja Bienert (and minor ??) scrolls around her bare breasts. It's actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk naked in front of a film crew, especially in front of the blinding gaze of pervert Franco! And it was not even the first time, since the duo had already done "Linda" together. Anyway, just in case you're wondering: YES, "Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro" has a plot, even if he's very foolish. In the first few sequences, a plane carrying a wealthy Scottish man and a girl crashes into the middle of an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian, because never at a given moment of the film, we did not even try to consume human flesh. Scottish Scots declare themselves a great white leader and the girl grows up to become the beautiful white goddess barely dressed. Several years later, an expedition arrives in the middle of the jungle to bring the girl back to civilization and ?? more importantly - steal some of the legendary diamonds from the tribe. It could have been a captivating and action-packed adventure movie, but Jess Franco obviously could not be bothered. Why shoot jungle chase sequences or cannibalistic rites while you can just as easily point your camera at a hot girl naked in a tree? Most jungle scenes simply seem to have been filmed in someone's garden and there is a huge amount of clumsily edited footage on National Geographic to fill gaps in continuity. The back of the DVD describes "Kilimanjaro Diamonds" as an ingenious, feminist and adult-oriented version of Tarzan. Yes, yes, they just put this sentence there because the character of Katja Bienert rocks from one tree to another using a few times.
