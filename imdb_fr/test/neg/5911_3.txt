Just read the other reviews here and be a little surprised to find that no one has yet said anything about the acting game or the plot. <br /> <br /> Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy can both deliver an extraordinary comedy show. . Great actors that they are not. Enough of that. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot? Oh man. Whenever the movie tries to "trick you" into believing that the good guys are going to lose, you know these scenes: "What's the good guys losing? Oh, I see, it was just a ride", it's is so bad, you can spot it a mile away. <br /> <br /> He had 2 or 3 fun moments, but not enough to save the day. <br /> <br /> It's a bit ridiculous that these comments have to be 10 lines now. Many people will fill it with shit, to make it eligible. To be brief is an art.
