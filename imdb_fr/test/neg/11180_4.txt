There are so few movies whose title tells you everything you need to know about the movie. Such a movie is that I was a Communist for the FBI. Another example would be I got married with a monster from outer space. <br /> <br /> What is really interesting about this film is how, in the name of God, was it nominated for an Oscar in the documentary category? It's not a documentary in the strict sense of the term, it's not even in this hybrid category of docudrama. It is a rather exploitative film about the work of an undercover FBI agent, Matt Cvetic, who infiltrated the Communist Party in Pittsburgh and actively tried to retake the United Steelworkers for the Communists and report on those activities. to his FBI staff. <br /> <br /> A documentary about this work could have been interesting, but we got a film adapted to paranoia. I found it fascinating that when Cvetic finally broke his cover, it was before the committee of anti-American activities in the House rather than the New York trial of Communist Party leaders. There was a moment in the film when Communist leader James Millican told his supporters to start spreading the word that the House Un American Activities committee was made up of a group of right-wing yahoos who were trying to make it happen. know. Now, what could have given him this idea? Anyway, just connect the points and the word probably comes from J. Edgar Hoover, who tries to give some credibility to HUAC by ensuring that an effective infiltrator is made public instead of a trial. The cross-examination was not interesting. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers, producer of I Was A Communist For The FBI, later produced Big Jim McLain featuring John Wayne about an HUAC investigator in Hawaii. HUAC acknowledged the work done by the Honolulu PD to dismantle a network of Communist spies among the dockers. But at least in John Wayne's movie, no one claimed it was a documentary. <br /> <br /> Frank Lovejoy plays the lead role in Cvetic and his FBI managers are Richard Webb and Philip Carey. Dorothy Hart plays a school teacher in Pittsburgh who says there are about thirty people like this in this school system who indoctrinate young people, among whom is Ron Hagerthy, the son of Lovejoy. She changed her mind about the Communists and Lovejoy must save her from a homicidal fate planned by her superiors. Ironically, Hart left the cinema and went to work for all places, the United Nations which, as we know, was often accused of being a communist nest in the United States. <br /> <br /> More than half a century later, we really have very few objective works on film or printed on the Communist Party of the United States. They were actually a very active group in the labor movement. The real heroes who stopped them were union organizers such as Walter Reuther at the UAW or David Dubinsky at the ILGWU. But since they were leftists, they simply do not have the right to be an appropriate propaganda material. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was a Communist for the FBI, it's an exploitation work based on real life. character and a testimony of these paranoid times.
