I really feel bad for the criticism of this film because I wish I had seen it only as a conceptual production. The Covenant seemed to have been a truly original piece, but unfortunately they are losing the great idea of ​​on-screen translation. <br /> <br /> The story follows four (five) teenagers who are the descendants of the families. who started the city of Ipswitch from the survivors of the Salem witch trials. They are also part of the secret sect called "The Covenant". Their power must be used sparingly because it drains their life force in small quantities and creates a strong dependence. In theory, it would make a very good sci-fi action movie, or at least an interesting teen movie. <br /> <br /> But there were too many dazzling falls that did not allow this film to achieve its goals. full potential. This action game was not good, the soundtrack was mediocre and we found a lot of useless synchronization issues. Of course, the biggest problem is the bad editing work. The film has little or no coherent flow and makes a fight to keep a mental chronology or a feeling of rhythm. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments, but overall was a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> A sorcerer 4/10
