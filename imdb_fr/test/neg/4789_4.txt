I agree with the comments regarding the downward rotation. The last shows have been a little better, but the writers surely need more direction. I think the characters are always interesting, even if sometimes they turn a little too much in the "white basket". Subtlety and nuance go a long way on shows like "Office". I think the target audience is a bit similar since they are both the same night and the same evening. One might think that karma and the whole Eastern religion is a sufficiently important subject to bring different and interesting broadcasts, but they only scratch the surface. In my opinion, this shows the disdain that many people in Hollywood have with regard to the intelligence level of the masses. We can handle more intoxicating content. This has already been proven in many other shows.
