Oh yes, I admit that I was guilty of the crime of seeing this waste. I can not say that extraterrestrials forced my head, tied me to a chair and prevented me from closing my eyes. I then shot this terrible excuse for a movie. No, I did it with free will. I deliberately tortured myself. Let's review the fact here people. - The acting is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous. - The development of the characters is appalling. - The characters that appear in the movie are so clich√© that you would recognize them in your average comic book. - Editing is sloppy and unimaginative. - The work of the camera is discreet. - The dialogue is simply the worst of the cinematographic history. - The staging: well, I bet it's not Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> Then, to add to these facts, there was absolutely no talent involved. The director must now split himself to forgive himself for having inflicted this poison on the world. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Passport to Paris is one of the worst films ever made. PERMANENT!
