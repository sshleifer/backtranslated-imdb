Who really wants to see that? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for so long. I do not want to, but I have always stayed true to my philosophy of watching a film as bad as it can be. It was the most difficult (just after "next Friday"). <br /> <br /> It's basically just shit. How can you possibly call that something else? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for Gore and T & A. Yeah, yeah, "Hey, that's realistic, they've been like this." Well, but why bother us with that? I do not care if it's been like this (and there are many scenes where I really doubt it). The fact is, why would anyone want to see him? The problem is that there is only one reason why you would like the film: it is that you like violence. There is nothing special about it, just cruelty. You can say "Cool!" as you say in Splatter-Slasher-Movie. But horror movies with at least violence can give you chills and excitement, maybe characters that matter to you. But here everything is dark, dull and boring. Each character is crazy. "The story of an emperor who can not manage his power". What? In the very first scene, he runs naked in the woods with his sister! I have no problem saying that we saw a madman for two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> But maybe you're excited about seeing Helen Mirren, being pregnant and dancing. Or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the message of the movie. Or castration, yes, it was fun! Real scenes of birth, what hilarious! Humans, animals, we do not care, just treat them like toys. <br /> <br /> I do not care what anyone says, it's not a movie, it's just 2 1/2 hours of blood and sex, degrading and disgusting. Go watch a porn movie if you want sex or watch a horror movie if you want violence. At least, these films do not claim to be an artistic masterpiece. And they are shorter. <br /> <br /> [0/10] [6 (1+ - 6-)] [0/4]
