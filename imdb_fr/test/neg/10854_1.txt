Well, I went to a British university, actually, I went to that same movie, and it was nothing like that. It's a horrible film, badly done and badly played. The worst is that it could have been really good, if they bothered to spend more than 12 pence, in fact, if she really wanted to represent real British students, she should instead act as such and get a loan from 15,000 books. It says nothing of life in Uni, where was the dive in the bush, the tea drunk until 4am, the endless discussions on group dynamics ??? Where was diversity and pleasure? Maybe I'm just romantic, but I do not remember Fresher's week having been so terrible, and I'm shy. And in the end, the question remains: a bed or a wardrobe?
