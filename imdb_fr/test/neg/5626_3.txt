Let Freedom Ring was probably designed with the best intentions in the world, but it sends a curious mixed message into the final product. <br /> <br /> The inhabitants of a western city where the railway passes are submerged by the arrival. immigrant railwaymen, working on the railroad financed by the robber Edward Arnold. There are some ranchers and farmers whose lands are on the way to the railroad and these people are treated summarily by the men hired from Arnold. A man who does not want to give in is Lionel Barrymore whose son returns home from Harvard, lawyer and ready to defend the cause of the breeder. <br /> <br /> Only Nelson Eddy decides that the best way to fight is to go to Zorro on the bad guys. But apart from Charles Butterworth, no one knows he's the Wasp (a very interesting choice of names by the way). <br /> <br /> What Arnold did is used the proven methods of political leaders in the East, which compel immigrants to vote. Nelson's idea is simple: if the immigrants knew only the truth about what Arnold was, they would vote with the original settlers and stun the urban extra-terrestrial machine that was in their midst. He kidnaps editor Raymond Walburn and takes him with the press to a mountain cave where subversive newspapers are printed and distributed. <br /> <br /> Railroaders are a real group of immigrants, and not the Irishman who works in the west the Chinese work in the East as history has it. It's a real UN working on Arnold's railroad. Victor McLaglen retains control over the workers and Nelson has the unenviable task of convincing him, as did John Wayne in The Quiet Man. <br /> <br /> Of all the movies with Jeanette and Nelson Duo, this is certainly the worst of what they did at the MGM. Nelson is about to be hanged with Barrymore for crimes that are at best indefinite, but certainly do not deserve to be hanged. And Virginia Bruce who plays Nelson's girlfriend saves the day with an interpretation of My Country Tis of Thee with which immigrants join. Faced with the revolt of his paid voters for immigrant voters, Arnold packs his bags fairly rationally and leaves the city to build his railroad elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I do not ask you, it's the end here. What's the message, vote with the settlers and lose your jobs with Arnold? But anyway, you'll get out here? <br /> <br /> I wonder sometimes if 20 years after the incidents of this film take place and that the city settles in a lost corner of the west while some cities where the railway has crossed are became cities, that the good citizens of this city did not rethink what Nelson Eddy did. If they did, they would probably run him on a rail. <br /> <br /> Nelson is of course very enthusiastic and offers various concerts and popular songs to sing, including a ballad to immigrants written by Sigmund Romberg. Where else but here? The song is a sincere tribute to an immigrant who has done well in his adopted country. Too bad there was no better room. <br /> <br /> The almost platinum blonde Virginia Bruce is nicknamed here. And I'm sure Jeanette MacDonald was just as happy that she did not accompany Nelson on his trip west.
