Four things intrigued me about this movie - first, it features Carly Pope (of the "Popular" fame), which is always a pleasure to watch. Secdonly, she starred brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Thirdly, it is filmed in association with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourth, a friend recommended it to me. However, I was totally disappointed. The whole story is absurd and complicated, with very little resolution. Pope's role is fine, but Owen is unfortunately underutilized. The other actors and actresses are fine, but I do not know them all. Aside from the beautiful riddles that punctuate throughout the film (as well as Pope and Owen), this film is not very good. The moral of the story is ... do not look at it unless you really want it.
