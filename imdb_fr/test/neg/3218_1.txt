What's wrong with all these ethnic criminal groups copying movies about the Italian Mafia? We all know the godfather as in Don Vito Corleone, we now have this one Mexican which is only a hijacked copy. I do not see why other ethnic groups should imitate and imitate Italian gangsters, but that makes them really ridiculous. They seem to be Italian Wanabee. I would much rather see the Mexicans interpret their own ideas and enjoy seeing their own culture and way of doing things, instead of copying the ideas from The Godfather trilogy. Apart from that, the film was disappointing, to see Mexicans playing and trying to be Italians is not my thing. After watching this, I will now look at the "real" godfather so that this movie can be erased from my memory.
