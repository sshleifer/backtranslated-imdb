First, let me emphasize that I am not a big supporter of the politically correct. In fact, I like satire or black humor, even if it disturbs minorities. The reason I'm pretty sure that this racist job is not worth watching is that it does not make fun of minorities to show their living conditions, their social situation or how they are. processed by the company. In addition, he uses all stupid stereotypes and prejudices to reinforce feelings and xenophobic reservations. It's a shame, but not surprising, that other reviews do not understand this point because we all had a cheap laugh. Congratulations.
