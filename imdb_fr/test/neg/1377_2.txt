Carlos may not be the most original comic book, but the first series was amusing, his frank comments and comments were recent. I missed a few seasons, but after all the allegations of hardware theft, I caught some episodes of Mind of Mencia at the end of July 2007. A change that changes, I see! Carlos likes toilet humor and sexual jokes much more than racial observations. In one episode, he somehow hinted that he was in the same league as Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. I do not think so. Maybe Comedy Central will give him one more season, but the episodes I saw seemed tired and the same with more buzz words than the Osbournes. Carlos, come back to the stand for a few years, get some fresh material and try again.
