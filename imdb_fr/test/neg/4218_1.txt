... but not that one! I always wanted to know "what happened" next. We will never know for sure what happened because GWTW was Margaret's baby. I am a long time fan of Gone With the Wind and I could not have been more repelled by the movie. I compared "Scarlett" to the original GWTW because any movie worthy of following GWTW had to be of the same level of quality as the first one. Rhett has been beautifully portrayed, but no one will ever be comparable to Mr. Gable. I am also a fan of Vivien Leigh !! She was Scarlett. She did the trick. Not another actress in this life or another will ever wear the same shoes, but with "Scarlett", the work could have been done better. There was not enough thought to find the right Scarlett, it was obvious. <br /> <br /> All in all, you have to watch, but if you want to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, I suggest writing it yourself or finding a fan. fiction. This film is not worth the time.
