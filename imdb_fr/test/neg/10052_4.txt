It's a family film that was broadcast on my local ITV channel at 1am a few days ago. This might be a strange decision on the part of the planners, but THE REAL HOWARD SPITZ is a rather strange film, strange in the way he does not want to disturb his audience. Come on, there's nothing more adorable for kids than sadism and that's why Roald Dahl was such a popular author for kids. This also explains why DOCTOR WHO has been so successful around the world. In this scenario, you crave for the creator of the pulp fiction to do something naughty for the kids, but that does not happen. I do not advocate child abuse, but see Howard Spitz lose his rag because the little ones would have improved the film. Can you imagine how much KINDERGARTEN COP would have been worse if the producers had gone completely to the PC? I mean, if you make a child-centered film that hates kids, should not the story be told and not told? <br /> <br /> A big part of the problem lies with director Vadim Jean and you get the impression that he does not know how to handle the material, which is bad news for the film. As someone has noted before, the soundtrack is random and Kelsey Grammar is very wooden. I imagine he was trying to play the role of "dead pan", just like in the series for which he is famous, but that does not work here and there are many scenes with silent and ridiculous camera angles that seem unintentional but distracting a lot. But in the end, the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the public's sensitivity.
