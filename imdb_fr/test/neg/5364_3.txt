I'm a fan of the paranormal and I love Ghost Hunters, so when this show came out, I decided to try it. I could hardly sit down during an episode. The show is so obviously staged. Finally, each episode involves a demonic possession or force trying to kill the family. Another important flaw is that these guys never demystify anything. When I look at the Ghost Hunters, they find evidence and try to refute it. If they can not, they are. In this show, they find a voice or video evidence and they call it very quickly as a ghost. This completely ruins their credibility, unlike TAPS and Ghost Hunters who really know what they are doing. Honestly, if you're interested in the paranormal and want to watch a show about it, watch Ghost Hunters.
