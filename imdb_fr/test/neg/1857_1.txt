When I say worse, I mean less entertaining. Todd Sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera tricks since the last Zombie bloodbath, making the movie even less tolerable. In the last movie, there were no special effects for the camera. In this one, we are treated with a shaky camera and a constant switching in black and white. In addition, it's called Zombie Bloodbath, despite the fact that zombies are barely in this one. The film begins in 1945, where some Satanists kill a violent burglar and place him as a scarecrow. In modern times, some children have a car problem and go to a house, the same as the one in which the Satanist murder occurred. Some villains try to rape the children (or something), and they bring the scarecrow burglar back to life, who comes back with zombies and now speaks like Darth Vader. Mr. Sheets has amplified the language and mitigated the violence. If you want to see what a bad movie is, look at this! <br /> <br /> My note: BOMB / ****. 96 minutes Not noted, contains violence and language.
