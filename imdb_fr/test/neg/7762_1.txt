Week after week, these women simply sweep all the men. Get real. None of these women are "Knockouts". Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) seems to be the kind of woman that men would find at !: 45 hours before the bar closes after their vision and standards were evenly hindered by ten or eleven martinis. Yet, it's the queen of bees, a killer of super sexy men. The other three are not doing much better. And their constant voiceless comments ... not to mention the fact that they jump into bed with unknown men and never catch the disease. This show is pathetic and scary. I do not think a man would be terribly attracted to any of these women, even though he had blown Viagra like a Tic Tac while on shore leave.
