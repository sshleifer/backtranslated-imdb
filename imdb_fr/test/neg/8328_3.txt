"Tragic Hero" is a film that most certainly tries to imitate Godfather's classic films, with a focus on family, crime, loyalty and revenge. In addition, this is part of a two part series as The Godfather was also (at the time). However, this film is far from comparable to that of these classic films and is even worse than other Triad thrillers released in Hong Kong at that time. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons is the acting game. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, acting is usually excessive and amazing. The public tends to find the humorous process simply because the actors can not maintain a sufficient degree of gravity. As a result, we find that the film is not really emotionally or emotionally intense, because we do not really care what happens with these characters. <br /> <br /> Another reason is his lack of concentration. The narrative attempts to incorporate many different narrative elements into the film, but as a result some parts of the film become underdeveloped and lack any real sense of coherence. The audience sometimes gets lost in the debates we are watching, not knowing what the motivations of the character are. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film contains an honest fight, but again, we do not care about the characters, we do not care about who lives or who dies; The scene loses its intensity and suspense because of that. The other script pieces are rather mundane, with the feeling that they are too controlled rather than flowing freely. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a strictly average film and is not recommended for the film in general. Spectator ... Only genre devotees and Chow Yun Fat fans should consider watching this movie.
