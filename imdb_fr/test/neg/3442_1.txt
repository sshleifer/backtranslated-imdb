Tim Taylor is an abusive acholoic addict. He is a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming quality as an actor or person. "Galaxy Quest" is the only movie he plays with. Only because his character - an overflowing actor from an old successful television series - was so close to real life. The rest of the cast is just as bad. I hate the mother and the actress who played Patricia Richardson, she fears! There are always cliches, the stupid, fat woman, who loves opera and cares only about her children, while in real life she proclaims family values ​​and divorce after having twins. And the children actors were about as interesting as a root canal.
