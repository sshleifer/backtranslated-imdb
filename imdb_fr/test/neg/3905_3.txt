Hypothetical situations abound, the director of the time, Harry Ralston, gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse with the dead world, left in the streets, in the shops and in the landscape, without being in the middle of a desert forget it. One survivor, trying to restore his sanity, takes food from the city in his bungalow in this desert. All alone, he hopes more, but without anyone around him, he finds himself with white underwear and a passion for a local Indian tribe ?? until the discovery of a camera that opens new doors and breaks the barriers of human coexistence. Alan, a man of the book, remains on Earth after an unknown disaster. Thinking that he is alone, he begins to live life in his own way ?? until, Jeri Ryan, appears (as she would in any dream) out of the woods, disheveled and unhappy to find the last living man to ... be ... well ... like Alan. Anyway, they try to coexist, fail, get drunk and, before creating the ultimate dystopia, they come up against Redneck Raphael (played by the newcomer - Dan Montgomery Jr). The bonds are torn apart, confusion sets in, a couple becomes a third wheel and the battle between the physically incompetent nerd and the brainless jock. Even if there is no one left on the planet, it becomes true that even the darkest nature of human nature will emerge. <br /> <br /> Using a variable film technique, Ralston gives us a mediocre story vaguely based on another film called "The Calm Earth" (which I will look at later) curiously, to which he never gives any credit . With a borrowed story, I suppose he's doing a decent job reinterpreting it. His punch seems to be lacking at first, as Ralston tries to find his rhythm, borrowing again from the techniques of other directors to try to find his own. He opens the film quite interestingly, but does not respond to any direct response. Of course, the last days have arrived, but could there be a concise answer on "how" or even better "why" have these few survived? A more frightening beginning would have led us more in a comic film. The juxtaposition would have looked like "Shawn of the Dead", but rather left us with the feeling of watching a show "made for television". Listening to the audio comment, I have respect for Ralston because he worked diligently to make this film and his passion almost sells him, but his interaction with the cast revealed that he was not so happy of his final. product. There were mistakes, errors he reported and others he was ashamed to report. Although this makes it possible to make a good independent film, it sometimes seems cheap and, in the case of Ralston, it was the latter. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that David Arnott's portrait of Alan by Arnarn seduced me. He played very well as a garou, a nerd at school, and an adult. He was both funny to watch and listen to, and he became sympathetic to the viewer. He played a key role in the cohesion of the film. Alas, I can not say as much for the rest. It was Dan Montgomery's first film, and it was obvious ?? I want to say ?? really very obvious. There were scenes in which I thought the landmark map was about to come out and read the lines for him, maybe even give us a more realistic performance, but alas, that was not the case. Then there was Jeri Ryan. She drew her character towards the end of the film, which was for me the culmination of the entire work of art. She goes from unknown stranger to crazy girlfriend and grumpy at the end. Confused? Once again, she fell into her character at the end, just giving us a glimpse of what she probably could have done as her game matured. Even as the commentary progressed, all she contributed was a moment of laughter, giggling, or "ohhh, look at that color." Even though her beauty can sell tickets, one can consider that the knowledge is just as beautiful. It was his first film, can I be too harsh? <br /> <br /> Overall, this film felt like something was missing. I thought the idea was strong ?? the premise that even with only a pepper of people remaining on Earth, the evil of human nature still exists. The bacteria or bombs can not kill jealousy (perhaps because it is consumed by zinc?) And we, as a race, will always want what we can not have. Ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are flawed and pre-used, but he knows how to make a low-budget comedy. I think our idea of ​​"funny" is different, so I did not laugh at all the songs he found "hysterical". His actors provided the necessary level of actors for this film, below average. His film was cowardly, meaning that there were elements never really explained or discussed (that is, something with wings survived?!?), Which generally detracted from the intensity of the film . It was a comedy, but it could have been a lot darker and a lot more funny. For those who think that Roger Avery was an important part of this film, as we learned from their comments, he was only there for money ?? it was essentially the bank of "The Last Man". Do not expect classic Avery moments. <br /> <br /> Do not expect more from Ralston ?? and that's how I will end. <br /> <br /> Grade: ** on *****
