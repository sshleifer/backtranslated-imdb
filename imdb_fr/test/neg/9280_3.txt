Third and last big screen derived from the very popular ITV sitcom of the early 1970s, HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES is just as resilient and rudimentary as the previous two attempts, and from a point of view three decades and a half later, Absolutely staggering that only one film was produced in this franchise. <br /> <br /> The intrigue is at the heart of the adventures of Stan Butler (Reg Varney), his conductor Jack (Bob Grant) and their autocratic and autocratic inspector Stephen Lewis) after being fired from their usual work at the bus depot. All found a similar job at a summer camp followed by Stan's family (Doris Hare, Anna Karen and Michael Robbins). <br /> <br /> The British cinema had a deserving and considerable reputation for quality in the 1960s, but that was largely due to US financial support and advice that ended unfortunately at the dawn of 1970s. Subsequently, notable titles from the region (GET CARTER being the very few exc has become as rare as Mick Jagger in a stable marriage, and British cinema has embarked on the path of cheap budgets , sordid and unintelligent sexual comedies (the CONFESSIONS series, COME PLAY WITH ME) and soft celluloid versions of various television shows, most sitcoms (which is one of the many ugly examples). Only DAD'S ARMY and PORRIDGE are doing quite respectfully in this respect, the unusual success of the first movie ON THE BUSES (the biggest box-office success of its year in 1971, absurd to think now!) led to two other suites. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the TV series itself had a gay, mature and non-PC vulgarity that was reasonably tolerable in the form of a half-hour sitcom It's ironic that HAMMER FILMS produced this effort, which resembles a horror movie in the literal sense of the term, with old word games, unfortunate clubbing and a horrible and dismal production. values. <br /> <br /> A chance to send the dairy The British holiday camp is totally lost, in favor of the above elements, and it is very strange, even horrible, to see Varney, fifty years , and Grant, the nose with the long toothed mouth, which instantly charms young people. women in their early twenties, while constantly laughing at their own bravado and lame jokes.The presence of Wilfrid Brambell (from STEPTOE AND SON) romanticizing Miss Hare does not help anything either, and even if the film lasts about a year Half an hour later, it is interminably depressing. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it was the last film of the most terrible cinematographic trilogy, and the TV series ended at about the same time, with a sequel (do not drink the water, which was flouted outright by critics and ignored by the public), followed in 1975. Most of the main actors involved were not seen much later, but the most affected was Bob Grant. other mental problems for many years, he committed suicide in 2003. A sad coda for a sitcom that was the most popular of his time (she did not get too old either), and should have stayed that way, rather than the three big screen hybrids with financial success but artistic despair that diluted the good memories and occasional merits of his televised counterpart. <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: 2 Â½ years out of 10.
