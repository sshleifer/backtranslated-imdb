Days of Heaven is one of the most painful and useless movies I have ever seen. I would not recommend it to anyone ... unless you're trying to get your kids to sleep or, God forbid, to aneurysm someone. If I could go back in time and do something, I would fire the reels before they're sent to the room. Why? The scenario of Days of Heaven is simple but extremely vague. A long, dialogue-free sequence makes up a large part of the film. The characters are too superficial and ridiculously stupid. The culmination of the story does not affect you: at that time, your brain worked so hard to understand the intrigue and the multitude of hidden metaphors that your ability to think left. The only things that work are your eyes and, sadly, your ears, who have to listen to the sound of Linda, the little girl in the story, who speaks like a man. I am now more stupid to have seen this movie. Do not let this happen to you.
