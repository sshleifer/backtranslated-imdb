The only quality that redeems this film is that it shows bands and their music when it was changing in New York in 1981. As for the film itself, it presents at least three major flaws. First of all, there is a narration throughout the film, which is absolutely not necessary. In the few places where explanations are needed, simply adding a small dialogue would have been very useful. Second, no obvious attempt to synchronize the audio has been highlighted. In fact, it is obvious that most of the dialogues were recorded later, without attempt of correspondence. The third flaw was in the end. I will not give an end to those brave souls who would suffer the torture of sitting through the movie, but it is a major sin in scriptwriting. It's not worth wasting time or money unless you're a fan of one of the groups represented.
