"The Thomas Crown Affair" is a terrible remake of a not-so-good movie, to be exchanged only for the topless shots of former supermodel Renee Russo. <br /> <br /> That's all. The conspiracy is insignificant, Pierce Brosnan telephoned in his role, and Dennis Leary (as usual) plays an annoying Irish cop, but I could not take my eyes off the beautiful Mrs. Russo. There is a good love scene on a staircase, an incredibly sexy ballroom dance, a barefoot beach scene and a roll in the bag. Oh, and a painting was stolen from a museum and a catamaran sank. <br /> <br /> But let's hope other filmmakers recognize Russo's fantastic attributes and give her other highly visible roles.
