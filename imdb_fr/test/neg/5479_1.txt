It could have been the best game of all time! But the game makers have ruined everything after 3 assassinations and the end! This is a combination of Prince Of Persia, Hitman, GTA and Age Of Empires II (Saladin). <br /> <br /> Yes, these four games mentioned above are considered one of the greatest games ever made. <fr /> <br /> You combine all four and you get this game !! He has all the good aspects of the four games such as acrobatic skills, stealth assassinations, the open world and HISTORY !! For the first 3 assassinations, you feel that this game is the best !! But after the third, things seem to become so repetitive that you only hope the game ends. <br /> <br /> I play on a PC and the PC version is horrible with stupid problems and side missions. are insane. <br /> <br /> MY advice to all. It's a good game, but get it for the XBOX360 or PS3. DO NOT get it for the PC. <br /> <br /> Finally, this game is a creation of the creators of Prince Of Persia. Surely the producer is hot, but the game is not hot and it's not better than the four games mentioned above !!
