Let me start by saying that I was looking forward to the release of this film for some time. After finally having the chance to see him last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a film that might look good on "Exorcist: The Beginning" last fall, but "Dominion" does just that. No, wait ... it looks like a BIG movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was too excited about this film and that contributed to the disappointment. After all, the idea that Warner Bros. was going to release two versions of what is essentially the same movie six months apart was an exciting attraction. In addition, I am a big fan of Stellan Skarsgard and, in fashion, it gives a superb performance, despite the often ridiculous content of the film. By cons, the cast of this film is catastrophic. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of a single expression - an empty look, and delivers all her lines with the same monotonous tone, while Gabrielle Mann's father Frances is just ridiculous. The effects of this film are, at best, laughable and the mere fact of losing all this is enough to deprive the film of any chance of being taken seriously. This film caused more muffled laughter than anything else, and with the exception of a really scary shot that lasted about three seconds and forced my friend to cover her eyes and moan, she neglected to offer what whether in the alarms department. I could go into more detail and possibly give some revelations, but frankly, I'm too tired of thinking how badly this movie was writing all that I would like to say. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing Part of the thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film have tried to give ... a story about a priest who lost his faith, then found her after agreeing to cope with her troubled past ... had tremendous potential, especially with Skarsgard as leader. Unfortunately for us, this potential has been wasted. Check out this movie only if you're really curious about how it differs from the Harlin version, but do not expect to see a good movie or you'll regret losing your money and two hours of your life. If not, just make the first published version and move on.
