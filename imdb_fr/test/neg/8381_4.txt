He undertakes to finish what he began many years ago by claiming souls to finally inherit the magical powers of the amulet for his own evil. to use ... <br /> <br /> Edited, co-produced and directed by Joe Knee, it's not a good movie and it's nice with it. Benjamin Oren's scenario, which seems to be taken very seriously, is a supernatural tale about a cult leader who returns from the dead to finish what he started a few years ago, because you would expect the character involved to now links to what happened All these years ago and it's as dull as it sounds. The characters are bland and forgetful, the dialogue is just as much, there is no horror nor exploitation strictly speaking, it's slow sometimes, it's predictable, it's cliche, it derails completely at the end and does not make much sense when you think about it. The story never seizes or engages you, it is never exciting or particularly interesting and I would have a hard time qualifying it as average. There are very few things here that allow me to recommend Cult. Do not bother with this one. <br /> <br /> The director Knee has no problem, but the film has a bland look shot on video for television. it's totally forgettable and flat. There is no fear, there is no atmosphere and there is no tension. There is no gore either, although there is a lot of blood splatter, but no special makeup gore scenes. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 950,000, Cult looks cheap, although it's not as badly done as some of the low-budget horror movies I've seen recently . The acting game does not even deserve to be mentioned. <br /> <br /> Cult is a mediocre film that brought me nothing. I could not call that an average. There are many better horror movies.
