I was able to watch this one without commercial interruption, and let me tell you that even for a TV movie, it was pretty predictable. The actors did a job worthy of what they had done, and the distribution was rather accomplished - Barry Bostwick, Jane Seymour, Frances Fisher, etc. However, the scenario was not only predictable (except for the last scene), but the dialogue serenely sounded like it came from a third-rate novel. Jane Seymour's psychotic monologues were laughable. I'm sorry, but I can not believe anyone with this goose bumps raises any suspicions. As bad as Therese Russell is in "Black Widow" - and she felt it - she had at least the sense of playing her pseudo characters a bit straight. Seymour is a much better actress but did not overcome the problem here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score is incredibly old-fashioned. It's almost a satire of its kind, like a fusion of Kenny G. A film with such a dull and derivative script really should have gone further.
