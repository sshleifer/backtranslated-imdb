On this site, I have often criticized the Americans for not being able to write comedy, BUT, while they never produced anything of the quality of "Fawlty Towers", "Blackadder" or "The fall and the uprising of Reginald Perrin ", to my knowledge, they have never done anything so bad: the nadir of British comedy. <br /> <br /> On my comic Richter scale, she is only behind the real execrable 'Are You Being Served This is the worst comedy series in the English language, with bad acting, annoying characters and a humor I had grown up before leaving primary school. Unfortunately, this was part of a big series of shows at the time, with "Daddy's Army", "It's not a hot half-mom" and "Allo, Allo" who relied on ridiculous situations and familiar slogans to keep the audience entertained. <br /> <br /> Michael Crawford later proved that he was a talented performer, but personally, I'd rather be sentenced to a month's monitoring of "Rhoda" than to endure a single episode of this drivel , which makes me ashamed to be British.
