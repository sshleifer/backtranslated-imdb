It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment ... so I just watched "The Doctor of Crime's Courage" all the way through. It is a mystery of murder with a typical cast of characters and two of the usual suspects, each with its own possible motive. The story begins abruptly and the viewer is immersed in the plot without any character development or narration of any kind. I guess it's not too surprising for a B movie from this period. There are also moments similar to that, that is, before the Second World War, but perhaps it is due to the writer's past in radio broadcasts. <br /> <br /> The "crime doctor" is the detective who is visiting California for his R & R from his East Coast psychiatric practice. He met a mystery novelist friend with whom he was involved for one or more previous mysteries. The novelist sometimes fulfills the role of teammate of our bloodhound (AKA Dr. Watson) and sometimes alleviates things with a little comic relief (somehow). <br /> <br /> but not quite the police captain who is upset that is sometimes annoyed by the inventive detective. And then there's the mysterious Braggas, a brother and sister who are dance artists in a disco. Dance is a kind of interpretative dance that happens to be one of those moments that is more like that of the 30s than 40s. Although the place of history is in California, the Braggas seem to live in a castle! <br /> <br /> An element of the plot has managed to entertain me a little, but I will not divulge anything more, because I have always appreciated the movies when the story is discovered, rather than be known in advance. (Although I can think of many, many B movies that would have a higher rating and it is hard to say that watching this one is a good time) I have not seen any other movie of the series "Crime Doctor" So, I can not make any comparison.
