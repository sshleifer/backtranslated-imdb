Everything that made the original so fun seems to be missing here. It is simply an "ordinary devil", but without the passion that animated the original. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in the story, it actually seems that they ignore the first altogether. Here, the demons are unleashed in a high-security building and, of course, kill most of the inhabitants in appalling ways. The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time. Although the actors are not really brilliant in Demons, in Demons 2, they are actually much worse. You do not care about these characters at all. The plot is non-existent, the music is mediocre (except for a song by Simon Boswell), it is not scary at all; it's just not so good. <br /> <br /> Easily the worst film in which participated Dario Argento and Lamberto Bava also (Bava has a cameo in this film, not very funny). <br /> <br /> Maybe 3 is too high, but at least I could look at everything and I did not have the idea to stop halfway. My advice; Stick to the original.
