Italians are undeniable masters in the questionable "art" of ripping off and imitating movies. What they do is adopt an innovative and profitable foreign concept, maintain the basic plot and simply add a lot of political action, discourse and inconvenience. But what to do when the original non-Italian film is already a notoriously well-known film and quite difficult to surpass in terms of slop and controversy? Well, then, I guess, you do not consider everything in terms of story building or style and you are totally focused on achieving something that is virtually a porn movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by the success of Richard Fleischer's "Mandingo" slavery saga, published a year earlier, but as the manufacturers were still too lazy to imagine another title, you should not expect anything looks like a narrative depth, character drawings, a disturbing atmosphere or inspiring statements about intercultural relations. "MandingA" is simply a sexual exploitation effort in which the plot only develops during the last ten minutes, in other words, when you have stopped worrying for a long time. The characters in this film are a gathering of ignoble bastards, which is of course to be expected when dealing with rich and obnoxious whites who operate a plantation in South America. The owner of the place, aged and extremely sordid, is a widower (who probably also won two awards "Mustache of the Year") who exploits and whips long slaves who work for him. Her mistress, who, if I understand correctly, is also her cousin (?), Is a real bitch woman who likes to cause disputes and sneaks out of the house overnight to copulate with crucified slaves. When the plantation owner's son returns from Europe after about 25 minutes of wasted travel time, the plot finally starts to grow slightly. The handsome young man had sex with the bitch several times (even in front of the slaves, supposedly to "show" how their masters do it ??), but he finally fell in love with the girl of the cherubic preacher. Her romantic preference obviously makes the bitch mad with anger and she plots a horribly cruel act of revenge that will forever change the life in the plantation. Hey ?? I just realized that this brief description of the plot suggests that "Mandinga" looks like an interesting movie! Well, it's not and I apologize if I raised someone's expectations. It's an incredibly boring and hideous movie to fight, but if you're interested in the themes, then take a look at the aforementioned "Mandingo". Much more than an unhealthy exploitation, this film is a truly insightful portrait of one of the darkest pages in the history of mankind. It was also a properly produced film, with real actors, good music and awesome shooting locations. "Mandinga" has nothing, absolutely nothing to offer.
