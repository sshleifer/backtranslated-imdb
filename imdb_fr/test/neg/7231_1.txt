I just watched this one after getting tired of getting ready for the Michigan Bar exam. I wanted something that was stupid and that I could just sit back and say, "What the hell did they think?" I was not disappointed with this venture, but if I had looked at it seriously, I would have been angry. The company that made this thing just split the computer graphics of the first Octopus and add a small sequence with a false octopus that gives the one used in "Bride of the Monster" the appearance of a chef-de special effect sequences. Since when does an octopus have fangs? The plot is that a diver from the New York Police Department is investigating murders / disappearances on the Hudson River shortly before July 4th. He and his partner (who will soon be transferred, or soon to be eaten by a fig-eating octopus) are investigating rather ineptly (while believing that an enormous octopus would kill people) and are sometimes accompanied by a woman. lackey of the mayor's office. Of course, it is believed that an octopus can become so big until the attack of the cop and the girl by the mayor. Surprisingly, hell does not go out of its way and only a few policemen and some civilians are killed. <br /> <br /> Really lame. Do not bother with that.
