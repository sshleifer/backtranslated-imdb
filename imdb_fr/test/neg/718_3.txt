This film was recommended to me by some academics. Based on their comments, I had high expectations. But this movie was only disappointing. The director's goal is obvious: to use an interweaving of speeches and poems to argue against the Bush doctrine. But the director fails miserably. In addition, I seriously question the choice of the main character by the director. He is a tramp who is certainly not worth hearing. The rise of corporate power, so what? More importantly, this film gets a score of failure in its power of persuasion; it is clearly intended for those who have already formed their opinions. It is true that the aesthetics of the film is very nice. But pretty much everything else in the movie is just nil.
