I would call this show horrible if it was not for the fact that it was on the same network as Arrested Development. Because it's on FOX and it's renewed when AD has been canceled. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely impossible to say how terrible this show is. But let me try to describe it. Take an extremely low rate, Archie Bunker, and let him have a humor that would have been out of date if he were married with children. Next, take the outline of AD intrigue (the son has an ugly and boring girlfriend) and turn them down so that fools who watch sitcoms can understand them. <br /> <br /> If you look at this, I will have completely lost respect for you, just like your family. However, if you are a fan, you should love the new FOX comedy 'Til Death. Looks like fun and avant-garde stuff. I mean, married couples do not get along ... great.
