I will not tell the story of the film as some people do. I'm pretty sure those who read this will know what the scenario is. I will not go on talking about all that is wrong with this film, because I will be there for centuries if I do it. The plot is typical and the special effects are below current standards. This is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff (like most of us here), little things will bother you throughout the movie and spoil the experience. If you are an occasional spectator who likes to have a good time watching a movie, then this movie is perfect for you, very funny. It would also be a good movie to take with a partner. Not for moviegoers. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 10
