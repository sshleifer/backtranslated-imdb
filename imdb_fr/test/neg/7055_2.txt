The title of the movie sounds like a porn but it's not even a sex comedy. Instead, Hot Summer in Barefoot County involves a manager sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest money launderers. The moonlight, however, comes from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful girls. Almost everyone can guess what will happen next, but curiously, the movie is very tame. He does not even qualify for a PG ranking. In addition, the small budget is evident in almost every shot and the acting is so amateurish. This film was probably intended for the driving crowd, but it is unlikely to satisfy them even in 1974.
