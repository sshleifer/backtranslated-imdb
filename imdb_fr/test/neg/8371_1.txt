As I watched it, I was preparing to compose a glowing review of this "movie" (it's actually a video), but then I saw that someone had already done it. I quite agree with him. But again, there seems to be a lot of effort and millions of lire have been invested, so I guess you have to give them the credit to try. However, that being said, anyone who does not already know the Lovecraftian world and that is what they were trying to convey, will probably think ... no sense. Thank goodness, I read part of the other review (maybe?) And save my mind from any additional exposure to such a profanation of HP Lovecraft's brilliance.
