OK, what was that story about again? I'm afraid I never read the book and, frankly, it was one of the most confusing movies I've ever watched in a long time. I am a little confused as to the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man without a thumb. The film did not even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how they knew each other in the world. <br /> <br /> After recently watching the movie "Pride and Prejudice" with Colin Firth, I tried to do a study of his film career in I can not find much of what he did to watch his other movies, and downright, other than "What a Girl Wants". I am certainly not saying that HE was not good. He's really one of the best actors I've seen in modern film, but the content and quality of the movies in which he plays have a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" is another perfect example of where the director, the screenwriter and the team are too close to their subject to realize that the viewer does not receive the photo? ? Literally. The film as a whole seemed to present Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of boring emotion. Nothing is really explained and every subject since the beginning seems to need a psychoanalyst evaluation! <br /> <br /> The character of Kristin Scott Thomas seems to enjoy describing erotic stories in front of a totally male audience and to titillate men other than her husband; Colin Firth, who plays her husband, does not necessarily have all his balls in place and is supposed to be a secret agent ?? I suppose; and Ralph Fiennes walks around like a Roman Mr. Darcy (sorry, Colin!) who thinks he knows everything. The rest of the cast is cast (pun intended) to the four winds as the plot progresses is another confusing element that leaves the viewer a disgusting taste. But of course, the viewer is still upset by the fact that the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) ended up having sex for the first time. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry and no accumulation. Just a slap, bam, thanks! <br /> <br /> And is not it romantic that Fiennes is a traitor helping the Germans by giving them desert maps? (sarcasm) <br /> <br /> To describe this film, I would simply say, "How to impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and deceive your adorable and adorable husband who loves you." <br /> <br /> The last incredible part of this plot is to understand how we would choose Ralph Fiennes rather than Colin Firth. Firth had very few opportunities to demonstrate his acting skills ?? In fact, when I watched the movie, I thought it must be one of its first. The scene where he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two-second clip to see in the movie. That said, I have no interest in watching it again. <br /> <br /> The best scene I liked was the crash of the plane where Firth was trying to eliminate them all. Too bad he missed! That would have saved another twenty minutes of even more sterile film. The aerial scenes of the desert were pretty cool.
