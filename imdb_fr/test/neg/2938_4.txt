However, it may be necessary to say that it is perhaps more the case in America than in the United Kingdom, it can still be a delicate subject. Just look at all the debacle of homosexuals in the millitary a few years ago. It is with "In and Out" that the writer Paul Rudnick is inspired by the mentality of the small cities of Central America and the way in which the American press (as well as in the United Kingdom) is so successful in getting out a celebrity. Just look when Boyzone's Will Young and Stephen Gately are out of the closet. <br /> <br /> The film is centered on Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), an English teacher in high school in his hometown. people are getting ready for the Oscars because one of the nominees, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), is from their hometown and was a former Howards alumnus. Cameron, who plays a gay soldier in a Vietnamese epic, wins the award only for declaring he was gay during his acceptance speech. It could not get any worse for Howard, who is just in a day marrying his fiancé and school colleague Emily (Joan Cusack). Predictably, the media response is cataclysmic and disrupts Howard's life. Not only does he try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay, but he avoids the shady newspaper reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck). <br /> <br /> Although it was presented as a comedy, it is clear that Rudnick and director Frank Oz are also trying to be satirical.You only have to watch the first scenes of the Oscars ceremony and how the Bracketts hometown and the school's teaching board react to its release. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film does not live up to the promise we saw earlier in the film. It is a rather flat attempt. make social comments about a crazy comedy. A good cast is unfortunately wasted on a scenario that never delivers enough nessecary laughter and is not as insightful as it thinks. <br /> <br /> Kline gives us the same kind of endearing performance as in his previous comedy "Dave", making Howard an instantly likeable character.Cusack is also a good value because his fiancé is obsessed with Howard's weight, while Tom Selleck plays very well as a gay news reporter, Bob Newhart is also a joy, as the principal of the high school where Howard works, it's a pleasure to see him on the big screen for It's a pity that this is the case. <br /> <br /> The performances as good as they are can hardly save the film of a rather boring affair.A few scenes Have fun in the scene inspired where Howard tries to be more virile by listening to a self-help cassette There is little to appreciate, and when things do not seem to get worse, Rudnick resorts to a disgusting finale to overcome the supreme feeling. I could not Also, I do not think that my intelligence was insulted. Maloy seems to be a too sordid character to become the man who puts his ethic before making a good story while Cammeron finally comes to the rescue in the heyday of movie seems at first to be too involved in a character to worry about what happens to his former teacher.After all, it was he who caused all the problems in the first place. <br /> <br /> "In and Out" is not exactly But when you consider that Klines works better like "A fish called Wanda", you can not help but think that there is a great talent unfortunately spoils. <br /> <br /> Robs Rating: * *
