There were two things I hated about WASTED: the realization and the scenario. I know I do not care about ridicule, but the direction of Stephen T Kay is too much like a .... like ... well a MTV pop video. I think digital video was shot against an intrusive soundtrack, often blurry and often with fast cross sections. If you are not a teenager, many segments of WASTED are unassailable because of the stylistic approach. As bad as the staging, it's the scenario that pulled my channel. The story is told by Samantha, a poor little rich girl who spends much of the film speaking voice-over (strange that the voiceover never seems idiosyncratic enough to come from the same character) telling us the pressure of her exams, the pressure of family life, her social loneliness and that's all that led her to take drugs. It was for similar reasons, such as parental breakup, that her two male friends (I thought she was supposed to be alone?) Are starting to take drugs. Oh poor Sammi in his beautiful house and his problems, my heart blew for you and your friends - NOT. What WASTED does not mention is that no matter what a dependent person, be it drink, drugs, nicotine or chocolate, that person must work to become an addict, she is not a victim of external forces, it commits an act of free will. TRAFFIC and TRAINSPOTTING explained this very well, people become addicts because they want it. Presenting them as victims is unfair, even dangerous <br /> <br /> By the way, if MTV is anti-drugs, will he stop playing videos of stars who freely admit to having consumed?
