The most worthless film of the decade. Those responsible should never be allowed to film again. I do not have words to describe the lack of entertainment provided by this movie. You could not pay me to watch this movie again. I honestly think I would be a better person if I had not seen it. If I called it an offensive, I would fall into a category of emotionally frail extremists. I would say that this film goes so far as to hurt the industry. There are movies I refuse to watch, now that I feel they might be so tasteless. I feel foolish for not having the good sense to go out at any of those times when I was forced to do it. Yes, I saw the end and I'm ashamed of it, like anyone else, including the writer. I'm impressed ...
