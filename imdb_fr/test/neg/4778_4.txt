When I saw version 6.0 on IMDb, I was rather impressed and excited to watch this movie, as a 6 for a horror movie should be rather entertaining. At first, I thought that terrifying the audience would be a disturbing and invisible perverse force (without reading the book), but it turns out to be a rather banal plant - killer plants. Anyway, I'm a rather open-minded person when it comes to movies, so I thought the film would bring some sort of breakthrough on carnivorous vines. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations, excessive amounts of clich√© and lack of originality. To top it off, the main female character continues to bother you with her stupidity. Unless the film is intentionally a bad B rated movie that is entertaining in the hilarity of evil, no movie should ever ever have a main character irritate you if the audience is expected to care about him. These roles should be reserved for secondary characters. The characters were unexploited, the monsters (the plants in this case) unexplained, and the pictures were dripping everywhere. <br /> <br /> Only a few bloody / bloody scenes are slightly effective. in comparison with movies like High Tension or Ichi The Killer. Systematically failing logic (such as why a character who does not watch the top of a rope during a second attempt to descend into the ruins when he has just broken and almost killed someone), even a minor, adds up and continues to anger the audience. The film could have been saved by using characters or a sort of narrative device to reprimand or "redeem" idiotic characters who had just done something stupid (or at least let the character recognize or regret his own mistakes). But continuing to allow idiocy to preside will force the audience to give up all attention to the character, which will in turn remove the terror of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a bad movie. The remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (and the previous one) is an example of a well-made film featuring about twenty people being killed, which certainly sowed fear and fewer defects of logic of character. In summary, if you have a lot of time to kill, go watch it if there is nothing else. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this sub-par film and go see something really scary and very satisfying like the remake of The Hills Have Eyes.
