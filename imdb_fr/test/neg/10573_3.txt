I thought it would be funny. I did. I do not know what happened But I think a lot of the problem unfortunately falls with the cast. I do not know who this kid is, he could be a very nice person but he was not good for this movie. And the support cast was great, which only makes it more obvious. For example, there would be a scene with him and his love interest and your mind will start to go astray, but then Keith David will start talking, or Leslie Nielsen, or Marion Ross, and it will be as if someone were lighting the light and suddenly, we could be careful. again and you think it might not be so bad. But when they come back to the main characters, the lights go out again. <br /> <br /> The parody material available in the superhero genre is plentiful, so the fact that most jokes were basically a fart, makes you wonder who wrote this thing. I mean, there were some fun passages, because I remember laughing a lot, but for the moment I can not remember why, and that was just a few days ago. <br /> <br /> Really, I'm taking it or leaving the note, but I think most people should just leave it.
