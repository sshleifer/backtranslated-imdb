Dodgy plot, wacky script, wacky almost everything in fact. The most convincing performance is that of Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but even that does not save this useless and mean movie. The director's implicit invitation to the viewers is not simply to suspend disbelief, but also to suspend his judgment. <br /> <br /> If it is presumed that the film is supposed to be scorching and threatening, the film has its erotic moments very rare. This kind of thing has been done better by many others. Do not go out of your way to see him.
