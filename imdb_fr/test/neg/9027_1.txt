Vicente Aranda made a terrible historical film. It shows the weak resources of Spanish cinema. In the film, an unreal scenario shows Juana as a ninphomaniac, facing Felipe, worried only for sex ... but sex with other people not with her. Technical errors start with the wedding ring that shows Isabel de Castilla - Nobody noticed? Then, the voice seems to be a documentary, the actors and the actress in the film sometimes laugh - take a look at the sequence when Juana arrives at the council who wants to keep her isolated -; the castles are almost broken when at the age of the film they were recently built, the crowds are only "four" people, the lights are misplaced ... Compared to Amelie Poulain, the French film for the Oscars .. It does not make sense to talk about a bad movie like Juana la loca.
