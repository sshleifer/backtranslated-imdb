So, what should you do if you are a porn star with discolored looks? I know how to become a pop star! This documentary - and I use the term roughly - follows the trials and tribulations of Colton who is trying to transform himself from a gay porn star into an electronic music singer (read: dance). I only wish Mr. Ford's voice to be as muscular as his arms ... sorry to say his voice is painfully thin. There is not much interesting here, but Mr. Ford and his friends are admiring. <br /> <br /> See him record a song that sounds just like every other dance song without a mind. See him traveling to New York to establish "relationships". See him return to LA with little success. Look in the mirror and ask, "Why am I wasting my time looking at this mess?"
