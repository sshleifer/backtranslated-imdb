An elderly and deformed scientist kills a fellow scientist to steal formulas to rejuvenate cells and reverse the aging process. She takes it and turns into the beautiful and devilish Satanik (Magda Konopka) who seduces and kills wealthy businessmen. <br /> <br /> a bit like the late Marisa Mell from the movie DIABOLIK. Coincidence ?? <br /> <br /> However, despite all this, it is amateurish and sloppy without the pop-art gadgets of James Bond DIABOLIK had had. Even the locations of Madrid and Lake Geneva do not make up for that. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is of Manuel Parada and Roberto Pregadio. guitar used as embellishment. Perfect for one of those European Loungecore CDs released in the 90s. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD also uses low quality, poor quality color printing, with an early explanation that this was due at the age of the film. Bull! Either they did not care to find a better source, or they found none. There are only a few images of Magda and that's it. <br /> <br /> Sloppy & poor all around, this one gets a 3 out of 10.
