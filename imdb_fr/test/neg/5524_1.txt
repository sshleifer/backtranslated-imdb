As other critics have already mentioned, another among the countless number of Alien clones, this time with a great Terminator wizard cast, adds a bit of the classic SF story "Who Goes There?" And an incredibly stupid leap from the Andromeda strain (seemingly flashing red lights keep the droids from disconcerting killers from spotting scared people standing three inches away). <br /> <br /> OK, the story: after a sequence of people moving in a spaceship and killing us we get a legend. <br /> <br /> "25 years later". <br /> <br /> The crew of a relay station in orbit around Mars, which must be relieved in 48 hours, detects a spaceship ginormed on a collision course. It's Siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. It was not the right time to have everything turned off on the relay station to do some repairs. The approaching vessel does not deviate from its course and broadcasts a message "DO NOT IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES Enter this ship!" Warning. After much screaming, the relay station crew assembles something and drives the station away quickly. But the ship changes course and jostles them in any way - impaling one of the crew members on a sharp impalpade. The satellite begins to "lose its integrity". The bits are depressurized. Much more screaming and racing in which only two members of the team are sucked into the space at the back. (Why are they ALWAYS sucked upside down?). <br /> <br /> After a few keystrokes, the wheelchair technician (called "Wheeler" - the only detectable joke of the whole film) deduces that Siberia exhausts them with all its power and that they must go aboard and turn off his engines. They all board and take off their helmets. "DO NOT enter this ship!" obviously means getting on board the ship and exposing oneself to potentially life-threatening infectious diseases. A team heads to the main computer room, where they find a dead, frozen guy holding what looks like an American Express card but turns out to be a minidisc. The other team finds switches. Surprisingly, the dead guy turns out to be the father of the attractive female crewmember who is most likely to survive a confrontation with a raging extraterrestrial. They shut down the engines but that means the ship's reactor will explode. A scary shot begins to kill people. It seems that Siberia has discovered a new mineral, an essential source of energy worth millions of dollars, which means that the most venal members of the crew are immediately put in danger of seizing it. The POV shot comes back with whoosh! whoosh! footsteps on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, this gives you the idea that the killer is wearing corduroy pants and that the effect is wasted. <br /> <br /> Then you will not be able to kill yourself and be killed in the order of ugliness and the ability to act, until the survivor - with the cute dog that had managed to bring about death at least two crew members. Why hardened veterans wander in the mouth of certain death in search of their pets, cats and dogs, has long been a mystery of this kind of film. Other highlights include everyone who forgets to react to the drop in oxygen content until the voice of the onboard computer reminds him (not that the low oxygen content way be the awesome fires that this load of idiots begins). If the Killer Droid is so smart, he can steer the ship into a tight curve and try to hit the relay station again, why not disable it "Do not under any circumstances get into this ship!" warning signal .. I'm sure if he was looking for more people to kill than to shout GO GOAY! It was not a good way to go about it. <br /> <br /> Musetta Vander is the only person who can act as a comedian. All the others sniff their nostrils while showing their teeth, shouting and pointing their guns. One and the other. It's that kind of script; full of exclamation points - the only thing that let me look to the end was the hope that the scenario would require him to undress or get wet without wearing anything. Unfortunately, that was not the case. One of the things that went wrong in this film (except that more cyan was put on the screen than in any other movie) is that there was no free nudity.
