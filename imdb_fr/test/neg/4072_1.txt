This film is so bad that it's worth it. This film will have viewers coming and going in a coma in the first 10 minutes. It all started when a group of writers had the idea of ​​a hijacked airliner and a passenger able to fly a small plane that was to land. However, they know that this has already been done many times, so for it to be different, let's make it very bad! Major Masters has its name hacked into the 80s movie "To Live and Die in L.A." of character played by Willem Dafoe. This saved us 10 minutes of writing and production time. The plane is supposed to be a Boieng 747. It has a unique silhouette, even in the dark with its characteristic front hump on the top. Just ask the late Ronald Reagan who deplored this point when the Ruskies shot down KAL 007 in the eighties. However, when the plane takes off, it is clear that a 747 no longer resembles a 767. This well-documented film also forgets to include the engineer's seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfortable seats. No need for flight engineer on this complex plane! Heroine is played by Gloria Lynn Berg, a perpetual pout. After tying up the hijacker, despite several buses in the giant bus, no one cares to look at this guy who almost killed them all. He just has to be entertained. <br /> <br /> The crippled plane, releasing fuel from all the hijacked shenanigans, will not return to Hawaii. Masters will attempt to land at an Air Force base on an island. Only 300 feet of track are too short! Four army guys with little Bobcats (those you rent to carry a load of horse manure all day at the back of your barn) will clear a strip 200 feet wide and 300 feet long across the jungle in 20 minutes! No need for a bulldozer here! Where can you find guys like this? These guys could make a trip between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 3 hours with only tablespoons, a compass and a duck! <br /> <br /> Once this hellish obstacle has been corrected, Masters will try to land in an airplane. pushes far. Hijacker laughs for himself and without supervision becomes free to do more problems. It is finally mastered in the most delayed way that I can not tell you. But, can you say Moby Dick? <br /> <br /> There are so many late scenes in this movie. The injured captain is parked flat on the bar on the plane, while Masters, who is expected to barely fly, places the plane in 60-degree benches and a 20,000-foot-per-minute drop. The pilot should be French kissing the ceiling during these difficult stunts, but do not move an inch. <br /> <br /> I think that if they had chosen different actors to play the roles, this trip would have been much better. If we need a pouting heroine in the film, why not choose the best-known actress Bernadette Peters who also seems to pout? In addition, she can sing and Peters, a well aging and well aged woman, could present some free shots. Now, with the singing angle, it could be a plane hijacking: Let's Land the Plane Movie MUSICAL! Cast Luciano Pavarotti as the pilot. They can sing duet in the cockpit before the diversion and there is no chance that Tubby Tenor flies to the ceiling, because Masters exploits his magic with this big bird. In keeping with the musical theme, Masters could then be played by Andrei Bocelli, with whom Peters can sing when he lands on the plane. Not only is he totally blind, but he knows only a few words of English. Now it's a plot! Think about the edge of your headquarters conversation between the Captains (Bocelli) and the Air Traffic Controller: <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, please roll back to 180 degrees, the flaps set to 25 degrees." position 230 "<br /> <br /> Bocelli:" What? " <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, arm stoppers now, confirm the braking pressure to 250 psi, keep the descent to 500 fpm." <br /> <br /> Bocelli: "What?" <br /> <br /> The hijacker could have been played by the late great Rodney Dangerfield, who can spit a plethora of his linings while sitting, tied up and unguarded: "I did not No respect, his wife loves group sex Yes, she fucked me in front of the judge and the jury! "Have an idea? <br /> <br /> MISSED OPPORTUNITIES The movie has your standard crying and moaning passengers who are never grown up. Woody Allen could have been in the back offering one of her neurotic monologues: "She said I was awesome in bed, I told her I practiced a lot ..." Now it's a movie ! <br /> <br /> In addition, according to the similar movie "Executive Decision" where Steven Segal, lazy to the eyes, is happily killed in the beginning by giving a chance to this film, the 747 have massive lofts at the top. The plane was introduced in 1969, so who knows what has accumulated in almost 40 years there? My uncle has old clothes, a sled, magazines and all kinds of things in his. Was not it cool for Masters to open the hatch and see a tear-eyed Chevy Chase wearing a women's dressing gown watching old Super 8 movies from her childhood? Just a recommendation. <br /> <br /> So let yourself be tempted, and imagine how awesome this film could have been if I had my hand in it ...
