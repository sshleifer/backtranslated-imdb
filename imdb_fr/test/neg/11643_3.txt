The best thing about this movie is that it seems like they used a lot of things left by the Pearl Harbor attack in Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the photo of the P-40, which collapsed in the parked P-40 row, but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. Unfortunately, the situation worsens from there. <br /> <br /> Two black and two white prisoners are American prisoners of war, as well as Filipino prisoners of war and Japanese guards. The prisoner of war of the Americans is a lieutenant of the white navy, who is of course an O-3 in the navy. In any case, he needs a haircut, badly, distractedly badly. Hockey hair does not belong to a WWII film. Oh, and he's racist. He does not want to share his quarters with the "negros". Of course, in real life, he would not want to share his quarters with the white enlisted guy either. I think the Geneva Convention contains a clause on the quarters of the officers and the enlisted, but that was not the question. Oh well, I think the plot is secondary to other issues in this movie. He is put in his place and passes the rest of the movie watching and running the air pump for the divers. <br /> <br /> But once you go there, it's not a bad story. The JAP want divers to raise money thrown by Americans before the fall of Corrigador. Filipino resistance wants them to take their time. And prisoners of war do their best to help. A potentially good story and not so badly done, I suppose. It is a bit incredible that prisoners of war use camps to breathe again and swim between the POW camp and the Filipino village every night. Maybe I'm not so picky when I know it's not a hit movie. I guess that's why it's part of a collection of DVD war movies containing 20 packs for five dollars. <br /> <br /> The music of the 70's was not part of this movie or any WWII film. It's quite distracting to say the least. The acting was not so bad. Probably better than I could do. <br /> <br /> Not being a football fan, I at least discovered that Jim Brown was a real person and not someone that Richard Pryor had invented. That in itself was worth the 25 Â¢ I paid for this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth watching with the MTC or paying a quarter. <br /> <br /> A star to be a war movie, another to be World War II and another because I feel generous.
