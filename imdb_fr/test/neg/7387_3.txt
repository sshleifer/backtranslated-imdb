Super Troopers was an instant classic. The Dread Club, although disappointing for many, had its good times. Puddle Cruisers has fewer moments. I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw downstairs that it was directed by the band Broken Lizard who created Super Troopers. So I naturally chose it. I only found a scene to laugh funny. Far from the Super Troopers. Overall, I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you have a lot of free time and you really need to waste time. However, you'd better play video games or watch something that could make you laugh or think.
