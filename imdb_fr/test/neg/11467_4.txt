I just went to see this movie with a friend. I quickly watched and read a brief synopsis and thought it sounded interesting. We went out movies without really knowing if we liked it. <br /> <br /> The acting was good enough and the contacts with the characters were acceptable. I thought the main character looked a lot like someone like Van Helsing. Yes, it was rather amusing. <br /> <br /> But I had the impression that the plot had been used in other films. The script was a little weak, I do not know why, whenever something bad happens, the main character says "Oh my god" every time. <br /> <br /> The special effects worked well, but (sorry for that spoiler) the main monster at the climax reminded me a lot of Lord of the Rings' Balrok. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was OK but I felt like it was already done. Go see buy all means, but do not wait too much.
