This movie has a rating of 7.0 on IMDb, so even though I felt something rotten in its summary, I decided to try it. What a loss of 100 minutes. First, the 80s were not a good decade for the crime and thriller genre. Most of them, at that time, were badly made with a silly conspiracy (if they had any), so there are very few who can stand out, and even if they were good, they're still not very good. The Hit, however, suffers from all that made silly crime images silly. It has a mediocre character development, an improbable plot and has not been written or run decently, and when you have such flaws, the acting does not help. Stephen Frears has often tried to emulate the new French wave in the making of English movies and the two do not fit. <br /> <br /> First, Terence Stamp has been hiding for 10 years because he has testified against some of his former crime partners. He hides in Spain, from all places. He is finally caught up, and the first kidnapped by a group of Spanish thugs looking silly, you just have to be away from the malefactor supposed to take care of him. This is John Hurt, who is supposed to be a tough guy, a stone killer, and Tim Roth (in his first role) as an apprentice of the devil. They do not kill Stamp right away, they first have the "three Amigos", they should not have been hired in the first place, and then they drive Stamp to Paris, because one of the friends, he has testified against wants to confront him. OK it's possible. But even if Stamp is such a dangerous figure that they had to engage four guys to control him, they do not tie him down, weaken him in any way, and do not lead him with him, as if he were one of his friends. Stamp has no objection and willingly goes to Paris to get shot, using no chance out of twelve, these "professionals" offer him to escape. It seems that Tim Roth is a schoolboy, which makes it even more unlikely that the leader of the great crime associates him with a hard-hearted man like John Hurt, especially in such important work. But even though John Hurt is not that hard, he spends twenty minutes filming, killing or not killing the totally surplus Australian, played by Bill Hunter, whose sole purpose is to introduce the ravishing Laura Del Sol, his mistress (who says he is 15, but looks more like 25) and whose role in history and acting skills suggests that he was offered the role only because she was the director's mistress at the time. After long deliberation, Hurt kills the Australian but takes his mistress for no apparent reason. While he wants to kill her, but Roth with his "subtle manners" convinces him not to do it, so even if she hits him, bites him and scrapes him throughout the film, he stays true to his human side deeply buried. <Br /> <br /> That you have completely silly scenes, like when Hurt and Roth lock the car from the outside, trying to prevent people inside to go out?!?! Anyway, the film hangs in length. Tim Roth falls asleep, watching Terence Stamp with his gun on his chest, and Stamp is just waiting to watch the waterfall. While all the chaos of a plot comes to the point where everything we've seen in the past hour and 20 minutes is coming out the window. Let's recap, if you do not want to kill Stamp right away (except for a movie), it's to take him to Paris. His former partner must have a last word with him. And the essential thing about him not to run away is that he is ready to die saying, "It's just a moment. We are here. So we are not here. We are elsewhere ... maybe. like to breathe. Why should we be afraid? "But my friends, here's where the plot turns, Hurt kills the man while he's still in Spain, and we ask why bother and drive for days, he could have done it in the first 15 minutes, and unlike to his philosophy, Stamp is very afraid of being killed, so we ask again why he did not run away and he was very lucky, Roth is killed too, but he should not be in the film at all. , and Del Sol, well, she promised a role in this movie only for romantic reasons (read sex), so she stays alive, even though she attacked Hurt for the movie. "15th time in the movie. killed all the others, but not her, she must have a maximum appearance on the screen.The film was made with a tight budget and it shows, but when you do not have story telling or cardboard, it shows even more, and yes, Fernando Ray appears and goes through the film as a guest, with a eule line audible dialogue.
