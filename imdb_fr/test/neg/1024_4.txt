A sustained effort that succeeds in adapting Odyssey's classic narrative to a nostalgic play of the '30s. This time adventurers are escaped convicts wandering about the Southern Depression, blocking their way into trouble . <br /> <br /> The greatest strength of the film is its wonderful soundtrack, which effectively evokes not only the time at which it is defined. in, but the spiritual references that rage in the film. Besides its value for the tone of the film, the music is just fun to listen to. <br /> <br /> What paralyzes the film is that the characters are really not nice. In a comedy, you need this element to have fun with them in their misadventures. Instead, we have a group of selfish, arrogant, soulless and naughty people who really have no positives. They are not big enough for you to hate them either, so it's hard to understand them. They are proposed as clowns, but like those who wear makeup and parade, they are just not funny. <br /> <br /> Like the story that inspires him, the film takes them to a dead end. "odyssey", meeting a variety of symbolic characters (some even mystics). Everyone is struck by offensive stereotypes, the key word being "stupid". People are making fun of right and left and, therefore, no one is particularly interesting or attractive. The film does not like his characters, and he does not let you love them either. <br /> <br /> Baptisms by the river, beautiful mermaids, stolen cars, fist fights, radio preachers, whipped with sticks; all are thrown upon you in a disjointed manner. Some evoke some bursts of laughter, others bother you or bother you. I laughed when a nerdy guy demolished a particularly obnoxious main character. But there were many more useless free scenes; An example: a type of the 30s, Dillinger type attaches cows with a machine gun. The comedy? Symbolism? No; just a blind violence, which undermines the intellectual nature of the original sources on which this story builds. <br /> <br /> Other adaptations of the Odyssey are much better. Unless you're a fan of George Clooney, rent something else. But buy the CD of the soundtrack; the music is great.
