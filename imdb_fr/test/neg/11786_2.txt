Only a very small child could forget the absurdities of this bomb; The first difficulty encountered by the submarine "Seaview" is what seems to be pieces of rock? fall into the water and crash into his hull. But it's not rock, they are under the North Pole, it's ice! Everyone, except perhaps until now, mentioned the small children (and even some of them) knows that ICE FLOATS. <br /> <br /> Then, the disaster strikes - this sacred VAN ALLEN radiation belt around the Earth catches fire! We are told that nobody knows how it happened, which is understandable, because it is absolutely impossible that radiation "ignites", and even if it were possible, there is NO AIR IN SPACE that he can burn. <br /> <There is literally no reason to neglect scientific concepts related to Grade 2 textbooks when making a film; However, Irwin Allen manages to do it again and again; perhaps we should rather focus on the "people", which is quite easy because they are cardboard. <br /> <br /> The distribution tries very hard not to appear embarrassed in this ridiculous delirium of sub-children, a little like subsequent episodes of his television series "Lost in Space", whose concept was swept directly by the writer Ib Melchior, then rushed into production. <br /> <br /> The submarine looks pretty good, though, which is why this one gets a "2".
