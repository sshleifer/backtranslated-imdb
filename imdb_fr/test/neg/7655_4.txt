The Second Woman tells the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to hurt him. A girl who likes her wants to help her but she is led to believe that her fears are caused by mental illness ... <br /> <br /> Intrigue interesting, very good acting, but the result as a whole is mediocre In many ways. The story is too simplistic, or rather, presented in a simplistic way (even if there are some interesting twists). For example, people say they love each other after only two meetings. I do not want to reveal anything else, but you'll see what I mean if you watch the movie. "Come on, it was the 50's!", You can imagine. Still, I've seen quite a lot of movies from that era, and I know some of them do not seem so dated these days. <br /> <br /> Something that bothered me was that some scenes were shot in the dark, which is almost impossible to watch what happened. Ok, it's a black film but this one is too black at times ...: o) <br /> <br /> Overall, the Second Woman is not a masterpiece of this era but not a waste either. Look at it if you have nothing else to do ...
