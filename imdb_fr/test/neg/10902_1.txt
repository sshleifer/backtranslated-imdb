Apparently, in the eyes of some - there are not enough horror movies about young people being chased through a desert by a mysterious, bloodthirsty madman in a truck. I mean, all we have so far is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man - among others. REST STOP is perhaps the worst example. This is a girl and her boyfriend who leave their lives to start together again in California. On the way, they stop in dirty toilets so that the young woman can relieve herself, but when she returns, she notices that her boyfriend and her car have disappeared. From there, she learns that the culprit is a guy who drives a yellow van that pursues her and terrorizes her while she is hiding in the toilet. This film is so original that it is totally boring. The acting is annoying, the gore is sweet and the killer, whose identity is not revealed throughout the film, is anything but memorable. Terrible - terrible movie ...
