SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I like movies. I saw a lot of movies. I did not think I had ever seen a movie that I really hated. The Son of the Mask has ruined him. The mask's son is so bad that I will not even make a detailed comment as usual. In fact, I will not even write much. I think you should all know that this movie is horribly horrible. And poor Jamie Kennedy. He was awesome in Scream, but now this movie! In addition, this movie takes a SMO-CAN movie and turns it into a childish goofy movie that even kids will not like. This film is also composed of very coarse humor. Like the woman on the nose. She has a nose for a head and when she sneezes, a white substance escapes from her nose. There is also a parody of exorcist. Yes, a children's movie has an adult parody. Maybe they thought adults would like it. Quite frankly, it made the movie even crisper and rude. <br /> <br /> Here is the basic and stupid plot. Tim Avery's dog takes on Loki's amazing mask and turns into a cartoon dog. When Tim pays more attention to the baby with special powers, the cartoon dog becomes a Wiley Coyotes scam. Then Loki takes the baby with incredible powers and Tim and Loki have a really nerdy fight. Tim is wearing the mask. All ends happy. Too bad this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Overall, the original mask was a fantastic Jim Carrey film. This, basically, is not. Please, do not rent, buy or download this movie. I made a terrible mistake by praising this. I do not want you to make the same mistake. I feel horrible that I can not write a detailed comment, but what to comment on? I would give him one, but hey, it's a children's movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended films: The mask.
