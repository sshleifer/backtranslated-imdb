Odious Chuck Norris decided to put one last nail in the coffin <br /> <br /> containing his film career before going to the safe world of CBS <br /> <br /> The carnage that will take place on Saturday night with this supernatural hysterically bad <br /> <br /> Action. <br /> <br /> For such a stupid film, this thing is sure. Norris is the Chicago policeman <br /> <br /> Frank Shatter. First of all, what kind of family name is "Shatter"? <br /> <br /> Have you ever met Shatters? Genforum.com does not have an advertisement for <br /> <br /> the Shatter surname, which opens any half-intelligent viewer to <br /> <br /> replace the "a" in Shatter by an "i." He and his partner, Calvin <br /> <br /> Jackson, practice the same cop cop routine you've seen <br /> <br /> before: have fun with the pimps, and make their captain furious. <BR /> <br /> Jackson, resembling Whoopi Goldberg <br /> <br /> and Rick James's theoretic love child, quickly gets upset with his dismay <br /> <br /> and Eddie Murphy- patented facial expressions. <br /> <br /> Shatter and Calvin engage with an emissary of Satan, <br /> <br /> which is presented to us in the opening scenes too long. <br /> <br /> Prosatano is a demon locked in a crypt by King Richard, the heart of Leo. The scepter of the devil, from which he derives his power, is divided into nine pieces and hidden in nine different parts of the world by holy men. In 1951, grave robbers accidentally let <br /> Prosatano out and he began to collect the nine pieces. He disguises himself as a professor of antiquities by the name of Lockley and <br /> <br /> always gives a lecture where a holy man is killed and a scepter <br /> piece is taken. <br /> <br /> Norris brings in his "Walker: Texas Blunder" cohort Sheree Wilson, <br /> <br /> who plays Lockley's assistant. She helps Norris in his investigation, they look at each other, and our intrepid investigators go to Israel after the murder of a rabbi in Chicago. During his stay in Israel, Calvin has even more to complain about <br /> <br /> about: the heat, the lack of catering, the ugly drivers, and the fact that he misses the Chicago Bulls in the playoffs <br /> <br />. Norris even manages to train a cute Israeli child in this <br /> <br /> nightmare. Bezi steals Calvin's wallet and hangs around the men, guiding them around Israel and raising no suspicion of any kind. <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Lockley (Prosatano) assembles all the pieces of the scepter, but needs the blood of kingship to complete the ceremony <br /> <br /> and call the devil. Where to find royal blood? Well, Sheree's father <br /> <br /> is a duke! It has an American accent, but it is the most convenient method for writers to force this monstrosity <br /> <br /> towards its inevitable conclusion. Of course, this Satan's minion could have killed hundreds of people over the years, but how is he going to face a good old American kick? <Br /> <br /> After Prosatano was defeated and killed by his own scepter (<br /> <br /> I envied him, he did not have to watch Bezi steal Calvin's wallet again < we are entitled to a hideous coda involving a bearded man <br /> <br /> who watches Shutter, I mean Shatter, and Calvin during their quest <br /> <br />. You see, it was predicted ... somewhere ... that two <br /> <br /> warriors from the west would defeat Prosatano. <br /> <br /> The silent bearded man who watched over the couple was none other than Jesus ... I'm not making fun of you. He is listed as "Prophet" in the ending credits, <br /> <br /> but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle Christian reference <br /> <br /> that filmmakers are trying to expose here . <As in "I'm using a Walker: Texas Ranger", Norris gets older and can not get into his fight scenes anymore. He kicks a lot and <br /> <br /> people fly over the furniture in slow motion, then Norris gives all his readings lines in his monotonous voice. Oh, what real director <br /> <br /> might be able to replace it! His brother, Aaron, who also directed it in other films, has no sense of history or dynamics <br /> <br />. Scenes are projected for the sake of the ego, not to entertain <br /> <br />. The scenes where the dynamic duo meet for the first time Bezi hang out <br /> <br /> over and over again, then Bezi is not so important for the rest of the film <br /> <br />. <br /> <The film was filmed locally in Israel, which means that the Americans could insult the Israelis in person. There is not a single, friendly Israeli character here. The captain of the Israeli police is a fool. <br /> <br /> The driver of the cops does not know English and Calvin convinces him <br /> <br /> that the word "sh * tty" is a compliment. Nothing is funnier than mocking these stupid strangers in their territory, especially when <br /> <br /> all this racist humor comes from an American minority <br /> <br /> Who would have been more than shocked if the tables were turned <br /> <br /> and that the Israeli policeman was making fun of the African-American policeman at <br /> <br /> Chicago. <br /> <br /> This film is badly written, badly played and badly directed. <br /> <br /> It does not work like an action, a cop drama or even a horror. It just shows that <br /> <br /> Cannon Studios, now missing, were willing to throw their money <br /> <br /> into anything, no matter how bad it was planned. "Hellbound" is surely a good title. This film displeased me enormously. <br /> <br /> This is noted (R) for physical violence, gun violence, <br /> <br /> strong desecration, some sexual references and some adult situations. <Br /> <br />
