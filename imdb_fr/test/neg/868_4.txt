B-horror blade that takes itself too seriously given its subject is about a dear old woman who was transformed into a creature of the night by a tenant who came to rent him a room. When this tenant is killed, Mum has to go out alone to feed herself, which creates stress for the family and attracts the attention of the authorities. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is that this film should have brought THE DROLE. He did not manage to do it though he had some slight effects of gory and schlocky creature makeup to keep the B-movie audience happy. I saw worse but I would not give this one a story - 4.5 / 10.
