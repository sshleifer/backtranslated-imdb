When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought, "Hey, damn it, it looks like a good movie, why not praise it?" So yes, I rented it and I went home to see him. When I inserted it into my DVD player, I was shocked. <br /> <br /> And well above all, no one told me it was a Mexican movie and that it was spoken in Spanish. Fortunately there were subtitles. <br /> <br /> SECOND, it was naked, naked NUDE! Since I have no experience in Mexican movies, you could see my shock when I saw it. * Gasp! Covering the blank eyes, NOO * <br /> <br /> THIRD, predictable to say the least, but being predictable was no excuse for loving the movies, as I did not care whether it was predictable, unless well on the top. <br /> <br /> FOURTH, how Heidi and Kike were reunited, so corny. <br /> <br /> FIFTH, how did the movie end? It was an AfDB, ADB ending. The sudden approval of Mr. Van der Linde for the mayor's election was due to the fact that his daughter knew how to organize the party ... BLAH, Blah. I was hoping it was not so easy to accept, the manager might have been rushed. <br /> <br /> After all these criticisms, the good things are coming. The film was actually quite hilarious at one point, Maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and everything, Heidi's attitude, Valentina being poetic with the words. What I really like is the song Valentina made with her girlfriend. That's all, and for the other stuff I did not mention, they were just like this.
