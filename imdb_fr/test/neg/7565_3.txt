I mean, it was immensely boring. the main man (Christian Schoyen) must be the worst actor I have ever seen. and something else, if the character of the movie moved to America at the age of ten or something and had been living here for over 20 years, he would speak a much better English than he pulls here. or say it in my own language "Skikkelig gebrokkent". But it's cool to see Norwegian guys in a movie shot in Hollywood. it was a shame they were hacks without talent. The scenario itself is below mediocre. I suspect that Christian Schoyen made this film just to live his dream, as he clearly does in the movie by singing a beautiful girl after another.
