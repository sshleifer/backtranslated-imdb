This script was slightly original at the time of writing in 1935, but the poor performance and the inconsistent level of quality do not recommend. Some of the vignettes are absolutely terrible and the dialogue is never natural. Some of the plot twists were creative, but I was very surprised to see that it was so well noted here at the IMDB. Some scenes are worth it, it's like a movie that is completely lacking in entertainment. If you like this type of editing, do not walk and get "Tales of Manhattan" (1942), a wonderful movie that follows the life and times of a coat.
