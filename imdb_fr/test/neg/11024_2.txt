Jimmy Stewart, an inefficient supplier, ugly, boring, self-deprecating and ugly, has a bad marriage with Carole Lombard. After going through difficult times, he endures degrading work, a dominant, passionate, aggressive and passionate resident mother, who badly needs an epic punishment and a crying baby. The film trembles on failure and endless misery discernible. Do you want to watch a couple bickering with their mother for ninety minutes? Many scenes present a screaming baby. The film can not explain why we want to endorse the mother of hell, or why Jimmy Stewart can not cultivate a pair. Who wanted to see that? Who wanted to see Stewart and Lombard without laughter or charm? <br /> <br /> It's absolutely depressing and unbearable.
