Ealing's comedies are their own specific sub-genre in the film's history. These were funny reflections on British life in the late forties and early fifties. They are always fun, but I feel it is misleading to call them comedies. They are breezy and in a good mood, rather than laughing funny. However, the best of them are laced with a discreet satire and crossed by an occasional gloomy trail (especially Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers). <br /> <br /> I have an affection for them all except The Lavender Hill Mob is probably the one with whom I have the most difficulty. Compared to others, it seems a bit superficial. For me, it's a sketch for a movie, but it required a lot more development time before it could be shown in front of the cameras. <br /> <br /> Everything is a little undercooked. For example, no one has real context or context. Henry is simply a conscientious man, whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions are not recognized, while Albert is a frustrated artist, forced to prostitute his talent by making the gift shop a treasure to earn a living. This is a motive for their crime, but nothing that happens thereafter results from their characters or their project. <br /> <br /> Other characters are presented but play no part in the story. The senior resident of Henry's B & B could have (with his love of crime novels) become an unintentional thorn in his side, but would simply be used as a "background color". Similarly, the various police who come in and out of the action are just there to ensure that the plot continues to advance. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film is entirely guided by its artificial plots, which I find both frustrating and slightly irritating. The ingenious flight is accomplished with minimal problems, despite the fact that Albert is prevented from playing his role in the plan (by Sidney Tafler's Clayton). Gold is then smuggled to France without hindrance. Everything would have gone well if there had not been a little snag, inspired by the French pronunciation of the letter "R", which means that six of the golden Eiffel Towers were accidentally sold to English schoolgirls. <br /> <This leads to a series of frantic pursuits as Henry and Albert seek to recover them. These scenes are well executed, but at every moment, the conspirators are frustrated in their pursuit of schoolgirls by a series of entirely fake accidents. It is as if God deliberately intervened to give them a hard time. This kind of conspiracy always makes me cringe. <br /> <br /> When they finally find the last Eiffel Tower at an exhibition of the Police Academy, they snatch it under the nose of John Gregson's police inspector (why is he here, from anyway?) all the shreds of conspiracy logic are abandoned. The final car chases are then simply filled with screens until we return to the shooting device with which the image started. <br /> <br /> The film does not even bother to tell us the fate of Albert (Stanley Holloway), Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). <br /> <br /> This awesome little caper has the professionalism of the Ealing team behind her, so it's far from a bad movie. I guess most viewers will find it considerably more enjoyable than me (and why should not it?), But I can not help but think there was a much better movie to wait for, if only more Time and effort had gone into making both the characters and the story. <br /> <br /> According to the standards set by Ealing, Lavender Hill Mob is a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> PS: A curious note is that Audrey Hepburn receives merit for his only line at first, but Archie Duncan remains anonymous despite his much more substantial contribution. I guess she just had a better agent.
