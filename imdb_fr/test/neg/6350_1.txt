If you want to see an example showing how not to make a movie, you have to watch it. Myself, without experience in cinema, I could do better. The scenario is laughable with a weak plot and there is no effort to see for a smart structure. To remedy this deficiency, one might think that the action would be decent, would it not? <br /> <br /> As the acting, the assembly and assembly of the film are appalling, the only positive point is the salvation the terrible performance of the main actor. The reason he's saving grace is because he's so bad as an actor that he should win an Oscar for it. At least a little gratitude for making me laugh so much. <br /> <br /> Throw in the body of a dead woman after a shooting with a man (where did it come from?), Press the trigger semi-automatically several times while the soundman realizes two shot effects, the film crew's reflection in the shadow of Kool Mo Dee, one and only one piece of music for the WHOLE film, a non-original script that has no logic; is a perfect recipe for a very, very bad movie. It's actually more fun to spot mistakes than to try to find something positive. Avoid at all costs.
