First of all. I do not despise Americans. I know a lot of smart people from the United States. But this movie is so bad that I just had to comment on it. <br /> <br /> First of all ... The films are for the most part far from the truth. This film is no exception. Many scenes are incredibly wrong. For example the departure of the two spaceships. You see them drop the full tanks into space. Just a short distance from each other. Remember what blew up the Space Shuttle in the past? Just a little flashy part that has finished. Here, it is common to drop fuel tanks as big, if not more, than the entire ship. What idiot would let two spaceships rise and do it at the same time ??? Secondly, the Russian radio station is a piece of shit. I do not like to talk about it, but astronauts are going to Russia today. Since their equipment is much more reliable than that of NASA. The Space Shuttle is retired. And NASA only uses it to pay its bills. And there is no better alternative for that. And the list of whoppers goes on and on. It's really an insult to people taking trips into serious space. And I know half as much as these guys. But the most annoying part (read: the whole movie) is the shit of propaganda and patriots who choke you. MY GOD !!!! I thought I was watching a CNN commercial for about an hour. The actors solve their little problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone, throwing themselves into fights, ignoring the police, etc., etc. By sacrificing their lives, everyone queues to commit suicide (bomb detonator) ?? Perhaps I do not miss the feeling of being a true "patriot", able to sing the national anthem upside down in Swahili. While driving with George Bush driving a golf cart, turn until the battery is empty. But this movie was too much for me too to handle. And when I finally got hold of my hiney, I took off the flag and the fabric of the American flag. I realized that I was happy that this movie was finally finished. I do not know why so many good actors have participated in this propaganda film, with stereotypes and narrow views. But I pity them. This is a country where you can escape murder if you have money or power. As long as "Uncle Sam" thinks you are a good patriot. Where everyone is happy as long as it's another devastated country, no one cares.
