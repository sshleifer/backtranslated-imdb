I'm sorry, but this movie is just too superficial for me. In this film, Perez is a taxi dancer with his boyfriend Keitel trying to do it as an actress. First of all, what is a taxi dancer? Even after going through this, I still do not know. Oh yes, Perez also inspires DeLorenzo to follow her like a puppy to love sickness. There is no reason behind love, it happens like that. There are times when characters and events really make you feel bad, but it rarely works. The only character you really feel is Keitel's character, and that's only because he's doing such a good job with him. Any other actor and the character would have been like the others. <br /> <br /> The script is essentially an uninspired narrative that shows how difficult it is to make him an actor. This has been done and said before, the language and the dialogue seem to have been written by a pimp of the street. The end is ... well, I do not want to ruin it. Let's just say that it does not seem satisfactory. I would be more upset if the story was good to start. The staging is average with nothing really wonderful, but nothing that is really painful to watch either. To reiterate the acting game, the only one that does anything worth watching is Keitel. Although I could have lived without seeing him in a tiger print bikini underwear. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Eddie Bunker is coming. As random as this mention is, it's how random it is in the movie. And Tarantino does a favor to his buddy director by showing up for about 20 seconds.
