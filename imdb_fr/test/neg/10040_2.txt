The filmmaker remains true to the most accurate narrative of history published in 1894, which includes an 1846 manuscript of Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) entitled "Our Family Trouble". To the best of our knowledge, this is the only eyewitness account ever written. The filmmaker should be credited for accuracy, but there is little to say about the quality of the production and the game. The acting was theatrical and the quality of the sound and the image was extremely bad. It seems that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating them or incorporating them into a plot or fluid narrative. If you must know the story, read it, it's much more captivating and conclusive.
