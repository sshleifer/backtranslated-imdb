What a terrible failure. Not only the title but the idea is the same as that of Jane Fonda, George Segal's vehicle of a few decades ago. Why? I wonder, someone with Jim Carrey's influence will not only be a star, but will also produce that tired, ugly and useless excuse for a comedy. He could take comedy to a whole new level, instead he goes for what he can assume to be a safe territory. Money, money, big, Christmas. But I'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. I call it uncomfortable because that's what I felt. Aware of my desperate attempts on the screen to be funny. And fail, miserably. It was perhaps a scandalous and politically incorrect comedy, according to Post Enron, but no, it would be too high, too risky. Too bad!
