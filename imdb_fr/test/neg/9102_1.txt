My friends and I rented this movie as another skateboard movie. Watching Steve Guttenberg as an action hero is hilarious. The film is so incredibly predictable and so surprising that it ended up being a festival of laughter. Even though I gave it a 1/10, this movie should be seen especially if you manage to watch it on TV anywhere.
