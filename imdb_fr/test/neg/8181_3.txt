After watching Avalon (which was acceptable only because of the beautiful digital effects) and several anime movies written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (fantastic), I decided to take a look at the trilogy box set Oshii cinema. Since the red glasses and the stray dog ​​are related, I will comment here on both. And let me tell you that was one of the biggest waste of money I've spent in a long time. I first watched Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. I'm sad to say that these movies are probably the two most boring movies I've ever seen. For about 10 minutes in each movie, you see the action between the characters, who are dressed only in the outfit of "Panzer Cop" during some ephemeral scenes. The rest of the time, you will see very long scenes filled with boring dialogues in less impressive places. I really do not understand the motivation behind these two films. I like Wolf Brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot, but the movies themselves leave a lot to be desired. I would suggest NOT to watch these films and certainly not buy the box as I did, unless you enjoy wasting money. Oh, and if you're wondering what I think about the third movie in the series, Talking Head, I could not even bring myself to watch it before I purged the box from my DVD collection via eBay at $ 20 a loss. If you want live Japanese action, take a look at Returner, Ichii the Killer or the Zeiram series.
