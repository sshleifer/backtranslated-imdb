The DVD version published by Crash Cinema was very badly done. The mastering engineer must have been intoxicated, asleep or not even in the room during execution. It seems that the audio synchronization was mastered from a copy of about tenth generation and about halfway through the film. The dialogue is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the audio. If you are thinking of buying this DVD, save your money. I remember seeing this film at the theater in 1973. In addition, the VHS copy of this movie entitled "When Taekwondo Strikes" looks better than the DVD, but the remaining minutes of the film are missing. Where is the original negative of the camera?
