I have trouble understanding what makes the viewer feel like it's a powerful movie. I guess the main intention of this film would be a study of characters and the effects of racism in a British community. It is therefore all the more disappointing that all the characters are two-dimensional and that the acting is at the level of a college performance arts class. I am always skeptical about "improvisation", another word for being too lazy to write a decent scenario. I was embarrassed by the performances and I sat in front of an audience who laughed when they were supposed to be moved by the story. Racism is a serious problem, but I think that a subtle approach to film works much better than troweling it.
