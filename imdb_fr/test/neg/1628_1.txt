The sequel that no one asked for the movie that nobody wanted. There are obviously too many flaws in this film to be able to be named here, so I will focus on the acting game. Miles O'Keefe would have been more apt to play Thong's Asian sidekick, mainly because he would then have no dialogue. Lisa Foster delivers her lines showing an emotion, monotony. Charles Borremel gives life to his share by pausing every five words. And finally the flamboyant type of John Saxon ...... no comment. <br /> <br /> See "Conan the Barbarian" if you need it, but do not waste your time with this budget loser.
