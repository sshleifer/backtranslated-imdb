Repeating this with the rest of the Marx Brothers set, I found myself disappointed by almost anything beyond a night at the opera house. This stinker is probably the worst I've seen so far, with smart lines being left out and the characterization deplorable. The playwright is so obscurely stupid in this room that it's hard not to attack the TV and strangle it. much better when they have a good gag or two at least. All the material here is obviously written for anyone and really spoils Marx's talent. To avoid. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
