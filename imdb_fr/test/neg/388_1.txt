Closet Land is a nasty job with great actors. Nothing more (or less) in the film besides the endless abuse of a seductive prisoner by a sadistic police officer. The setting is minimalist. This could be considered S & M soft porn because the drama is devoid of any point of reference such as time, place and political context. Since what happens is cut adrift in an imaginary futuristic environment, the abuse becomes purely personal. The pornographic aspects are justified by a warning about the evils of the totalitarian government, but as there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we come out troubled but did not learn anything. <br /> <br /> the point? This torture exists in the world? What abusing prisoners is bad? That dictatorships abuse innocent people? We already know it. Closet Land echoes such works as Darkness At Noon and Ionesco's Rhinoceros, but these two works were made by competent artists whose works had a historical context and depth of meaning. This work is amateur and the dialogue sophomoric. A definitive thumb down.
