The idea of ​​the movie was not so bad: a horror movie shot in a corn maze on Halloween. The bad part was the poor quality camera work, the ten million puddles and maize, and the hour-and-a-half walk this guy went through in the labyrinth. Oh, I'm sorry, the "corn". I chose this film because it made me think of a corn maze near my home and I thought it was a good movie idea. But taking all into consideration, it seems that your average Joe could take the same idea and go much further with it. The role of Bill Cowell was not too bad, in fact, I would say it was pretty good. But the lack of talent of his co-stars did not help his efforts. Hoping that his next film will be easier to swallow.
