A motley group of Western tourists in Africa are suffering from the misfortune of their plane. They are therefore forced to board a bus to cross the Namibian desert and reach the nearest starting point to return to civilization. Unsurprisingly, the driver's compass eventually stops working, and they find themselves at the end of the road stopping in a deserted ghost town that was a barracks during World War II battles. They find kerosene (useless to refill the tank of their bus), a storage room filled with carrots half poisoned in cans, and an indigenous hermit who observes them with indifference. One of them, who seems to have some knowledge of survival techniques, goes for help. They must remove the tires from the bus and burn them if they are not back in five days: hopefully someone will see the black smoke. <br /> <br /> Does this seem interesting to you? Of course, even if it looks a lot like * The Flight of the Phoenix * or a number of films of the "desert island" genre. That's why it's surprising that * The King Is Alive * is number 4 (if anyone else is counting) in the ongoing series "Dogma 95", which, if I remember this ridiculous "vow of chastity" 95 "proclaimed that" genre films "are strictly verboten. Oops. Anyway, you can say that you will try to be very artistic in order to make up for the fact that it is a genre film. Yes, it does not take long for a member of the group, an old waking theater actor, to start scribbling - out of memory! - the different roles of * King Lear * on, well, rolls of paper. The idea is that playing the game will help pass the time. All of this is really against the advice of an optimistic survivor (does the old actor ever do a theatrical show with * The Odd Couple * only once in his life?), Except such an activity that is colossal waste of time and precious energy. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that I really do not know how to continue. It's so stupid, so loaded with absurd situations and characters that it's all about rational criticism. Full disclosure may be an opportune moment: I despise this so-called Danish "movement" of cinema to an almost irrational degree. I think my face becomes even slightly red at the mere mention of Dogma 95. First, if the name of your movement contains the word "dogma" in the title, you've already lost me; secondly, in this particular case, the movement's insistence on the self-denial of individual artistic achievement is a recipe for arch-archic hypocrisy when you consider that the filmmakers here are plundering one of the greatest works of the greatest writer INDIVIDUAL who has ever lived. (But, no doubt, the host of dogmas believes that the works of Shakespeare were written by a consortium of Elizabethan bigwigs such as the Earl of Oxford, Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh and the Queen herself.) <br /> <br /> Hell, I may have forgiven the entire company if it had been the scenario for wacky purposes (attacking the precious Dogma - now THAT would be subversive!). But the film is taken very seriously and is quickly part of the clich√©s inherent in the genre to which it belongs: people turn against each other; men who wear a beard; the inevitable death of some of the main actors. All with an impassive face. "Is this the promised end?" Well, not quite: we must also support the abyssal transfer of the DV. Because it is another rule of the vow of chastity of the Dogma 95: digital video pocket only. Some friendly advice to the Danes: your "movement" is in trouble when the visual quality of your finished product is lower than that of a home video of graduation. Professionalism is part of the tricks of an artist, beside his own individuality. "Artisan" and "artist" are related words, Mr. von Trier: all fools with a $ 100 hand can not be filmmakers. Pass it. And by the way: allow your Dogma directors to be credited for their films, while you're there. The fact that the author of * The King Is Alive * receives a credit while the guy (or the girl) who films the movie does not do it - is just a little hypocritical. <br /> <br /> despicable. 1 out of 10 stars.
