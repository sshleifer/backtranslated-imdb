Meet Cosmo (Jason Priestley), a feeble young bookmaker who splits his boring life for the crowd and lives in an apartment in the basement of a seniors' center. Her only hobby is watching TV and occasionally playing with her bizarre prostitute friend Honey (Janeane Garofalo). But one day all this changes, when the leader of the Mafia is killed and the good considered Cosmo is chosen by the new leader, sweet and persuasive, Gordon (Robert Loggia), to become a man in its own right. This is an offer that Cosmo, a reluctant man, can not repeat or refuse, and quickly gives up his mundane and lonely existence to an intensive revenge class under the tutelage of veteran gangster Steve (Peter Riegert), a laid back good-natured and suburban who loves maximum pay and minimum hours of employment. In no time, Cosmo surprises himself and his mentor, showing an absolutely strange aptitude for work. Although he never touched a weapon before, Cosmo turns out to be both a sniper and, after an initial wave of moral hesitation, a cool and detached killer. Soon, Cosmo sends impetuous customers with style and speed. His natural flair with a gun quickly positions him as an invaluable asset to Gordon's crowd. <br /> <br /> Reality hinders her, when one night, while being massaged by Honey, Cosmo admits she feels a bit stuck and she recommends her to try yoga to relax. Cosmo takes her advice and participates in a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named Jasmine (Kimberly Williams). Cosmo is instantly taken with the kind and gentle Jasmine, who feels quickly attracted by Cosmo. Now, if she can just get rid of her annoying and abusive boyfriend, Randy (Josh Charles), maybe she and Cosmo can start something. Cosmo, using some of the "skills" of his new job, eventually persuades Randy to disappear and his relationship with Jasmine takes off. <br /> <br /> Writer / Director Mr. Wallace Wolodarksy, twice Emmy Award- The winner of his work on "The Tracy Ullman Show" and "The Simpsons" has created a scenario merging his three passions: "J 'love comedies, gangster movies and novels,' Wolodarsky explained. create this movie. "But he's offering a film so disjointed and improbable that it sounds like a very long skit from Saturday Night Live, his monotonous tone does not match his delusional sense of humor, highlighting the fact that a lot of money has been spent on a vehicle so that Jason Priestly happily breaks his image of a nice boy, who does not even succeed completely because he plays his character not like a nerd, but like a laconic zombie.A nerd can be naive, but a nerd has Passion for things directed inward, but Priestly plays his character as mentally deficient, almost anti-Forrest Gump Unfortunately, "Coldblooded" does not have the sense of reach necessary to really become anti -Forrest Gump. <br /> <br /> Peter Riegert (Local Hero, Animal House) performs well, as usual, and Kimberly Williams does her best with what she has to work with, but Janeane Garofalo ( the issue HBO's Larry Sanders Show) is virtually lost in his role as Cosmo's friend. Probably not for long, though. Garofalo has all the excitement and charm of an apple waiting to be picked and it's only a matter of time before she is given a meaty role, hoping to do a team thing with Marisa Tomei. <br /> <br />
