The Kite Runner started as one of those "important" movies that most people love because they are told they should do it if they want to be part of the elite and they have quickly fallen into a silly movie absurdly extravagant proportions. <br /> <br /> I never read the book and I never felt the need, because honestly, I do not care. Of course, I am told that I am misinformed to say it, but I really have no interest in what a novel "pulls in your heart, copy it from all other stories to get the emotions of readers ", even if it takes place in Afghanistan. <That said, I watched the movie. I heard good things about her beauty and how touching it was and decided why not. In the end, there was a very good reason why not. Not only was the alleged main character completely unfriendly (I understand, he was young and this is a film about redemption, but honestly it was horrible, I hated him and not in this way "anti-hero", he was just a dull, idiotic, egocentric character for whom I did not feel anything), but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that I could not believe how much others were fascinated by his beauty, by the way they cried and it touched them. I'm sorry, but I only feel touched by something realistic. Science fiction is known to move me, fantasy too ... but that? Please. It has surpassed many other films for pure nonsense! My biggest pet peeve, Hassan was Amir's brother ... really? Are you sure you did not snatch it from a thousand other stories? Is it positive that this particular treat has not just been added to try to pull more tears out of your audience (do you know what kind of people are looking for reasons to cry during a movie)? I rolled my eyes when this "twist" was revealed, knowing that it could only descend in the opposite direction (without forgetting to return to Star Wars "Amir, Hassan is your brother" "NOOOOO, it is not true, it's IMPOSSIBLE! ") Oh, and it certainly is. Filled to the brim with snapshots and just plan a silly narration. Like "a man miraculously escapes the bad against all odds with the help of a spunky kid who, although he is really sodomized and not knowing who you are, is willing to help you with a well placed weapon that has a special meaning for you ". Ooh, and do not forget this idiot "to finally get revenge on the kid who teased you when you were little and who, surprise surprise, became a psychopathic adult" (believe me, guys, you like to live by proxy through movies but that will never happen, you know that kid who teased you in high school ... he's not a terrorist, he's probably an accountant.) <br /> <br /> Oh , and I must mention the CGI-tastic kites! I think they were on par with the "Matrix" and "Transformers" movies, congratulations guys! BRAVO! <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was designed for a Western audience that needs a reason to be interested in the Middle East (a story of emotional friendship will work!). of one of the most superficial films in the world. I had the misfortune to see, it poses so deeply ... but when you get there, it's nothing special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the core of the American audience will do what they say to you and follow the "This is controversial material, so it must be good!" way of thinking.
