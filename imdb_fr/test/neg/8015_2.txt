I praised that because I could not miss the opportunity to see Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones before Hollywood celebrity, but it was not worth it. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is for the novelty of seeing them before they get noticed through the pond. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones, who is generally fun to watch even if she is not the biggest thesp in the world, is terrible. Owen looks really uncomfortable in such a turkey, in addition to wearing a ridiculous and awkward wig (at least I hope it's a wig and not his real hair). And the scene where he dances a country template with Zeta Jones just embarrasses you for him. Joan Plowright walks stupefied through the entire movie - she's probably wondering how she ended up in such a mess. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Clive Owen's wife is not terrible, but just about everyone is. Oh, and writing stinks too.
