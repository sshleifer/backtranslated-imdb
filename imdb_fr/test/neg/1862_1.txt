This film was so horrible ... I want to defeat all those who have already made this movie ... I was an original fan of all ghoulie movies ... but when I saw that, I started to crying but I could not handle it anymore ... there are not even ghosts in it ... like the original creative monsters ... it's so cheap ... I'm coming on a witch ... it sucks, nobody wants to see the witch ... they wanted to see what the movie was about ... "GHOULIES" i meen jeesh am I right or what? Thats there we looked at others .. now we really have to stand this horrible story ... It makes me want to eat my own shit after Spaghetti Monday !!!
