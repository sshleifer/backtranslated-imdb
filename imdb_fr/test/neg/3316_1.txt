It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not only is this a comedy that is not funny, but it is also very poorly done with an exaggerated direction full of separate screens and unnecessary effects. <br /> <br /> The two "heroes" with their imaginative language is simply boring and it made me very uncomfortable to touch the genitals all the time. But the worst of all this nonsense is the inexpensive attempt to grab the attention of this film, referring to German history and showing the sensitive aspects of "heroes", which culminates in showing how Erkan and Stefan look after a mentally ill woman. their "happy" lifestyle (!). But I did not expect better from the director Michael "Bully" Herbig, who also directed two little funny TV shows, a not-so-funny Western movie and a humorous SF movie that was almost not funny. But Erkan and Stefan had been a little better in some of their stand-up programs. For me, the only good thing about the movie is Alexandra Neldel, who is very beautiful for me.
