This film was pathetically ugly. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects nauseating. If you have a life do not see this movie, you will want to kill yourself. This film totally removes Blade (which is undoubtedly a very good movie ... or a trilogy, I should say). <br /> <br /> I do not care who the actors are, this movie is just awful. I watched for 10 minutes and I had to come to my computer and say how bad this movie was. In fact, I do not know why my family still looks at it ... oh, wait, yes. They almost constantly mock stupid action, dialogue and action.
