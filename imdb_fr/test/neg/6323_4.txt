George Segal lives with his elderly, senile mother. There are many jokes about her dementia similar to Alzheimer's disease and most of them are not funny, even though there have been some fun moments scattered here and there (like the nakedness that runs through the scene In the beginning, Segal tries to kill his mother because she is difficult to live with and because he is a selfish guy. Making the film a bit like a Wiley Coyote against the Roadrunner comedy where he tries again and again to kill that indestructible girl would have been a joke - pity that this is NOT the general tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> I applaud Carl Reiner's attempt to make an insipid film in order to offend everyone. I have a special place in my heart for films like ED AND HER DEAD MOTHER, Eating RAOUL and HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS - all the movies about death that dare to offend. The problem here, though, is that O IS POPPA? There are fun times, but there is also a lot of food and the overall product is incredibly bland. In addition, topics such as homosexual rape, incest and others are really hard to make funny. I read in "THE GUIDE TO CULT FILMS" that it is considered a cult movie, although I can not see anyone wanting to see it more than once.
