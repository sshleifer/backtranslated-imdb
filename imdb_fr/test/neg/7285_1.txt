I'm sorry to say that, but I did not like this movie at all. It was too boring. So annoying that I could not watch the rest. It's not as interesting as the lion king or Aladdin. That's why I hate those stupid days because these days are just not what they were. The movies recently released by Disney are really worthless! The old days when they produced good movies like The Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, The Aristocats and Robin Hood I missed. This movie is really awful. I really tried my best to be interested in this film, but I simply could not. I do not think I can recommend this film to anyone. I would recommend the ones I just mentioned above.
