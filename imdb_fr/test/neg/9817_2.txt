A nonsense done in a surprisingly amateurish and inept way - or perhaps many since the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, likelihood, suspense, etc. other prodigious failures of Fritz Lang. (I thought the German ambassador was actually played by Lang, but apparently not - they could have been twins.) If you can not predict the end to multiple time zones, you're not alive. <br /> <br /> I was impatiently waiting for this DVD and I was totally surprised and disappointed by such shit (even with George Sanders and John Carradine - maybe I can change my mind by looking at Viaggio in Italia instead and for the umpteenth time). <br /> <br /> Does anyone want a DVD used once? (There may be a film to make the achievement of this atrocious movie and the fact that so many talented people could be wasted if completely.)
