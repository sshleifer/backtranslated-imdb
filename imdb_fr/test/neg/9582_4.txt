I can not believe how many critics say it's realistic. I am a million miles away from an expert and I will never climb a mountain; but even the basic knowledge gained from reading Into Thin Air and watching Everest Beyond The Limit and a few other Everest documents made this movie even more ridiculous. There are good climbing sequences at the start; and when the billionaire chef de mission asked at the beginning of the film "What experience do you have over 8,000 meters?", I was encouraged to hope that it would be a realistic odyssey. and realistic opposing man and nature. Instead, you have a group of mountaineers climbing a mountain without acclimatizing; climbing with goggles in full sun, they are barely out of breath doing miraculous endurance feats. A little fatigue is suggested only near the top, to dramatically increase the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous peak, almost afterwards. If you do not know mountaineering, take a look: get ready for heroic shots (but no more clich√©s than a hundred exciting movies), and a cliche result. I developed a small fascination for the high mountains and I was eager to watch K2; but apart from some incredibly beautiful scenery, it was disappointing because it was so far from reality. I can imagine that experts are employed in the making of this film, but then they are conveniently ignored in the pursuit of the heroic and unfortunately fantastic scenario. In addition, you would look a lot like a tit if you said "welcome to the zone of death" at 200,000 feet.
