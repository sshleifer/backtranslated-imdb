Dante would be mortified if he knew that his masterpiece was being shattered !!! The actors who played the puppets are also sold. Because playing a puppet does not play, it's basically doing nothing. Nobody will really care who the puppet was. people only care about those who played a major role in a movie. It's just annoying to see how you could make fun of such an incredible man and his belief in this little silent film. It should be a crime and .... I can not believe you'd ruin a book like that. I thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and had to be destroyed !!!! It totally ruins what you expect to get by reading it. You just made a big joke.
