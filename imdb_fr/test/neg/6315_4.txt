This movie is based on the Street Fighter Alpha series (or Zero)! It is placed in a different setting than the Streetfighter animated movie! This film is all about Ryu who is accompanied by Ken and Chun Li. I recognized Rose, Zanghief and Birdie! There were no other characters from the video game (which I could discover)! The fight scenes were ok but nothing really spectacular! And they were not numerous! For me it's strange! Streetfighter does not fight! The animated film Streetfighter (1994) is far superior to this film. He tries to be more than he really is! The use of "Hada Power" and other supernatural elements has nothing to do with character skills in the video game! And in this case, it's a bad thing! The story is so boring that you do not really care what's going on! The action is considerably lessened! Why? And what happened to other characters in the video game! They are surely more interesting than the villain in this story! The main attraction of the video game are the characters having their own special skills! In this movie, everything is about Ryu! That's why this anime fails!
