Mickey Rourke hunt Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard's Killshot It's not like Mickey Rourke really disappeared. He had a series of constant appearances before returning to the stage. He was memorable in: Domino, Sin City, Man on Fire, Once upon a time in Mexico and Get Carter. But in his dramatic and dramatic performance in The Wrestler (2008), we witness a complete presentation of the character evoked in Get Carter. Whenever we know him, Rourke remains a slender, light but muscular and muscular ball. <br /> <br /> This is a story and a production of Elmore Leonard. Leonard has written remarkable films like the 3: 10 western thriller on Yuma, Be Cool, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, 52 Pick-Up and Joe Kidd. It means that we have hard, some good, some not so good. <br /> <br /> It also means that we get accurate and realistic intrigues and that the characters do what is best for them in every situation, turning the complications into violent conclusions. . Killshot is no different. The hard and thin ball killer, Rourke, tries to marry the married witness, Lane, badly. Think the history of violence does not meet any country for older men. It's not as intense, bloody or bloody as those two, but it's almost as good. If you like these two films, including David Croneberg's Eastern Promises, just as fantastic, you'll also love Killshot. <br /> <br /> Director John Madden did not make a lot of movies. His latest achievements have been pleasant, if not unsuccessful: Proof, Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. <br /> <br /> Diana Lane has not had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful. Lately, she is charming and seductive in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe, Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun. She is just in focus, balancing her sexy appeal with a reserved tension. <br /> <br /> This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. Yet, Dawson does a good job with it. You see a lot more of Lane, including an underwear scene to compete with Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. <br /> <br /> While you're in the crime dramas section, also take Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang, and Gone Baby Gone, and before the devil knows about your death. The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. <br /> <br /> Killshot flopped at the box office. More is our chance. It's definitely worth a 3-4 dollar rental, if you like that. 20/06/2009
