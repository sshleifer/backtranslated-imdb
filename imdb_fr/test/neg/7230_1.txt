Oh wow, the character shares my name and surname! Notch! This film is as bad as the first, if not worse. At least there is a real octopus in this movie. A real octopus that looks better in this movie. In better, I mean, "Longer" the acting is pretty dry and it's hard to miss. Just to tell you that when this 90 minute film ends, you are not only released from your couch, but you have the ability to breathe again. Not only that, but you realize how stupid you are, then you commit suicide, realizing how horrible life is after watching this movie. Really, it shows how desperate horror movies are today, more shit like this is coming true and where the devil have been the real masters of horror lately? This film should have been the water drop, so we can bring cinematic geniuses back to horror movies, which could actually make GOOD good horror movies modern, this film bites.
