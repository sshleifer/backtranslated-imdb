Disney's ridiculous film about a student who accidentally discovers a potion that makes things invisible. This is not a bad idea and some of the special effects are very good. Still, the script is VERY bad ... all jokes fail and the acting is ugly. Everyone is trying to be funny and they are not. A real boring and stupid movie of Disney. But it was fun to see Kurt Russell so young.
