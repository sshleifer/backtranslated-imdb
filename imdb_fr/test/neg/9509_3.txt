Certainly, the only reason I watched this movie - for about ten years since it was released - was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrait of my second favorite character in this room. In any case, this film is as serious as everything that the Old Zeff has produced since "Jesus of Nazareth". But some of the best parts of the room have been left out. I understand the choices of realization / editing, but I do not think it really does justice to the piece. Maybe I'm too purist. I should lead people (who have read so far) to Branagh's version, otherwise I disregard his tendency to over-dramatize. He still plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But then, did not we all wait for Gibson to prove himself as an actor? Now, all he has done is prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages. <br /> <br /> ... Maybe the only actor worthy of Shakespeare here is Scofield as The Phantom.
