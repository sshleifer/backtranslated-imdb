The only reason I registered on this site was the opportunity to write a comment on this film. I felt that I had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it. <br /> <br /> The movie "Babas Bilar" must be about the worst film I have ever seen. I really believe that the scenario may have been able to become a very good movie or at least OK, but something is happening on the line. What makes it even stranger is the fact that the cast seems to be quite good on paper. Put into practice both scripts and the distribution fails to deliver. There is too much action, it happens to a lot of things and you can not ask why this is happening. And then, the actors make such an effort that you almost start crying. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time, I would say you can see it. If no, do not do it.
