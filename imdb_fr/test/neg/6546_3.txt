This film has some good performances and that's it. Leaders, especially Pauley Perrette, are attractive. (Although some players seem to be acting from a teleprompter.) Hardware - that's the problem. I feel like the screenwriter / director watched Felicity's entire series in one sitting, then sat down to write a screenplay without falling asleep. It really reminded me of Felicity - a thoughtful young woman who finds herself, finds love, with a moving approach to the characters and their relationships. Except that while I loved watching Felicity, this film left me cold. The writing is just horrible. It's amazing that the cast can go as well, because the dialogue is dull at best. At worst, it becomes banal, elevated and amateurish. There is nothing original here, with recycled plot elements from gadgets that were not so brilliant at first. (The angels and fortunetellers? Come on.) During the first half of the movie, I focused on the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience. In the second half, I just wanted it to end already. My sympathies to the actors, who deserved a better vehicle for their talents.
