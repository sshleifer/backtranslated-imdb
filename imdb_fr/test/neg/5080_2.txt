Seeing the names of the main actors (Statham, Snipes and Phillippe), I thought that the film should at least be decently funny or interesting. Instead, all I received was not just boring for 92 minutes, but the frustration of knowing everything that was about to happen and hearing tons of lame, lousy sentences. that the movie does not have a good story to begin with. And when you have that, no one can help you, neither Statham nor Wesley Snipes ... even John McClane could not have saved this movie :-) It could be cool for kids, if they do not have over 12 years old, because they do not care so much about the story, and there are big explosions in the movie.
