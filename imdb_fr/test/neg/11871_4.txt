Let's be clear: I really like the work of Snipes. Unlike his other contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme), he can play. This film, however, does not improve its reputation. it's not entirely unassailable - but I'm in no hurry to see him again. In fact, if I never saw it again, it would not bother me - there are just a lot of the best movies on the market to ruin me! It's a shame, because with a little imagination and some subtle changes, it could have been an interesting movie. Instead, the director chose to almost try to bludgeon his audience with too much violence and too little characterization. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem is Snipes co-star Silvia Colloca. It puzzles me to see that the producers of this film have bothered to hire a beautiful and talented actress, like Miss Colloca, to give him a character as pathetic to a dimension with which to play. If she was hired to just add a little "glamor" to the movie, she does not even do it very well; there is no nudity in the film and no sex scene deserves to be mentioned. Strange, really. Given the amount of violence in this film, it embarrasses me to understand why producers have adopted such a conservative attitude towards sex and nudity. Do we live in 2007 or in 1957? What the producers of this waste (and probably the actors too) have forgotten is that the films are supposed to be fantasies. Like most people on this planet, my real life is very boring. I'd love to sue terrorists, be able to behave like Mr. Snipes, and be around a beautiful girl like Miss Colloca. This film does not satisfy any of these fantasies. That's precisely why I give him such a bad review!
