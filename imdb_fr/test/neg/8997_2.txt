After reading the most eulogistic comments on this film, I decided to rent it despite some suspicions of TV movies. I should have followed my instinct. <br /> <br /> I tried so hard to prepare myself for the film and to find merit, but I simply could not. The story never attracts you or sounds right and the acting is superficial at best and laughable at worst. In this production, everything is amateurish. <br /> <br /> Mary McDonnell is still the only artist to be able to escape this disaster without harming his career or reputation. I will not even bother to check the name of the first man. I hope he will come back in the ads. <br /> <br /> Even the poor Vanessa Redgrave, that I love and I respect, channeling Katherine Hepburn seemed the whole time. if she was really drugged at home. Maybe she needed that money. <br /> <br /> If I can save a person from losing 100 minutes on this tripe, I will feel justified.
