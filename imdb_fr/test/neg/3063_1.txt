Some people may remember Ms. Russell's films such as "Black Widow," which had an appeal and praise from critics. Damn, she probably needed a rent check to sign the dog. <br /> <br /> Yes, there will be some who like gratuitous violence and nudity. But we must ask the question and ask ourselves, in retrospect, what appealed to anyone who would spend money and time to do so. I just saw this movie on one of the "HBO" and I can not believe they picked it up. <br /> <br /> In 1996, Ms. Russel did not enjoy the physical appeal she had before in her career. . But go! Have it play My Barker ??? His "sons" all seem to be brothers. It is also disturbing in that you think there will be incestuous relationships (fortunately there is none, hope it does not count as a spoiler). With Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano added to the cast, it's all about B-movie video. <br /> <br /> The scenes between Purvis and Ma Barker, in person or on the phone, are a bait in terrible, terrible actor. Oh, wait, I've forgotten a terrible writing too. Chalk this one to experience. A bad experience.
