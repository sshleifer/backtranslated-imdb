The only reason I did not fall asleep during this movie is that the seats were not very comfortable. Hannibal is BORING> BORING> BORING and BORING !!! This film is appalling, not because of violence or graphic mutilations. It's actually pretty tame in this regard. The story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. I have the impression that director Ridley Scott has just called this one. The actors are all well, they just need direction. The score is also very annoying. This is particularly noticeable since so little is happening in the film. It looks good but it's not a good enough reason to see it. By the way, did I mention that it's boring? <br /> <br />
