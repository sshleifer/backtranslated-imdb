I guess the previous movie "House" was a success, which pushed Universal to shoot a few more drops of the monster cow. The creative team had to be in a recycling mood, starting with the opening theme addressed in "Son of Frankenstein" and some of the animated footage scattered throughout the film, like an involuntarily funny piece of drama where the Glenn Strange's footage as a monster is mixed with Karloff clips of Bride from 1935, and compared to Strange's robotic way, Karloff seems to move like a cheetah in comparison. <br /> <br /> The continuity of the previous film is set aside, about the miraculous death-cheaters of the werewolf and Dracula, but when Dr. Edelmann & Larry Talbot discover the monster of Frankenstein with the skeleton representing Boris Karloff, Edward T. Lowe acknowledges at least part of the film's story, though Talbot never strangely mentions having met Karloff Dr. Niemann's. <br /> <br /> Since this will be Universal's last cycle of horror, the supernatural elements of The Wolf Man and Drac are (unconvincingly) transformed into medical ailments. Drac is told that he suffers from a blood disease, a very rare disease that allows him to turn into a bat or evaporate if the sun touches him. >: -] And Larry Talbot just has some pressure on the brain. Of course, all this is explained with great care, a "medical jargon" being often used in many scenes. This turns out to be the biggest obstacle, as filmmakers seem to forget horror or entertainment somewhere instead of giving monsters conditions that seem to be treated like flu. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of the old Universal horrors, it's rare that I feel so bored looking at one. It all looks like a movie that was done just because it could be, but if that mess had not been slapped, the monsters might never have met Abbott and Costello, so I guess that was had positive effects.
