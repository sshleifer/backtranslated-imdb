I rented this film in a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book on which it is based or the film itself, only because it is one of the few unknown jewels that can be discovered from time to time. time and that we can really appreciate. . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies. I'm not sure whether it's a sentimental film or a deliberate agenda, but some of it has made immersion impossible. It is supposed to portray a community of struggling immigrant workers who are trying to cope with the harsh realities of their lives. This is a good premise that could have been a captivating story, but the execution has just made me alternate between annoyance and amusement in front of ridicule. <br /> <br /> Here we have a community of simple farm workers. who have emigrated to the United States looking for a job and who have become accustomed and abused many times by evil white men. And when I say evil, I mean evil. All whites in this film are sinful, racist, sadistic and abusive demons, whose only goal in life is sexual depravity, intimately linked to the exploitation of poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it was not so unintentionally grotesque and so hilarious. <br /> <br /> The representation of immigrants is also an example worthy of exaggeration, except that it goes in the opposite direction. The immigrants are holy, clean and could serve as an ointment to boo-boos and other countries around the world. I could not help but laugh at seeing these "field workers" digging in the ditches all day long with their notoriously clean clothes and chiseled haircuts in a top-class barber shop. A little restraint and a more impartial hand at the helm could have made this movie a much better movie evoking a desired emotion rather than sarcastic snickers.
