There is a reason to call it a teenage movie. Out of 100 possible points, I would put it somewhere in adolescence. It's predictable, the acting is horrible, especially minor roles, and most importantly, it's super predictable. The end is so hokey that I should have left early and maybe it would be over. By the way, could you call the male leader a pervert? I bet if it really happened, someone from my school district would have said so. Finally, in the school where I grew up, even though the middle class had more than 1,000 students, we could have chosen a guy like Josie as a fraudster and we would have pushed her out of the crowd. My last word is to save your time when it comes to watching something better like stock prices.
