Italian filmmakers like to rip off American films. All our movies, and as often as possible. <br /> <br /> I do not say that as an insult to Italy as a whole, but I would also like to point out that the Italian film industry is doing a lot of harm in allowing such transvestites to go to Italy. abroad. by the whole world. That's all I say. <br /> <br /> And the Italians are no more seriously hurt than not to inflict a severe penalty on those who have made the world look "Shark rosso nell'oceano" - which is certainly a scam " jaws "much better (as if you did not know it). <br /> <br /> Let's dive into the plot (get it? Haw-haw ...): this A huge monstrous swim that looks like a cross between an octopus, a shark and Steven Tyler attacks many Innocent (Italian) Americans off the coast of Florida (Italy) and the fearless Peter (Sopkiw) who sips beer with his anorexic girlfriend and his beer and other people whose main purpose is to be devoured by creature, killed by mysterious forces that want the creature to be left alone or just stand around and otherwise be useless (and suave beer). or to be the doctor of this film which repeatedly defibrilises dying patients (20, perhaps 30 times in a row) without waiting for its blades to recharge (must be A sacred battery, there, doc). <br /> <br /> Then there is the monster ... brother, if you thought that the shark "Jaws" was a fake, look below and change your mind immediately. <br /> <br /> This is an after-the-fact film (with a Bava!), mounted with an onion chopper, interpreted by ambulatory wood chips (pouring beer) and written by people ( pressing beer) which should never again be left near a typewriter, movie studio or big city of the world. If this is how the writers of this film think that real people are acting in such a situation, they have obviously made too many zombie movies. Or iced too much beer. <br /> <br /> Shall I say that this film is bad? It's: bad like green cottage cheese; wicked like a Hawaiian shirt to a formal wedding; bad as the skits "Bad Theater" Dan Aykroyd used to host on "Saturday Night Live"; bad like Calista Flockhart weight gain tablets - get it? Well. <br /> <br /> Mike and the gang SOL repeatedly slap this beautiful woman stuffed with beer and reveal this "horror" movie in the following form: horrible. However, with a certain European charm: it is charming, when it is watched by a European - preferably a beerman. <br /> <br /> No star for the waterlogged dead fish known as "Shark rosso nell'oceano"; six stars for the MST3K version. ... and now, whoever for a beer? <br /> <br />
