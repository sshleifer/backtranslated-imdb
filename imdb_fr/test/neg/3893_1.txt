Now, do not get me wrong, I love a good movie and after watching The Thin Red Line (and having loved it), I was looking forward to seeing Terrence Malicks two previous movies, and, after watching Days of Heaven, my enthusiasm to see The Badlands have virtually disappeared. <br /> <br /> I talked a lot about praising beautiful photography, but I saw this film on a terribly old VHS tape that made it pretty awful. All I can say is that I hope the photography was great because it was one of the only things of interest in this film. Since the replacement killers did not fall asleep during a movie. This film was so long (and it was not!), The editing was jerky and incoherent, the non-existent scenario, the voiceover was an inconsistency, the characters were poorly developed and everything was insoluble. I know Malick did not know how to do the movie. As a result, he shot a lot of footage and then spent about two years editing to try to reconstruct everything. This is very obvious on the screen. Everything looks chopped up, every time a scene seems to be gaining momentum (or character development), it's cut down by boring scenes of people doing boring things. It was as if someone had tried to cut together a story about archive footage of people working in agriculture. The few good points are the music and the hunting scene towards the end, but these things are not close enough to maintain interest. I would normally let a bad movie go without being too vocal, but when it is so overrated, you have to say something. <br /> <br /> Maybe a farmer would like that ...?
