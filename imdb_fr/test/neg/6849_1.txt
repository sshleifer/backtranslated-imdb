To really enjoy this movie, you had to be present (actor?) Or have been a member of the team. <br /> <br /> Yes, I am "Selena" and, at the age of 42, I have serious doubts about what we did / did. <br /> <br /> It all started as a story of the genre "John Waters", bad friends acting in bad movies. Somewhere on the line, the fun stopped, the people who were supposed to be friends no longer spoke, and ADB was getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> I regret the bad image that I could have projected. Golden elastane trousers, size one) <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film cries so much that I would not even watch it by my mother. <br /> <br /> To my director, the actors and the team I say, <br /> <br /> "Why can not we all hear us <br /> <br /> That makes more of twenty, people !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!
