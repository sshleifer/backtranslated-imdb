I saw the movie yesterday and stopped it at half-time because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea of ​​making a film through the eyes of a chef - one of the "bad guys" in most fantasy and medieval movies - is great and offers a lot of possibilities, but ... the film could not catch any. I did not feel any of the characters, the plot was too predictable (to the point that I followed it) and the second jump in the story made me leave. Those who expect a deep insight into the emotional situation of a group leader in the Middle Ages, a social group at the time, might be disappointed.
