OK, that will contain spoilers. Now, I have never seen such a big pile of poop since laxatives / food mix with the elephant pen in the zoo! There are more holes in the plot than lace devoured by butterflies and the "realistic" plot. Sexual slavery is a formidable and very real world problem, and this pile of holds is using this plague as a means of plotting to titillate and tease, which is a shame for everyone involved in this questionable judgment. But back to the movie, if you want to kidnap people from an airport, some of the safest and most enjoyable places for cameras in the modern world, then why plant a stool inside the van that fucks everything up? the plot needs a twist. Wait until you get out of the airport, take out the gun, handcuff the passengers, drive calmly to the warehouse and kill the guys, the job is done. On the passenger side, at least three times, the gentiles have neutralized the bad guys and are armed, WASTE THEM! Once in a movie, it may just be acceptable not to put a bullet in the skull of the bad guys, but COME ON THREE times! And after he killed most of you. Also, the guy is ready to put the gun to stop a marked cheek, but kills a girl for a yeast infection that could be brightened with drugs worth $ 20. I could go on and over the number of holes, but I will not waste any more time. Suffice to say that I have rarely been so insulted by such an awful act and that, with regard to the real problem of sexual slavery, girls voluntarily go to new "jobs" in far-off countries and are abused, raped and often killed by the master gang who meets them from the boat / plane and takes their passports and freedom. It is an insult to all those whose lives have been affected! Do not waste your time!
