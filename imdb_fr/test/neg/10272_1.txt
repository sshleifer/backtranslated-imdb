In simple terms, this mini-series was terrible. Let me count the paths. 1. Absurd plot. 2. over-acting. 3. Scattershot approach of the characters. 4. Boring narration. 5. Inability to arouse the interest of the viewer. <br /> <br /> This film does not even pass the test "Soap Opera for Dummies". I'm sorry I did not read this award-winning novel. I only judge it as a movie, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where they will show you dozens of snacks. You look at the wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are removed and you wonder where they went. It's like this movie, with too many characters introduced and never drawn. There are enough stories and characters in this film to create a series of 20 episodes, but we have less than four hours to digest everything. <br /> <br /> There are more facial expressions and reactions from Ed Harris than you. I will find about 10,000 monkeys. The pace is extraordinarily slow. <br /> <br /> Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so overwhelmed that their characters are not credible. Joanne Woodward's character is one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The persistent metaphor of the river becomes banal. <br /> <br /> And probably the most absurd part of the movie - the cat. This devilish and vengeful cat who follows the hero around him to scratch him and his seat covers - well, go now - it's not even good Stephen King! <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting character of the film John Voss, the disturbed boy, whose last act of desperation is at the origin of the only conspiracy device that works in this film, is one of those who are not well drawn. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this movie is amazing. <br /> <br /> In summary, there is not much here to inspire. The drama is poor melodrama. It's just a terrible effort.
