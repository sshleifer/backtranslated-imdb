Anna Paquin, a neurotic teenager fighting against the "things-who-go-bump-in-the-black" that torment her shortly after her move to their new home in Spain (?!). A little more than a geographically reconstructed scam of "The Shining" and more specifically "The Others", the "Darkness" is basically your typical B-horror characteristic used with some predictable lame predictions. scary that can be seen by the public at one kilometer (so to speak)! In hindsight, I guess I should not have put my personal expectations so high for this film to be really good, given the well-known fact that it was put on hold for almost three years before it was finally released around Christmas of last year in American cinemas. the country to what was ultimately the sale of lukewarm notes and very harsh critiques of criticism. When will filmmakers ever learn that there is more to making movies (horror or otherwise) than the mere possibility of a small financial gain? (Turkey-Zero Stars)
