Good grief ... to think that I saw everything ... Danny Thomas looks so out of place in this hodgepodge. He seems really uncomfortable. He can not sing, it's worth licking, and when he's paired with Peggy Lee (PEGGY LEE ???), she does it easily. Maybe the director has seen it and made him do the really bad routines he sometimes does in the movie. Peggy Lee is fine, but it's a disaster. Good for laugh, maybe.
