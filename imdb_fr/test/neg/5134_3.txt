OK, I do not want to upset those who liked this movie, but it was really a bad movie. The way the scenes were set up and the actors' play made me cringe at times. I really tried to appreciate it but it was like a student movie, they had to have the smallest budget. I loved the story to a certain extent and the characters were friendly, but the film as a whole was awful. Also, why is it that in almost every movie with lesbian characters, one of them either either commit suicide, or die, or turn straight?!?! This sends a false and unrealistic message. I gave it 3 stars and everything considered I think it was very nice of me. Watch this film only if you want to laugh at how bad it is.
