This movie deviated from the Bible and fell under the bar of the 1956 film. I hate that they replaced the 2006 film with the 10 commandments traditionally seen. Moses looked like a criminal in this film, not the kind man of Charelston Heston in the 1956 movie. I will not waste any more time watching this movie. They tried so hard to modernize this film to keep you on the edge that it looked more like a soap opera (not a good opera). I am pretty sure that the younger ones who have never paid attention to the original 10 commandments can disagree with me, but in turn. In addition, it took them 10 years to do the first 10 commandments, probably 2 months to do this one. The special effects were not as amazing as the first and after all these years with so much technology, you would have thought they would have done better now.
