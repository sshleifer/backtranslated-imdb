I give this Hollywood trash 1 of 10! Seriously! I mean, I like comedy as much as the next. I can also take a stupid comedy and sit down and laugh with her. But this movie had nothing to do with OR. <br /> <br /> I like almost all the actors of this film. So I thought I forgot what many people told me about it (my fault for not listening). I was just mortified of the stupidity of this script! Just ridiculous and not even fun. The only fun scenes were in the excerpts that everyone saw at the movies watching other movies or television. I was very disappointed and I would really like to know why these actors, otherwise relatively good, would read this script and register anyway to be there! Bad decision on their part ... <br /> <br /> *********************** MAJOR SPOILER ********* ** ************* <br /> <br /> Okay, here's my biggest question about this movie ....... If the characters come back on this story of Jewel (Liv Tyler) afterwards .... so how can Paul Reiser go to a therapist remembering the past!?!?!?!? He dies in the last scene being crushed by the dumpster !!!! Can someone answer me?!?!?!?!? Major blunder of filmmakers ..... Nobody noticed that?!?!?!?!?!?!
