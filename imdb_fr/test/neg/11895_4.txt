I saw that last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and the sacred god was mean. From script to editing, through filming, cinematography, nothing worked. Not to mention the scenography / costumes were so bad for the period (this goes from the late 70's to around 2006). Even John Hurt, who is usually a great actor, was completely ridiculous. Quinten Crisp is an extravagant guy at first, but Hurt did not work here. I do not know much else to say except for the public with whom I saw him with absolute passion ... so maybe it's just me. But the public loves everything that happens in film festivals when it sits next to the director and all the actors. This is not a very accurate test of the quality of the film or its quality. Personally, I found this film terrible. On the other hand, it was so horrible that it was hilarious. Get drunk and try it when it's on HBO in 2 years, if it's ever so far away.
