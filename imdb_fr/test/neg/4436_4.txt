Quintet marks the only venture of Paul Newman and director Robert Altman in the field of science fiction. It was said of Newman that he could not do comedy, but he tried until he got a real success in this genre with Slap Shot. But the failure of this film makes him shy and he never tries it again. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest downer movies I've ever seen. It's a futuristic ice age, caused by who knows what, but presumably it's a nuclear winter. Even during the ice age of thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of the Earth still maintained animal and human life, but apparently not here. The seals have survived and Paul Newman is an outside sealer. <br /> <br /> But the hunters need a little rest and relaxation and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring that the natives have some kind of game with six people and it's is a kind of Russian roulette. To win, you must kill five other players in your game. <br /> <br /> It's a sad turn to see what the man has come down to. That's one of the reasons I could not get into this story. The atmosphere is dark, the story is dark, the people are dark, everything is so dark. No wonder this case ended in a box office failure. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that almost everyone thinks will never be ranked in Paul Newman's Top Ten list, including myself. <br /> <br /> It's the future of man, what a nuisance.
