My friends and I often joked about the fact that the movies were in real time. But this film is really ... They will literally show 4 minutes of strait, just a guy who digs in the mud with his hands. There is no intrigue, and an incredible amount of free screams. Honestly, I do not think he won an award for his so-called suspense. If you're like me and you've seen the first movie and love it for its horrific gameplay, accidentally hilarious liners, and low-budget "budget," it will not matter; it's so bad that bad memories could even erase and alter all the good memories of the original. You would be more entertained if you looked at an empty screen.
