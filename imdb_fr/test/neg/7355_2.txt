This film is so daring that it does not try to hide its similarities with The Shining. It lacks the originality to do it. And when he does, towards the end, try to conceal his story of "psychopathic father going under the influence of a haunted house in a foreign place", he does it by bending to many other conventions and ideas already established. In other words, it is reduced to a simple cliche. But damn, even me, I enjoy a good horror or predictable thriller, as long as there is an interesting story, full of violence and coolness, somewhere before the film takes a frightening turn to reality . Well, this movie does not have a good story and I was really disappointed. What "Darkness" wants is a remarkable direction and cinematography. It's a well-shot and carefully constructed film, full of fun, scary angles and shots. What 'Darkness' does not have is just about everything else. Let's start with a small problem: the editing of this film is odious. He jumps from one scene to another, sometimes unnecessarily. For example, the old man in the film (which bears almost the background story, later filled by another character) is underlined by a circle of hamsters. I mean, it looks cool the first time, but why keep using the same image? I guess you should see it yourself, to understand what I mean. Another problem with this film is the character of Anna Paquin who moans throughout the film, crying and caring too much about everything - it's the failed attempt of the horror film directed by a character. The film presents scenes of exaggerated sentimentality and the family drama he describes is simply not credible. In the end, "Darkness" is a confused melodrama, with a non-engaging mystery endowed with a too simple end. And it's scary.
