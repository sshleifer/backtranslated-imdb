The script of this movie is indistinguishable from others, including The Core, another bad movie. Why does Luke Perry not get a lot of work, but it's sad to see the beloved commander, Major Worf (Michael Dorn), resigned to that. <br /> <br /> a rebound that does not come to a kilometer and a half. This is not an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> The special effects are very poor, even against the standards of television. The lava flow at the beginning of the film, signaling the upcoming global disaster, sets things off to a very amateur level. And it's not going better from there.
