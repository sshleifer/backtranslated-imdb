I decided to watch this film because I had never seen Carol Lombard in any movie. I'm sorry that this one because, frankly, it's a dog ?? and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both excellent actors. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too fast in the story of a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) less an hour after his meeting. What is this cliché? Get married in a hurry, repent at leisure ... <br /> <br /> In short, the story is a series of episodes that show the deterioration of the financial situation of couples, their troubles with the John's resident mother, their difficulties paying bills, John's decreased status at the office, the arrival of their baby, John Jr (unexpected and causing further friction at home with his mother), the anxiety of couples at home about their marriage, the worsening baby's disease, requiring a heroic flight by a single pilot (in a violent storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally for John to be accepted as a junior partner from the law firm. <br /> <br /> How many more cliché situations could writers understand? Maybe mom dies shortly after? There was not much comedy; the drama was dull at best; the dialogue was painful to hear. Only the game of the four main actors was adequate. <br /> <br /> It was the period of the end of the Great Depression, the United States coming out of their long crisis ?? during which many people have experienced all the events described in the film. <br /> <br /> So it made sense for Selznick to reaffirm the values ​​of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance and initiative? ? all in the context of the "average" American family. Who better than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /> <br /> And, it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939; yes, it was planned in 1938 ?? shortly after the United States began producing for the second world war. Therefore, this type of film has been a great stimulant for the general public. At the time, many of those who were soon to join England in the war. As many know here, Hollywood and Washington formed a precarious alliance before, during and after the war. <br /> <br /> However, I'm happy to have seen it ?? as a disguised socio-political propaganda. But I will have to see other films in Lombardy to get a better idea of ​​her role as an actress. <br /> <br /> As another critic noted: see this one just to say that you've seen all of Stewart's films; otherwise, do not bother.
