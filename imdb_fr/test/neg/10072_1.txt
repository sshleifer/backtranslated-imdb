This film was perhaps the biggest loss of 2 hours of my life. From the 10 minutes of opening, I was ready to leave. The clich√©s that slap you in the face, and the plot was not only predictable but also full of holes that Swiss cheese. I plan to continue for those 2 hours lost, and $ 6.25, in addition to the fact that I am now more stupid to watch this waste of film. The T-Rexs have to rock in their graves, so to speak.
