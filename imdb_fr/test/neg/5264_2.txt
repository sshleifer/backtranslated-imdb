Not to be bored during "Love and Sex", I first tried to think of all the movies mentioned in "Breaking Up" with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek (although their ending was more original), " About Last Night "with Rob Lowe and a lot of TV shows. <br /> <br /> Second, I saw how beautiful Framke Janssen is and I could not believe for a nanosecond that she might have a problem getting an appointment. She's certainly ready to give Julia Roberts a run for her money, literally-- and was not Julia in a movie with that same plot or another? <br /> <br /> Third was trying to understand why the screenwriter / director had bothered to give the character of Jon Favreau the Jewish name of Adam Levy; he even speaks with admiration of eating a ham sandwich. <br /> <br /> Fourth was trying to understand why some critics had commented well and that's why I was at the theater. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 9/2/2000)
