If you are in the mood for a very bad porn without any good porn associated with a very bad horror movie, this movie is perfect for you. However, if you breathe air, be sure to spend your time looking at something other than that. The acting game is zero. The "plot" is nil. They tried too much, and all the time I waited for the only good redemptive scene that could make the movie worthy of interest. Nope. Stick to the scrambled cable.
