OK, what is all this supposed to mean ??? Halloween 6 (let's call it that, OK?) Is without a doubt the most confusing film in the series (and from what I've heard, seeing the original "cut producers" does not seem to make you think of anything less confusing than the "official" version). Such a waste. <br /> <br /> This is not really a bad movie, as some have said. There are scary scenes and quite intense moments - it does not make sense! Do not tell me that Michael was "designed" from the beginning to do evil, kill and destroy, and blah blah blah. It was bad enough when they turned Michael into Jamie Lee Curtis' brother (just to have an excuse to keep it in the second movie) - that's too much. <br /> <br /> It seems that this is another case of the creators of the film trying to be "too intelligent" by proposing a new principle that will shock and impress us all. Bad movement, guys. We are not looking for an explanation of why Michael is killing, so please do not try to feed us that shit. Show me Michael threatening and killing a lot of people. Show me that Dr. Loomis is trying to track him down and, as always, comes at the last minute. Do not lose (what turned out to be) Donald Pleasance's last performance by telling me (in the most puzzling way possible) that Michael was "created" by a cult of hell and that his "seed" will be passed on to another and ... oh, my brother. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 at its moments, do not get me wrong, and we all know there have been a lot of worse things than this one (Hellraiser, do you mind?), so get that you can get out (the scene towards the end of the movie with Michael charging in a dark red hallway is particularly effective) and try to ignore the plot. Let's hope that someday we can all see the "cut of the producer" and perhaps have the chance to give (a little) more meaning to all this. Until then, this will have to be done ... <br /> <br /> -FTM
