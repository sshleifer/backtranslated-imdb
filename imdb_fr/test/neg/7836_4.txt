The story: Alain, a French policeman, is shocked to discover that he had a twin brother when his body is found in Nice. While investigating the murder, he discovered that he was in possession of a list detailing the acts of the Russian mafia. With the help of his brother's girlfriend, Alain avoids Russian gangsters and corrupt FBI agents while trying to find the list. <br /> <br /> "Maximum Risk" is another feature from the long list of action films starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. As for things, it's strictly a formula. The script sticks to clichés and the acting is mediocre. There are action sequences well done, with an inventive car chase, a fight in a building on fire, an escape through the roofs, a brutal fight in an elevator and JCVD ​​fleeing his enemies on a train line elevated position. Director Ringo Lam makes sure everything happens at a reasonable pace.
