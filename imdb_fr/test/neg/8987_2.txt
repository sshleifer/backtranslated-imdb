First, let me tell you that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. So the book may have been great, but the film is not. <br /> <br /> I have lived all my life in the Peidmont area of ​​North Carolina. I have never heard the southern accents as ridiculous as those in this film. I lived in two small towns in North Carolina and Charlotte and Raleigh. On occasion, you will meet people with a strong southern accent, but I have never met a city where everyone speaks as a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind. <br /> <br /> In response to Gore_Won from the atheist community. Your comments reveal more about your distorted psyche than about the movie. If we were to expand our imagination and claim that there is something realistic about this film - what does not exist - then the truth is that bad people, such as Tory's father, will always find a justification for their actions. The author chose religion to counter Tory's supernatural abilities. Your assumption that "the true character of the Gospels" requires a man to beat his daughter is pretty much the most perverse and misinformed interpretation I've ever heard. Before you start talking about the Gospels, you should perhaps read them first. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. The dialogue is flat, unnatural and incredible most of the time. In particular, many of the things Kade told Tory are inappropriate and do not fit the mood, the context, or the way they are said. <br /> <br /> The "exciting twist" at the end of the film is lame, predictable and lacks credibility. Some have also claimed that Jacqueline Bisset did a remarkable job in this film, but the truth is that the bitter mother character is also an obsolete, predictable and one-dimensional character. Is it Bisset's fault? I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you have the choice between watching this movie and having another twenty years of broadcast of the Muppet Show, I recommend the Muppet Show.
