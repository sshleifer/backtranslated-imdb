According to the article from http://blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html, one of the actors of the film, Carina Lau, was forced to appear in this film for free. She was the victim of an infamous abduction shortly before the making of this film. Later, photos of her in distress were published in a magazine, which has since been forced to close and her publisher was sent to jail. The actress denies being assaulted, but there was a leak on a film that would have shown that she had been raped by a gang. (The Hong Kong press, out of respect for her, has for the most part refused to report on the incident, but Google will publish some articles about it.)
