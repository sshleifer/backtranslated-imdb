In general, I am an admirer of Jess Franco's film production, but for some of these films I have a hard time understanding their motivation or even their reason for being. Like this sick puppy, for example. "Sadomania" has absolutely no cinematographic value, it is poorly realized without intrigue and contains some of the most insignificant sleaze sequences ever recorded in a movie. This is another disgusting film about women in prison where rape, lesbian action and violent torture games are a daily routine. The guards are more crazy than the prisoners and the institution is protected by a helpless governor who is only sexually excited when he sees a girl kissing with a dog (!). The girls are all very beautiful and nude throughout the film, but you can not really enjoy this show with all the perversion that happens. Doubtful highlights include a barbaric hunt game (you can guess what it is), a deadly duel between a guard and a prisoner, and the image of a poor girl having a needle inserted into her nipple. Auch! Avoid this sick mess and you will save yourself the trouble of taking TWO baths to wash the dirt.
