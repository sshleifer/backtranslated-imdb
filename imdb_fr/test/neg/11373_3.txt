I gave it a rating of 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> And what's sad is that I took care to watch the movie schedule of this channel so that I do not miss not to see him. I wanted to watch this film because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors, Barbara Wilson. As a lesbian, I thought I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Ms. Wilson felt for the film, but I found her disappointment major. <br /> <br /> It should have been intriguing - it was a mystery - unfolding in Spain, and the main character, Cassandra, is a linguistic translator who is contacted by a mysterious and beautiful woman who offers Cassandra a lot money to locate her ex-husband, Ben. <br /> <br /> Many secrets are revealed, but for whatever reason, it does not matter. It was like, oh, and then. I could not get involved with these characters, come to worry about them or to have interest in them. I could not even identify with these characters. <br /> <br /> I think a big part of the movie's failure was the actress playing the main character. She looked old, tired, exhausted and as dull as a dishwasher. Her hair was in perpetual disorder, her loose clothes were boring and she was neither attractive nor interesting. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie was to hear a recording of Dean Martin, but even that was ruined. by the strange makeup worn by the man who was dancing and synchronized his lips with the song. Believe me, it was nothing to learn to see the beautiful Mr. Martin play it. <br /> <br /> The end is so syrupy that you would like to have pancakes to accompany the syrup. <br /> <br />
