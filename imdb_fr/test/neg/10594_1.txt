The film was slow, the dialogue between actors / actresses seemed "flat" and, basically, the characters of the story did not develop. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was sneaking around with all his time, sulking and looking basically annoyed by everyone. Danes has no magic on the screen, and the character of Ribisi is a character that no one would want to attend even if he was paid to do it. <br /> <br /> Go into the strange scene where Epps has to dance an old man, and you have what could possibly be the worst movie in film history. <br /> <br /> I watched it by satellite (luckily I did not pay for it), and I wish I did not have it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go sort out the drawer of your underwear and socks if you have something to do, but you are tempted to watch this movie when / if it comes out on your TV. Horrible movie if you ask me, and I usually have something good to say about any movie there.
