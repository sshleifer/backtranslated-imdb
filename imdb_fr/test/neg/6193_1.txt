Let me first say that I was a big fan of Carlin. I think George is one of the smartest people and comedians on the planet. What made George's strength in the past was his ability to look at things in a twisted way and give us his unique perspective on these things. it has not always been done to be funny, but you always respected his opinions, because they were presented in a very intelligent way. but you are all sick is just a long speech. it gives us no unique perspective on anything, it just gives us a long list of things for which it works. there is no intuition, no intelligence, just an old man who complains for an hour in a row about things we all complained about. and besides, it was not even funny. you are all sick call to stupid people who can not handle anything more advanced than something simple and straightforward. It does not bother me that comedy fuels anger, but George could have done so much better. I really hope that George Carlin's next show will live up to the quality George has shown in the past.
