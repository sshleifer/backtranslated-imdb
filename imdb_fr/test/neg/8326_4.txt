"Black Vengeance" is an alternative title for "Ying hung ho hon" by AKA "Tragic Hero" (1987). I just saw this on VHS, with the first part of the story, "Gong woo ching" ("Rich and Famous"), also 1987. (The poster and the 2 stills presented on the page are for a set of 4 DVDs of movies with Black Pest (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist) .The fourth movie is titled "The Black Six." Strangely, while the characters retain their names originals in "Rich and Famous", in "Black Vengeance", the character of Chow Yun-Fat is Eddie Shaw, Alex Man (Man Tze Leung) is Harry and Andy Lau, Johnny.It is also puzzling that 1994 is the copyright date for both movies Maybe this was the year they were dubbed by Americans According to the release dates given on IMDb, "Tragic Hero" was released before "Rich and Famous". Was there a reason to release the sequel first? Despite the comments of some users, I enjoyed these movies , although they are not among the best of CYF such as "The Killer" and "Hard-Boiled", which are really amazing. However, if one day I discover a set of two films "Rich and Famous" and "Tragic Hero", I will not hesitate to buy it. Let's hope that these comments on "Black Vengeance" clear up what was also a mystery to me as to its place in Chow Yun-Fat's filmography.
