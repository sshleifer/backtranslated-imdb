This series is stereotypical and boring. The episodes are the same every week, just with slightly varied settings. A purely diabolical character performs a despicable act, Walker pursues it and ends with a karate match. The bad guys are super-stereotypical super-bad guys, the good ones are all pure, honest and holy, and the scenarios are simplistic and unrealistic. After about 2 episodes, the series becomes totally unassailable by all fans, except the less informed. Certainly not the best job of Norris. His other work may be clich√©d, but he usually does not hang around for weeks. If you like repetitive, boring and repetitive festivities, then this is for you.
