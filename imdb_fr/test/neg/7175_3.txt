This is a type "barrel" type movie taken from one of the classrooms of the poverty class, Monogram, in the mid-1940s, of the genre to fulfill a double bill. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw was to see what JACKIE MORAN looked like in the lead role of a radio station trying to solve a murder. He had played Phil Meade in GONE WITH THE WIND only two years earlier and this was one of his last teen roles. It's not Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> The scenario is as unlucky as the values ​​of the production and is full of rigged situations with a selection of characters uniformly without talent. WANDA McKAY is the "discovery" switchboard operator for a radio producer and SIDNEY MILLER is the nerdy friend of the hero who is afraid of his own shadow. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the murder ended in an hour is solved after a roundup of all suspects. Terribly exaggerated, JON GILBREATH embodies Tex, the cowboy, but he bites the dust after a too brief appearance. <br /> <br /> There are several songs, but they are all forgettable, as are the jokes and the lame dialogue.
