Very interesting to find another critic who had exactly the same reaction to this film as me: it was much better when I was 10 or 11 years old. <br /> <br /> Seeing him more than 30 years later, it's still going on, but that only interested me a little. What seemed extremely funny at the time was only slightly amusing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the things that surprised me as a 10 year old girl seemed ridiculous. For example, in a scene, Trinity walks, pulls the revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking. In fact, he does not even bother to look and see if they are dead because he knows he hit. Uh, yes, that's right. <br /> <br /> In addition, many dialogues sound more like wood. Sorry, but 35 years later, he has not really aged well. <br /> <br /> Even though I have not seen this one for a long time, probably a better Terrence Hill movie than this one would. be my name is nobody.
