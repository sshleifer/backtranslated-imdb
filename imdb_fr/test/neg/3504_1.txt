I wrote this in two parts. The second part has spoilers. <br /> <br /> Part 1: <br /> <br /> No, this is not the one about sex with car accidents. It's the one about racism in South America. You know, the one where everyone is racist and where race is the subject that worries everyone at all times. Race. <br /> <br /> It's like in the movie a form of turret syndrome where race is the constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Race relations. Relay race. <br /> <br /> Paul Haggis made a film about Magnolia's structure, which was used to show the disconnection of tangentially connected people, then screwed her into a mental vomit of 1'53 "Racism in America RACE In the 24-hour period, we have 7 parallel stories all related and about race.The first hour, people say ridiculous things and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in America. br /> <br /> For example, the story of Ludicrous and Larenz Tate brings comic relief.That's a shame, the first part of their story is taken directly from The Situation of Bonnie in Pulp Fiction.RACISM.Their section is the section Quentin Tarantino where, instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion, the characters talk about race and racism CONSTANTLY. <br /> <br /> The other good thing about this is the Mexican history when the Mexican by To his daughter, he gives her his invisible, impenetrable coat to protect her from bullets. Decent writing, but only because writers have had girls and know what they would say in its place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the stories are extremely ridiculous. Hindi does not act like a semblance of realism. The scene where he tries to fix the lock and the Mexican tells him that he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. Why would anyone act like this? Is it realistic? NOOO. It reminds me more of the convenience store clerk at The Doom Generation. "Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents Girly." If I ever watch the second half of the movie, I hope his head is shot and his bodiless head begins to cough with delight. <br /> <br /> I did not mention race in more than one paragraph. RACE. RACISM. RACE FOR THE SUN. Better. Then there's the black guy who wants to be white, Matt Dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against the blacks, Ryan Phillippe who is handsome and who does nothing, and various other bad actors who do wrong with a bad dialogue . When Matt Dillon assaults the black producer's wife, could I help him if I crack? When Philippe decides for the second time to write his partner for racism, can I help but that I crack? The movie is so funny when it's racist. Racist. RACIST, I tell you. <br /> <br /> Now, this film has been nominated for the best film, the best director, the best screenplay and the best editing, not to mention Matt Dillon who actually tried to do a good job. I have no idea who has been paid for this one. <br /> <br /> Do not see it if you do not want to be preached against racism in society through a bad and unrealistic scenario of 2 white men over 50 who have no semblance of reality or of interaction with the real society in any way. <br /> <br /> D- <br /> <br /> Second part: <br /> <br /> The second half of Crash takes all the stories of the first half ... and rejects them in a sort of conclusion, the world is kind of a big coincidence. And it's actually one of the worst ways to do it. <br /> <br /> Take the 1999 magnolia. People were not conveniently connected again and again. They were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know someone who knows someone who has done something and in which you know someone else has also been involved. Crash takes this extremely seriously. <br /> <br /> The stories are aligned for everyone to see each other. Is there only 5 on the LAPD force? Do not these people work strange teams? Dillon and Philippe were late and early the next day? And why should Tate be the murdered hitchhiker? Would not he have more emotional tension and realism if it was someone we had not followed all day? As Phillippe just took a hitchhiker at random, then panic. Everyone would panic. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the second half of the room, the scene of the invisible and touching cloak is used for Hindi to shoot the girl. It made me angry and made me feel dirty. Not that the Hindus fired at the girl, but that they created a beautiful touching scene that she later provoked. It really marked me. To the writers, not to the stage. <br /> <br /> The whole film is false and totally unjustified. The coincidences are far too numerous and require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia, which was moderately connected, it had connections over connections that were really great. The only good side of the second period was the fall of Sandra Bullock. She does not die though. She should have. I applauded when she fell. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the film is that it shoots a magnolia. Not only in the structure, but there is a montage on the song In the Deep where you see everyone being depressed. Magnolia took this and made post-modern comments by singing all the characters on Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately, Magnolia was released in 1999, while Crash was released in 2005. It is difficult to comment on a film that will not be shot before 6 years, but it happened. Somehow. <br /> <br /> Total loss of my time. <br /> <br /> First half: D-; Second half: lowest score ever recorded; Overall: F ---
