Few videos of recent history have been produced as amateurishly as this one - at least none of those of such a distributor. Every image of this film is a plague of the best movies of the past. The word "cliche" takes on a new meaning by a writer / director without talent who should reserve his imagination to less masturbatory efforts that do not harm the spectators. A number of unskilled technicians contribute to the mediocrity of cinematography, laughable makeup and special effects. Unfortunately, one or two of the movie's hilarious actors show a touch of talent that will go unnoticed because of the reputation that this atrocity will produce.
