I watched THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the avowed purpose of refuting this so-called scientific atheist. I do not know where to start because it is a source of stupidity of such richness. <br /> <br /> He is obviously not a statistician, otherwise the chances of the 2/1 of burning him since the dawn of time would have pushed him towards belief in God <br /> <br /> He consider science as a religion and expect us to believe it as God. Just look at the language used in his postulations. <br /> <br /> Regarding faith. This product is widely used in everyday behavior. Think about it. When he goes to an electrician, he thinks he will be properly plugged in and turn on the switch with confidence. When he goes to a plumber, he pulls the chain into his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction. Regarding Faith in Science When I took chemistry classes, I learned that the atom was the smallest particle and that the theory of onion peels was both ignored. I was taught this as the atomic theory "written in stone" so to speak. So, why should we believe a particular scientist when he exceeds the parameters of his field? Dawkins states that religion will be the fall of civilization. Religion is a civilization. Can he or another atheist tell us what civilization was founded and nurtured by atheism, barbarism or savagery, please? He is currently living in the last stages of a civilization based on Christianity and derives all the benefits without giving the source. I found that Dawkins was arrogant, dictatorial, critical, an obvious believer in eugenics and a Nazi in his attitude toward young people. How dare he say what a parent can teach his child? The child is theirs, not the nation and as parents bequeathed their genetics to them, they bequeath their beliefs. His dismissal of Adam as "he never existed" because he had no proof was an example of that same attitude. So, I have no proof that Joe Blogs lives in New York, but he could do it. I have not found the proof yet. It does not deny its existence. I note his argument with the bishop of Oxford that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the Bible. Dawkins does that too. Where does he distinguish between historical document and religious declaration? It is also selective. I heard the lot when Dawkins invented the ALTRUISTIC gene. What stupidity. He is desperately searching for evidence of his farce and, as the inventor of Piltdown Man was invented, we now have this gene called ALTRUISTIC that predisposes us to take care of our youth and other members of our group. The problem is that all animals do it. - not only the monkeys, and with evolution, it is the survival of the fittest. not the nicest and if he really thinks that we are becoming kinder as a race, he does not read the same journals as me, I found his arrogance unexpectedly by declaiming that, as we only have this life, we should take full advantage of it. So how does he relate this to his obvious position as a wealthy European to a poor person in Africa who has seen his family destroyed and probably raped and starving? Will he help her? I notice that all his opposition to religion is a) they go to war. GK Chesterton said that the only war that was worthwhile was a religious war b) we opposed the use of contraception, abortion and homosexuality. All sins against the 6th commandment. It's funny. <br /> <br /> As a Catholic, I find that the reference of the declaration of the dogma of the Assumption by Pius XII in 1958 is wrong. He, Pius, never said that it was revealed to him while sitting somewhere by himself. In case Dawkins does not know it, Apocalypse ends with the last apostle. It would have taken years of advice to Pius and to study documents that have been transmitted to him over the centuries to reach this declaration. Also, as a Catholic, I am satisfied with the dismissal of all religious. what garbage. We fight every day the world, the flesh and the devil. We are the militant church. We are also able to glorify ourselves at sunset and admire the beauties of nature even if we believe in God. The problem with Dawkins was that he had interviewed zealous fanatics and extrapolated them to all of us.
