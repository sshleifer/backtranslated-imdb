Royal Rumble 1988 bored me very well. The rumor itself is rather serene, filled with mid-carders, and a winner who had no interest in winning, and why on earth the main event The Young Stallions Vs The Islanders? half of the crowd left. Jessie Ventura seems to be bored through half of the thing, and you can tell when he says he finds the development of Hogan Vs Andre more interesting. McMahon and Ventura do not have the chemistry of Gorilla and Jessie. <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat vs. Ravishing Rick Rude. A very disappointing match, with too much rest, and a slow pace, slow down this one. When it's like crazy for the last 5 minutes, it's too little, too late. Steamboat wins by DQ. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Dino Bravo tries to set a new bench record, with Ventura marking him. Severe segment, worthless entertainment anything. Ventura is not enough to carry this segment, and even McMahon admitted it was boring. Controversy or not, I lost enough time on this shit. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Women's Team Championship. <br /> <br /> 2 falls out of 3. <br /> <br /> Glamorous girls | C | / W Jimmy Hart. Vs the angels of the jumping bomb. It's the best match of the night, no I'm not kidding! Very exciting things for women's wrestling, and you'll be hard-pressed to find such good things, now for several days. The angels of the jumping bomb were finished and the crowd fought to win the title. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Signing of the contract between Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant. Hogan gets a decent pop, but he has some remarkable remarks about him, probably because it's in Canada. A little too drawn for my taste, but it was necessary for the scenario. He spread the word and had some good moments, but most of the time, I kept saying, "Go ahead". The two sign and Andre puts Hogan's head against the table and sets the table on him. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble match. Royal Rumble very weak, probably due to a delicate rhythm, and the real lack of stellar power. I think Vince was testing the waters with this one, and it showed. Ventura seems indifferent and I do not blame him. Crowd clearly wanted Roberts to win, shouting DDT almost every 5 minutes, and although Duggan had good pop, I do not think he was the winner he wanted, and where did it go? his career? Nowhere. The 1st Royal Rumble of Bret, and he made an impressive performance. It was not so good, but it was pretty dull and there was not enough to do the show, considering it was what the show was based on. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Hogan has an interview with Craig DeGeorge. Standard maintenance with Hulkster, but not with the same madness and outrageous remarks that he usually draws. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Ted and André are interviewed. André says he will give the championship to Mr. Dibiase. Short, but effective. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> 2 falls out of 3. <br /> <br /> The Islanders Vs The Young Stallions. The crowd is completely dead for that, and half of them left for the exit. It's pretty boring and I had no reason to be in the main event. Jessie and Vince seem to be bored and arguing about other things during the match. The islanders win because they took advantage of Roma's injury. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Conclusion. Historically important, I suppose, but there is really nothing to see here. It was a good start for great things to come for The Royal Rumble, and although you can see a glimpse of the potential here, there's nothing here that lets you see. I usually recommend once again for Die Hard Wrestling fans, and since this is the first Royal Rumble event, I guess I have one too, but get ready to get bored as often as possible. <br /> <br /> 3/10
