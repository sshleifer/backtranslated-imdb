Even those of us who love pretty pictures of animals - and I hate them - would have a hard time finding any merit in this tragic parody of a movie. Perhaps inspired by "101 Dalmatians" with his intelligent and loyal dogs, his silly and sneaky humans and his absurd "happy" and predictable ending, the alternative title "101 Turkeys" comes to mind. This would cover just about everyone involved in this unfortunate production. Before I learned, to my horror, that it was actually a Canadian film shot in Victoria, British Columbia, this bogus British theme park in a city, while extirpating money from Ottawa ON tax, is just as phony of Canadian mediocrity. Let me count the ways it's bad. The dizzying plot? The asin script? The dismal performances and the sophomoric direction? Disgusting animals? The endless shots and the predictable slapstick? On reflection, neither I nor those who browse the IMDb have time to draw up a comprehensive catalog of its failures. However, if I detailed its merits, this space would remain empty. Believe me, it's bad. flagship monument of the vast pantheon of cinema (Canadian) really terrible. If you've seen it before, my condolences. If not, move away from the disease such as SARS or bubonic plague. Or other movies with cute animals. Do not even let your children see it, lest their tiny minds be falsified by the even smaller minds of those who financed, fabricated and filmed this appalling madness. Maybe tonight, when I retire, I'll have a nightmare with scary fang beasts coming up from the bed table as I flee frantically. I hope. It will be a much better thing to do than to look at that fucking banal beast. But then, I could dream that I had to look at it a second time and the pure terror and the cold sweats that result make me want to stay awake all night, trembling with the possibility of even seeing it again as a bad dream. I could even find something interesting to watch in its place. Maybe "Godzilla" or "The Attack of Killer Tomatoes" may be the instructional video of my built-in vacuum cleaner.
