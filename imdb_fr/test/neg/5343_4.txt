As a teacher of writing, there are two endings that I never allow my students to use: "Then I woke up" and "Then I was hit by a truck." I will now add: "Then I have a lump on my head." I find it absolutely unfair to use these tips to hide a lack of imagination. The whole question of transmigration could have been handled with intelligence and craftsmanship, but in this film they could not or would not do it. I'm not saying it's totally useless, but its progression is so predictable, except for the stupid end. There are even gangsters who seek help from the police. They should have done it immediately. It's just a horror / sci-fi movie, forgotten, with nothing new to offer.
