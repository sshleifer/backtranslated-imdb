I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this Bunuel movie (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. Bunuel had a longstanding resentment against the Catholic Church and was delighted to try to offend Catholics in a rather stupid way. It's one of the most stupid; almost like what you expect from an 18-year-old smart-aleck movie class. The last minutes of the film, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a last shot for religion. <br /> <br /> If you read the "scholars" about this slow, sometimes funny movie, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If this is indeed the case, Bunuel expresses it in the most diverted way possible. The central character is a nasty bully who loves to kick dogs and knock out blind people on the street, and mentally transform advertisements on billboards into fantastic sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the fault of the church (for interrupting his love life), or is he just a fool? I vote for the latter. I think Bunuel had to have a lot of personal problems and chose to blame the Catholics. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments when you could cry, "ah ah! Surrealism!": A cow in a bed, a giraffe falling through the window (a mediocre model), a man who tears a feather pillow, a woman flushing toilets as we watch images of lava boiling (or a mud pit ... hard to say in black and white). The rest is self-indulgence. Unfortunately, Bunuel still pursued the same idiots until the end of his career (Viridiana, Discreet Charm ...). If you want to see surrealism on screen, discover the first works of Jean Cocteau.
