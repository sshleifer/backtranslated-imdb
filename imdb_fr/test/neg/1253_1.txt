This film is a shameful result of what happens when: <br /> <br /> A) It is written, directed and produced by an idiot. and / or B) It was rushed into production to satiate the craze poker / Stu Ungar. <br /> <br /> The story from the beginning is uneven. Vidmer devotes too much time to Ungar's childhood and not enough to some of the legendary tales - such as counting cards, his blackjack escapades, the money roll as a piece of identification. He also left out the names of other great players such as chip reese, brunson, etc. The film is a complete mess from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you want a more complete and accurate account, read the book One of a Kind. If you thought the movie was good, read the book and change your mind.
