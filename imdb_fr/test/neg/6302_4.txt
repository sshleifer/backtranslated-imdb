"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" is still considered a masterpiece of Australian cinema. I found it quite disappointing. The main actors are awesome - Terence Stamp is aging wonderfully, Guy Pearce should do more comedy than the dark roles he has chosen and I'm a fan of Hugo Weaving since I saw him play a long time ago. The cinematography is excellent, but if you had already been to the Australian outback, you would know that the air is so clear and the light so bright that they could have turned it on the equivalent of Box Brownie and that always would be. have seemed spectacular. <br /> <br /> So what's my problem? Well, three things. First, there is no nice female character in the whole movie. A woman who has to earn a living by shooting ping-pong balls in a roadside pub deserves all our sympathy. Tick's wife is not much better treated. <br /> <br /> Second, the scene where they sing "I Will Survive" to a group of Aboriginal people is shocking. Trying to draw any parallel between the struggles of drag queens and transsexuals and the almost total destruction of the indigenous culture, which I suppose the scene is supposed to do, shows a level of historical understanding worthy of Paris Hilton. <BR/> <br /> Finally, the biggest flaw of the movie is that it's not funny enough. Did Stephan Elliott really talk to drag-queens when writing the movie? Anyone who knows a drag queen (or three or four) knows that most of them have a rapier spirit and are not afraid to use them. Now, I can understand that a lot of drag dredges would probably have gotten the movie ranking refused but Elliott could have put together enough "kid-worthy" material to finish his movie. <br /> <br /> So all in all, a good idea and an excellent distribution.
