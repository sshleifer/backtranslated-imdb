If that were possible, I would have given this sorry an excuse for a ZERO star movie. It was by far the worst I have ever seen. It was like it was a movie at home that some bored high school kids decided to do like a joke. The "game" was horrible. The "actors" did not even react to the fact that they were murdered. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I bought this movie by mistake. The Spanish title said Jeepers Creepers 3, so I thought everything would be fine. False. It was really the worst of all time. I did not go past the stupid movie's 20 minutes. I skipped chapters and nothing interesting never seemed to happen. <br /> <br /> The cameramen were also terrible. It was like a movie at home. I would never recommend anyone to watch this. Terrible terrible stupid movie.
