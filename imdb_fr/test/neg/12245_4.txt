Parody movies have come so far since Mel Brooks in "The Producers" (1968) said, "Do not be silly, be a smartie, join the Nazi party." He brought us some delicious movies, such as "Young Frankenstein", "Airplane!" And even "Naked Gun". But the good ones die young. Fortunately, the genre managed to do it until the end of the 90's. And then ... the Wayan brothers started the apocalypse: "Scary Movie". Suddenly, the word parody was an insinuation for raw sex jokes. Since then, most of the films that claim to be periodontics have followed suit, including "Scary Movie 2", "Date Movie" and the movie to kill the genre "Epic Movie". Of course, there were reliefs. There was "Shaun of the Dead" and "Hot Fuzz". Will Ferell has become a spoofing vehicle close to every sport imaginable. In addition, the Wayans brothers left the "scary movies" and they were made by the reliable Zucker Brothers. Although these films have had some value in the rescue, the genre is tragically doomed to be loved only by pre-pubescent men who have just discovered what an erection is. People who have not explored the term "parody" and cut / pasted movies for a quick laugh No heart, no brains, just cheap glue. Unfortunately, 'The Comebacks' has been added to the list. Dave Koechner (who played in 'Anchorman' alongside Ferrell) leads an underdog team to win against a coach (Carl Weathers of the fame 'Happy Gilmore') who took him back in his coaching role. Koechner has shown promise as a secondary actor, but as a director in this film, it sounds just like a script. It seems too much that he makes a cold reading with passion. In addition, the jokes about being a failed coach, who throughout the film encourages the team to fail at school and who later runs into police underwear, have already been made. Yes, it's a parody movie. But remember that even parodies can have a quality. Give the characters a dignity and a kind of sophisticated vision of modern society. In addition, the use of stereotypes will not make us laugh (who knew that a movie with people who spoke jive could give rise to gangster stereotypes (not really, but you see)). Although I admit to having to laugh at least a few times ... it was not up to par. The football team itself had many stereotypes, including a Mexican, an arrogant jock, a fat guy, the lean nerd and help for the mentally handicapped. Even the only woman on the team was reduced to stereotypical female humor, mostly dressed lightly and giving off innuendo. In fact, his character, as well as most others, never developed. It's a sad state of affairs for this film. If only he was not so dependent on stupid sexual jokes, he could have done something. In fact, this movie will probably be the target of jokes alongside "Epic Movie" for the time to come. Koechner really deserved better. The script in general was poorly designed, even naming the championship 'The Toilet Bowl'. Then yes. Parody movies are dying. There is a movie called "Meet the Spartans" (get ahead of the trend, boycott now!) Which includes a parody about Britney Spears' breakdown. So let these kids keep having erections ... but people grow up and lose them. We need food. One day, they will learn to stop parodying and restore them. Hopefully one of the heroes will be "Get Smart," created by master Mel Brooks, which will be released next year. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5 (stars)
