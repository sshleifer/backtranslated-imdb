This film was recommended to me, so we went to see it together. I would not call it a movie, it's more a combination of 10 different uncompleted and illogical stories, which are not so funny. There are several characters in the movie that seemed important at first, and they simply disappeared from the story. He's just trying to do everything in two and a half hours. I left the show without wondering what happened to each other. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is only a long version of "Hitch", with many more characters and dances. <br /> <If it's the best movie this couple has ever done, then I'm pretty sure I'm not interested in the previous ones.
