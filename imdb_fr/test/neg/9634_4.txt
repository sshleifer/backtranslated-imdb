HANDS OF THE RIPPER <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> An Edwardian physician (Eric Porter) uses a Freudian analysis innovative on a girl (Angharad Rees) who turns out to be the daughter of Jack the Ripper and just as deadly ... <br /> <br /> Improbable Horror of Hammer, in which a respectable personality of the society takes in charge a handsome young man waif without attracting even a whiff of scandal, even when she undertakes to assassinate everyone with a variety of murderous instruments (broken mirrors, hat pins, etc.)! LW Davidson's screenplay wanders from one murder to another, sacrificing the inherent subtext (Porter's obvious appeal to Rees) in favor of a commercial melodrama, and the tone is always discreet . Some gore scenes are surprisingly bright, even for Hammer, and these were cut from the original American version (despite an MPAA R rating), although the full version is now available as a personal video. Porter and Rees give excellent performance. The highlight of St. Paul's Cathedral is certainly a highlight, but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and ineffective. Directed by Peter Sasdy.
