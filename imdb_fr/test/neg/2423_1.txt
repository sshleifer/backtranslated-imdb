Coach Preachy or Straight Sappy. It's bad writing combined with an even worse role. You can choose to drink Gatorade from this special dish after school hours, but I have not done it, not even the 20th anniversary of the Toby Robbins / Islander philosophy: a motivational moment. It's too much posture to be entertaining and not substantial enough to be informative. I have respect for the coach and the program inspired by this film, but the move itself is awful. As a person who has been playing rugby for almost 20 years in the United States, I had hoped to get a better rugby film (even a movie with something to do with rugby). And I can tell you that the Haka performed by a group of Haoles and Icelanders is not intimidating (much like it is played today by the All Blacks, seriously boys, everyone saw it it's time to put it away). If you want a real bullying, align yourself with a group of South Africans (the real ones sentenced to rugby). It is a wrong and badly done film about being a genuine and good person.
