The stylized westerns of Hollywood, full of familiar conventions, seem to have eternal life and it's an avatar. Everything seems to have been torn from the bottom of a 1939 drawer, a larger budget has been applied and this production has become his question. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper played this kind of role dozens of times - the Southerners moved, fast on the draw and firm with honor, although easy, to the extent possible. He plays Blayde Hollister who travels to Texas in search of the gang that destroyed his cotton plantation. He wears a deerskin fringe shirt and packs two six ivory-handled shooters. He speaks with an overwhelmed accent - "A drummer could hurt himself by doing that." (See, "Sergeant York.") The gang is led by laughing Raymond Massey, who buys and sells land, usually by sneaky means, to the extent possible. The group includes Steve Cochran, who can not play a Western although he is very good at garbage bags in general. The required wife is Ruth Roman, daughter of the owner of the Mexican plantation, who looks and speaks Mexican like a Boston brown betty. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'll miss the plot too much. No doubt someone has gone into the details and it is not worth mentioning more. As in all Western 1939, it is labyrinthine. Everyone except Cooper and his friends are devious and there are multiple double crosses, identities exchanged and hidden secrets. <br /> <br /> Everything is retro. Intrigue, dialogue, wardrobe, even music. The score is Max Steiner, the mainstay of Warner. This is the guy who scored "King Kong". It was in 1932. This film was released in 1950. <br /> <br /> The name of Cooper, "Blayde Hollister" - prompted me to browse the records of the RACA - the Real American Cowboy Associaton. - to see if this name figured in their archives, which go back to the beginning of February 4, 1911, day of the death of the last Real Cowboy, following an unfortunate meeting with a peccary disturbed. There has never been a Real Cowboy named Blayde. Hollister, yes, but not Blayde. In fact, there is no record of a Real Cowboy named Wade, Luke, Cole or Matt either. The most popular names for real cowboys, in descending order of frequency, are Clarence, Mortimer, Noble, Nebukadnezzar, Plautus, Pinchbeck and Hortense. <br /> <br /> If this film was released in 1939, it would have been routine. In 1950, it is a catastrophic monument in the history of human recycling.
