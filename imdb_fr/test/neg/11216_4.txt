The young Michael Dudikoff, like the young Lord Greystoke, was abandoned in the jungle of a Pacific island while he was a child. But instead of being raised by the monkeys, he fell into the hands of a Japanese soldier who was still living there because he had not heard that the war was over. And, like the young Luke Skywalker, he fell into the hands and learned the fighting skills of a ninja. <br /> <br /> That's a good thing because they were separated and the young child had a case of amnesia, but fighting skills did not go far. The young orphan, now named Joe Armstrong, enlisted in the army and parked in the Philippines. Meanwhile, his Obi Wan Kenobe performed by John Fujioka is himself rescued and works as a gardener on the planter and terrorist field between Don Stewart with a cheese accent that seems to vary between French and Spanish. <br /> <br /> While these things happen, everyone meets and Dudikoff solves the mystery of a part of his past and saves the daughter of the commander of the villains of this Golan-Globus production. Charles Bronson was getting a little long and Golan-Globus needed a new star for their action movies. Michael Dudikoff pretty well filled the bill and made quite a few movies, including several American Ninja Suites. <br /> <br /> This film is all in action and Dudikoff sends the bad guys at a record pace. What he does not do, Steve James does his best imitation of Rambo and shows his great skills in martial arts. <br /> <br /> The movie has enough holes in the plot to drive you into one of these army vehicles. the story. But that's what worries the public who buys tickets. Dudikoff looks really beautiful, stripped of his battle clothes. No wonder so many sequels have been made.
