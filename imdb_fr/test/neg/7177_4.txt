Two page boys working on a radio network go from trying to solve murders to playing black between two shifts. Jack Moran and Sidney Miller play the lead role in this 1945 thriller. There is a lot of talk, everyone screams after everyone, and the two guys on the page call police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford) . It's a real "short" at 59 minutes, and it has the feeling of being adapted from a play, because it takes place mainly behind the scenes of a radio station. We are not really interested in any of the characters, which probably explains why he is almost never shown. Not serious. It was Phil Karlson's second film as a director. We do not get clues as to who could knock people out, so we're sort of following the police detective and the page guards who are all trying to solve the mystery first. I will say no more not to leave spoilers.
