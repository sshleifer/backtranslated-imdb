A dark and humorous story featuring a cop who has direct experience with vampires and decides he must quit his job to pursue these evil beings. Most of the film contains actions, intrigues, props and questionable films. The fight scenes were as hokey as the return of the battle of the Second World War by a schoolboy. The delivered lines were pronounced as if the actors had no motivation to be there. The props were bad because they did not even seem to work to the slightest extent. the majority of the film seemed to be shot in someone's basement (in some scenes you could see the rafters above a scene that was not supposed to look like a basement). The plot had no motivation to move forward or backward, it just seemed to stay still from time to time for no reason for the actions of certain characters. I sometimes felt that the sound effects were not in the place of this kind of horror and more than a series of cartoons. It's similar to the movie Blade, in that he's an African-American vampire hunter. However, that's where all the similarities end, and the movie is more like a parody of Saturday Night Live.
