First, the title "DAILY" is a lie. <br /> <br /> Each "Daily Show" program opens with an on-screen display of the date it was created, followed by a pause and the opening announcement. The many days they review a daily show, they slide the band and OMIT the date and start with the opening announcement giving the false impression that the show is new. It's a lie. There is no mention that it is a rebroadcast. And that kind of bullshit is just a little indicator of the stealth and lies of this show. <br /> <br /> In addition, the program is only offered 4 nights a week. It is not quite "everyday", that is, Monday to Friday, another shortcoming, but for which I am grateful. <br /> <br /> It is sad to think that many distraught young people use this false news as the main and often only source of news. This leaves them terribly ignorant and far worse - very badly informed. <br /> <br /> Although this leans the liberal left, politically, this show can sometimes be fun. However, its veracity is weak. Facts and information are often intelligently twisted to fit the writers' agendas. It is often difficult to tell where the facts are and where fiction and comedy begin. The result is pre-digested and reinterpreted information designed to convince and influence. This is called "PROPAGANDA". <br /> <br /> Remote interviews are very difficult to correct. <br /> <br /> He really loses me when he hits God and the Christians - which he does too often. However, you will never hear anything vaguely anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> If Jon Stewart and his company attacked people other than Christians, this would be considered an offensive contempt. The names in the credits explain the source.
