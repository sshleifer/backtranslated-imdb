Hulk Hogan plays the role of wrestling champion (a real feature film ...) named Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his girlfriend from a greedy group who wanted him to sign for their network ( Because the fight is selling!) However, when Rip declines, the network gets a circuit-fighting championship called (and I'm quite serious) "The Battle of the Hard", including champion Zeus (played by Tiny Lister Jr. ) is perhaps the most deadly man in the world. Rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and placed in the hospital. No Holds Barred is pretty much what I was expecting from Vince McMahon's production featuring the least versatile actor of the action genre (Hogan). It's basically a lot of unintentional humor, tons of awkward sequences, some good action sequences, and tons of stupidity. In other words, it's not very different from the fight itself, so I give it a reasonable rating, mainly because anyone who praises this activity knows what they're getting. The film is cheap, but pretty well done for what it is and the real wrestling fans will probably appreciate that. I myself found this ultimately hilarious. These are moments of such absurdity that you laugh only for yourself. (Like the way Hogan jumps into the air after being stuck in a limousine, how he forces a guy to get pissed off and of course the way Hogan recites from his memory card. (IE: "I will not be here when this check is erased! ") No Holds Barred is very fun, it's true, but it's mostly because of its ridiculous, camp fans should really enjoy this clever clinker. <br /> * * of 4 - (just)
