<br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges has a weird accent. <br /> <br /> Rita's ability to crack the password code <br /> <br /> The whole script <br /> <br /> The end - especially the last scene where two coffees are presented at the table for Jeff and Rita and the publisher. J & R laughs and says, "We do not drink coffee anymore." Well, why did they order then ??? They obviously did. If they did not do it and the waiter brought everyone a coffee by default, there would have been three coffees. <br /> <br /> Total Tosh.
