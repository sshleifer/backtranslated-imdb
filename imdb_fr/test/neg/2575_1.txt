Forget the fact that most people expect an action movie in the form of Seagal. This movie just did not have any substance. Very long, stretched and boring. The scenes lasted much longer than expected - the camera often focused on something for long periods of time without anything happening. Cure for insomnia. By far the worst film of Seagal (I like some of his other films). 1/10
