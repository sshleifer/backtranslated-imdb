Amnesiac women who take off their clothes by the fall of a hat (or blouse?) Are pretty much the only things that make the difference in a film that is otherwise slow and aimless. Although the basic principle of history offers a multitude of possibilities, they are never developed satisfactorily and the exhibition is almost non-existent. Much of the film is just a wandering in the corridors of a multi-storey hospital / hospital. The overall effect is dark and sterile, at THX-1138.
