One of the problems of popular culture, especially when it comes to popular culture in the 1970s, is that mass media - especially television - are usually about four years behind the "underground" media. , mainly music. Many people think that the "Woodstock generation" remained important throughout the 1970s; in fact, everything was finished at Altamont in 1970. In 1972, rock "underground" or "counterculture" had moved eastward in England and Led Zepplin, Black Sabbat, and David Bowie, the first metal -heads and the so-called "glam-rockers", who were all "peace and love" - ​​no more. Nor, in a completely different black, the "family" of Charles Manson. <br /> <br /> This obvious pilot project for a television show (which, fortunately, has never been captured by the networks) is trying to deal with a culture already weakened like the flowers of yesterday. It's been a few years since the writer Carlino is already known for his stories of virulent revenge on the Mafia. The cultural references are all "Easy Rider" and Woodstock (1969). in fact earlier, in 1966/67, at Woodstock, Hendrix, Canned Heat, and Sly and the Family Stone had thrown this kind of folk music into oblivion. <br /> <br /> The film is about a middle-class family going on the road to meet the hippies. Wow, dude, farout, outasight, it's sacred. However, politics counts for nothing - Vietnam, a place in Asia, right? <br /> <br /> This medium-length TV movie (meaning empty and stale) is only bought by Jeff Bridges' astonishingly mature performance. It's the young kid who dropped out of school and convinced his parents and his grandparents. -mother to "discover" America (hippie). All other shows are shown on standard television by the standard television actors of the time. The director uses interesting cinematographic images, but otherwise the film is a bad way to spend 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I knew everything was over when Sal Mineo spoke of a young fugitive (who tells the other characters, they are not really there): "She is a latent existentialist." Wow, far, groovy. <br /> <br /> A few extra points to be "so bad it's funny", but if you do not care about the TV version of the '70s of the' 60s, stay away.
