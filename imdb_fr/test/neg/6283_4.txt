"Tenchi Muyo In Love 2" is Tenchi's third film. It seems that its creators took elements of the first two to realize this one. At the risk of giving spoilers, Tenchi is kidnapped and the team must recover him. Nothing new there. A past love of Yosho is the bad guy. This was done in the second film. The battle between Aeka and Ryoko begins to get boring. The film has almost no action scene and very little comedy. Personally, I do not know what AIC thought, its manufacturers. I gave this film a vote of 4.
