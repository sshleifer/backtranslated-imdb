Cheap cheese, gloriously bad 80s, the cheese decade. I watched this one for the first time uncut and non-MST3K, and it was pretty funny to laugh funny even without the comments. <br /> <br /> The plot (as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which artificial intelligence robots revolted (seemed familiar?) and destroyed almost everything, leaving a ruined world with such a terrible air that no one can breathe it. The few remaining humans act as slaves to an enigmatic creature called Dark One, who seems to be both a computer and an organic being. "Air slaves" work to produce energy in exchange for breathing air. From time to time, the Dark One has the strongest air slaves fighting to death, so no one stands up as a leader in a revolt against the Dark One. <br /> <br /> so-called serious things. Let's move on to stupid things, such as the ridiculous, almost futuristic clothes that everyone wears, including fur clothes, loincloths, stuffed boas and feathers (worn mostly by the maid of the Dark One, a chick with one and almost incomprehensible accent). Or the wooden play lines and the stilts raised by all the so-called "actors", who dialogue with a high pitch and a weak sense. Or the special Dime Store, featuring pink socks with teeth glued to "deadly" snakes, a stringed piano wire bomb and a tin can, and awful "mutants" wearing Halloween rubber masks. <br /> <A group of air slaves follow their leader, a mysterious vagabond who has adapted to the outside air, to get to the Energy Factory to destroy the Shadowed One. The guy's name is Neo, which explains where the Wachowski brothers got the idea of ​​the matrix. They meet a group of Amazons en route, with the obligatory combat scene in which the woman is beaten (of course). Has anyone ever noticed this in every movie or tv of Amazon? show ever produced, these so-called amazing warriors always break their buttocks by men or women? The Amazons are just thoughts, I suppose. <br /> <br /> This group of determined warriors fight their way through Central Park ... uh ... devastated lands beyond the last standing city (good way to save money on anyway) and go to the sewers leading to the power station where the Dark One and his wife Valeria stand. Here they will defeat ferocious beasts such as the sock puppet worm, a giant spider that no one sees, and the lobster lobster robot that is one of the personal guards of the Dark One. <br /> <br /> The final confrontation is sad enough. One of the slaves, a girl whose father was taken away by the Dark One because he had created a way for people to breathe the stale air, sees that his father was "consumed by the true form of Dark One ", which implies that the three remaining adventurers destroy the Dark One by turning off a few switches and the holocaust of the robot dies not with a detonation but with a groan. The two humans exchange incredibly woody forms. lines, and that's it.
