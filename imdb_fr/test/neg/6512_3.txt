A thriller action not so good because it tends unsuccessfully the same water as the first films of Steven Seagal because there is not a very good scenario. Steven Seagal plays the same kind of character he has played since Above the Law. In my opinion, the performance of Keenen Ivory Wayans is wasted in such a medium film and belongs to a much better film. Bob Gunton is good as the heavy leader. The best actor in the whole movie belongs to Brian Cox, who is very scared in the role of the murderer. My favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the Russian Mafia. One of the reasons to see The Glimmer Man (1996) is for the brief appearance of the beautiful and voluptupus Nikki Cox. It's a shame that there are no more scenes with her inside.
