After the general, a film that broke the life of the Dublin gangster to such a heroic proportions that he sickened the average Dublin man, accompanied by Kevin and his attempt to portray Mr. Lynch or Martin Cahill, aka the general, the role So bad that this crime drama becomes a comedy for the duo Dubois and a tragedy for the fan of Kevin Spacey. In short, the film deserves the detour ... No, unless you like to play with hilarious Irish accents, ah, make sure to be. The story is based on the commercial success "The General" which, despite the glorification of a well-known animal from Dublin by Martin Cahill, is still worth a visit, nationally because it shows the true working class of Dublin and internationally because of his real Irish actors and killers, including John Voight. In sum, the "decent ordinary criminal" is anything but a decent movie. To avoid.
