Barely throughout the film ... Play is bad, the dialogues are even worse. I felt a little st00pid 4 to watch, but it was named as one of my favorite games, so I struggled in the hollow. They even messed up the sound. At some parts of the film, the background music is so strong that I had to turn down the volume. It would be great, if it was a contest to find out who can ruin it more. <br /> <br /> Oh and PS: I do not know what this guy "Uwe" is able to create ... I do not think this movie is bad just because he's the director. I checked the list of his work, and it was his first (and probably the last) creation I saw. <br /> <br /> over & out.
