This film lacks everything. Aside from Bobby Deol, who is mediocre by his own standards, no one in this movie has nearly played in one scene. Kangana is completely wrong in his acting. <br /> <br /> The great Anupam Kher has an appearance as a guest and is better in these 2 minutes than bobby in the whole movie. The music does not complete the film <br /> <br /> well. The contrast in Music between Bobby and Upen is not very well highlighted. Great concept completely wrong. The film has no correct end. Please do not waste your time like I did on this movie
