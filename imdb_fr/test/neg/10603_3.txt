I really wanted to love this movie, but I just could not. It had the potential to be a cool and cool remake of a cool show, but that's when it collapsed. It was too trendy, too cool. First of all, all the cool lines and scenes were presented in the preview trailers, which I had often seen. And the editing was very disjointed, so that the scenes did not seem to be fluid and that they seemed all displaced. Claire Danes, whom I love as an actress, has failed in her acting career beyond high school. The only good thing was Giovanni Ribisi as Pete. His somewhat silly, yet smart style was funny and refreshing. But overall, I would just recommend looking at the clips instead of seeing the movie and wishing it to be more.
