I want to say that this movie really appealed to me, but when it came down, it was too boring. It begins to be promising, and even once in the mines, the atmosphere and atmosphere are scary. The problem is the monster or its absence. As people have said, it's a stop-motion monster, but that's not the problem (stop-motion can look great if done right). The problem is that we do not see enough and we do not see any deaths. This is supposed to be a horror movie so a lack of monster and a lack of death equals boredom. I liked certain scenes, for example when a girl uses her camera in the dark and the monster goes to her. There are also some other terrifying scenes, but they are far too few to hold your interest and are certainly not worth watching. It's a shame, because I see that if it had been handled properly, it would have been a scary horror movie. The sad thing is that films like this one will never be filmed again, because filmmakers are currently over-polishing their films and relying on poor quality CGI effects.
