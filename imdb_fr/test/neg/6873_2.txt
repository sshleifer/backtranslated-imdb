Here is another film with dysfunctional main characters that are totally amoral and yet we are supposed to look for them? Not me. No character in this film was worth anything. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays car salesman "Joey O'Brien". The man has no class, a loser in every moral sense and a guy who thinks he can get out of anything. Knowing Williams' ability to speak, he was good for that role. The women of his life also make him crazy. Some of them are not much better than him. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins plays the same role in a small life like this. He begins the film's recovery when he is loaded with explosives, crashes into a showroom people, including his wife, as a hostage. Robbins, as usual for him, plays a deranged and ridiculous character. I guess these delicate roles are easy for both players to take on. Well, I wonder why. <br /> <br /> There are so many shouts and cries in this movie that it will give you a headache. Combine these two screamers with Fran Drescher's nasal voice and you'll get an annoying over-the-top distribution. It's like listening to chalk on the board for an hour and a half. It's comedy? No, it's lame. <br /> <br /> In fact, for a Robin Williams movie, having only a dozen critics posted here tells you something. It's far from his best film.
