Many people at the movies enjoyed this film, but it only made me feel misanthropic. If foolish "intellectuals" make fun of their irritating sex life, it suits you, look at it. I felt bored, but happy to know people like that. The principle of the film was that, as in all societies or great civilizations, they are ultimately doomed to failure. According to the female historian character who bores us with this fact, America is showing signs of its decline (she admits that it is more detailed than me). The rest of the film focuses on the empty, insane and casual behavior of his friends and colleagues and the various miseries provoked by their libidinous behavior, with a vague attempt at humor. Many people liked this movie where I watched it. I could not understand it.
