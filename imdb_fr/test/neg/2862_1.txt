When I first heard about this film, I went to praise it impatiently, persuading (wrongly) that it was one of those movies so bad and so much fun and that I was for fun. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> For starters, the pace is terribly slow and scary. The pace does not even begin to accelerate before the last 15-20 minutes of the film! The plot was boring, and the ending was absurd and confusing. For those looking for a cheesy horror movie with thrills, look elsewhere. This film gives the cheese tone to the shovel, but is sorely lacking in "shivers", cheap or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Try "Child's Play" instead.
