I found this film preached and unrealistic. It's a film that shows children fighting against the system, but it does not even have a positive solution. I guess I did not really feel for children. I can fully understand their problems and I know how poor the schools are, but I found their solution and how the outside has treated it to make it a big deal. If this happens on TV, do not waste your time. Look again Short circuit for the 235th time.
