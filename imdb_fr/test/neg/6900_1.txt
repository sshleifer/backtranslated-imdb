When my six year old son fell asleep at the theater during this film, it's the confirmation I needed: this movie is a whore. It was boring. The scary parts were boring. The parts of maudlin were boring. Even the fun parts - with two minor exceptions - were boring. And predictable. And did I mention predictable? Examples: 1) The gruff but loving daddy indulging his child kid. 2) The gruff but loving dad buys the farm (singing a song ?!). 3) The kid of a kid decides to fend for himself, but thanks to his friends, he managed to get out of things because they needed him. 4) The kid of a winning child against incredible odds. 5) And an impertinent character voiced by an African-American actress. I want to thank these filmmakers for this bit of originality and for perpetuating this stereotype. I mentioned two fun passages. In both cases, contributed by minor characters. The mouse bouncing on the farmer's pulse was funny. The farm dog who was a victim of his weaknesses while seeking leadership was funny. But the rest? Painful. Someone tried to make a Hipness-Thru-Committee movie and make it even more appealing by turning it into a computer animation movie, and that's the result. And why make the Batman-naughty coyotes stupid by monologizing with their victims, rather than eating them? Oh yes. No need for blood in this movie for kids, which already focuses on simulated alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and humor at the pot. And the fuzzy-in-a-box? What exactly was it? A porcupine? Tasmanian devil? In addition to a really stupid plot device to help Otis the cow to win the battle of the Mother of all battles? The barnyard is a bomb. And I did not even need to mention the breasts.
