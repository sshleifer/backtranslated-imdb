This film is an absolute mutism incarnated. However, I have seen this film many times and I intend to watch it several times because, despite its stupidity, it is very entertaining. And there is one of my favorite actors in the hokey movie, Casper van Dien, who is here in all his glory. Here, Casper van Dien is entirely Casper van Dien, and you must love him for that. If he had not been in this film, he would have been totally unassailable, or at least more depressing than he already is. <br /> <br /> The "science" (cough) used here is meaningless at all. No one else in the world has noticed this big asteroid approaching Earth outside this small group? Not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers constantly looking for the sky for such a thing? An asteroid of this size would have been perfectly obvious to anyone with a pair of eyes, even vaguely able to see. And a piece of the asteroid bounced off the atmosphere and nobody even noticed it? A rock as big as it would hit the atmosphere would have caused huge shock waves which, in turn, would have caused enormous damage to the surface of the planet. Surely, someone would have noticed such a thing. Bwahahaha! The "science" used in this film is so completely ridiculous that it works one way or another to make this film as entertaining as it is. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was that, despite the extreme heat, not all the characters were sweating and their clothes were completely soaked. At best, the characters seemed to have been lightly splashed occasionally by someone off camera with a bottle of water to give a "burst of sweat". Authenticity was * not * a goal that this film constantly and diligently sought. Which, in a strange and hilarious way, gives this film its entertaining charm. <br /> <br /> Is this film really worth watching? Absolutely! Assuming, of course, that you have absolutely no expectation of anything that, even at a distance, is closer to reality. And, it's your desire to wallow and relax in the mood right now.
