Two things always indicate that you will watch a bad movie: <br /> <br /> 1) If you are instantly reminded of other movies like THE TERMINATOR, HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER during the sequence of titles <br /> <br /> > 2) If there is a death at a sex scene just after the title sequence <br /> <br /> There is actually a third warning sign and a legend indicating a lazy exposure warning the poor ignorant public naive of the dangers of corporate greed. Guess what ? CYBORG 2 begins with a legend warning us of corporate greed in the future, followed by a sequence of titles that reminds me of THE TERMINATOR, HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER, followed by a death at a sex scene! Hey you do not assume I'm going to watch a bad movie by chance? <br /> <br /> As you can guess, it's a bad movie. It is essentially a series of action scenes written around the naked scenario of a cyborg on the run from an avid corporate corporation. It is poorly written, directed and misinterpreted, but most importantly, it is very poorly lit, which means it is very difficult to see what is happening on the screen, although I am not quite sure that it's a bad thing. The only interest is that it's the beginning of Angelina Jolie's movie that plays the cyborg in the race and that says the prophetic phrase "They are adorable, I wonder if they are real?", What I ask me every time I see one of his movies
