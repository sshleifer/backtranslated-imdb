I used to work for the company that originally released this film, Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem as many small independent film companies, they did not have much money to invest in the production value of their films. It's not that money alone will buy you a good movie. Look at Waterworld by Kevin Costner, for example. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, if you hire a talented person to do the acquisitions or development, you can create your own new talent. But at Vestron, there was no such person and they always skimped in a crucial area. In this case, it was about the director and the author. It is difficult to have a movie worthy of the name, even with the superb overall cast that this film has. <br /> <br /> I think the basic premise of this movie was "Let's put a group of weird characters in a room and see if anything interesting is happening." It's a fascinating idea, but who not worth watching. <br /> <br /> Most of Vestron's films ended up giving them a very distinctive appearance. My wife and I have developed the ability to detect this quality even in non-Vestron movies. Many times, we have even seen this quality by watching only the trailer or television advertising. We sat watching the trailer or the ad, then we turned to each of them and, almost synchronized, we said, "Here's a movie about Vestron!" This is a Vestron movie.
