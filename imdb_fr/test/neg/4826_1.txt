I do not know how people can look at this - the only people who like to look at it are those who have no feelings or emotions and who like watching people die, houses burned down, car accidents, dead babies and cast members killed every week. It's the most absurd thing on TV and I still do not know how it pulls in the ratings. It's so depressing. I can imagine the writers sitting and saying, "So who will we kill next week then" or "which house should we burn in a month?" <br /> <br /> It's the most depressing, absurd and the most It's stupid on TV right now, and I do not understand anymore people's motives to watch this bunch of depressing shit
