The summary of a line is actually the line of striking a very old joke that begins with "What is a Jewish porn movie?" <br /> <br /> This film had interesting moments, but it was far too slow and did not do enough to explain to those of us who are not familiar with the orthodox Jewish custom, what was happening and why? How many people who have seen this movie would know that the bathtub in which the female characters were washing is actually called "Mikveh", which is a ritual bath used to purify spiritual nonsense? The same question could be asked as to why the bride was walked around the groom a dizzying number of times while her face was covered just before the wedding vows. These two examples are just two of the many moments of this kind that have remained completely unexplained for the uninitiated audience. <br /> <br /> This film presents touching moments as well as expressions of great love and emotions. The characters are presented in a very authentic way, up to the number of clothes that an ultra-orthodox Jew has to wear as well as the religious rituals to which he must submit to the waking up in the morning to start the day. The attitudes of Orthodox Judaism towards women in general and wives in particular are both intriguing and sometimes infuriating. This is another reason why more explanation is needed if the story is to be understood in context. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to people familiar with tradition and Jewish Orthodox rituals and those who might be interested. by throwing a brief glimpse of the lives of people who practice this way of life. <br /> <br /> The very story of two sisters who rebel in their own way against "the system" presents a moderate interest better.
