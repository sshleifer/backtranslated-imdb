When a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals crashes in a small Texas town, people start to die. The county sheriff is trying to investigate but the efforts of other government officials are hampering his efforts. It turns out that there is a mutant space gorilla on teenagers killed in the woods. <br /> <br /> I like sci-fi and horror movies on a budget. I like monster movies. So I thought there would be a good chance that I want this movie. Unfortunately, I did not do it. <br /> <br /> The bad acting of actors, the nerdy dialogue, the atrocious musical score or the giant holes of the plot that characterize this film do not bother me. There are many movies that have the same problems that I have seen and enjoyed so much that's good. <br /> <br /> But where others of this type and Night Fright differ is that Night Fright has a terrible pace. And it's hanging out because of that. There are scenes that go on without anything happening - looking for clues in the forest is only about people walking in the forest for a long time; there are several teenagers who seem to dance endlessly at a party in the woods ... but nothing interesting happens. If these scenes were shorter, the film might not have been so boring (although I do not think that just cutting these scenes would save this one). <br /> <br /> I have now given this film three views to be sure. that I gave him a chance before slamming it in this review. Unfortunately, every watch has gotten worse. There will be no fourth.
