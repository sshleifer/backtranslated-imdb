It is a very dull film with badly developed characters, secondary intrigues that go nowhere and a barely tolerable game. It looks like a poorly crafted "2001" scam. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is worth it is the sets, the costumes and the visual effects. But even that was not enough to keep me from drowsing. I'd like to get the soundtrack, especially the music during the spaceflight sequence, the nights I can not sleep.
