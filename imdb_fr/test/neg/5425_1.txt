I can not say I was surprised at this atrocity when I watched it a few months or weeks ago (I do not remember). I saw it as a two part episode of Zoey 101, because that's how they showed it here in Canada. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly bored by the Nerd Makeover project, it's just an example of the unacceptable, superficial, negative, skewed and stereotypical disapproval, the people in the entertainment industry are and, Frankly, I am extremely sorry. It was not funny at all. A nerd is a stereotype and it makes people very offended. <br /> <br /> Second, the people of Zoey 101 have no real problems. Logan has a big house, he has a famous father, he has everything and Zoey is rich too. They never have to deal with the problems facing teens and adolescents today, such as peer pressure and stereotyping issues. In addition, the actors are horrible. Jamie Lynn Spears does not deserve to be in a TV show as successful as Zoey 101 (what's wrong in the world?), She has no talent as an actor. In fact, she's worse than Britney! The stuff of Chase and Zoey was incredibly predictable, I mean, how could the show last with the Zoey and Chase Encounters? What other problems might they possibly have? Except that Chase does not get the girl he wants, everything is perfect! The worst 48 minutes of my television watching life. Already. 0/10 (and it's generous)
