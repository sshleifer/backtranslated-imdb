Spoiled, it's just a waste of time. MTV currently produces movies for television. A friend of mine recommended this and I praised it, it goes without saying that I will not pursue his recommendations any time soon. This film shows the roller coaster of drug use. The problem is that you do not really care about any of the characters because of the lack of credibility and their own discipline. This film is in a nutshell, annoying to watch, terrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and stimulation. The "digital" format tries to achieve realism, but disturbs. If you want to get a real idea of ​​drug use, watch Requiem for a Dream.
