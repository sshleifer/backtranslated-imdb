"There are things you just do not do," says David Zucker's 2003 comedy slogan about a young man caught in a terrible situation after another, called "My Boss's Daughter," and it's the slogan should speak for both those who made this junk and for those who are considering watching it. There are indeed things you do not do, with the placement of most types of content found in My Boss's Daughter, which count as elements that you simply should not do at the movies in including in your image. . My boss's daughter is a sordid one; creepy; grotesque experience, a clumsy and heavy piece that is infantile beyond words and disgusting beyond expression. To see it is to support it, to support it is to survive it and to survive it is an accomplishment in its own right ?? if any of the actors writers; extras; Damn, even the guys who worked as runners on the set help produce something as terrifying as ever, so it will be because they were sent here by the devil Himself to destroy the support of the movie or it's probably because they got a job on behalf of the Friedberg / Seltzer crowd. <br /> <br /> The daughter of my boss (who, I'm sure, should be titled "The daughter of my boss", "speaking grammatically), revolves around his infamous male leader, named Tom Stansfield (Kutcher), and a night at his boss's house as he pursues the seemingly elusive "goal" of his blonde girl, Lisa Taylor (Reid) - someone who works in the same department as in an office building imposing Chicago under the strict gaze of Jack Taylor (Stamp) Tom spies Lisa very early, she takes the subway to work with all the other shmos despite the fact that she owns a car and that his father is the boss of this damn After trying to talk to him, but his attempts having been thwarted by a vomiting baby and a dog for the blind more interested in Tom's crotch than anything, he finally got his chance at the office when we talk about a party in the shadows appears elsewhere and that he should come and see her at home - and yes, she still lives with her father. Think of Hitchcock's 1960s psycho film, Norman Bates and his mother, reversed and then played for laughs. <br /> <br /> The distinct establishment of the character is highlighted in the opening scene in which Tom sits in the subway. train and get to work with his yuppie cohorts. They are a ruthless and shameless group, evidently slipping the briefs of these unfortunate people to the point of jamming them in the door during the morning run that followed, without ever returning them. One day, it happens with Tom over there, and his wish is to make him, hammering us like he is not like the other guys (!) This, when he sees Lisa for the first time and that he is a little timid to approach him as other men treat the situation as a whole as if it would be a breeze if they were in his place. This rather obvious and brutal attempt to get us to "tidy up" with Tom worries about what it takes to earn a place among these employees of this company. <br /> <br /> It is, however, as close as possible to My Boss's Daughter, it is the same at all levels. The comedy of hell comes from a seemingly harmless place where a boy meets a girl and wants to know her. Tom's arrival at home will not see him invited to the party, but he is accused of having owled Jack's pet owl and to stay out of harm's way while maintaining a impeccable house. It has been established that the character of Terrance Stamp is synonymous with trade in the strict sense of the term, dismissing people for anything, such as preparing a bad coffee. It's not that Jack is a cunning businessman, he's a toilet maniac; obsessed with control and a borderline sociopath in his placement of bear traps in the garden to keep the children off his land. You can imagine that when we enter his big and exquisite home with orders that nothing wrong is to be done, there are obviously problems. <br /> <br /> The movie has fun with this premise of danger for about ten minutes. The first time someone uses the work plan to open a beer and mark the pristine summit, you can smile, but when half of the house is destroyed and Michael Madsen has arrived urinating all over the carpet, you have your head in your hands. Each joke of the film is staged in a very clumsy way before unfolding closer to the slow and unsustainable than smooth and irreproachable, the only thing missing from the gag is the Someone's sound effect incorrectly changes the gears of a car that creaks and squeaks on the next fall. Between raw delirium, the film takes time to unfold in a degenerative romance like Lisa and Tom while talking about personalities in and out of the workplace, and maybe they have more in common than early thought. Every hour, the film has opted for extravagant jokes and hateful speeches, especially when there is an entire scene that exists solely to target paraplegics and a stupid secondary plot to do with a sports-minded neighbor's head hurts. an unknown date in which really unassailable visual gags are unveiled Throughout the game, the character of Stamp likes to denigrate people and ask them if the simplest tasks are too difficult for them, what should be the common answer all by channeling Jack Taylor: first read the too complicated scenario - a concept for you, Stamp?
