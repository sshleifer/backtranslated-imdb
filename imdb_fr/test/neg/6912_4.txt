When I watched this film, it was an afternoon after my return from work. I love horror movies and I've already seen really tacky movies, but that takes the cake. The intrigue presented to the viewer at the beginning of the film seems a bit intriguing, but as the movie progresses, the script goes awry with horrible clich√©s and poor presentation, making the movie completely dull and boring. I do not want to continue to criticize the scenario and the plot, because believe me, it's not the worst. I must say that overall, the acting was not great for beginners, and I was impressed by Taylor Locke, one of his first films. The worst part of the movie was the special effects. They stunk the budget and really spoiled the entertainment of the viewers, even if he had been interested by far the plot. I recommend watching this movie to understand the power of a bad and bad scenario. Only then can you really appreciate the good writers and directors.
