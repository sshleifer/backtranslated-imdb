What atrocity. I'm not one to demand the full likelihood of a film, but the plot and scenario of "Killing Zoe" are so na√Øve that I found myself wincing for the (fortunately short) 90 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> Readers of these magazines will have already understood the plot: Zoe, a call girl who falls in love with the American safecracker Zed, is also a bank employee that Zed will help to fly in a break. Bastille Day head with big stakes. The film tarnishes his credibility. Zed and Zoe's magic night is highly prosaic, and Zoe's claim to have experienced the orgasm of her life would seem to reflect the writer's lingering teen fantasies more than any actual chemistry on screen. Zed's total indifference when his friend Eric throws Zoe out of the hotel room paves the way for their subsequent attachment. <br /> <br /> In Act Two, Eric's bohemian group - addicted losers leading a marginal life of minor crime - get ready for their big holdup with a night on the town. Here, Roger Avary's main objective seems to be to prove that he knows something about drugs. A secondary thread is to convince us (through endless rehearsals) that Eric is really, REALLY happy to see his old friend Zed again. Really happy. Eric's exaggerated flamboyance and affection for Zed are not even credible. For example, discover his false illusion when he discovers a dead cat in his building. The development of the characters that will accompany us throughout the film is an afterthought. <br /> <br /> Theft is a disaster - understandable, since the plan is laughable and criminals are perfect amateurs. It is here that Avary continues to pay homage to his idol Quentin Tarantino by showing that he can be more violent than violent. In reality, it is just more boring than boring. To enhance the excitement, an extra security guard is concealed inside the main safe. It was boring in video games, and now it's boring. <br /> <br /> Zoe is taken hostage during the robbery, but despite our expectation that she plays a pivotal role, she is just pretty. Or more precisely, Avary does nothing with it. In the last five minutes, she comes to life, breaks the hostage and saves the grateful, but still stunned, Zed must suffer no consequences of his crime. Why does not she care about her involvement in the crime - or why she does not care about him - is impossible to say. After all, she has no chance to see that he is more decent than the rest of the gang. <br /> <br /> Throughout the dialogue, the dialogue is frozen. A large part is in French. As a native speaker, I can certify that it does not even sound remotely. Eric's sweet-and-sweet speech, alternating quickly with boastful ones, is charming and frightening in its turn, but only cringe. Meanwhile, his accomplices are Scooby-Doo and Thomas Crown. When Eric is shot in a ridiculous example of excessive force, we can all breathe a sigh of relief: like the hostages of the bank, we will soon be released from this miserable ordeal.
