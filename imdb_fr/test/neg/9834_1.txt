Okay ... for the most part, and all his cheesiness, this movie was actually pretty good for a MST3K movie ... but then they decided to spoil the bit of goodness he had about fifteen minutes before the end . * SPOILER ALERT * The movie is very basic ... a rich mom's boy named Danny meets a tramp named Bix and the two go to a small town where Bix meets a pretty girl named Carrie (who is so.) Now, the basis of this film seemed quite promising. All they had to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romance movie ... Carrie loves Bix ... Bix loves Carrie ... a terrifying guy in town lustful for Carrie ... Now I know what you're thinking. .. Bix fights the plague and finally decides to settle down with Carrie. Danny goes home and everyone lives happily ever after ... right? FALSE!! Because Carrie is murdered by the city, because Bix is ​​too gay to commit it. (There are so many homosexual nuances between Danny and Bix.) And then, the whole city decides to lynch Bix, even though the city's slide would easily have been the main suspect. Then, the city admits to killing Carrie without much hesitation ... (he must have felt bad, the poor dope.) Then, Danny brings Bix back home ... it's the movie "happy forever". Sad, huh? All I can say is thank God for Joel and the Bots. Because they turned this horse hockey into one of my favorite episodes of MST3K.
