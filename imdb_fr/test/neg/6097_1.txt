Holiday on a boat, a married couple, an angry waiter and a shipwreck are the reason for this film debut. <br /> <br /> I like breasts. No questions about it. But when the main character joins the one who has the most fish right now, mainly by having sex with them and playing the role of constant victim, my anger rises to a whole new level. Take two guys (a husband and another man), place a pure woman bomb in their midst, a deserted island, subtract all her moral questions, a host of moral problems from men and mix her up in a big bowl. arguments, fish and a zippo lighter and you will get an unwanted piece of film like this. <br /> <br /> The acting game is, I would say, good. There are bloopers but not as much as I can see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to his lack of moral values. The man with the most fish catches his eye. Even if one of them is her husband, she sees no problem in being unfaithful with (Manuel) the other man, because "I have to do it to survive". How can you justify having sex with another man for the fish when your husband is 30 meters away? And he will not even benefit? The female character has absolutely no problem to justify what she does. If she does not approve of her actions, she is a victim. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to see this movie. This is the kind of movie that will make everything you see this year a fun cinematic experience.
