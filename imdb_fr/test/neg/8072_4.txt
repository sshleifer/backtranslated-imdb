Cuore Sacro combines brilliant film effects with a story that leaves something to be desired. With a scenario that the writers of "Touched by an Angel" could have left as too powerless, Ozpetek continues to interest us at times. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positives, but I found the last act so strangely bizarre and awful that I think the couple who was killed at the very beginning might have been the luckiest. <br /> <br /> This film is the heart (wordplay wanted) a story built on a twist style end. This type of tenuous foundation can give rise to huge success like Tornatore's Una Pura Formalità or terrible garbage like Mr. Night Shyamalan's films. Cuore Sacro is a little closer to the latter. I found cinematography in general above average. Irene's tracking plans conscientiously doing her daily tricks in the pool were very impressive, as was the atmosphere evoked by the interior of her mother's house. For me, the grotesque parody of Michelangelo's Pieta when Giancarlo arrives from the rain and Irene poses with him was a little exaggerated. One of the big problems that bothered me in this film was Ozpetek's method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions that were unfolding. This has had a fantastic effect in Face Windows, but when used here, it seems that Bubolova is not a Mezzogiorno. In fact, in addition to the ridiculous story, the main problem of this film is the milquetoast performance of its main character. This made the scene of the final breakdown even more unreasonable. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporate-led corporations by exhorting us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and more altruistic. And although I'm certainly a very nice person from this point of view, I felt as if the audience was hit in the head with a blunt object. Could the characters have been more two-dimensional? I tended to find this movie very unnerving and soulless. Was aunty aunt Eleonora anything but a caricature? This is also true for people on the "right" side, such as the "good" Aunt Maria Clara and the old porter Aurelio. And just in case we missed Ozpetek's goal, he decided to clothe his opposing forces in their own liveries. <br /> <br /> This brings me to an interesting point about the director's use of color. He wears the first pair that flew briefly in black, as well as Irene (when we meet her for the first time and after her conversion), the evil aunt Eleonora and, of course, the good but confused Padre Carras. Black is a color that suggests a definite course, the mind of the wearer is determined and without emotion. This is the color of choice for this indispensable element of modern armor, the tailor. It is also the color of mourning, like the funeral adornment worn by the suicidal duo. Finally, black is the color of piety, like the simple dresses of priests and nuns that Irene imitates in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> The other main color, and a very appropriate choice for a film on the sacred heart, is red. It's a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component. The character who wears red is audacious, emotional, receptive to new ideas and indulgent. Red is a risky color in modern times; it challenges our perceptions of the wearer and, at the same time, makes him vulnerable. However, the red has a huge weight in history and mysticism, since the first members of the Cro-Magnon man buried their dead in red ocher and the first man named in the Torah, Adam, draws his name of the Hebrew word for red. Red also has an anachronistic flavor, referring to the past where red (and by association a less autonomous attitude towards life) was more accepted. Thus, when we meet the room filled with red (the mysterious wall covered with frieze, completed by a menorah enhanced with red and a red board depicting a whirling dervish!), The mother of Irene, "good" characters, Maria Clara and Aurelio, finally carrying the picture of Irene's mother dressed in a formal red dress, allows us to see where the sympathies of Ozpetek are. <br /> <br /> A word or two on the soundtrack, I found that the original musical themes were perfectly adapted to the story. The quasi-Baroque theme which meant that Irene was great for his monotony and his lingering sense of uneasiness (the absolute best use of a constantly recurring Baroque theme, as in the case of Barry Lyndon, Kubrick, with masterful rehearsals of an 8 sarabande attributed to Handel). An absolutely inspired choice was a few seconds of an operatic tune that we hear as the power wavers as Irene pursues Benny across the house. This is the famous air "Ebben? ... andrò lontano" of the Catalani opera "La Wally". The air is sung by the main soprano who leaves the house forever. As Irene's mother was a dramatic soprano, we guess it's a recording of her singing and she says a poignant farewell to her daughter, because in the movie, Irene is destined to never again see Benny again. I just have a minor question of the soundtrack, why include the famous tango Yo Soy Maria? I love this song and I personally heard it all the time, but it did not really suit me.
