I started watching this movie on tv a few weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so. Initially, the person on the witness protection system on an isolated farm is worried about outside guards and then asks if he can make a phone call to find that the line has been cut off. Shortly thereafter, Roy Scheider, one of the witness's murderers, introduces himself and duly executes the witness and his wife - whereupon Roy Scheider's character duly picks up the wall phone in the kitchen, dials a number and then speaks: it is done !!!! It was for me!
