After spending half an hour examining Rumors, a gay bar outside Tupelo, Mississippi, SMALL TOWN GAY BAR takes a closer look at the murder of Scotty Weaver at Bay Minette to demonstrate the risks involved. by the subjects of the interview. But there is a problem here. Bay Minette is not near Tupelo, as the movie indicates. It's not even in the same state. It is actually about three hundred kilometers from the Alabama coast. <br /> <br /> The director Malcom Ingram does not hasten to emphasize this, and does not care to say that Bay Minette is not more than one This is actually two great inspirations of the greater metropolitan area of ​​Mobile, Alabama, which has a remarkable gay community, many gay bars and even a congregation of the Metropolitan Community Church. If Ingram lacks sincerity on these points, it is necessary to ask if it does the same for the others. <br /> <br /> Speaking as someone who is born, raised and continues to live in Mississippi, I must say that finding most of the small towns GAY BAR a lot of hooey. Neither Meridian nor Tupelo, the communities Ingram focuses on, are as rural, small or isolated as they would have imagined, and gay bars are indeed more common in the state than the film suggests. That said, Ingram ignores the fact that the lack of a gay bar does not mean the absence of a gay community. It shows a fairly deep ignorance of the culture of the South, which tends to retain those who frequent the bars ... homosexual or heterosexual - of low esteem. <br /> <br /> SMALL TOWN GAY BAR is, in my opinion, a case where a filmmaker came to him with a personal diary in his hand and then proceeded to film the diary. Do gays and lesbians living in rural Mississippi face major, sometimes frightening challenges? You bet they do it - but it's not an excuse to play with reality to such a degree. The DVD contains a commentary track and a number of deleted scenes, but I found the feature film so ridiculous that I lost no time. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
