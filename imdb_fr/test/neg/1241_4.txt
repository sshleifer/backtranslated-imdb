This show is like watching someone train for a show. There are good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre. It does not seem that the authors know how to differentiate between what is funny and what is simply strange or rude. <br /> <br /> This has its moments. When Spike watered a neighbor who let his dog soil his lawn several times, he reached his peak. But the hilarious moments are too few and there are too many experimental comedy pieces that miss the mark. <br /> <br /> The series is better than, for example, watching a test pattern or the QVC network, but it needs better screenwriters. . <br /> <br /> When I read the extremely positive comments from IMDb on this show, I'm sure most of them were written by exhibition staff, parents and friends Spike's personal. <br /> <br /> is not very good most of the time.
