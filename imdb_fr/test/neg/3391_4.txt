Some of the most loved and loved horror movies have a diabolical sense of humor, but when a movie comes out, it's not as original as the "classics", but it's made for a laugh, then a Pile of being critics completely slag it off. This film made me laugh a few times, it shows how this film was approached and it shows. The two main films look natural and believable together, which really helps this film. All along the way, you laugh with them and everyone laughs, everyone has friends like those two. Another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's great, intimidating and really well shot. Get inspired (completely steal) from tons of movies, the most obvious being Duel, Jeepers Creepers and probably the reference to Jack Black's co-star, Orange County. But really, you can choose any road trip and find a reference here. But then, what is not trying to win an Oscar, but to give the viewer a good dose of fear and laughter and, on this point, it is a 10! Obviously, this does not give a 10, I give real sensible reviews and different scores of 99% of people under IMDb. There is no chance that this movie will get a scratch like so many lazy idiots for too many movies and as fun as it was. It's a good fun movie for anyone with a sense of humor and who loves scares. You really can not get any easier than that.
