1) If you want to make a film that deals with social realism, it is very important that the audience identifies with the characters represented. 2) The public can not identify with very stereotyped characters or situations that are too obvious. 3) If you have a bad actor, you can not create any character. Anyway, even if you have good actors, their work will be ridiculous if you force them to speak with a fictitious Andalusian accent. <br /> <br /> Jes√∫s Ponce ignores these 3 points and also makes some cheap jokes completely irrelevant place. Her scenario is so predictable: a woman gets out of jail, she meets her old boyfriend junkie, life is hard, etc. Anyway, the fact that the story is anything but original would not be so bad if only Ponce was not complete writing and filming incompetent. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long will they continue to give money from our taxes to make movies like this? <br /> <br /> * My rating: 3/10
