I would like to know who drove the producers of this film to pay for its production - This persion is a kind of genius. This film caught my attention for about two-thirds of it until I realized it was not going anywhere fast. I think the music was able to give the impression that something was happening, but nothing really was. It was not scary. The dialogue was poorly written. The first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes. It would have been a moderately acceptable episode of Twilight Zone or Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> At this point, I'm just mad to lose all this time. It's been a few hours that I will never come back. <br /> <br /> I hope these comments will help someone avoid losing their evening. Take a nap or go to the gym instead. Or if you want to be scared, turn on a cable news channel.
