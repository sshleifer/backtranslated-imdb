A man comes to the office of the psychiatrist Sammael (Joan Severance), claiming to be the demon Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), the executioner of the 13th level of hell, and he would like to tell strange things. He says he had made an agreement with Lucifer to become human again. He should knock out his virgin sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) on the day of their mother's death. She should kill six people and deliver the Antichrist, then he would escape from the pit and reborn. When Mary Elizabeth gets pregnant, her stressed and violent sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe she is a virgin, but their father and former obstetrician, Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines his daughter and sees her intact. Meanwhile, the church discovers the truth about Mary Elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the priest and former military father Anthony (Eddie Velez) to spy on Mary Elizabeth. She is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), in love with his tenant and friend Jennifer (Azalea Davila), and Jennifer herself, to eat their hearts and drink their blood, but she thinks she has nightmares. However, during the ultrasound, she realizes that she is wearing a monster and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy. But it's too late. <br /> <br /> The terrible "Born" is a movie B (actually a movie Z) that believes it is an excellent movie. The result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor, a terrible acting and direction. The plot is a complete disaster: there is a priest who is a handyman and a former soldier; a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatrist; a father who examines the virginity of his daughter; two female demons (succubus?) who stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their sexes; a character who is a slut, and exists only to expose her beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst is the acting game: the unknown actress, Alison Brie, is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. Sorry, Mrs. Alison Brie, but I hated your boring performance. I did not recognize Joan Severance, who has a good performance, because I still had the image of her youth. Denise Crosby plays a hateful character and, like everyone else, she has aged but she remains a good actress. I think that if the writer and the director had included black humor and presumed that this film was a B movie, the story might have worked better and better. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Anti-Cristo" ("The Anti-Christ")
