It was pretty bad - bad action, technical details, bad shots and sound (although I watched a DVD, sometimes I could not hear what they said, sometimes the speakers were blowing, even in the same conversation). The plot was predictable, and the characters consisted mainly of neurotics, bi-polar and incredible caricatures. The development of the character was awful ... the stupid little sister (why was she even written in the script?), The harassing mother (again - what is it for?) The bloody girlfriend (why has not he abandoned it for a long time?), the gang of "black suits" (what an originality - I can not think of a better name, I guess), the hot girlfriend of the dealer (you have to a Latina if you want to have LA gangs, but really ...), etc. etc. I can not believe I looked at everything.
