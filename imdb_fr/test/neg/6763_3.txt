Jeff Morrow is Leslie Gaskell, Barbara Laurence is Vera Hunter and John Emory is Hubbel Eliot. With a few Air Force personnel and a comic geek, they are in charge of a super-secret underground lab on the west coast. Morrow is delighted when he discovers a meteor that crosses the atmosphere but not frightened when the meteor decides to plunge into the Pacific Ocean and become a fantastic machine on the Mexican coast. <br /> <br /> Nobody knows what this colossal, block structure is. Obviously, it is a wooden artifact because it consists of right angles with a kind of bald sphere half visible above. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the machine, nicknamed Kronos, comes from the planet and was sent here to steal the earth from energy. You see, here on Earth, we learned to convert matter into energy, but on planet Kronos, they understood the other half of the equation: how to convert energy into matter. And now they are running out of energy on the other planet. Do you take notes on this? Well. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you can tell me some of the scientific questions raised by Kronos' mission. For example, if Kronos builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa, why do not they convert some of their own materials into energy instead of sending sophisticated machines to Earth to turn off the lights in Los Angeles? But it is unlikely that the authors can explain it either. Inverting the polarities of two antennas is described as an "anthropic conversion", which means a "change to man", which makes no sense. But it does not seem that science makes sense in this respect. The diagram Morrow draws on the board shows that the current goes in the wrong direction, from positive to negative. <br /> <br /> The locomotion of Kronos is also a problem. He walks along the coast, threatening "populated areas" (read Southern California), but he has no joints in his two or three legs. These strains collide slowly, crushing some people. The movie does not do much about those crushed people. They are presented as Mexican peasants, so maybe they do not count too much. The USAF is also throwing a hydrogen bomb at Kronos - while it's in Mexico, notice. Nobody raises their eyebrows. <br /> <br /> Little action game is needed and not much is given. Jeff Morrow has a distinct and resonant voice, ideal for radio voice or voiceover. His face is less expressive. Whatever the situation, he has only one expression: a close smile, as if he were taking pictures at the Universal Studios Tour. Barbara Laurence had a beautiful gold quality when she directed "Street With No Name" a few years earlier. She was 17 years old and was the wife of Richard Widmark. Here, her appearance and behavior reduce her to being an actress in B-movies, even if she's still pretty. It is always good to see Morris Ankrum in one of these films. He created so many that I mix them. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film seems flat, I'm afraid. (There are, however, some nice pictures of a B-47 in flight.) Trays reveal a low-budget business. This is not necessarily bad in itself, but nothing makes up for deprivation. Little tension in the scenario, no director display, and little effort in performance. <br /> <br /> You could have a good footing - a casual top - because it's absolutely flawless. It's just that there are so many better films like that.
