The effects of Western-style feminism on the various subcultures of India have so far remained virtually non-existent, with the two entities belonging to foreign and threatening realms (in the name of tradition) never coinciding. Art imitates life (at least so-called) and popular Hindi cinema is no exception, reflecting an underlying misogyny that unfortunately is the foundation of much of of Indian collective culture. But why? What has made the feminine gender so odious to the culture that women are regularly subjected to the most unimaginable horrors, such as rape, murder, infanticide, imposed illiteracy, infidelity and subjugation of the spirit in the name of 'dot'? Rajkumar Santoshi's latest offer, "Lajja", poses the same plaintive question, linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chapters / episodes that constitute the path of shame endured by her protagonist, Vaidehi (Manisha Koirala). <br /> <br /> The management of Santoshi is not up to the level required by history. He fails to display the sensitivity necessary to describe the saga of sadness and confronts the problem of misogyny aside, rather than head on. Santoshi recently said he did not shoot the film for an international film festival, but rather for the masses of his country. Unfortunately, the film blatantly shows and the film too often falls into the kind of blood-blood action that Santoshi specializes in. The film suffers from its jerky and episodic rhythm and its end is a bit too artificial. <br /> <br /> The female cast has much nicer and more rounded characteristics than their male counterparts. The protagonist is interpreted with tact by the beautiful and luminescent Manisha Koirala, who proves to Lajja that she is one of the most competent ladies of our time. An appropriate role and structure allowed him to break away from a truly commendable performance. One wonders how brilliantly she had shone if the film had been shot by a director with the creative intent and appreciation. Mahima Choudhary performs a commendable performance and continues to demonstrate that she is an untapped talent. Embodying Janki, Madhuri Dixit plays with unprecedented fervor and bliss for what really deserves the name of "game". The role of an intelligent street artist who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child represents the greatest risk in his role as singing and dancing songs that have maintained his tent status at during the last decade. This leaves the last and most disturbing performance of this so-called feminist saga, that of the talented Rekha. Lajja is Manisha Koirala's film, there is no doubt about it, but it's Rekha who dominates the debates in a performance that sinks into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the vestibules of your heart . Rekha dazzles under the name of Ramdulari, renouncing vanity and complacency to offer a performance so full of authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this part of the film. The comparisons are really odious, especially when they are opposed to one of the greatest ladies in the world, but in front of the benevolent presence of this legend of screen in title, the others fade in its shade. <br /> <br /> "Lajja" is not sophisticated. proto-feminist dramas like "Zubeidaa", "Pinjar", or even the celebration of the queen of hell "Laadla": it fulfills its feminist goals in two first moments: the noisy tirade in which Mahima reprimands her in-laws for having abuse of his rights. his father who committed no other crime than to give birth to a girl. It breaks out, leaving the wedding procession in ruins. Seeing her father devastated, she begins to cry, blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her. She moaned, "Why did I say something, I ruined everything, it's all my fault!" Her grandmother, a silent witness of the aggression she suffered, comforts her by saying, "Why are you crying, there is no reason for you to cry, you have nothing to complain about. fault is mine, the fault is with every woman who came before you, because if we had the courage to say nowadays what you said today, you would not have needed to say what be it today. "The importance of feminist heritage is clearly highlighted through words. <br /> <br /> The other, more subtle, moment comes very early in the film when Vaidehi (Manisha) fled from her abusive husband to the shelter of her parents' home in India. For viewers in Western societies, it may seem perfectly reasonable (and even natural) for any woman victim of violence to seek protection from her parents; However, this is a taboo of society in many eastern cultures, including India. Once a woman is married, the identity she assumes is that of her husband and her personal assets (family, businesses, children, etc.). For her, giving up these responsibilities is a serious social sin, which has no equivalent for the Western woman. It is then considered to be an attack on property and as "damaged property", the value of which has been entirely canceled by its own actions and its refusal to submit to the role entrusted to it. She is less an individual than she is an emblem of family honor. His father reprimands him for his actions, fearing that his family honor would be irreparably tarnished by the girl he had already transferred to another man. Her main concern is the impending marriage of Vaidehi's younger sister, a much less likely prospect with a divorced elder daughter of the same household. He tells her without hesitation that she must return to the man to whom she belongs legally, as violent and sadistic as it is. He raises against it the old adage that says: "The honor of each home is in the hands of his daughter". She answers silently and thoughtfully: "Yes, the honor of each home is in the hands of her daughter, but there is no honor for the girl herself."
