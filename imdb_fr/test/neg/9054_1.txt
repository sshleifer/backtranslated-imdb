An IMDb reviewer calls Eaten Alive a passable movie for the "cannibal connoisseur". Are there such people? I did not know. But if you are one of them, hey, have fun. The rest of you might find it hard to swallow (pun intended) even though, like me, you consider yourself a horror movie geek. I've been a horror enthusiast for about 15 years now, although I've never been familiar with the cannibal subgenre a few weeks ago, and I guess I owe my ephemeral interest to those movies causing moans, strangely enough , to China total disregard for copyright laws. You see, I bought a two-disc DVD collection of all Wesley Snipes movies for 20 yuan (about $ 2.75), which included Last Cannibal World, The Mountain of the Cannibal God, Eaten Alive, Cannibal Holocaust, Next, with Nicholas Cage and something called Voodoo Lagoon, with Blade 1-3, in Chinese. Nice. <br /> <br /> Being a second sequel, I immediately felt that the film began with a cannibal in street clothes wandering in major US cities, shooting unsuspecting Americans with darts poisoned, then rushing at full speed. Having exhausted the means to scare the cannibals of movies, it now seems that they have headed for the continent. Later, you may be shocked to learn that this guy is participating in a "training exercise". Lock up your girls! <br /> <br /> Shortly after, the film settles into the old routine of missing sister, while a blonde young woman, Sheila, begins her own investigation into the disappearance of her sister, who does not it does not look like him, but she's ready. spend most of the nude movie, so I guess it does not matter. It seems that after shooting at one of his victims, the unfortunate cannibal that we met at the beginning of the film, who was not used to living in a big city, hit the road and was hit by a van. movement. <br /> <br /> Brilliant police forces uncover a mysterious movie showing Sheila's sister involved in bizarre ritual behavior, but aside from the movie, the guy is a complete mystery. As the chief of police deplores, "we do not know anything about him except he's dead!" Poor guy, he must have a headache because of all that. I recommend a nap. Fortunately, Sheila is the kind of girl who can spend tens of thousands of dollars as if she were not looking for her sister. Perfect for hiring a brave backwoods guide caricature, as the police will clearly be of no help. <br /> <br /> Obviously, nothing new is added to this tiny subgenre. On the contrary, cannibalism almost seems to be the background of a whole other kind of bad movie, about rescuing a missing person from dangerous elements. Thicken the plot of this clothesline is not difficult, just add a caricature cult in the jungle of people who follow a guy called Jonah, who believes in the use of pain as a means of reunite man with nature, process call "purification". Personally, I prefer just peeing outside once in a while. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Sheila is caught by one of the sect members - an overweight guy who seems to have taken a three-day weekend from the office to appear in this movie. As he pulls out his trusty medical kit to give him an injection, he warns him, "If you do not believe in Jonah and purification (through pain), God help you." He then gives her a shot and, when she grimaces a tiny pinch, he apologizes politely. I feel a true believer in this type! <br /> <br /> As far as gore is concerned, there are a lot of unpleasant sound effects on random images of slaughtered animals and a sufficient number of disgusting sequences of women cut and eaten alive, so I guess there the film is aptly named. The acting is incredibly bad, as one might expect, and it is interesting to note that the editing is also spectacularly sloppy but still strangely effective. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think you need to be able to connect with people who believe in completely foolish sects to put you in touch with anyone in the movie. There are many strange religious ceremonies taking place, making it increasingly difficult to understand why Sheila's sister decided to turn her back on normal society. I am all for individualism and do your own thing, but come on. <br /> <br /> After a while, the film goes even further in your standard escape movie, just before we attend Glory's most completely inappropriate rendition, Glory Hallelujah in the film's story . SENSATIONAL. <br /> <br /> Note: In this film, a woman is raped with a severed snake. If you need more reason to never look at it, seek the help of a professional. Avoid this mess at all costs.
