I approached this film with the understanding that it was one of the worst films ever made. I sat down to look at him with that state of mind and was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> It's not great. It's not even so good; in fact, it's pretty poor. However, it is not as serious as I had been led to believe, by far. This is quite inept, and obviously, as a cost-saving measure, many archive sequences are put into service, many of which have no apparent connection to the narrative. an intensely personal film made by a man who obviously had neither the skills nor the funds to do justice to his idea. Before buying back _Glen or Glenda? _, Examine your own artistic skills. I would love to draw, but all I'm trying to draw is like a stick. I wish I could sing, but all I do is scare young children. <br /> <br /> Wood had an idea and, unfortunately, he did not have what it took to make it work. However, it was an incredibly daring film for the Puritans of the 50s, so exploiting or incoherent it may seem at first sight.
