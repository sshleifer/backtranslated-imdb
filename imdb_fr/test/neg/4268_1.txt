Stay away from this one. The worst thing is the dreadful story. There seems to be an intention to convey a subtle spiritual / love / friendship message, but it is so pathetically devoid of any substance that you can not help but cringe. In addition, the majority of the time spent on the screen corresponds to a story well below the standard of thieves, criminals and our (our) hero (s) dealing with some extraterrestrial artifacts related to time travel. I know you're in trouble when you deal with time, but the story is full of holes than usual. You also have: inexpensive sets, bad acting and some of the worst musical arrangements in the history of the moving image, overwhelming, cheap, abrupt and disjointed. All I can say is "Man alive! This movie is bad!"
