Some things will not stay dead. They just have to keep coming back for more, whether we like it or not. I guess some people like to beat a dead horse. The first "Ghoulies" was a surprise success and his first sequel was an even better movie. The third film took a more comic approach and at this point, the little idiots began to exceed their reception. I guess someone in Hollywood thought the idea of ​​resurrecting the franchise was a good idea, but the result will probably disappoint fans of previous entries. <br /> <br /> For: The acting game is actually pretty good for a movie like this. A silly score, but fun. Move at a correct pace. Cheese for those who love it. Some very good sequences full of action. A little more conspiracy than the others and unlike II & III at least tries to bond with the original. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Not as much fun as its predecessors. Although there is more plot than before, it's pretty ridiculous. Mediocre effects. The original Ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and are here replaced by two trolls that serve no purpose other than being comic reliefs. Speaking of comedy, all attempts at humor are lame. It's a direct sequel to the first film, but there are so many details in suspense. For example, I thought Jonathan had finished with black magic after what had happened in the original? It's not spectacular in other films, but the direction of this film is particularly bland. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: the first three films 'Ghoulies' are a dream for moviegoers. This fourth and final sequel (hopefully) is a little disappointing. Of course, there is fun to have, but it's just not the same thing. The others also have a small budget, but the people involved put in a lot more. See if you are a completeist or want to see beautiful women in tight outfits. Otherwise, stay with the other three. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
