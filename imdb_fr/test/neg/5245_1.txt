GOOD: Technomusic accompanying medieval sword. In addition, the movie is more elegant than most B-movies, but let's be realistic: Quake or Doom has more atmosphere. I am usually able to see the potential of even very bad movies; heck, I like a good B-movie like "Split Second" and tastes. But this one has only the boredom and the clich√© to offer ... Totally predictable from the beginning to the end. Oh, and I forgot the ugly special effects, they look more like an old Playstation game than anything that is mythical! The use of a classic poem to sell this miller offends me! <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: Simply boring. If you want to see Lara Croft, buy the game, it's much sexier!
