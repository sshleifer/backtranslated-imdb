I really do not know why people are so complacent about this strange film. That said, I spent the entire two hours saying nothing, and I can not say that it was not totally non-entertaining. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Frank Marshall is not a real director and that is clear in the film - he is an experienced producer, so he will have seen a film shot several times and will understand what happens in the process. But I think it's quite different to be able to really direct a movie - the direction was competent, but flat and without direction. Marshall has more experience as a unit or as a second manager, and I feel that the finished product has resulted - it's apparently a set of sets that really failed to maintain a continuity in his sensations or in his character. <br /> <br /> Fun, observable, but good? No.
