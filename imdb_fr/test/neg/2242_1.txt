This film does not deserve a criticism, it has just decided not to go see the next film Tarantino. And I loved Tarantino's movies. <br /> <br /> Not artistic, not entertaining, not spiritual, not funny, nothing, just dull and stupid. If this movie had been Tarantinos first, it was also his last. <br /> <br /> Tarantino must recover, otherwise his next film will have three hours of lack of meaning, boredom and lack of freshness. dialogue. He seems to have fallen in love with his dialogue - and his love is blind. <br /> <br /> Once you've finished your popcorn, there's no reason to sit down at the theater anymore.
