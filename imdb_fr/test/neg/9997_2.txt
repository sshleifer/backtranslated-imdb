Terrible, terrible, terrible times, a hundred people still do not begin to describe how "Biggest Loser" is zero. Imagine this: Take two big couples with nothing interesting to say, humiliate them and let them work to lose weight, all on prime time TV. Am I the only one who thinks it's not something that people with an IQ in the three-digit area WANT TO LOOK AT? Everything hangs around forever, with masses of lard lamenting that losing weight is going to be so important to them and their lives. Does anyone care? Do they think we care? Are they concerned if we care? Probably not. I think I will shoot videos myself and sell them to a big TV company. If it goes for television, it's the same for my workouts!
