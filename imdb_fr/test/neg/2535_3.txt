I think the problem with some reactions to this film is that - with a few exceptions - they do not focus on the main disconnect, hence the main division of the audience. <br /> <br /> On one side, there are those who are caught by the visual design, the pretty costumes and the variety of elements entering the film. Some movie buffs love color and animation, as well as all the "magic" effects that are scary, animals that are metamorphosed, and so on. Some culture lovers like the complicated references, the layers of different elements of folklore and the fact that they can see Zhang Ziyi sing and be mime, in two different languages, in what was supposed to be a children's comedy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, some people say that a children's film should still make sense, that a mix of folk tales is not a tale at all, and that It's easier to believe in magic when you're fed up with the technical aspects to make it look real. <br /> <br /> In other words, the ideas could be lovely; but when you put them on the stage, they have to deliver. Here they do not do it. <br /> <br /> A good folk tale - from any country - has a clear story, a point and characters that interact strongly with each other. They miss them all. Some gestures too sophisticated for opera, Western and Japanese, can not replace a solid theme. <br /> <br /> As a fan of fantasy, I must say that I spent some time between turkeys and lovers, but this one really tries to do too much - cheaply. Put in Zhang Ziyi to try to add a little glitter smell of exotic flowers syndrome. The other problem is not that there is no conspiracy; there is a half-story, which means that you continue to be shot, and then dropped again while another not-too-brutally-executed dance number starts. <br /> <br /> The characters all seem to know that they play the main role. in a movie. Unless you really enjoy watching amateur video from other people, it's not good. I would like to test that on real kids; I think they would drop it for Uproar in Heaven after about 20 minutes.
