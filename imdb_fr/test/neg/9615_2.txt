Oh, my God - I do not see how Alfred Hitchcock (North by Northwest, Spellbound, the 39 Steps) could be so ugly, this cheap shocker, it's beyond me. Do not look for hidden depths or deep meanings - there are none. It's just awful, shabby and cheap. The main characteristic of the inspector is the family life of the inspector who directs the investigation: his wife considers herself a gastronomic cook and constantly serves her revolting culinary experiences to her poor husband. It's fun and it saved me from putting the film in the "terrible" category, but the film as a whole is one of the most unpleasant I've ever seen. I think it was Hitchcock's last movie - maybe someone was trying to tell him something.
