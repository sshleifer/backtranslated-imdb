This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life! I'm wasting my time on this. I watched this movie completely as I took a punishment for myself. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie? there is no continuity. We feel that he has just shot scenes and joined them in editing software! The music is of course, but the movie does not need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake and I wonder what role Celina Jaietly has in the movie? Bobby Deol is good. at least he can act! Upen Patel must take acting lessons rather than take off his shirts in almost every scene! The end was the most pathetic! <br /> <br /> After watching "300" (the movie), I watched Shakalaka Boom Boom, you can really imagine how I felt about this Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> I really respect Bollywood, but please, directors and producers, be realistic, everything is not fantastic!
