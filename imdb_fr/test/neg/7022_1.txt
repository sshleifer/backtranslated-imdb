Lucille Ball was a powerful powerhouse on television in the 1950s and 1960s, but she still did a casual film, including THE LONG, LONG TRAILER and THE FACTS OF LIFE. Although her television career remained strong in the early 1970s, her film career seemed to be over, but Ball was determined to have one last big screen and the project she chose was the 1966 MAME musical. In many ways, the role seemed tailor-made: based on the popular novel that gave rise to two different Broadway plays, Mame Dennis is a wild and wildly uninhibited woman who "inherits" his orphaned nephew Patrick - and leads him on a wild tour of the possibilities of life, moving from one comics to another. The music, which included songs such as "Open a New Window" and "If it worked in my life today", was one of Jerry Herman's best works. The basic cast, which included Robert Preston and Bea Arthur, was the best of the best. Expectations were great; The opening night was great. the film was a disaster. The critics were dismayed and the audience was speechless. <br /> <br /> Whatever Lucy's fans may say, MAME is a fiasco, so much so that it's hard to know where to start. It is poorly directed, poorly filmed, misinterpreted and this is where Lucille Ball is at the center of everything, unable to dance, unable to sing and smiling like a waxworks model while incredibly bad choreography revolves around her . But the disaster comes with difficulty from her. the support distribution is not better. Bea Arthur and Jane Connell recreate their roles on stage by Vera Charles and Agnes Gooch; the first is on stage, the last is gloomy. Robert Preston manages to sing with a smile, but he is quite lonely and obviously not very happy about it. <br /> <br /> The DVD presents the widescreen widescreen VHS release movie, but it only means that there is more fright to see. Everyone loves Lucy, but only the least critical fan can love Lucy's MAME; while I would not say it's serious enough to make you want to tear your eyes off, you may want to have some. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon review
