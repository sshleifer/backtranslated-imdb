I watched this as part of a marathon of vampire movies with a search intent, otherwise I would have never looked at it thoroughly. The first scene where a gang of vampires wearing very bad wigs are electrocuted by various slow weapons manipulated by an even slower aspirant Van Helsing ... in black and white ... with a voiceover, sets the tone for the whole film. rest of the film. The fighting scenes look ridiculous, the dialigene would be funny if the acting was not so bad, what happens to the plot does not make sense, and the values ​​of the production bite ( from the plumage of the mantle worn by the hero The cheap magician's cloak their lead vamp revolves around.) <br /> <br /> I've seen some bad movies (see The Magic Sword with B. Rathbone, or the Raven with a very young Jack N.), but this one gets my vote for the worst of all time.
