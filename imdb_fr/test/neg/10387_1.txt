This film had very few moments of real drama. After the first few minutes, the movie went down in a spiral that did not really take us to hell and the back-view was a purgatory at least. The acting was more horrible than the subject of the film and sometimes I kept laughing. The continuity between certain scenes was dramatic: characters disappeared from scenes without explanation were replaced by other characters who, a few minutes earlier, had been elsewhere. It was surely a parody of the exorcist. The collection plate at the church was to be full of copper the day Mr. Russo signed up for it. Do I speak Latin? And you Brutus.
