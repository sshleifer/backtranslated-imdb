for starters, I'm easily happy. I'm by no means a real critic, and movies that genuine critics, friends, family and newspapers can find horrible can even be fun to watch. <br /> <br /> not this one though. <br /> <br /> I got it because it was the last movie wesley snipes from my DVD store. I like snipes, but it was disappointing. <br /> <br /> bad story, bad actors, continuity problems, shit sound, depressing places, pseudo-cool snipes, I really had to force myself to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> they even left marks on the plans where a car had to stop. <br /> <br /> and I do not speak of a "small production company / young director / small budget" a little bad, where you can ignore some mistakes because you feel sympathy. <br /> <br /> An action movie that disgusts you and disappoints you like someone else for a long time.
