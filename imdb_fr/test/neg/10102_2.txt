I just watched this today on television. It was on ABC's Sunday Afternoon movie. <br /> <br /> It was not a very good movie, but for a low-budget independent film like this, everything was fine. There is a bit of suspense, but there are so many bad qualities that really make the film fall. The scenario is rather lame and the elements of the plot are not very realistic, such as how a 911 operator would laugh and hang up when an individual reported a murder. I do not know what the writer thought when he got this idea, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was going to be a good suspense thriller, because there were some scenes that seemed to lead to something good, but unfortunately, they never did. There have been some storyline elements that have been used in other films similar to this one, and ultimately, have not proved very creative. <br /> <br /> If there is anything good about this film, it's the casting. All the actors of this film worked well with what they had to work with. The terribly underrated actress Elizabeth Pena was excellent in this film. She is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice. However, if you want to see a really good movie, watch the great animated movie The Incredibles. In this movie, she used her sexy voice wisely. <br /> <br /> What can I say, this movie is not really worth your time, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, they all lost their time with this movie, which is a shame. This movie tried to be a good thriller thriller, but in the end, it fell flat. If you want to see a good movie that looks like this, but much better, see The Hitcher. If you want to see something with the actors in this movie, watch one of their other movies. You can easily skip this movie if you have the chance to see it.
