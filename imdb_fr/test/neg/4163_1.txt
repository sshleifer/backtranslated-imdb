I just finished watching this movie and I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was so boring that I found myself zooming in at X2 speed and finishing it in less than 30 minutes. I was not only disappointed, but sorry to have wasted my money to rent it. It's in the top five of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands of movies! The plot was very confusing. If I had not first read the DVD sleeve before renting it, I would have been totally lost throughout this movie. I would not have thought that Tim Robbins, having made such good films as "Shawshank Redemption" would have agreed to appear in this film.
