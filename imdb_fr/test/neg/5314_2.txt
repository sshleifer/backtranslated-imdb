I laughed twice watching this movie and, in case you were wondering, I was not having a bad day and I was not subject to anything else that could have skewed my opinion when I watched this kinematic saddle . This film is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and I simply could not. With all that talent, you would think it would have been at least watchable, right? False. <br /> <br /> Let's play to suck and not suck! John Travolta - Very nice. Although visibly buried under too much makeup, I found it pleasant to watch. Did not fear. <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman - After killing bills 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this character writes atrociously. The highlight of this character was to show someone how to use a T-Mobile Sidekick. Sucked. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn - The role played to death by a white man who thinks himself black goes to Vince "Money" Vaughn. Is this character model still considered funny? I like the guy, but I want to see him in something better than this one. It was like he was falling. Sucked. <br /> <br /> CÃ©dric the animator - This guy is good. He made an excellent monologue after being called a racial insult (you can probably guess what it is) which was probably the best part of the movie. He was funny and really elevated the content that was given to him simply by his presence. Did not fear. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel- Sucked because of a performance called. <br /> <br /> James Woods- Sucked but not his fault. In fact, yes it was. It reminded me of his role in Casino for some reason. I do not like maniacs James Woods, I like to burn James Woods slowly. Victim of bad writing, maybe? Andre 3000- Sucked but he fell while swaying. I think he has potential, as long as he is not led by a hack on his next picture. <br /> <br /> Christina Milian - She's absolutely beautiful and visibly talented, but this movie is not going to make her a star. . Did not fear, but needs a better vehicle for his talents that is not led by a hack. <br /> <br /> The Rock - That should have been the role that catapulted him to the rank of movie star, but as directed by F. Gary Gray, ends up sadly mismanaged. In this film, Rock projects this charisma that makes him so likeable that I felt sorry for him. He really tries and although he does not succeed completely, he gets an A + for effort from me. This guy is not afraid to embarrass himself and be completely counter-type, playing a gay bodyguard with his eyes on celebrity. I really want to see him doing things big. He has what it takes as long as he is not led by a hack. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to what I consider to be the weak link in this production. I might as well come and say it, right? F. Gary Gray's direction was about as strong as really serious diarrhea. Wow, it was bad. Who had the brilliant idea to let this guy lead? The negotiator was good but what else on his resume convinced people that he was the man for the job? Between his direction and the atrocious writing, I am ready to offer the two culprits a beautiful lead salad at the knees. Do you want to see John and Uma dancing? Maybe I could think of another movie with these two that I could recommend to watch instead. It did not cost me ten dollars and fifty cents. It cost me to go to the theater. <br /> <br /> This film could have been good, and it was not even "quite right". <br /> <br /> RATING: * on *****. <br /> <br /> PS Fergie from Black Eyed Peas is worth noting. Sizzling!
