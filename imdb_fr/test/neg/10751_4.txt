Mystery of low-budget murder where a Public Defender tried to free his client of the murder of which the man had been sentenced 12 years ago. The fact that he escaped custody after his conviction was complicated, but the DP believes that the man is innocent of the murder and is trying to find the real killer. Gig Young as PD is doing well, and James Anderson as a convicted murderer is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole does not suggest suspense and, despite some good players, performance is generally below normal. Director George Archainbaud was apparently more comfortable making westerns - he was broadcasting Gene Autry's television series in Columbia about this time - but even if he had tried to breathe life into this picture, the hack script would have defeated his attempts. At best, the film culminates with a courtroom scene straight out of an episode of "Perry Mason" and that is just as predictable.
