Let me understand: <br /> <br /> "Plastic surgeon Hotshot loses a patient on the operating table by removing a cyst from his face and ends up falling in love with the recently separated hostess of breakfast in the 24 hours following her departure to meet her because of her wise advice on how to do the bedsides. "<br /> <br /> Wow. Move on "The notebook", there is a new child in town. <br /> <br /> Where to start. Well, what about the depth of this "relationship"? I think we can safely summarize the foundations of this eternal love by doing the following: <br /> <br /> 1. Swap polite jokes for a mouthful of salad. 2. Drink a lot of Jack Daniels; play basketball with old food 3. Provide wise and unsolicited advice on your life of misery. 4. Make love during a hurricane. 5. Devote your lives to one another by air mail. <br /> <br /> I noticed that George C Wolfe had "The Hairball" and "United Kanye West Project" in his file. Would "stick to your gender" be too hard? Enough said. I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry, laugh or even hope. But the reason they are able to do this is that somewhere in the plot, we really start to worry about the characters we watch on the screen. We need to take the time to develop these characters, their lives, their stories, why we are watching them now. Wolfe did not seem to want to "waste our time" with such trivialities, but instead provided us with about 8 minutes of general information about each character before embarking on an intense face-to-face interaction between two ACTORS us. " let's all love it, but we do not care about two characters. <br /> <br /> For a brief moment, Richard Gere exclaims that he does not expect her to listen to his problems, and she invites him to come and dine, the viewer sees a glow - a beginning - of something special between these two characters, but instead of being able to enjoy the anticipation and fantasy of "what happens next" in the marvelous and unpredictable joy of the court, we are rather drawn into a love story between two people we barely know. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, we've all heard of a nerdy liner in romantic movies. s why we took advantage of Bogart in "Casablanca" or Nicholson in "Something's Gotta Give" is due to the fact that our hearts and minds were lifted to the sky and dragged in the mud, then again with these characters, and deliver the line, we are so involved in their difficult situation, we do not even notice the cheese factor. Since Wolfe does not allow us to love or love our protagonists, we still have a cheese sandwich and a few snickers in the audience. <br /> <br /> Wolfe takes the phrase of the old Hollywood director chasing it "far too literally here." While each lining is delivered by our team, the viewer wonders if the director Wolfe subliminally tells the audience: " Come on, it's a Richard Gere romance. Just make yourself right. "<br /> <br /> It was as a result of this astonishing lack of character - or relational development - that the film's climax failed miserably - when Gere's character died, I felt that I was watching the news of the death of someone I did not know, or watching a rowing race of the eight ladies during the Beijing Olympics, just not Care. <br /> <br /> Epic, fail.
