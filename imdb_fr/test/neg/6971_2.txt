I saw Ed Wood's biopic a few years ago. Tim Burton paid a loving tribute to this extremely talented but enthusiastic filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Plan 9 and it really tickled me. A stupid story, a kind of bad production but always fun and even fun. <br /> <br /> So this. What can you do with it? Well, since Wood was reported as a transvestite, it's amazing to see a movie that treats him like a cartoon. Yes, there are some attempts to teach something on the subject to the public, but it is usually a kind of parody really twisted. <br /> <br /> One of the problems is that he has a hundred points of view. On the one hand, it is a plea for tolerance. Another describes transvestism as a disease. And finally, he says to the audience, "Okay, if you're shocked now, wait and see that!" The problem was that Wood had to compromise to be able to make the film. You can almost feel it when you see the opening title of the producer: Personally supervised by ... So, where are we? This is neither a serious film nor a totally shocking subject. <br /> <br /> The entertainment value is practically zero. The wooden voiceover is slightly amusing, but only because it looks so misguided. This was done in the 50s however, so we can say that it was brave to make a movie that even mentioned the word travestis. It all boils down to what the film itself is trying to defend against. Schock. The rape scene, though sweet, is just there to do it. <br /> <br /> So, sorry. It is a failure, but the discredit is not the only one of Wood.
