Yes, it's pure trash. It may be interesting for all experimental film buffs (like me) to see Lowlifes chatting and do nothing for nearly two hours, but it becomes very painful when you realize you really paid for it. It's probably one of those movies you like to watch for its total emptiness and nihilism. I accept it however for its shock value, decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction.
