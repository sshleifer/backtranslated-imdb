This film affirms through its protagonist that the world is essentially composed of sadness and pain and that those who do not know it have blinkers. One wonders if this is true or not. But even if you accept this as true, the film ends either A) argues that there may be good results in tragic situations or B) forgets that and uses a clich√© montage to let the audience feel high. <br /> <br /> That the film metaphorically acknowledges his protagonist by presenting him as a sympathetic character despite any evidence of this sympathy reflects the contempt of the secondary characters that were most convincing in the film. <br /> <br /> have in this film a scenario whose theme and direction are not coherent and do not put the end in sync with the rest of the film. All members of the cast, especially Spacey, Olin, Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson, are performing well. It's a pity they were not supported by a better screenwriter / director.
