It's not really a complicated story. It is not a mystery or a plot that you have to spend time watching because you have forgotten an intrinsic part of the dialogue. Claiming a movie has to be seen several times for you to get it, it can apply to very few movies, but it's not one of them. These types of films have substance and involve so much that it is easy to miss a significant part of the dialogue or a subtle nuance to trace details that you may have overlooked. With Goya's ghosts, that does not apply. The main flaw of this film is the lack of detail. He jumps from one character to another, never giving enough substance to a set of scenes to allow the participation of those who watch them. Because of this, you do not connect to any of the characters. You do not reach the point where you care. Either the main actor is gone when the film seems to be redeeming, or their actions are despicable and you are not inclined anyway. Goya's refusal to go far to help Ines is a good example. His refusal to commit more reflects the general tone of his role. The only characters you can momentarily feel are Ines, when she is interrogated and then tortured. After his rape by Lorenzo, any concentration on his character is almost over. Then, the best scenes of the film are based on Lorenzo's invitation to dinner with Ines' family and his father's attempts to force Lorenzo to sign false confessions and recover his daughter. Then, as things start to grow again, they are part of the movie. I read a lot of comments here about the fact that the movie did not know what it wanted to be, etc. I found that basically he managed not to be much. Since Lorenzo's return and Goya's accidental visit of Ines' daughter, everything seemed unthinking. Without a long story, no effort was made to really examine the turbulent times in which they lived. The essence of who Goya was was not materialized except for his actions, or his absence, proving that he was more self-centered than anything else. As far as his art was concerned, the film seemed to want to examine some of the paintings he had made, but there was once again an additional opportunity to examine the reactions to this work rather than the work itself. To summarize the best, the film had no cohesion, it was badly lacking substance to plunge into the historical environment it covered and, in the end, let you think that what you just saw was a series of attempts aborted to engage the viewer by passing from one thing to another without adequately engaging the viewer in any of these things. You can not look at this kind of thing many times, hoping it will improve with additional scrutiny. There is simply not enough to waste time. This is not a case where you miss something, it would simply be further evidence that the ingredients necessary for the success of this movie are just not there. As for the best movie ever made? It's not even the best movie I've seen today.
