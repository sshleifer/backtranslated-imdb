It's literally the Three Stooges all over again, without the charm. This show is nothing more than the worst slapstick. I'm surprised they really have writers. The so-called jokes are completely random and controversial. No need to try to be very (very) difficult to be controversial. And people think it's 'pissed off'? Get a clue: this show takes absolutely no thought, time, effort, money, creativity or originality to produce. All references are for people aged 6 to 16 who occasionally visit People magazine. But I guess that's just what all kids want, love and need today.
