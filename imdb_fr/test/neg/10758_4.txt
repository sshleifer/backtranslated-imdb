It is incomprehensible to understand how this crude version of the film after watching the wonderful WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor is out of reach. <br /> <br /> Myra from MAE CLARKE is far from the role played by VIVIEN LEIGH in remaking. She plays an ordinary American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the "Yes" answers are a little shocking when you expect a less rude character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (presented in the credits of KENT DOUGLASS) is incredibly unlikely to the extent that a soldier likes it, no matter how many times it drops. BETTE DAVIS has a role to play in the game. <br /> <br /> Their melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the film are unimaginable (extravagant parts of the suraction), even if it is a coarser film. version of the story when the sound was only a few years old and the silent game was still in fashion. <br /> <br /> It's awful. And it ends abruptly with Clarke who loses his life during a bombing on the bridge. The End. <br /> <br /> It has no wonderfully nuanced performance of the 1940 MGM remake, including an original cast. Instead, it has come up with low-budget production values ​​(and I mean a modest budget) without any subtlety. And there is no brave pre-code in the scene where Myra explains to the aristocratic woman why she should not marry her son, Roy. She simply says, "I took it on the Waterloo Bridge." Explanation completed. Nothing daring. <br /> <br /> Summary: For once, the original is by no means the best version. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR have never been surpassed like Myra and Roy in the tender and superbly played 1940 classic movie.
