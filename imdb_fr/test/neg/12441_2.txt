It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I can not believe that people a) write scripts like this b) have a budget to make a movie c) expect it to be a success. The words can not even describe how horrible this movie is. I enjoy my lot of teen movies, but it was not even funny. In fact, it was funny just because it was so horrible. I can probably count one (maybe two) parts in the movie where I even managed to make a little laugh (except the laughs about the seriousness of the situation). <br /> <br /> The rental was one of the biggest mistakes. I have never done. It's been a day since I did not see the film, and I'm still shocked by its horror. To avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> 2/10
