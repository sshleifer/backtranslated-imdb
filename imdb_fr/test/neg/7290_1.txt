I wish I could find good things to say about this animated sequel (but not really a sequel) of "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", but that would be a very brief comment. The magic of the first was not found here. The animation is rather mediocre, the characters themselves are not very well drawn. The backgrounds and foregrounds are not good either. There is very little attention to detail here. And instead of a captivating and engaging story, we have 3 shorts stories that are boring and that do not make much sense. I swear, even the characters were ringing as if they were bored and would prefer to be somewhere else. Who says the actors were bored and wanted to be somewhere else, at least that's the impression. Some of the same actors are coming back for this lamentable effort, but the success of the first was for many the success of Michael J.Fox as the main hero, Milo Thatch.I have the distinct impression that this film has just been assembled capitalize on the success of the first, without Cree Summer comes back as the voice of "Kida". This is probably the only good thing about this movie, and even if it does not seem to have its heart in it. you can not blame all the actors for not giving everything, given what they had to work with, or rather not to work with. It's a straight film to the video (and I use the word vaguely) that should have gone straight to shame on Disney. Consumers deserve better than that. This one gets a 0/10 and a well deserved merit at that time.
