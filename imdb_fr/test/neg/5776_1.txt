Seeing the cover of this movie before watching it, my expectations were not great, especially since it was part of these horrible horror films blockbuster (alongside movies like Junior). <br /> <br /> Okay, not only Movie has stereotypical characters without brains (the rich shower-bag, the bitch, the sheriff, the tenant who knows what's wrong with the city, etc.) but who has such a dialogue, action, staging and incredible effects. Jeremiah Stone's guy was hilarious. (* SPOILER *) I'll never understand why he snapped out of nowhere as he held this idiot hostage. <br /> <br /> The basic principle of the film is as atrocious as other defects. From what I've learned, Jeremiah Stone was a gold digger during the Gold Rush and a notorious outlaw. He had a golden crapload (* SPOILER *) and cast a spell on anyone who was looking for him before being shot by the locals after killing a girl, but he not only survived, he bit his finger and s has run away. Thus, nowadays, a group of helpless morons discover this gold mine and, of course, they are warned by the local population of "The curse of forty-nine years". And what are they doing? As expected, ignored the warnings and eagerly sought for gold. They get gold and all kinds of things happen. Fortunately, (* SPOILER *) the dog is cut off the head. <br /> <br /> That's about it. Looking at the cover of the movie, you can tell what kind of movie it is going to be. It's so terrible that it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> 1 and a half stars out of 5
