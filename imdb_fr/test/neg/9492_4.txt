Douglas Sirk's first "image of women" cries for Universal, based on a didactic, dogmatic and didactic didactic novel of the intolerable Lloyd C. Douglas (author of this other piece of beloved shit, * The Dress *) . Rock Hudson, in the role that has propelled him to star status, plays Bob Merrick, a drunken playboy who is worth millions of dollars and who is more interested in pursuing skirts and motorboats than by the end from his medical studies. In the first scene, he wrecks his boat on a sumptuously photographed lake. The accident almost killed Merrick, who therefore needs a rather mysterious "resuscitation machine" to keep him alive. . . Meanwhile, Dr. Phillips, his beloved surgeon, eventually lost his life due to heart disease. Since the local hospital can only maintain one resuscitator at a time, Phillips dies so the louse can live. When Merrick learns this, he tries to apologize apologetically to Phillips' family, especially the widow (Jane Wyman, wearing a matron's headdress and gown), but everyone who knew the surgeon spit on Merrick like a pair of cobras. . A hospital doctor even calls this a "total mess" that the playboy lived in the surgeon's place in the image of Christ. Hippocrates might have something to say about it! <br /> <br /> It is in these first scenes that we find the typical iconoclasm sirkian: the director rubs us so much in the face in the discomfort of the middle class in mid-century America, we find ourselves in to encourage play-boy wastrel to put cushions of cries under the fannies of the chopsticks of these moral hypocrites. But, alas, no: the ludicrous plot of the novel must continue, and Merrick soon finds himself converting to God, under the pretense of blowing a pipe, Otto Kruger, an artist who claims that Phillips made him a better and even better man. painter. (Why do not we see this extraordinary art?) We learn that Dr. Phillips, who is intolerably ubiquitous, would often refuse to pay for medical services rendered (although the qualified person for these "magnificent exemptions" is never clearly indicated ). This is supposed to provide our hero with a whole new vision of life and an example of personal conduct. Kruger even tries to make all this seem very illicitly exciting: "Once you have started this project, you can not get away with it! It is an obsession ... a MAGNIFICENT obsession!" So Merrick tries to do it by harassing AGAIN the widow with apologetic excuses, but he does somehow get her hit by a car. She loses sight. Apparently, Merrick will still have several stations-of-the-cross to go before he can be considered an honest boy. <br /> <br /> But Sirk continues to sneak into his revenge even though the film grows more and more sermonist. The most obvious part must be the presence of Agnes Moorehead as the hospital's chief nurse and Wyman's friend and unspoken lesbian lover. Note the disappointment on Moorehead's face when Merrick, finally redeemed as a doctor, shows up to save Wyman's life towards the end. Hudson's homosexuality, an open secret in Hollywood at the time, is also used with great irony. He and Wyman - 15 years old and over - do not generate any erotic heat in their scenes together, which, by the way, is deliberately limited, probably because any other scene between the stars would expose this whole business without hope. (One thing we're sure of: if Rock Hudson was obsessed with something, it certainly was not Jane Wyman.) This is a chronic case of * Tea and Sympathy *. Sirk seemed to like to dig into everyone's noses by letting this gay actor - who was seducing the innocent ladies of the day - drift coldly through these exquisitely colored "women's pictures". In fact, the director worked with Hudson six or seven other times, optimally in the rest of this film, * All That Heaven Permits *, which brought Hudson and Wyman closer together, but was also accompanied by a realistic scenario. Meanwhile, in * Obsession *, we must endure God / Kruger who looks with an observer eye looking down Merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save the life of Wyman, in tandem with a musical score singer of a Hollywood choir. <br /> <br /> But to understand why Sirk is considered an author, discover the scene in which Wyman explains to his grown-up daughter that she can truly distinguish night and day. The whole frame is blackened here: the girl is barely visible and Wyman's face is slightly profiled against a dim light. She goes on to say that she hates the night because "I know Dawn will never come back." A great moment of glory that deserves a much better movie than * Magnificent Obsession *. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars.
