I found the film in my local video store and was surprised to see it on DVD. I had heard about explicit sex scenes, macabre violence and notorious debauchery. I sat down and watched and started laughing! The sets and the artistic direction were cheap and fake; nudity was sardonic and incredibly flippant; the story was poorly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written! The incestuous relationship between Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and her serene beauty sister, Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) can not be taken seriously ... it's not even shocking or disgusting! Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were obviously taken hostage during the making of this film, but fortunately they die in the first thirty minutes of the film. Cinematography was a joke and I was even more amused when they used a quote from the Bible! Mark's book not less. If you are looking for a shock value, this movie will disappoint you. If you are looking for the value of camp worship, you will be even more disappointed. I know I was. I've seen shocking and it's two hours of your life that you'll never have back.
