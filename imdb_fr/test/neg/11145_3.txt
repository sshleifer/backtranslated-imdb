All the hype! All additions! I was disappointed not to have seen it on the big screen. Where this movie worked was in the little details. In ALL the rest, it failed. Arnold has achieved many better performances in recent years. I thought that the days of Commando and Last Action Hero had disappeared from our lives. Unfortunately, this film is reduced to the lowest common denominator and brings Arnold back to a blunt muscle with a crumbling face who knows how to shoot weapons and detonate objects. In a last minute snapshot (and at another moment) predictable from the start, we see an actor glow that proved he was more than he had paid early in his career. I was not impressed by the movie because it never innovated or went anywhere other than where you expected.
