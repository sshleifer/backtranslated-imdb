It hurts me to say that about an Australian film, but Mr. Accident ranks among the worst of the worst films I've ever seen. Even more tragic is that it does not fall into the category "it's so bad it's good". What annoys me the most in this film is the rather large sum that was wasted in a useless, insignificant, underdeveloped scenario. Dumb performances (What do Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore, aka Elle McFeast, in this basket?), Inadequate direction, no plot and a general sense of wickedness totally undermine the design of the interesting production and leave you a really horrible taste in the mouth. . The comedy! Ha! Do yourself a favor and stay away!
