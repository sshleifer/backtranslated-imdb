I signed up for IMDb only to warn others about this movie. Has anyone ever received funding for projects like this one? It's the mystery. Farewell to Harry could be the worst movie of all time, except that I tried to wipe out the others who rival this moronic idiocy. Bad plot, not credible logic. I can not spoil this movie by revealing anything that might make your experience less enjoyable. This film is not pleasant. I have the CD and I will send it to you for free, it's so bad. First come, only served. If I know you, this offer is void, because I would not do this film to anyone, not by design. YOU WERE PREVENTED.
