The brass pictures (the movies are not a suitable word for them) are really a bit coppery. Their appealing visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive and high-quality television commercials. Unfortunately, Brass's images are feature films that claim to want to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this, they fail miserably, their undeniable qualities, but rather soft and flaccid than hot and erotic do not resist. <br /> <br /> Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti of the same title, Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of insane love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass moved the action from the 19th to the 20th century, in 1945 to be exact, so there are murals of Mussolini, men in black shirts, German uniforms or the ripped costume of the partisans. But the historical context is totally negligible. <br /> <br /> Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who craves for the amoral SS who always puts too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well-trained Italian actress and clearly above the content. His wide range of facial expressions (signal of boredom, disgust, joy of life, fear, hatred ... and ecstasy) is the best reason to look at this picture and deserves two stars. She endures this trashy trash with amazing dignity. I wish that very good parts accompany it. She really deserves it.
