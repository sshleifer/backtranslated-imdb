I really wish I had read the reviews of everyone before going to see the movie ... it was one of the most atrocious movies I've ever seen. I was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes after the beginning of the film; I should have followed my instinct. The film offered nothing new or intelligent, it was boring and very clich√©. I was surprised to find that it was headed by a woman! The characters do not represent any woman I know, they are boring, bitter and melodramatic. The film was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. And the actors looked tired, their makeup and hairstyle were mediocre. He was recently compared to the movie Sex and in the City; it was not even half as good. My suggestion, do not see this movie!
