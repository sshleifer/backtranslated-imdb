The remains of an army unit ambushed joined a group of cowboys to fight their way through the Indians on the warpath. Looks like it could be an exciting western, but this one is dull, dull, dull. It moves like molasses, the action scenes are not inspired, the acting is pedestrian, the writing is flat, even the photography is not very good. Eastwood plays early on an ex-Confederate who does not like the idea of ​​fighting on the same side as the Yankees. It's pretty much the only remote situation of interest in the whole film, but Eastwood was not experienced enough in acting to get by, and his character seems to be rather irritating than angry or bitter. A very ordinary western. In fact, a western much inferior to the ordinary. Worth a look if you are an Eastwood fan and want to see him at the very beginning of his career. Otherwise, do not bother.
