SPOILERS FOLLOW - and I did not even see it. <br /> <br /> Let me guess ... the murder has a connection to the demonic promoter who wanted to build the river, and Dickens was murdered for trying to uncover a similar vile plot. If someone who saw it can let me know if I'm half right, you saved me the time it would take to look at something worthwhile and the rest of us will be able to avoid both this film and its enthusiastic critics. On the other hand, this * seems * intriguing; but if it were good, would it really be given with a Sunday rag? And what kind of balance sheet does Foley have anyway? <br /> <br /> ... So, as a public service, I managed to get through it. It's worse than 'Swept Away'. Really. I read stories of eight year olds with more drama than that. Really horrible. And I was half right.
