A guy named Karl Rhamarevich learns to live even after his death by telekinesis. He is buried in a mausoleum. The same night, Julie (Meg Tilly) must spend the night to be part of a group called "The sisters". And Karl's "power" is in full bloom. <br /> <br /> Silly movie. I saw him in a theater when I was 21 years old and I was generally bored. PG's note should have warned me - it's a horror movie for kids. A real stupid scene in the end has a corpse that breaks through the concrete to hit a young man! For starters, the bodies are placed in HEAD first, which prevents the body from using its arms and it is impossible for anyone to lose concrete. When you notice such stupid mistakes, the movie does not do its job. <br /> <br /> He has two good scenes - two of the "Sisters" are "attacked" by floating corpses piling them up. At one point, one of the sisters strikes a corpse in her belly - her hand creeps into her body and she can not take it off! This scene stayed with me every year. And there is a nice little piece involving a corpse and a toothbrush at the end (which made the audience laugh). But the rest of the movie is a dark and dull memory. For children only - adults will get bored. I give him a 3.
