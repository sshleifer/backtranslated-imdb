Take advantage of the opening credits. They are the best thing about this mediocre but harmless time killer who offers passable performances such as those of Eric Roberts and Martin Kove. The main part, however, goes to the newcomer, Tommy Lee Thomas, who seems a bit small for this kind of action but who nevertheless manages sometimes to project a kind of belligerency. The first time we see him, he is shirtless, sweaty and engaged in this favorite activity of "beef": cutting wood. After that, he has seven other scenes without his shirt, one in which he is hanged by the wrists and zapped with electricity at the Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon". However, he could use a better scenario because the way he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing. There is also talk of millions of dollars apparently related to this survey but never explained. There are, however, some advantages. Sending "John Woodrow" under cover as "John Wilson" is a fun game on a president's name, and co-starring Jody (Ross) Nolan is promising as an inmate who, at the beginning of the proceedings , is shown hanging from the wrists and struck by a strong guard. One last remark: the film's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of "supplements". Despite the impressive size of the prison, there appears to be only about 12 inmates! (Note: the distribution credits at the end are not very useful.) For the record, the vigorous bald guard who uses Jody Nolan as a punching bag is played by Bill Fishback and the young blond guard who administers Electric Shocks of Thomas Tommy Lee are played by Marc Chenail.)
