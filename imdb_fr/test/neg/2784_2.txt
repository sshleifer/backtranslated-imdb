Right to video and with good reason. It's as if the children of the neighborhood were putting on a play in the courtyard, but worse. (Don Digiulio), a young man, inherits a farm in West Virginia that has been dormant for generations. He decides to take some friends to check the property. This farmland produced good harvests of corn even during the Great Depression. The secret was that the owner was murdering people and watering the fields with their blood. Then hang their bodies like scarecrows. The special effects are pretty lame and the awful dialogue is filled with one-liners and jokes so ridiculous that the sound can be turned off. Cheap and a simulacrum of horror film. Alongside Digiulio in the cast: Jeanie Cheek, B.W. York, Booty Chewning and Jessica Dunphy.
