. . . and never, never see him. Now, I've been watching bad scifi movies for years. I like watching bad scifi movies. I think that was the only reason I could watch this movie all the way through. "Nukie", "Indian Superman" and this awful film "Fantastic Four" hardened me, to name just a few examples. Usually, I have to bang my head against the wall after seeing a bad movie to remove some of the pain. No, not with this one. With "TDB", I hit my head with a shoe in the middle of the film. Temporary solution. I can not believe I wanted to see that. I cried. When it's over, I cried. It was horrible. It was worse than when I saw Wil Wheaton shudder in underwear in The Curse, which, by the way, never looks either. Aside from the fact that Wesley Crusher is in his tight pants, it's such a shame. But this review concerns "TDB". The worst thing about all this is that someone wrote this movie and said, "It's worth filming! It's great!" and Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe and all the other cast members said, "Oh, that's what I want in my movie story!" I'll watch "Indian Superman" until the cows come home, but I'll never see that bunch of smoking kids again.
