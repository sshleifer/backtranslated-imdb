Unfortunately, a boring movie, and the only way to see it, is obviously the bootled version of the public domain, which is so blurred and dark that it's sometimes hard to know where the screen is. The main actors are a nuisance. The man spends most of his time on the screen trying to seem nonchalant, charming and sexy, totally forgetting the content of the film and the murder suspect because of a lady who played it for a goose . The lady herself is content to go through the film, being worthy of her if she is not busy looking cute. It is a rather badly written text, never interesting or spiritual. No good camera work, no memorable soundtrack, no glamorous actresses or no atmospheric decor. It only scratches the surface of the genre, and nothing happens if you miss this totally flawless movie.
