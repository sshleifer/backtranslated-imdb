I have always found the dilettante Man Ray and his deeply pretentious artistic endeavors, and I have never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Besides his Rayographs (which he invented by chance and which are only direct contact photographic prints), his only real contribution to culture seems to be the fact that he was the first photographer to portray the feminine nudity of a way that was rather accepted than as porn. But that must surely have happened one day, and nothing really justifies Ray's merit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story of the Emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> "Star of shit" ... whoops, "sea" ... contains a lot of blurry photos and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained . Starfish have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs - and even regenerate whole bodies in duplicate - but, if it has anything to do with the theme of this movie, Ray fails to say it. I was much more impressed by the title cards of this movie, which include (in French) rhymes, a pun ('So Beautiful, Cybele') and suitcases. <br /> <br /> As often in Ray's work, there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this film. Unfortunately, photography is (to a large extent) so fuzzy that we hardly have the opportunity to appreciate it. I am going to evaluate this mess a point out of 10.
