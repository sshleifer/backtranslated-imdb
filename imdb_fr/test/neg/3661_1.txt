My girlfriend and I love horror movies. Especially those with a lot of useless nudity. When we saw the box cover for this blockbuster movie, we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night. We started looking at it, without expecting it to be great, but we thought it would at least attract our interest. 20 minutes after the beginning of the film, we realized that the pace would not accelerate and that it was an incredibly boring film. We tried to get in, but the plot made little sense even after reading and re-reading the back of the DVD box. The film was shot very dark and it was quite annoying to try to understand what was going on in each shot. Every scene of violence was very difficult to understand and you could never watch the violence you expected. It is definitely a film without motive that has been badly shot and very stretched. Each scene lasted about 20 minutes and I felt that I understood better after the first five. Ignore this movie and watch a movie from Freddy or Jason again and you'll be happier.
