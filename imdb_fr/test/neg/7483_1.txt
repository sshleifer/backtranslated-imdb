I do not think I have already assigned a score of 1/10 to something, but it easily gets the denomination. I have trouble sitting in one of his jokes. It's not just that the jokes are so bad, but combine that with the fact that Carson Daily has no charisma, can not set up or finish a typing line, and you have a late comedy recipe evening that will really hurt your heart. <br /> <br /> I watched the show, never in its entirety, but several times. It scares me after Conan. I usually watch for a minute or two to see if Carson is still the worst talk show host of all time. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you see him interviewing a guest, it's just an interview. I feel so sorry every time he receives a guest and their confused smiles try to hide their body language screaming, "Give me hell of this monster!" I recommend watching the show, not for laughter, but to think about how it went on the radio and what it's still doing there. Look as much as you can, I think you'll find his total awkwardness ... interesting.
