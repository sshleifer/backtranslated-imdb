The film was featured on the BBC miniseries DVD Six Wives of Henry VIII. I loved these six movies. They have done well, well written and historically accurate. In fact, I read Gregory's book and I liked it despite its huge historical inaccuracies (I'm talking about the fake homosexual angle with George Boleyn in particular), but this movie did not even mention it. This angle was one of the essential points of the book. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film just lets me ask "WHY?" Why do we see, as someone else puts it, "The Real World: Tudor England"? Why are camera angles so bad in general? <br /> <br /> Why is the script so bad? I mean, I know it was improvisation, but go! The actors at the time stuttered and stammered on their lines and it was obvious that they were makeup as and when. <br /> <br /> Why are sex scenes so clumsy? The way they were made in the book made them at least pretty interesting. In the movie, they are just bad, almost hilarious. At one point, the actress playing Mary Boleyn was sleeping with the actor playing Henry VIII. He is moving away and she has that look on his face that says "Hm ... I have to go to the store, has he finished already, maybe if he's done, I'll be able to go look for cheese very quickly ... "just bad. <br /> <br /> Why does Catherine of Aragon play such a small role in this film? His refusal to divorce was one of the main causes of the scandal that shook Christ. She is the reason why Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn could not get married immediately. Why is she not here? Overall, this movie is just bad.
