Roeg's position on Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" was not quite up to my expectations. Although based on one of the most studied and interesting texts in history, the film has become rather boring. The story never manages to capture the viewer. It just seems indifferent. <br /> <br /> The traces of the text are easy to spot, but it's not really Conrad's "Heart of Darkness". The script of Benedict Fitzgerald (who also wrote "The Passion of Christ") simply uses Conrad as a source of inspiration and thus becomes "The Heart of Darkness". The film is not worth it unless you are particularly interested in Conrad or perhaps John Malkovich.
