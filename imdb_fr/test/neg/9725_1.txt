Since the beginning of this film, titled "The Lost Boys", a heartbreaking opening sequence, loose wire and, worse yet, the end of the dialogues, this film has accelerated to the pace of a snail. "The Covenant" was highly recommended by some of my colleagues, who, I am quite convinced, were making fun of me. At least I hope that was the intention and their taste is not so bad! This movie was not much longer than an hour and a half, but felt much longer than that. The story was so basic that it could have been summed up in 15 minutes maximum. They could have at least completed the rest of the movie with funny fight or magic scenes, but someone decided (maybe the director, but I do not know if anyone really "made" this movie) that it was going to be filled with poorly executed "artistic" shots and absurd scenes of "boys" swimming and fighting in bars. About halfway through this movie, I thought bumping my head against a wall would be more fun, and partly to get rid of that horrible dirty feeling I had to keep looking at it. . So I banged my head against a wall and enjoyed it more than the movie! I watched it until the end, hoping it would end up giving me more pleasure. No, my efforts have been rewarded with "And if I make you my Whee-aytch!" I threw up, then I just felt embarrassed for the screenwriter and pity for the poor actor who was to deliver this drivel. The acting was really not as bad as other critics seemed to think, but even the most talented thespian could not save that job, and the work got on my nerves! I give movies a chance, even bad ones, because they usually offer some form of fun, and it was actually not the worst movie I have ever seen. After it was over, I wanted to watch the movie "Stealth" again and WOW it was so much better this time! Oh yeah. Specific case, do not bother with this movie, really. Watch some episodes of "Charmed" and "The Lost Boys" after drinking a lot, and you will become much better. If you fall into the same trap as me and watch "The Covenant", be sure to keep all sharp objects away from yourself, thank you.
