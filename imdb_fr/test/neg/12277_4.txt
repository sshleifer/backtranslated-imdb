A CBS radio program called "We the People" is helping to find an American home for the Vienna refugee Charles Coburn (under the name of Karl Braun), a qualified surgeon and pool specialist. He arrives with his beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (as Leni), who "studies" to become a nurse. Relocated in a small, dusty Midwestern village, they are greeted at the station by the beefy John Wayne (aka John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (under the nickname "Nunk" Atterbury), veterinarian. Mrs. Gurie is unhappy in the dustbin and wants to leave. At once. But the prospect of a love affair with Mr. Wayne could change his mind ... <br /> <br /> God answers the many prayers of the citizens for the rain, but that may not be enough to save the peasant town. It is advisable to the whole city to settle in Oregon. Wayne wants to stay and persevere. Coburn receives an invitation to work in a high-level clinic. And, Gurie learns that her fiance, presumed dead, will arrive to claim her as a wife. She feels obliged to accept. but, he has a dark secret ... This film does not flatter Wayne, who seems to be out of his element. Being paired with Gurie, promoted like another Garbo, does not help. Wayne's car has a nice scene ("Jalopy, an Italian car"). <br /> <br /> **** Three Faces West (7/3/40) Bernard Vorhaus ~ John Wayne, Sigrid Gurie, Charles Coburn, Spencer Charters
