THE MANADED MANTIS will certainly not scare anyone, but as sci-fi programmers say, it's better than most others. A volcanic eruption at the South Pole releases a giant prehistoric mantis feeding at the North Pole. The military disappear. Dr. Ned (William Hopper - the son of Hedda Hopper and better known as Paul Drake on TV PERRY MASON) is called to the diary. the creature - but at that moment, the creature has devoured several Eskimos and is en route to the Washington Monument. <br /> <br /> About a third or more of the film consists of archival footage: old government educational films, soldiers in radar rooms, airplanes - and would you believe that the Eskimos are leaving? at sea? Which explains, of course, why an Eskimo tribe is attacked in the film. ("Hey, guys, do you think we can do that?") Add some trivial special effects, clumsy dialogues and sexist attitudes, and you're ready to go. Not as original as THE MONSTER WHICH CHALLENGED THE WORLD, but fans of the "big bug" schlock of the 1950s will enjoy it - and kids will have fun throwing popcorn on the screen. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Review
