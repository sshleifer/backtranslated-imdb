You can usually ask two questions about the low-budget horror movies of the '80s and this' Demon Wind' in particular. 1. Is it a good movie? No .. 2. Is this a fun movie ?? You bet! Wind Demon is a horribly dirty and nauseating tale, filled with cheese makeup effects and unpleasant violence. The story is almost non-existent and involves a group of young people revealing the terrible secrets of one of their ancestors. Apparently, her grandparents lived in a neighborhood worshiping the devil, and the evil (in the form of demons and fog) still remains in the vicinity. But, I have to give it to this movie. From beginning to end, it breathes morbidity! Diabolical nuances, mischievous gore and (relatively) decent play make this movie a film far above the sloppers of the 80s, uninspired. This shows a little creativity and courage (literally) where other productions of this decade fall more easily into routine and forgetfulness. These creators were clearly inspired by the success of "The Evil Dead", and maybe even "Demons" by Lamberto Bava, but damn it! It's fun and done with a lot of enthusiasm. Although this film has a high enough level at a time. Especially towards the end, when flashbacks and laser shows are blended with happiness. And what is the story of these two budding magicians? Nevertheless, `Demon Wind 'receives my recommendation if your tastes are not too high with regard to the horror of shit!
