go get your camcorder, your little brother and the disturbing neighbor who throws boiling water on raccoons; and you have a movie! Well, that's what these guys thought anyway. It was so bad that I can not even remember the majority, with the exception of flashbacks comparable to those of someone who shot in 'Nam. Despite the really cheesy title, the horrible quality, the terrible actors and the cliche writing, I think this movie is not the worst I've ever seen. I keep this slot for everything with Steven Seagal, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude van Dam. Anyway, if you run out of options to find new "horror" movies that you have not seen 1000 times before (as I was) and you're struggling with that- here I would ignore it again. he had absolutely no redemptive quality. This fake serial killer thriller was a weak and puny attempt at an even B movie. if they are really lucky, the Wal-Mart could earn $ 4.50. but I doubt it strongly.
