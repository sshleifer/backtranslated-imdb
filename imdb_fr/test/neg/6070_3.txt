Trite and without originality. It's as if someone were watching Immortal Beloved and Amadeus and decided to mix them up and steal other elements from the stereotypical plot of other movies to make another one. As with most historical movies nowadays, there are some inaccuracies because the story is manipulated to fit the story, which is understandable for most. For example, in the last days of Beethoven's life it was necessary for others to write what they had to say so that he could understand them. Of course, it would have been an embarrassment to show on the screen. The script, although containing a few lines that can be quoted, does not really make the feeling of this period and, associated with some bad actors, seems rather contemporary. Diane Kruger is kind enough to watch but she still has a lot to improve in her art. Ed Harris does not work for me like Beethoven and I blame Gary Oldman especially for that. Overall, this is not a very good interpretation of the musical maestro's life. Better just get a copy of Immortal Beloved. <br /> <br /> http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
