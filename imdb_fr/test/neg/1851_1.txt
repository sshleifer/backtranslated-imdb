If you plan to go see this movie, my advice is: no. <br /> <br /> For me, the film failed to get the grade at all levels and reminded how much most English (and Irish) are terrible. the movies are. Unforgettable tripe is the best I can say. If it had been on TV, I should have done something more interesting five minutes after the start. I saw this film with a group of friends and, after reading the press reviews, I prepared myself not to be critical and, hopefully, to spend 90 minutes fun. But, oh my dear ..... <br /> <br /> As a comedy, it was not funny, as a thriller, this stupid story was sloppy and lazy. Like a totally incredible love story. Especially as a piece of "gloriously above fantasy" it lacked both style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they had to do to earn a living by playing ..... Gambon and Caine. Is it just me, but aside from playing Eastern gangsters and Jack The Gars, does Michael Caine leave you cold? <br /> <br /> In all fairness, some of my friends thought it was "ok", but if you go, my advice is to drink a few drinks in advance and leave your critical faculties under key at home. <br /> <br />
