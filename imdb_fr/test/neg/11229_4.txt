If you are in the mood to laugh at a very bad movie (only the worst that can be Ken Russell), you must try this one. It manages to make you feel as though you've just landed in a porn box .25, and you can almost feel the urine on the floor. Kathleen Turner struts into a blonde wig pretending to be a hooker (she really does a good job in the garment industry and has been so hurt by men that it's the only way Tony Perkins play a hysterical "priest" who may be trying to kill him (again a film that ends with Tony Perkins) Annie Potts introduces herself and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit, reason enough to hate this movie The pervert will love the sex scenes, so rent the UNrated version in the RED box so you can see Turner give a cop a taste of his billy club (I had to pause the VCR until 'we can not laugh anymore).
