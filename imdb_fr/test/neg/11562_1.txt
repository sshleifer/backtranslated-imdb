Mystery Science Theater 3000 could not bring any redeeming quality to a projection of this "jewel". <br /> <br /> This is like a copy of 80s pornographic cheese that you could have bought in VHS on a 42nd-ranked arcade. before Disney bought the whole smash and closed them all. <br /> <br /> But wait, all the sex scenes have been cut. I challenge anyone to find a worse movie. This film could replace waterboarding as a humane interrogation method. <br /> <br /> No, I withdraw that - I would prefer waterboarding. <br /> <br /> The only credit that this film could win, apart from the worst film of all time, would be to threaten the Middle East to solve its problems under penalty of watching this film.
