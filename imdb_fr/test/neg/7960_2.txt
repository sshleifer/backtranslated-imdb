Water shows the fate of Indian widows in the late 1930s, says in the end that the problem still exists largely by giving statistics, refers to Gandhi repeatedly in the film before finally having a scene the representative and does not do anything more innovative or new in the film. Yes, cinematography is pretty impressive but it can not be the soul of a movie for me. <br /> <br /> India has had many problems, like many other nations, but it has gotten rid of many of these problems in general. And if a movie about racism was shot in the United States in a given year that ended with "x number of Americans still victims of racism today." <br /> <br /> a) How would that be relevant and b) How would it be so amazing to be featured in the cinema? <br /> <br /> A view I read of a Deepa Mehta interview was that this movie is portrayed as a voice for the marginalized everywhere. From the reviews I've read everywhere, the story I hear is how the director did a great job and was brave in bringing a problem to the world. The film deals with more than one specific problem that a society faces (and got rid of through reforms as a whole). <br /> <br /> I do not see anything shocking about the movie. Moreover, the film lacked soul and was between the intrigues of Chuiyya and Kalyani. Sarala, the young Sri Lankan actress, has beautifully described the role of Chuiyya and this is the only thing that impressed me about the film, unfortunately.
