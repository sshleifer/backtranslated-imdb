A good example of reverse and politically correct racism, where white men are presented as foolish brutes who are only there to be slaughtered and their native opponents as noble heroes, superior in appearance and ability. In addition to making the information too boring, it also prevents the neutral viewer from identifying with either side - it's too simplistic. The repetitive score is incredibly boring (just like the voiceover), the characters lack depth and the viewer is quickly lost between questions such as "who is this character" and "what is it supposed to mean ". The photography is wonderful, however, and overall, there is a lot of atmosphere, but beautiful shots of foggy landscapes do not save this movie. The DVD box uses Kiefer Sutherland as an eye-catcher. In fact, his character could have been played by anyone else because it's actually just an empty shell (like most non-Maori characters) and still disappears half of the movie. But if you want to see Jack Bauer in a kilt, this is your kind of movie ...
