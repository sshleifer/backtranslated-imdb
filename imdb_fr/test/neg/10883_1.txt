Seriously, I was going to write the Razzie Council and recommend this movie under the title of Razzie Champ for 2007 ... until I'm on IMDb.com and realize that the copyright date is 2006 and not 2007. Seriously, this movie could easily have been a Razzie Champ. This film is bad! I do not know how this part of shit was forgotten, even for a Razzie nomination in 2006, as she could easily compete with Basically, It Stinks, Too also for the 2006 Razzie Championship. <br /> > I rented this film on the recommendation of one of my neighbors who said to me: "Oh my God, after seeing this film, it will take a long time before I ever stop at rest! " I could not believe how scary or terrible this movie was! Spoilers possible below, not that you will miss something. <br /> <br /> OK, first of all ... the problem ... the rest stops. Obviously, the director of this shit does not know the first thing about women. The toilets at this rest area were at the same level as the Trainspotting film. I do not pretend to know everything there is to know about women, but what I do know is that women, for the most part, are maniacs of total and complete hygiene. Given the choice between taking a shit in one of these toilets and possibly catching something or squatting in the woods, a woman will opt to squat in the woods. I know, because I've already been camping with them, and they have no problem crouching in the woods. So right there ... a major plot and a lie. <br /> <br /> Second ... she comes out of the halt, and her boyfriend who was driving the car is nowhere to be found, neither him nor his car. He just left. She begins to shout his name, wondering where he is. Ummm ... hello? You're standing in the wet mud ... Have you ever thought about looking for tire marks? I mean, her car is gone ... she did not get up and did not fly. And actually, it makes me think ... I was really looking at his feet and there were no footprints in the mud. How ... exactly ... did this happen? <br /> <br /> Thirdly ... the moving mobile home family with the monstrous dwarf in the back taking Polaroid pictures ... Wtf!?!?!? ? They made absolutely no sense, and it's as if the director had just added them to make them weird. They made no sense and did not even have their place in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fourth ... Oh my God, that ... well, I mean ... towards the end of the film. ..she finally sees the escape hatch to the ceiling inside the rest stop. I'm like: "You ... idiot ... bi ** h, you've been locked up in this rest area all this time ... and you come ... now ... see ... the hatch evacuation on the ceiling? "I mean ... it's like they threw it just because the killer threw gasoline on the floor through the window and was about to light a matches. So, she needs to go higher to avoid being burned, and ... oh, look! A perfect reason for her to go to the heights! An escape hatch to the ceiling! It's like ... Why did not she experience this before? Most people in this situation would have seen this from the moment they were locked up in this rest stop and were able to get out of the Dodge f ** k. When they showed this exit at the end of the movie, I thought, "You're kidding me." <br /> <br /> Fifth ... what was the problem with all the people she met continue to disappear? The girl in the broom closet in the rest stops? The idiot cop? She at the end of the movie when she found herself in the broom closet? This has never been explained. Personally, when they did that, I thought, "Oh, Christ on a cracker, it's her, she's the one who kills, it's wonderful, she killed all those people, she does not remember to have done, and the writers of this film I snatched a French horror film that I can not mention on IMDb.com or I will be on the blacklist for revealing the end (this film is zero, besides, people). "But it was not. She was not the murderer, and the contract with the missing dead was never explained. Oh, for God's sake, stay away from this movie! This film sucked the balls, and now I have a serious bone to take with my neighbor. It is on the support 2 for $ 1 at Family Video, do not rent it even if someone gives it to you for free!
