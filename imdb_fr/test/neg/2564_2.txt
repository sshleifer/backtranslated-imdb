Okay, other people commented that it was not an action movie, so I do not need to repeat (although I just did). In fact, it's nice to see an actor try something different. But unfortunately, this is not one of those opportunities. <br /> <br /> The story is non-existent. This film lacks almost as much history as "Showgirls". Of course, they throw an environmentalist couple, no, not even environmentalist, anything else, treats here and there to please Seagal (which is what he likes). It does not make a story, not even close. Now, the end ... Even those of us who really liked this film ... the end, it must be admitted, it was a little too much or a lot stupid. <br /> <br /> understand that it was a movie directly on video (at least in the states), but it's even too good for this one. This trash should have been wired only, on TBS or Starz (late at night).
