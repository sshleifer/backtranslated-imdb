I watched this film at the Edinbourgh Theater with 3 other Americans and our friend from Manchester and we all thought it was a waste of time. We would have much preferred to spend an extra hour watching the vague dialogue of Star Wars III that was taking place in the hallway rather than all that. <br /> <br /> Opening out on one of the worst jokes I've ever dealt with celluloid, he did not take off bluntly. Throughout the film, we felt that the jokes were too heavy. The writers thought so much about the staging that you could see the joke arrive 2 minutes in advance, and when he arrived he was so dull that you could not even smile; I quote the example of the giraffe cum-ming. <br /> <br /> The plot itself raises interesting thoughts in my mind, which amuse me much more than what was happening on screen. I think a lot more could have been done with this angle (the two different worlds, the characters' experience out of the water, the confusion and the surprise as people try to understand and distinguish the characters and writers the but too much time is lost in pushing this painful plot to the end with as much "weird" and "blunder" as it is humanly possible. <br /> <br /> And to say that the characters of the 16th century show all the extra talent of the writers is an insult to the writers and editors who might have made this film a worthy after 40 minutes of reflection; but no, it's a torture movie on the whole length and on the non-bet. <br /> <br /> As we were leaving the theater, laughing VERY little, I heard the young British electro couple face the hip behind me saying, "It was pretty good that's not it. never really knew what would come next. "And the girl who answers" Yeah, pretty surprising. " and that was all. If that's supposed to stop the British from watching a comedy: do not laugh for 90 minutes, but put a piece of communication at the end between two lovers at the end, then the movie was successful. But I believe in British life more than that. <br /> <br /> I did not laugh so much at a comedy movie since American Pie II.
