A university professor is working on creating zombies and, you do not know, things are going terribly wrong. The next thing you know, the entire campus is overgrown. Thank God, there are two super commandos trained for such a situation. Too bad they have to be accompanied by a group of moronic commandos, led by a rapper (he does not even bother to try to play the role of a soldier, he only responds to his superiors as he was a hooded rapper). The highlight of this part of the film is the changing room scene. The moronic commandos, men and women, share the same locker room and, apparently, the military regulations require all women to wear black bra and panties. Hey, if you can not make a good movie, you can at least have women in underwear. I would like to thank the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Thus, after much discussion about the readiness of these moronic commandos for work (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), they were all killed fairly quickly. . Their biggest drawback seems to be that they never came to light the lights. A typical meeting brings them into a room and see someone at the other end. Human or zombie? I can not tell. Turn on the lights? No, the moron-commando protocol requires them to walk to the person making sure to hold their weapon so that it can be easily removed from the hand and, well, you know the exercise. The disappearance of Sergeant Major Sticky Fingaz is particularly amusing - my favorite scene involving a rapper in any movie I have ever seen. Fortunately (and again, Filmmaker's hat), the sexiest girl among the moron commandos manages to survive. She and the female super-commando are both wearing tight t-shirts for the rest of the film. This is how a military operation should be carried out! There are a lot of things that punctuate my humor, like the uber-commandos, who are unable to pass through a simple network of fans (it's obviously a thin piece of aluminum that you could easily punch). This requires a plan to rub the guts of zombies, and even if we do not see anything in the movie that indicates that zombies locate their prey based on their scent, they are kind enough to immediately start sniffing the guts of zombies and to let go of our heroes. . <br /> <br /> Some other fun things - the Paris Hilton gag, "Can you hear me now?" gag and the fact that, although zombies immediately bite the secondary characters, the main characters are able to make their way through dozens of them without being bitten. Mr. Fingaz gives another little laugh that can not pronounce the word "tourniquet". <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a little fun. I could have used more interesting characters, but for an original Sci-Fi Channel, I was slightly impressed.
