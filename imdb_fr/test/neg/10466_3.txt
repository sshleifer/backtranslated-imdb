Another Indian legend you have never heard of is dropped. As the name suggests, it is an avenging wraith who likes to absorb the skeletons of people while they still use them. As usual, old burial sites (can you say "Poltergeist?") Have been disturbed by greedy and clich√© land developer construction projects. <br /> <br /> The CGI, if it had been better, could have accentuated this effect. treacherous, but they skimped on the budget, and it shows - to a comic effect. The unleashed creature probably should have stayed out of the scene during its first killings - it might have added a mystery or an atmosphere of impending doom - but the inept director decided to show us what it looks like, and this was not impressive. The dead are simply badly done, again with a bad image of synthesis. I guess ancient spirits always kill using cheap special effects. As for the "victims", they seem to laugh all the time while they scream. It is always clear who will get it: a character with only a few lines appears, strange noises are heard, CGI points fly, an exit character. Repeat (several times). <br /> <br /> However, there are some hunting scenes featuring the monster that really made this thing visible. Unfortunately, the director seems to use them as a means of recovering (so it is too often) when he can not think of anything else to do for his characters. Overall, it's pretty silly, but I've seen worse. This film is not expensive, but it is curiously fun to watch.
