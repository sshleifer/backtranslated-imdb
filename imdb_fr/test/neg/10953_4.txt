Downstairs at the movie gallery, I saw a movie that I had to see. It looked like a fun horror / action / western movie I could enter. Yes, I knew it would be bad, but I praised it anyway hoping to laugh. There were only a few laughs left. It was an extremely stupid film. It starts with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is perhaps the weakest main character in the film's history. He seems / could act against Chuck Norris, but he can not. His dialogue is zero too. Anyway, he goes to a village, shoot zombies. You could say they tried to extend that by putting in those boring scenes where it takes 3-5 minutes to reload or watch zombies. At least, zombies look cool. Anyway, some people get shot, zombies die and in the end, everyone died except our main character, who should have died at first when he was shot by four people.
