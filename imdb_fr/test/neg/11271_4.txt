The director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known, at least in his homeland, for his Japanese gangster films, a series with which this film shares a number of features. Violence and political intrigue are recurring themes in Shogun's samurai and in Battles Without Honor and Humanity. They both include a main character who finds his loyalty challenged by betrayals. Both films also have a large number of characters who seem to have no other purpose than to die, and as we do so little to develop them, their death has little impact when they occur. This film also has other flaws. The make-up, costumes and sound design are mediocre, and the battle scenes were also of inferior quality, inferior to other samurai films of previous years (seven samurai come to mind). <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba plays Sonny Chiba's character in Shogun's Samurai, the sword-mongering master who scours the film, scowling. Which guy; he can even wear an eye patch. If you expected to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you might be disappointed; his appearance is just a bit of a cameo, and when it appears that his character might do something interesting, he disappears definitively. <br /> <br /> Overall, the highlights of the film are its story, which is infinitely more understandable than these gangster films, and the challenges posed to the traditional concepts of good and evil. Two brothers are fighting over the throne of their recently departed father, who may have had some help to get by. From the beginning, it seems that we will be confronted with two characters who could not be more clearly good and perverse; after all, the older brother stammers and has a birthmark, the sure sign of a villain. Ultimately, however, it becomes clear that in a win-win-all-power struggle, there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.
