I usually like these movies. Give me a good old B movie every day, but this one was just awful. The acting game (?) Has been terrible almost to the point of completely closing the film. I thought I had seen the worst of all time but this one is up to par with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! Honestly, it's the acting game that made this movie for me. <br /> <br /> I found the actor awkward and the first role male / female extremely dull. This film had absolutely nothing. I may be asking a ridiculous question, but why nudity and the sex scene? Did the producers think that no one would look at them if they left them out? I think they were probably right! Oh, where are Price and The Tingler when you need them?
