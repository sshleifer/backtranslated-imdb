I must say that I was surprised to find several positive comments about this turkey (which desperately needs a feather transplant)! I give it a 1 because I think the idea of ​​making a movie about the wild man of rock'n'roll - Jerry Lee Lewis, is honorable, but it's a shame to put such garbage and the " killer "does not deserve that! It's a good thing that he arrived late in his career ... they said that Elvis had practically ruined his career with the movies he had released in the sixties and that it could have been the same for Jerry Lee, if it had been released 15 or 20 years ago! It's based on the book by Myra Gail Lewis and it's a shame to start. It's a bad and inaccurate story of his life with Lewis and there are much better books on the killer that could have made a much better and more interesting story. Add to that a group of actors who do not know if they participate in a drama, a comedy or a bit of both! The very good actor Dennis Quaid plays what must be one of the worst performances of an actor since a long time! He walks around the picture, talks about his "divine talent" and, as a spectator, you would also like to show some on the screen! Stupid gestures and funny faces and Jerry Lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what he had become in this really awful movie! The rest of the crew is almost as bad ... except for Winona Ryder, who does her best with the shit lines she is given. It's "Grease" again and every time Jerry Lee goes around Memphis in his convertible, the radio on in the car, the whole city dances to the sound of music! Everyone in this movie is like the cartoon characters of the people actually involved ... from the wild man himself to Sun Records Sam Philips! And it's a shame! A charismatic and interesting artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better and I hope he took the $ 500,000 he received from the deal and told the company to fuck himself ... twice!
