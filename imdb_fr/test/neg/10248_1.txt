For the connoisseurs of bad films, Galaxina is a true jewel. With a truly awesome dialogue, acting and director, it's not a choice for anyone looking for a good movie. But being one of the hilarious movies of its kind, it's cheap for a good laugh. In particular, scenes featuring the worship cult of the Harley Davidson motorcycle are particularly interesting and many other scenes provide an opportunity to have fun at a low price. as she plays an android, I guess we can excuse her for the wooden game. <br /> <br /> Bad moviegoers, do not miss this one!
