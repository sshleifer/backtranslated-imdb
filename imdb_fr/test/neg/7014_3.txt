Some good decorations. The good songs, although like the other guy said, they are not interpreted with a lot of energy. Bea Arthur, trying to do something with this material, occasionally had a good double in the role of Vera, Mame's friend, and helped advance the song "Bosom Buddies". Other than that, there is nothing here that is worth your time. A slow pace, an incredibly bad cinematography, a not very good song (except Robert Preston), a dreadful scenario, a bad acting (except Be) and a horrible leading actress. Who thought Lucille Ball would do well like Mame, an elegant and affectionate woman? The players of Warner Bros. were undoubtedly crazy when they decided not to use Angela Lansbury, who had done so well on Broadway, but rather with Ball, who was not as funny as she was 20 years ago. , could not play the role "in a good way" at all, and used a painful croaking as an excuse to sing. Even though (maybe because) making the movie was difficult for her and even if she financed it, she just was not Mame. Auntie Mame is such a much better movie and the soundtrack of the Broadway musical with Lansbury sounds good. For the most part, nothing here is great, attractive or interesting. Forget it, unless you're a big fan of Lucy who thinks she can not hurt anything. Hopefully after seeing this, you will realize that she was only a human.
