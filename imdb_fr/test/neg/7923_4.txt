Movies like these do not need sequels. One of the benefits of Don Bluth when he moves away from Disney is that he does not have to endure their endless tirade of sequels collected directly in video format and poorly animated. But apparently, it was the brilliant idea to make a sequel to "All Dogs Go to Heaven", so we understood it. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and he's not really that good. Most of the film is a poor excuse for a sequel, and it's not as dark, different, and as fun as the original. <br /> <br /> I am sorry for future generations who will have to suffer endlessly. suites like this without ever knowing what it was like to live in a time when Hollywood did not fully rely on hit movies as a crutch to unleash a banal crap. <br /> <br /> Please, finish the aftermath of the children's movies not need them.
