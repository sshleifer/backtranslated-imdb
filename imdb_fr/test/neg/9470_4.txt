Telly Savalas poses as the Mexican revolutionary (although compared to Chuck Connors as a military swift) in this pleasant but rather boring pastiche about the life and times of the famous historical figure. A first attempt, VILLA RIDES! (1968) with Yul Brynner in the role and co-star of Robert Mitchcum, treated these events more sober and on a larger scale. As such, PANCHO VILLA is a European company far too typical and not very distinguished despite its references; the end result is more often ridiculous than amusing - although a few moments, especially the action game scenes and a fight scene inside a church, offer a slight pleasure. Oh, and Savalas even sings the final titles!
