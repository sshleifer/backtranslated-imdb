In the twenty-second century, an architect named Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) commissioned a space station he personally designed. As can be expected, a special force is sent to take over the expensive station and detain the merchant. Upon arrival, they find him participating in a strange ritual with the use of a mysterious cubic. During the interrogation, he reveals that they must let him finish what he started, otherwise the hell he has released will bathe in the blood ... To convince the police who hold him prisoner, he remembers his legacy, the brand maker who built the box and why he is here in space ... <br /> <br /> The film is essentially the same for Hellraiser, as The Quickening was for Highlander. Something to be ignored and forgotten, so that it will not have much influence on Hellraiser's tradition. By far the most trash of the franchise, with a much worse feel than its predecessors (which, let's face it, were class B or C movies). <br /> <br /> It sometimes seems like the action is influenced by a mid-budget porn movie with incredible wood performance, which makes you think: So when will they get naked and start sex ? Surprisingly, not much sex in the film, although the introduction of the angelic seductress-demon (a totally superfluous character who unnecessarily disturbs what we know about the world of Hellraiser) offers many opportunities to make love. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film consists of three short stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) that are abruptly glued, lack concentration and rush to the amateur fashion. The end result is extremely mediocre, which is mainly underlined by the fact that you are not interested in what happens to the characters of the film. <br /> <br /> A decent movie in the movie, but other than that a total failure. .
