"A New Generation" is Amityville's third entry to base his plot on writer John G. Jones' postulate that an article from the Long Island home will cause ghostly misery and death to his new owners. First a lamp, then a clock and now a mirror. However, it is also the first Amityville since "The Possession" to relate directly to the actual events that triggered the entire series. This time, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, one day receives a macabre mirror by a homeless man. Soon enough, the people around him begin to die, which eventually leads him to discover that the mirror has already been suspended in the house of Amityville. That same evening, a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in Amityville II) murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror is not a mere coincidence and he quickly discovers the truth about his past, a truth he keeps buried since childhood. <br /> <br /> This seventh opus of the often-exhausted franchise is something of a disappointment to me. Things started to get better with the silly and entertaining movie "It's About Time". Given how much this movie tries to tap into its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. <br /> <br /> However, three trips to the same well with another devilish artifact from the Amityville House and an additional explanation of the malignant paranormal visits carry me, to say the least. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the unwavering determination of each producer group to completely ignore all other episodes of the series. On the one hand, it's quite reasonable that they do not want to be tied to someone else's continuity, but at least they might be able to recognize stories that have already been completed and possibly not repeat them. again and again *. <br /> <br /> The way the story unfolds also reveals something lamentable, probably because of the inevitability of this rehearsal festival. Since you already know what's going to happen, careful implementation is simply slow and tedious. Or maybe it's just boring anyway. The director John Murlowski probably could have done more to intensify the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror instead of just blinking it red and emitting "perverse" voices that lack subtlety. There were times when the characters seemed rather insensitive to their supernatural qualities. If they do not take it too seriously, why should we do it? <br /> <br /> Which is a shame, because "A new generation" has a cast more than capable. I was going to wait until I saw the name "Julia Nickson" in the credits. She captivated my attention as she always does, and if I was bored, her role was not larger. Terry O'Quinn was just as charismatic and still underused. Partridge himself in the leading role clearly corresponds to the type of square jaw hero covering a lumberjack shirt from the early 90s. Although I'm not sure he really gave him the sense of gravity required, it's not like someone here is performing Ibsen. <BR /> <br /> The sets are also noteworthy, with dramatic works filling Suki's room with claustrophobic corridors presented in flashback / supernatural sequences. Obtaining the appearance of these rights is particularly important given the way certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulate fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski is more of a visual director than an actor or horror director. Unfortunately, this is a horror movie after all. <br /> <br /> "A new generation" sees the same race played for the third time in 4 years. Add to that the lack of direction where it was really needed and all the efforts made fail. However, it is important to recognize its close links with the source material and that some good actors do not necessarily have the best hours. Honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who has not seen any of the suites of The Possession, for whom the story will not be such a huge trip.
