From Underworld's authors, we have by far the worst werewolf movie I've ever seen. It's basically a rebuilt version of Underworld, but it still lacks vampires (that's not a big deal), cool effects (a big deal) and, as a rule, pretty much anything that can be done correctly to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy (the biggest contract). of all!). Vivian, a 20-year-old chocolate maker with a lycanthrope, is currently living in Romania since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her many years ago for being a werewolf. There, she belongs to a small society (or pack) of werewolves and is apparently chosen to reluctantly marry the leader of the pack, Gabriel, whose son - a toad with a British accent - is hunting outside the pack. Apparently, they have already been discovered in other countries and want to stay in Romania avoiding any negative attention. Such activity is therefore considered prohibited. Vivian ends up falling in love with an American artist who forgets her involvement in the group of bloodthirsty predators. When they discover the secret relationship, things go wrong when someone is killed and the human is forced to participate in a murderous tradition in which he is abandoned in the woods and hunted - thus giving the pack a chance to turn into their "wolfy". All of this consists of a big leap forward before they light up and land like a wolf. Very cheezy effects. The whole movie is like an underground world mastered with some romantic montages and very little action. Watching this in the theater, I could not wait for it to end. A terribly boring disappointment. To avoid!
