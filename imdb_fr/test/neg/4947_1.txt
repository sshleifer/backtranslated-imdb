It was intolerable. (SPOILER # 1) The protagonists avoid the needless disclosure of scary truths to their loved ones, for fear of making such status and assuming the role of Antagonists. (SPOILER # 2) The authors would have us believe that the revelation of multiple transgressions by the transgressor poses a threat to, and provokes a retaliatory response from the first victim of the transgressions. (SPOILER # 3) Before the last 15 minutes, I was expecting a score of 6 to 8 out of 10; instead, it was a bit like discovering that Lieutenant Columbo's dog is the real murderer. The story was just not believable, and I do not think the best director in the world could have recorded it without massive editing.
