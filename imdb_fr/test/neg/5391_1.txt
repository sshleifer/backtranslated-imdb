Like many other people here, I bought this movie in the store "Two for $ 11.00" from my local, cheap store. I love horror and sci-fi movies, and this one certainly falls into this category. Almost everything that everyone has said here is without result. Yes it was bad, but that was to be expected. The main problem I had with this film is that it was basically BORING. I mean serious yawn-r-rama. The acting was bad, the costumes (held by K Mart Skeletor around 1982) were worse, and the editing was awful. No continuity whatsoever. Mr. Skeletor finally died in an explosion, although he encountered several explosions throughout this move. I guess the last one just touched him. Apparently, previous encounters with this "military" group (cough) have had a negative impact on his horse ... it would go from red to black throughout this shit party. Even for a movie B, do yourself a favor and skip it. The only benefit he's using now is to add to my DVD collection. Let's hope nobody will recognize it when they look through my movie collection. Bravo, big time.
