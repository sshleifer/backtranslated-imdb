How does this film fear? As a fan of Michael Imperioli's work on The Sopranos, I discovered it at Blockbuster based on his name and a story that looked promising. It's still the case, but this film does not fill it. <br /> <br /> Every turn of history is quite predictable; I kept looking for the Lifetime bug in the lower right corner of the screen. Everything is there: the noble woman who comes out of misery, the guy who does not succeed in reaching his potential despite all his efforts, the kid stuck in the middle, etc., etc., etc. This is the identity of this mysterious stranger. really made me want to throw things on TV - I would have been more satisfied if Little Stuey woke up and realized that it was all a dream. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers may have had as well a "Morale of the story is ..." shortly before the credits, because, as another critic has pointed out, this thing really turns out as an extracurricular special. Do not play, do not drink, do not use drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your children ... go, how about a little shade? How about interesting bad guys? Writer / director AW Vidmer must be the subject of a special mention: not only the dialogue is open, but also the rhythm (in the dialogue and at the end of many scenes) makes this film at least 45 minutes longer than necessary (and believe me, it's like longer) The talents of Imperioli, Renee Faia and some actors (Steve Schirripa, natch) are the only elements that prevent him from falling into the category "1". All their good work is almost counterbalanced by the atrocious work of portraying the boy Stuey. I do not know if it was a casting error (hey - it's a mass movie, so let's get somebody from Blue's Clues who can not do anything more than do too much with a big fake smile. .. then throw the sullen and dark kid in the Disney movie) or just a horrible achievement but these scenes are really hard to watch. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in the vision of another filmmaker on this character and his story; It's a pity that Imperioli has already been used by this film. Horrible, frightful, awful.
