Enchanting April was one of Harry Beaumont's latest films - he only made a few of them after this one. He had directed the Maisie films in the 1930s and 1940s. In the opening credits, it is written "From Elizabeth's novel" and completely leaves the author's surname ... rather strange, but Since it was von Armin, they might not have wanted the German association at the time ... Sad to hear that it was a flop when it came out, with funny names like Frank Morgan (The Wizard) and Jessie Ralph, who played WC Fields' disapproved mother-in-law in "Bank Dick". Two girls in London (Ann Harding and Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to house two of their friends, but things are not going according to plan. Reginald Owen plays the husband with several personalities. Aside from some fun times, it moves quite slowly. Ralph is the only positive point here, as a captivating dominant type, and the picture is rather blurred and fuzzy for much of the film. The views of Italy are all obvious scenery. The only thing that saves is that the Turner Classic version only lasts 66 minutes. Too bad they did not give Frank Morgan a bigger role. This was redone in 1992 by the BBC as a British film.
