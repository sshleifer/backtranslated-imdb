Watching "Baghban" is the equivalent in the movie of trying to get out of a saltwater draft tank for almost three hours. This Indian film is a sweet, sentimental and sentimental soap opera that begins as "The King Lear", moves to "Romeo and Juliet" in the central part, then returns to "King Lear" for its final soaked with tears. <Raj Malhotra is a bank accountant who seems to have everything a man can want from life: a woman who loves him, a family who loves him and a job he is about to retire a faithful service life. Although Raj and his wife, Pooja, have been married for 40 years and have four adult sons, they still act as a couple of lovers struck by the newlyweds, cooing and sighing, beating their eyes and murmuring soft words in the ears. almost to the point of nausea. In fact, the bloody brood is so happy, so loving and so harmonious that it makes the Von Trapp look like a dysfunctional family. Parents and children joke, joke together, even perform choreographed "spontaneous" singing and dancing numbers (like many Bollywood productions, "Baghban" is a drama interspersed with many - in this case, many too many a number - of musical sequences). <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows everything about storytelling is aware that this pure bliss can not go unpunished for long, and that all this joy is just the prelude to a terrible disaster destined to come crush on the head of our partygoers without suspicion. Knowing this, we spend the first hour of the film in a scary wait, asking ourselves what form this disaster will take when it finally arrives. The thunderbolt occurs about an hour after the movie begins, when Raj announces to his children that he and his mother have decided to move in with one of their families, leaving the choice between the children and their respective spouses. Suddenly, as King Lear uncovers the vipers hidden in the family bosom, Raj discovers that his children are not so loving, altruistic and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he originally thought. It is understandable that the children, horrified at the thought of this eventuality, try to live with one of their children, while Pooja will live with another; Then, they will be extinguished until each of the children has finally been able to welcome both parents, then the cycle will be repeated to infinity. To the great sorrow of the children, the parents adhere to the plan, even if they are deeply in love with each other and have never spent time apart. Thus, the second and the greater part of the third hour are dedicated to the two aging (though married) lovers who are grieving, while their ungrateful and insensitive little children are doing everything in their power to make their parents understand how unwelcome they are in their lives. houses. <br /> <br /> One of the major problems of "Baghban" is that it lacks subtlety in storytelling and staging. The love that Ray and Pooja feel for each other, as well as the almost vertiginous proximity of the family unit, is so stifled during the first hour that the film collapses almost under the weight of sentimentality. . Then, almost without warning, the scenario starts a penny and converts children into egocentric cruel monsters, and parents into passive, mourning victims of this insensitivity. Raj and Pooja are a little too long in the tooth and too autonomous to be able to make the little dreamy, sulky and unrequited love, which is better suited to schoolchildren than the parents of four adult children. The purple prose style, in which each emotion is emphasized and highlighted, leads to intense overactivity and strong reliance on cheesy reactionary scenes and melodramatic music for punctuation. The music numbers at first provide some liberating joy, but they last so long and appear so often that they quickly lose their effectiveness and only serve to fill the material to unbearable proportions. At least an entire hour could be excised from this inflated production without visible damage - and quite a lot of good. There is really no reason for this film to need to hang out for three hours. The most glaring of all is the seemingly endless harangue to which we are subjected at the end, a speech in which Raj (who has managed to turn his experiences into an award-winning bestseller) explains to us all the truths of parent / child relationships. consecutive minutes at least. <br /> <br /> "Baghban" is a silly, old-fashioned saga, filled with more sugar and goo than a giant box of Queen chocolates. Sample at your own risk.
