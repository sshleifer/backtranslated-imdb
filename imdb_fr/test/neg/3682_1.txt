Moscow Zero stole my money and I want to get it back! It's a horror movie, no thriller, no suspense, a horror movie. Yes, this movie is a horror. Horribly bad. After many years in the shadow of IMDb, I'm in a hurry to create an account so that I can (as at least one other review here) can warn people NOT TO WATCH THIS FILM! THIS WILL FLY YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies so bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you're not wise enough to press the fast forward button. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'd like to hear the director's voice on an "enhanced" DVD (there's another horrible thought) to see what the heck they thought. The producers had to assume that there were enough suckers on the market for the name Val Kilmer to at least be able to make this film at least profitable in international distribution. <br /> <br /> I had the misfortune to choose this film to watch on films on demand, which did not provide any subtitles to the Russian dialogue. Not that it mattered a lot. When trying to hear Russian, translate it into your head (if you can) to find out how dull it is and only add an insult to injury. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a "1" because I can not give it a lower score, and because it has achieved a remarkable thing. It sort of made an almost entirely underground movie NOT to feel claustrophobic. Now, it's a dubious exploit. <br /> <br /> HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the end, holy mother (no pun intended), it's like they're out of money and just decided to stop filming. The "climax" of the film literally occurs a few seconds before the end and is resolved by the simplest escape I have ever seen in a movie. Also exercise your simple escape mechanism if you find yourself looking at this - the button off.
