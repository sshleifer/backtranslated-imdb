This film is about a woman in mourning who lost her husband by suicide. She is tormented by her son who then refused to speak. <br /> <br /> As children's grief is rarely explored in a movie, it's refreshing to see a movie like Addison's Wall. However, because of the very nature of the film, there is no tension or drama. Apart from a few key emotional moments, everything in the movie is very simple. The abrupt end that solves no mystery certainly does not help the film to be more watchable. Addison's wall could have been much better, like exploring the contents of the wall, a more intensive care program to help Addison overcome her trauma. Instead, the movie looks very unfinished and uninviting.
