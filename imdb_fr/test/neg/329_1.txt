I have always loved horror movies. From some usual known as "The Exorcist" to others more underrated like "Black Christmas" or "Just Before Dawn". But who do people laugh at, even calling this basket a movie-b. He is right down the grade Z-grade. The acting game is the worst of all time. Really, I saw better an episode of "Young and the Restless" ... SPOILER ... Look for when the woman will come to talk to them about the legend of Jack-o. She breaks for a few seconds, as if someone is showing her cards and struggling to read her lines. RIOT! <br /> <br /> Oh, and aside from the bad behavior, absolutely no gore or F / X. And Jack-o looked like a plastic pumpkin. Watch Linnea Quigley in "The Night of the Demons" or "The Silent Night, The Deadly Night", much higher films.
