Jeff Fahey has such keen eyes and a sneaky and insidious smile that all the characters he interprets seem naughty; therefore, it does not really present him as the good guy in the room, the audience just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people. Drew Barrymore, fresh out of his acclaimed role in "Poison Ivy," had to make this film simply as a favor from director Phedon Papamichael (he was the director of the photo on "Ivy"); playing a character named Daisy Drew (!), she immediately fell, which leaves us to watch only Jeff Fahey and Sean Young (who has not had a subtle moment in front of the camera since "Blade Runner"). This unintelligent scenario, by Michael Angeli, is about a police detective drawing the face of his own wife from the testimony of a murder witness. Although this is not a bad idea for a plot, it would be much better for a one hour TV show. This movie made by cable lacks inspiration (starting with the casting) and surprises. * from ****
