During a period of eight years in the 1980s, when Charles Bronson shot nine films, another was released by a company other than the Cannon group: "The Evil That Men Do", a van TriStar Films ITC Entertainment company of Sir Lew Grade. Bronson was already at the heart of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, who went through many actors until "Kinjite: Prohibited Subjects" in 1989. <br /> <br /> Expectations should be very big with Bronson and Thompson working for a better funded organization like ITC, but "The Evil That Man Do" is a big disappointment in many ways. Although still a low-budget 80's film, B 'movie', Evil has an interesting potential for a great movie. All members of the production department, however, found an easy way out and sold spare parts that did not deserve Bronson's print. 'The Evil That Men Do' had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of Bronson and Thompson's best films, but would still be among the most average. <br /> <br /> This 1984 thriller / political actor begins brutally with Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher), a British doctor, who organizes his special training course for political leaders in Suriname. Molloch, passive and gray-haired, is an expert in torture methods employed by many political regimes. In the first seven minutes, we see Molloch use an electric current to inflict unbearable pain on Jorge Hidalgo (Jorge Humberto Robles), a dissident journalist. As you can imagine, the scene is horrible to watch and has been separated from the original version of VHS. <br /> <br /> Hidalgo was no other than a friend of Holland (Bronson), a retired assassin who takes full advantage of the Cayman Islands. The journalist had approached Holland a few years earlier to rid humanity of Molloch, but she had refused the offer. A Mexican professor by the name of Hector Lomelin (José Ferrer) goes shortly after the death of Hidalgo to convince the Netherlands to complete their work, bringing video tapes of the testimonies of the victims of the Doctor. At first, Holland accepted the dirty job, targeting Molloch and his sister Claire (Antoinette Bower) in Guatemala. <br /> <br /> Holland enters the city of Guatemala with the help of a councilor, Max Ortiz (René Enríquez); he poses as a tourist with the widow of Hidalgo, Rhiana (Theresa Saldana), and her young daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas). As with much of Bronson's later production, his character hits Molloch's henchmen one by one, crossing a shady American diplomat (John Glover) and his hit-man (Roger Cudney) along the way. A brutal end takes place in the crevices of an opal mine, where The Doctor only gets the deserts of several of his victims. <br /> <br /> "The evil that men do" is based on a forgotten novel by R. Lance Hill and jumps to American political negotiations in Latin America in the 1980s. Indeed, the evil is hard in all the senses of the word, because it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to camouflage enormous weaknesses in the development of the plot and the character. There are three or four disadvantages for each film, resulting from craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> Although "The Evil That Men Do" has a great concept, the film is never more than an excuse for Bronson to eliminate foreign-based scum. In the style of bad fiction, 'Evil' is filled with cardboard characters that we can never know or understand. Holland, although Bronson plays hard, never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him to become a hired killer. Rhiana, a terribly weak member of Theresa Saldana, has been disgusted by Holland for a good part of the time but later feels an affection for him. Where does his love come from, especially after seeing Holland kill several people and want to go home a few scenes before? <br /> <br /> The most interesting characters are actually Molloch and his sister Claire, because many questions can be asked of them. Naturally, we never find out what has brought them so close, how and where they started their torture, what is Claire's exact role in their business? These intrigues can last forever, especially with the scenario to be painted by numbers seems to invent things as and when. Why is Hidalgo's daughter in such a dangerous situation, apart from being easily taken hostage by Molloch? If Molloch's bodyguard, Randolph (Raymond St. Jacques) clearly saw Holland and Rhiana in the cockfighting arena, why is he so friendly with them in a bar after? Is his memory so short? And what was the purpose, if not the cheap theatrics, that the Netherlands throws Molloch's driver, Cillero (Jorge Luke), out the window, while the murder could have been treated more discreetly in the past? Claire's apartment? <br /> <br /> is decent and one way or another, Bronson gives one of his best performances. The management of J. Lee Thompson is lacking in points, but may have been compromised by limited time on the site. In addition to filming Evil in Mexico, ITC's presence is evident thanks to better production values, cinematography and music. Rural areas are well used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of Latin America and cinematographer Xavier Cruz provides rich colors and clarity. Ken Thorne's score for orchestra ('Murphy's War') is refreshing in the era of synthesized junk food. Curiously, these positive aspects only add to the frustration of a good film that screams to appear. The editing of Peter Lee Thompson is better than usual, but with more laughable errors of continuity. <br /> <br /> "The Evil Than Men Do" was the ideal material for the early 80s and I find it difficult to recommend the action of the 21st Century Fans. The Columbia TriStar Entertainment DVD is a good presentation, offering a standard, widescreen format with subtitles in four languages. Although the video quality is well above average, "Evil" was originally recorded in mono audio. The theatrical trailer is proposed and gives off a grindhouse impression, with an eroded color and a fuzzy sound quality. <br /> <br /> ** out of 4
