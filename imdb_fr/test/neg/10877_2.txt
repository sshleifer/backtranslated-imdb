Quentin Tarantino once said that to succeed in the film industry, you had to make your own Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. Screenwriter / actor / director Larry Bishop seems to have taken this advice a little too closely with Hell Ride and concocted a disordered homage that borrows much too heavily in his visuals, his music, his camera work and his stories that change the time. But to imitate a Tarantino movie, you have to be chic to build creative conversations; Unfortunately, the main element that derails Hell Ride lies in its atrocious ravings and vulgar monologues that only disgust and baffle the public while invoking pity for the actors just for their involvement. <br /> <br /> The anti-hero biker gang, The Victors biker, is made up of several groups of vigilantes who bring their own bloodthirsty righteousness to lawless roads. Chief Pistolero (Larry Bishop) is determined to take revenge and extinguish fires. The Gent (Michael Madsen) is just trying to balance his chaotic and psychotic symphony of life by giving a lead to anyone who passes through his boss, and Comanche (Eric Balfour) follows with fierce loyalty and a mysterious past. <br /> <br /> On the forehead of the wicked, Deuce (David Carradine) is the brain that orchestrates by far, but not far enough, and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) spits venom and obscene explanations for his tattoos while lugging a speargun and a general defender. life. While these characters may seem interesting on paper, once they are forced to dialogue with a horribly ill-conceived dialogue, all traces of cool disappear more quickly than funding for Bishop's next film. <br /> <br /> While Hell Ride is riddled with imperfections and missed opportunities, the main facet of its loss lies in ill-conceived conversations. And since Bishop's main influences are Tarantino's talkative films, there are many. The first twenty minutes of the film are almost incomprehensible and probably also have meaning in muted. At the moment the main Pistolero pressure is introduced and some phrases are overused until nausea, you pray for death and for the possibility of turning off the sound. Even Dennis Hopper struggles to stay calm while dropping such a goofy dialogue. <br /> <br /> Have you ever repeated a word or phrase so often that it does not sound right anymore or does not make any sense? Bishop starts there and continues the madness until you envy the characters on the screen to cut off their heads. And when the dialogue finally takes a break, we are entitled to shots scattered showing a naked woman fighting against oil and throats the throat. I'm not sure what effect Bishop was hoping for, but I doubt he found it. <br /> <br /> Hell Ride wants to pay tribute to Quentin Tarantino's films, Robert Rodriguez's films and all the movies that idolize the devilish attitudes of bikers. But if his intentions can be noble, the horribly disgusting dialogue and the hyper stylized montage that encroaches on the chronology prevent the public from investing themselves with generic characters of tough guys. By the time we understood the mystery behind the motivations of the characters (and it may take some time before you realize that there is still a mystery to be solved), it is too difficult to to worry about it. And while everyone on the screen is clearly having fun, they have completely neglected to translate these entertainment to the public. <br /> <br /> - Joel Massie
