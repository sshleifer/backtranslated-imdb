Most of this film was ok, for a sequel to a sequel to a sequel ... <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the amount of suspense there was; I really expected it to be thrown out the window for gore, gore, gore. This was not the case, but there are ridiculous deaths. <br /> <br /> What I did not like was all the complications of the plot. It could have gone if the writers had taken the time to explain them all. But what exactly was the purpose of the secret society in the psychiatric establishment? Why were they protected from Michael's damage to some degree? What exactly were they going to do with the baby? How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant, by the way? Why lock her up for 20 years to get pregnant too? Why did Michael kill all his co-conspirators at the end? Why were there fetuses in the laboratory? The actors seemed to have "understood everything" once they had seen the fetuses .. But this has never been explained to the public. <br /> <br /> If you are just going to watch this movie to see people being silenced Then it will be fine for you .. However, if you can not stand a plot that is thrown at you and remains unresolved at the moment where the credits fall on you, you should go look something else.
