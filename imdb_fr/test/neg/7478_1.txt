For a while, when I was in between jobs, I used to watch all late night talk shows. For a while, I had a good choice: Conan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimmel ... <br /> <br /> Until I reached the hour of 1:30. The time between Conan and X-Files, on SciFi. And the only show at that time was (and curiously still) Carson Daly. <br /> <br /> His show intrigued me at first. Young, dressed casually and with the trendy pedigree of an MTV animator, I thought Carson would bring a younger aesthetic until late at night. I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> He has no comic timing. His jokes are clearly insignificant and his monologue is a painful case of conscious babbling. I started to think that he just was not capable of producing comedy (and I'm right, it's not the case), but it became obvious over time that the writers of the series had to have him for him. The writing was silly and far too irrational and the skits screamed badly. And towards the end of the series being in the studio, the writers asked Carson to drink alcohol on the set with enthusiasm on each show, an unconscious Carson who smiled from one emaciated cheek to the other while he was pioneered through interviews. <br /> Zero interview skills. No. He tries to be friendly / talkative, but ends up being rude and rude. He talks too much. He cuts his guests. He asks them rude or embarrassing questions - if he can find a question to ask them. And as someone has already pointed out, guests literally look at it or squirm in their place, which is clearly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The show has now left the studio and seems to have been shot on a camera at hand. Even still, Carson refuses to grab the hint of NBC. At one point, Carson did not even have a cameraman, he had to film himself for an episode! Wake up, Carson ... this writing is on the wall. <br /> <br /> I see that the show is produced by Carson. I can only imagine that's why he's still on the air, he pays for it himself.
