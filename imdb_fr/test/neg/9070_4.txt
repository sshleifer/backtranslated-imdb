Robert Wagner (as Joel Gregory) and Kate Jackson (as Donna Gregory) arrive in the sinister mansion of actress "Lorna Love" (the home of silent movie star Harold Lloyd). Mr. Wagner and Ms. Jackson are contracted to write the biography of the silent movie star. Wagner has a personal interest in the project because his father was one day the lover of the star. Mysterious events unfold and Jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde, who is "perfectly preserved" in a crypt of the estate. moreover, the evil woman seems to want to own her husband and murder Jackson! <br /> <br /> It's really a variation of "Night of Dark Shadows", with the real old "Dark Shadows" Kate Jackson, who knows and plays her role well. Robert Wagner lacks the intensity of David Selby. Sylvia Sidney (as Mrs. Josephs) avoids Grayson Hall. Marianna Hill is not a match for Lara Parker (or Diana Millay). Bill Macy (as Oscar Payne) is excellent in a role that would have been played by John Karlen (in a production of Dan Curtis). <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell, John Carradine and Dorothy Lamour present fluid cameos. Ms. Lamour's performance is similar to that of Joan Bennett, which raises the question: why did not producer Aaron Spelling get more regular Dark Shadows customers? <br /> <br /> Director E.W. Swackhamer was Bridget Hanley's husband; he worked with Ms. Blondell on "Here Come the Brides" and with Jackson on "The Rookies". "Death at Love House" probably has a tighter scenario than the movie "Night of Dark Shadows"; it differs in the angle of the movie star; and, in his "Father Eternal Fire" ending, he looks more like the "Laura the Phoenix" script of the TV series. <br /> <br /> **** Death at Love House (9/3/76) E.W. Swackhamer ~ Robert Wagner, Kate Jackson, Sylvia Sidney
