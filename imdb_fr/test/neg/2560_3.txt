This is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s. However, if it has already had an exciting plot or even semi-interesting, it does not seem to have aged very well. <br /> <br /> Long story short: extremely complicated plot, slow, confusing with ordinary choreography, sounds of whiplash generally annoying and exaggerated with each punch and foot, and constant "twists" that never end never. By the time the film reached its emotional climax, it was a long time since I had the wind in my sails. <br /> <br /> Look at it for its historical value as a hub of Chinese kung fu cinema - just leave your expectations at the door, otherwise you will be bitterly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Reserved for hardcore fans.
