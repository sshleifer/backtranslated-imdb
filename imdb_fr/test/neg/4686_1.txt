When I bought this movie, I was expecting a fun operating movie from the 1970s. Instead, I had this feast of amateur author Andy Milligan. Ah, Andy Milligan. With its tight fixtures, fast pace and wonderfully well-known actors, you'd almost feel like watching ... one of his movies at home! Seriously, I could not even stay awake the first time I tried to watch him. The scenes of boring people dragged on, and every time someone was killed, the movie slowed down. Sometimes it also sped up, causing the characters' voices to sound like chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this movie. The screenplay actually looked a little better than the movie and seemed more appropriate for a soap opera than for a grainy sleeping pill of the 70s where actors stumble constantly on its lines. The cover said "Their main cuts were oddly erotic ... but completely brutal!" Believe me, this movie is not "erotic". Oh, we see characters that look like lumpy cottage cheese, but that's about it. And as far as "brutal" is concerned, well, the viewer is the most brutalized with this film. And something else...
