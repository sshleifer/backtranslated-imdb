A few days before the premiere of the film, his scriptwriter retires from the project and asks that his name be removed from the credits, you know that this does not bode well. <br /> <br /> The books on which "Wiedzmin" is based have a lot of potential for a living fantasy film ?? "Geralt de Rivia is a witcher, his only goal is to destroy the monsters that plague the world, but is everything that looks monstrous wrong, and all that is right is not good?" But all that mattered little, when a Polish film crew, with a reduced budget, without any appreciation of Sapkowski's work, decided to make a mini-series in 13 episodes. The two-hour movie is a by-product of their actions, to maximize profits. <br /> <br /> In this case, it is not difficult to specify why this film is qualified as bad. Intrigue (incoherent, thank you for stuffing it with too many stories), actor (below average, except for Zebrowski), dialogue (fade), editing (hashed), special effects (unbearable) and choreography (mediocre) , add to the bad overall experience of the film. Only the soundtrack, directed by Grzegorz Ciechowski, highlights the beauty of the world of "Wiedzmin", which has never been brought to the screen. Even the grandiose flora and fauna of Poland (where part of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" was shot), a crucial element of almost ANY fantastic film, have not been fully used. The more I think about this loss, the more words I am short of. At least, it is comforting to know that Marek Brodzki, the director of "Wiedzmin", has made only one film since (in addition, in Germany). <br /> <br /> For now, we only have fantastic stories and a fantastic computer-based role play (published in 2007) referring to Wiedzmin's books. But I'm sure that one day, justice will be done for the Wiedzmin saga, and we will be treated with such a good movie adaptation soon enough.
