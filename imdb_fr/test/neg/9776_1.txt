*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** A group of Afrikkaner-Hillbilly guys are in the desert looking for Diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area. Spoilers: The stupidest starts to hit the mound with a pickaxe, and the crevice. Then he looks in the hole and passes his head and surprises! something is eating it. The other two dimwits are not seen alive. Scott Bairstow looks like a pizza delivery man but he plays a role as an expert scientist with a degree in medicine (which means he should be around 35 years old at least). Bairstow should join Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that picks up Bairstow to take him to camp C has a handful of crazies that usually populate movies like "PITCH BLACK" "THE THING" and so on. The truck passes by to cross the first truck and they decide to conduct an investigation (how is it that this truck did not see the other truck when they went to get Bairstow, since they took the same route ?? ). Then they find the bodies devoured and there are some decent special effects on the bones with small pieces of flesh. Karl, the group's main fool, decides to find the killer. Then the truck rolls in the desert following tracks, and finally it has an electrical short circuit and the crew is stuck in the desert. The dumbest guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them. When he takes a nap (wearing the same jacket), the creatures devour him alive, and another guy rushes and pushes his arm into the fire and this model also loses it. This sounds exciting so far, except that a few minutes later, Dr. Bairstow realizes that the creature is actually hundreds of thousands of ants that use the bones to stand together in order to get to a new hive (because the miners opened the old hive). Now, the last time I checked, the ants could move alone, without having to kill people to use the bones as a structure. If all they needed was something difficult, they could have put together a bunch of sticks and used them to create a form. The whole story is really, really silly, and the explanation of the ant is the only given. The rest of the movie is about the group that is killed until they find the new ant nest, and kill the ant brains (somehow), and the hundreds of thousands of ants then leave their homes. own chef. feet. An available ant brain (off camera) was found and returned for analysis, thus creating a reason for a sequel.
