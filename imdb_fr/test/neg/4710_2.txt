I rented this movie because Elijah Wood did a good job and I thought it might be a neglected treasure. It was not a treasure. I do not know if it was directly on video, but it should have been directly on the dump. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood fans will appreciate the fact that he is shirtless in a shower scene much too brief. . But, no sensible person would want this script. Imagine Memento played by teen actors, but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible. Example: Janeane Garofalo plays the role of a caring psychologist (apparently, "he keeps the chain of mediocrity alive"). <br /> <br /> As if the syndromes of false memories and psychosocial medicine were not serious enough, the film also depends on one of these unexplained psychic twins who keep the plot moving and disconcert the audience . This same double bond creates too many artificial love scenes between Wood's character and the daughter of She's All That, who plays the holy sister of Wood's angry cancer victim. <br /> <br /> scenario, the other friends of Wood are victims of cancer and Kidney, a young black boy with a mysterious kidney disease. The wish of kidney is granted when Dr. Garofalo gives him his own walkman. The puzzled function of this character in the story goes hand in hand with his unstable relationship with walking. In Kidney, Kidney usually presents several inexplicable scenes in which he sinks other people. <br /> <br /> Kindey's characterization may be a detail, but it is indicative of the many other flaws in this film. Bumblebee flies Whatever it is, it's definitely annoying, but it never flies.
