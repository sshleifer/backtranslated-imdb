This is a really mediocre film in the vein of "Buckaroo Banzai". The cast turns as "Mad Max" aspirants, and they seem to share a joke that they do not want to share with the audience. Wheeler-Nicholson is one of those guilty pleasure actresses you're thrilled to discover in the movies, but she's not worth the rental price. The space fly starts an electric fire, and burns a vote of 4.
