The box to this film is totally distorted itself. The cover shows a view of the legs and panties in a short skirt. The title is "Pie". The synopsis on the back of the box gave the impression that Cat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the popular students, but this popularity resulted in a strange lifestyle she could not escape. All the box built in this movie was a horrible lie. I was expecting a sort of nauseating and direct version of the "Heathers" video for today's teenagers. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you what "Tart" really is. Yes, it's really the plot; so if you do not want to know what's going on, stop reading. We have a unique and boring rich girl. This girl's best friend is a skank. The skank is expelled from school, so the inimitable girl befriends a British girl. This leads to the inimitable girl who comes out with this boring guy, whom the box refers to as "the most popular boy in the school". If this guy was the most popular guy in their school, I would have liked to go to that high school because I could have kicked him out. Anyway, as all the movies will tell you, the most popular guy in school is invariably a murderer, drug addict or thief, or in this case, all of the above. Anyway, everyone ends up disliking the main character, who does not look like anything, because she is Jewish. Then, the school's most popular guy beats his best friend, skank, to death with a pebble, as skank has surprised the most popular boy in the act of homosexuality. The stoic mother of the girl and the hypochondriac brother are there for her at the end. Oh, and the whole movie also talks about rich kids and their awful parents. Gee, what's wrong with that? It looks like a fantastic movie! Well, that's what I thought. But you see, there are no nice characters in this movie. The main character is boring. The filmmakers made it mean, while during the film, she does not stop talking about what she is a monster. Skank is not skanky enough and has little time on the screen. The popular guy is nothing brilliant. Popular girls are only rich and ordinary girls. There are no moral lessons. Cat, the boring main character, is not a monster, never becomes one of the most popular girls, and (worst of all) after all the bullshit she goes through, she thinks she's still too beautiful to become the only kind girl, the stupid girl. To be honest, I do not know why the movie is called Tart. I kept asking, who's the pie? Is she the pie? Are they all pies? At 94 minutes, this is not theoretically a long film. But after watching this terrible waste of a VHS tape and not knowing who the pie was, I was surprised to find that the movie only lasted an hour and a half. The film felt like two hours and a few changes. After a while, I was hoping the movie would talk about pop pies. At least, when you look at a box of tarts, you know what to expect.
