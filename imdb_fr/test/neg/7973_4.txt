When Kristy Swanson gets blamed for what she does, she wants to go out. Unfortunately, Madsen is his immediate superior in a company where "giving two weeks notice is not an option". <br /> <br /> As a teenager who kills vampires, Kristy did a great job. The image of the valley girl seemed to match. But as an escaped assassin ... well, keep running Kristy. Run, run away! This film is not a concept that has never been realized before, but it WAS improved! <br /> <br /> I did not want to watch the rest of this movie, but I thought I should do it if I wanted to. to give a review of this film. I have always loved Madsen and his character was a little predictable, but this movie was really a waste of time to watch and do ... no wonder it was never released in theaters!
