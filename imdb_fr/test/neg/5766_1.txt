I am shocked to see that some people have awarded more than two stars to this film. They must be either joking or totally blind to the art of acting, directing and other flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I just could not force myself to go through the whole movie, it was just a shame. <br /> <br /> The first three characters, not to mention the "digger", were awful actors, and I mean AWFUL! Maybe the director did not care, or maybe he was a worse director. It was like watching a bad school play. The film was of course filmed with a video camera (small budget - it's not a real movie), and the light settings are not very good either. Moreover, the man of sound (if he had one) had to be a beginner or a drunkard, because the sound was amateurish. Even in one of the first scenes of the kitchen (AWFUL, BW), the sound of the dialogue was rather bad. For example, when the woman moved her head while talking, her voice could be heard disappearing and coming back. It looked like they had tried to correct this in post-production by increasing the volume a little when she turned her head. In addition, you hear the constant irritating buzz of the camera or other sources in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> All these squeakers in the first 5 minutes or so. Do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> A good school project or a fun project to watch, but that should never have been published for a real audience, especially not for a PAID audience. IT WAS A RIP OFF unless you have a very low level when it comes to movies or just the bad taste. You are warned! SB.
