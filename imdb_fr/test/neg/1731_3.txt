My summary refers to the fact that this film has 1479 votes, or just 21 to make it eligible to appear on the infamous list of the 100 best candidates of IMDb, the 100 lowest rated films of the site. With a derisory score of only 1.8, the film would be approximately between # 38 and # 46 on the list. Talk about a very dubious achievement !! My score of 3 is not so bad, but it brings the film closer to the list dreaded. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it stars Aaron Carter, once cute, once again. pre-packaged and forgotten pop star of the 1990s. When he first came on the scene, he was a cute kid with songs that appealed to Disney Radio pre-teens and Tweeners. His songs, his look and his image have been scrupulously maintained and created by marketing people. Unfortunately, in 2005, sales were down and Carter had reached his delicate stage of life - a problem that ALL children his age will have to face. Frankly, he is no longer cute in this film and is at a very difficult stage of life. I guess now he's a gorgeous young man ... but in "Popstar" he's not the heartbeat he once was. Here it is just very normal ... a death sentence for a child in his position of "pop sensation". <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the film has some appearances from another ex-teenager, a heartbeat. in recent decades - with roles such as David Cassidy and Leif Garrett - two guys who also know what it's like to disappear in the spotlight. Cassidy has managed to collect the pieces and make a place for himself, while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after celebrity was a joke. Let's hope that Carter will take Cassidy in the future and so far, thankfully, he has managed to avoid negative publicity and court appearances of many ex-pop idols. I was far from being enthusiastic about the film but I sincerely wish him the best in this department. It's not his fault that he was smeared on radio and television from the early to mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> In this film, Carter does not need to stretch, he plays the role of a pop star. However, despite his millions and adoration by girls, he does not have everything to himself. It is quite dense - mainly because it has little interest in learning. The problem is so serious that her mother decides not to go to school at home, which forces her to go to public school. The problem, though, is that it's pretty phobic about exams ... and it's hard to get a result at school. So he has the idea of ​​finding a smart girl to go out with her - a girl who would naturally be obliged to help her at school. He chooses the pretty Jane (Alana Austin), a bookseller, and pretends to really like him in a sad attempt to make this scheme work. <br /> <br /> This plot, by the way, is not bad and could work even though it looks a lot like an episode of a show like "The Brady Bunch" or a Nickelodeon sitcom. Of course, it's predictable and you KNOW that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn her plot and will be hurt AND that he will finally realize that he is really caring for her AND that at the end of the movie, everything will be forgiven and they will be. be a real couple. But, with good acting and competent leadership, this could be worth the detour for his teenage fans, because predictable is not always bad. And, if it turned out that this is not exactly where the plot took place ... but it was terribly close. <br /> <br /> There are some good things I liked in the movie. See Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens playing Jane's grandparents was very kind - their role was pretty sweet and it was good to see them again. In addition, the stars of the 70s designed for TV star Andrew Stevens appeared in the film - it was nice to see him again - even though part of me hated him, because he looks so handsome after all these years and my 45 years! He did a good job and it was nice to see him in the same movie as his mother (Stella). <br /> <br /> As for Carter, with his many previous experiences on television, he was, unsurprisingly, pretty good. Although her relationship with Jane does not seem very credible, she and Austin have given the best of themselves. The movie was not great, but they tried and I think most of the problems with the movie were related to writing - with a better and less formulated storyline, it could have worked much better. Moreover, the angle of "testophobia" seemed rather artificial ... and rather insignificant. Who cares if a mega-millionaire star is worried about taking tests at school ?! Overall, this is not a rotten film as the current rating would be, although there is not much here to attract a large audience. People who grew up loving Carter will probably enjoy the movie. Older people are probably not interested in anything, and the very young who probably have not heard of him. For them, the film has no nostalgic value. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie ... Leif Garrett giving advice to Aaron. I wanted to shout "do not listen !!" but not!
