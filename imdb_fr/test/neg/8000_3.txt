Enter the Ninja (1981) is the first of several "Ninja" films produced by Cannon with or with the Japanese sensation Sho Kosugi. But the star of the first movie "Ninja" was the legendary rugged Franco Nero. Unfortunately, neither Mr. Nero nor Sho Kosugi could make this film visible. When you have two bad guys in an action movie and it's neither observable nor entertaining, something is wrong. But I go astray. Skip this chapter and watch the next movies in the series. They are more interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Next is Revenge of the Ninja. Instead of playing "oriental evil" (I use this term as language for you to play the cheek). It's the star! Strange for a Western movie. Look at that one instead. <br /> <br /> Not recommended except for Sho Kosugi fans and Cannon moviegoers.
