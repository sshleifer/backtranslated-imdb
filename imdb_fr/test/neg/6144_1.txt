What is the point of pretending to "steal" people like ski passes and pizzas? I do not see a point. I am neither intelligent nor original and it seems to me extremely useless. <br /> <br /> Skyler Stone does not seem to be a very down-to-earth man or even a nice guy. He has very little charisma and anyone can do what he does in this series. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this shit is the fact that a lot of phone calls are replenished, so they're not apparently misleading the poor people to the We also invite the public who do not have enough time to read the "disinterest" that flickers on the screen for about half a second at the beginning of the series! <br /> <br /> Not only that, but he also claims that's how he lived all his life. What a lie. No one could live his life like that and the fact that he says it's not just another pretext to watch his show, but it's also one of the most more blatant than I know. This guy is an @ $$! <br /> <br /> What makes them think that, for example, write and record a song, ask someone to make a big picture of you and your two companions, take dance classes and get to go to a ski resort is it just worth getting free ski passes and food? What is the purpose of this? It is very difficult to get some ski passes and a little snow. <br /> <br /> As for the "comedy", it's the bottom of things.
