There are a lot of problems with this movie. We can say that doing a sequel to "Halloween" was a bad idea in the first place, and we should feel lucky that the previous entries, even at their lowest level, are still watchable. But even so, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" - even today - is so terrible that it's shocking. Bad film making at worst, indeed. There is so much to do. But where to start? On which shoulders rests this blame? <br /> <br /> Did director Joe Chapelle lead the style? Well, at the very least, the sixth installment is new in visual terms. And in terms of visual effects, you can see Michael Kill kill quite macabre, even if it does not quite fit the overall tone of the series. <br /> <br /> Can Daniel Ferrands do the same? troubled script be the culprit? Well, to be fair, he did his best. By the time you reach the sixth entry in a series, you are running out of places to go. Finding a nursery rhyme for Michael's reason is not a bad concept, but an uninteresting concept, especially the way it is run here. And it does not really help that the film was split into pieces and stitched so often that the story was completely lost towards the end. <br /> <br /> Maybe Dimension / Miramax could have botched the whole thing. After all, it was the first studio film in the Halloween series and we all know what happens when too many cooks enter the kitchen. Heck, look at the incredible lows they dragged "Hellraiser" to? I guess everyone is to blame, because apart from the actors and the visual effects, it seems that no one has bothered to produce a decent movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, though, is that no matter you cut, slice, dice or electrocute until your head explodes, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" n has never been a good movie. Marking an all-time record for the series that almost destroyed all credibility for Michael Myers, "Curse" is just that: cursed. The thorn angle has never been interesting, nor probably developed. The useless gore is so irrelevant and replaces the tension that is the hallmark of the name "Halloween". Towards the end, the movie stops making sense, stops trying to push a plot and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and end the movie before nothing is lost. It is unfortunate that the final performance of Donald Pleasence is immortalized in this movie, even though the man did his best in the worst possible conditions. And for the most part, there are other strong cast members in this movie. Paul Rudd embodies Tommy Doyle, a bizarre and rather social anti-social adult, while Marianne Hagan does a fair job in describing the likeable female lead role. On the other side of the coin, Jamie Lloyd's redesign was a shame, and thank God, Devin Gardner is no longer making movies. As a child in the movie "Man in Black", Danny is anti-Jamie in that he is annoying, moaning and absolutely incredible in his role. It's sad not to feel sympathy for a child in a horror movie. But I guess it's "Halloween 6" in a nutshell. It is essentially anti-"Halloween", directed by a director who did not know what he was doing and by a studio that had its own agenda. Hell, even the music is bad. Many will try to paint this as an edgy "Halloween" because of its science fiction twist, but really, it's just stupid. Apart from some good visuals and decent characters, "The Curse of Michael Myers" is about as bad as possible. And that comes from a fan!
