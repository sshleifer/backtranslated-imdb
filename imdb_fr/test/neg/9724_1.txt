Anyone who notes this movie above 3 has a very distorted view of the movies, anyone who has rated this piece of sh! T 7 or higher, I have absolutely no respect for their likes in movies, and doubt they have ever seen a good one. I'm always ready to give a shot to a movie and I did it with this one; I tried to be careful, I tried not to lose my money, but 15 minutes with my friends made fun of me because I was listening to my iPod, 25 minutes later, I could not even see the overactivity that happened in the movie, so I got up and I left, I never got out of a movie, until this trash, the one who says he liked it is a liar or they should be banished from This site. I'm so angry when I see a person give it a score of 8 when the overall rating of the godfathers is 9.1, it's like saying that this movie was close to what it is not.
