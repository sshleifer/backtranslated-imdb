So I saw this afternoon "What Lies Above" and I watched it because the beginning was rather promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountaineering expert ... but that does not help when her fianc√© Brian is injured in a climb. When she goes for help and comes back, he disappears from the mountain and will never be seen again. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Diana is still a mountaineer ... but she will not go near Snowman's Passer. Until Curt Seaver appears and tell him he can find the body of his fiance lost with a new satellite program. She accepts and they take off in the mountains with the two assistants of Curt: his "bodyguard" Hugo and the computer genius Tyler. From the beginning, you know there are unacknowledged reasons, but unfortunately, the twists are not good and lead to a ridiculously bad chase sequence that represents the last 20 or 30 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> The main disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural nuances that never materialize. The object of the sky that fell in the mountains (which turns out to be less supernatural), the story of the creation of Snowman's Pass, and the most memorable of all: Diana's dream taking place half way course of the film. But what disappointed me the most is where they dropped the ball. The majority of the film is about Brian's research, so I can not begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was was never solved during of the film. It was the major plot. This is how the film started! How not to wrap that? <br /> <br /> I would not tell too many people to bother with this one ...
