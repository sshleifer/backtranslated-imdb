Great concept, characterizations and perfect voices, but total loss of time. A real shame, because if she had aimed higher, it probably would not have been the bomb she was (is); far too much dependent on scatological humor, to begin with. I am amazed by the comments of "educated" critics referring to the "good science" behind this puerile trash. Unlike "Finding Nemo", where (with a hint of disbelief) attention to detail was astounding and science was as effective as the context allowed, "Osmosis Jones" was utter nonsense; do not make fun of science. Humor was for eight-year-olds, but the subject was better for some unsuspecting teenagers.
