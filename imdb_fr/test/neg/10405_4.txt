This is another variation of the often-told story that two people get married and have to share their offspring. EGAL ROLL is directed by Howard Morris (TV) and it shows, because it's the kind of story that is played like a half-hour sitcom, which was followed by a feature film but with a lack of laughter, or in other words, only the number of laughs that would have been possible within half an hour of television shows. <br /> <br /> DORIS DAY has decided to end his activities after this film - and it's pretty easy to see why. Even the presence of fairly reliable actors in distribution does not help. BRIAN KEITH, BARBARA HERSHEY, PAT CARROLL and ALICE GHOSTLEY are doing their best, but the scenario is the real problem and should have remained blank for the big screen. <br /> <br /> Nothing can be said in his favor. Ignore her and see Miss Day in her most interesting films.
