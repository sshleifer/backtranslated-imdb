Oh my God. I never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller as bad as Domestic Disturbance so quickly, but here it is. Armed with a rotten plot, a dreadful editing, a scalded actor's act and a 'style' inducing headaches (sorry, I have no other words to say it), Sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to reevaluate a whole genre. That is, this movie is so bad that even the thrillers that I condemned, because the complete failures now seem a little better. <br /> <br /> Now, not only is Sanctimony a terrible film in itself, but it also succeeds in a difficult task. to tear up better movies and do a pathetic job with her. From the main titles - nothing but a blatant attempt to replicate Se7en's - I felt that something was wrong. As soon as the film started with a series of silly quick cuts, full of bloody images and vibrant colors, I knew where the smell came from. <br /> <br /> It happens that two police officers or rather the police officer Jim Renart (Michael Par√©) and the policewoman Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin) investigate a murder case in Vancouver. A serial killer, known as "Monkey Killer" (threatening and scary nickname, uh?) For his methods of work, killed a lot of people. You see, this nut apparently works after the proverb "do not see evil, do not hear evil, do not speak evil" and cut the eyes, ears and tongue of its victims. So far, six eyes, six ears and three languages. In a very ingenious way, Renart and Smith understand that the Monkey Killer is about to kill three other people ... well, because he probably wants to complete the number 666. So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien), a young businessman, successful and good-looking, with a terrible temperament. And this is where the scam of American Psycho gets involved. <br /> <br /> We follow the lives of the two police officers and the young psychopath, none of whom are interesting, until they finally meet. On the way, a disco where Renart barely misses Gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes of our recent memory: Renart is at the back of the disco club, because ... well, just because the script tells us it's a suspect. in law; then, with a single blow in the stomach, Renard gets rid of a great guard who blocks the passage, and we never hear of this guard again? Does this scene seem totally unrealistic? <br /> <br /> Anyway, after another murder, Gerrick shows up, but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect he might be the murderer. Typically for Basic Instinct, Smith makes an appointment with the young businessman, assuming she can discover his true identity. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the end, but it's just an embarrassment. ; there are contradictions, intrigues, problems that are never solved, and above all there is a final scene where a brutal mass murder, supposed to be shocking and sad, unfolds like such a ridiculously exaggerated and absurd that I do not can not honestly imagine how nobody could laugh at it. <br /> <br /> After 87 minutes, Sanctimony really pushes him. You never worry about a single character because they are all so flat (not to say boring) that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them. You are never drawn into the story because the scenes are connected through plots of weak parcels when they are not useless or displaced. The game of actors goes from the average (Van Dien) to the most atrocious (Rubin and most actors). music is an abyssal generic techno, and photography is one of the worst I've ever seen. Of course, like all the fiasco of the genre, we get some free nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10
