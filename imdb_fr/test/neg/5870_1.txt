It's often difficult to decide which is the best movie you've ever seen, as it can vary depending on the genre, the preferences of the actors / actresses or even the mood in which you find yourself on a given day! That said, this film is by far, in my opinion, the worst movie I have ever seen !! I thought the acting was terrible (was there any?), The plot was just silly, and the props were totally wrong. Could we create a low-budget production without being an amateur production? I do not think so. Even the friends I watched the movie with agreed that it was the worst video we have ever rented, and to this day we still joke about the night we saw this movie.
