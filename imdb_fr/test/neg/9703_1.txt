The first shot of the film - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, invoking all the clich√©s that cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of rebellious female character with a strong spirit in the drama of Time - I knew I was looking for something to make me want to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Joe Wright seemed not only to not have read the book, but to be regrettably sorry that what he was filming was not actually Jane's subtle and nuanced comedy Austen of manners driven by glittering and delicate social interactions in English salons of the eighteenth century, but as a kind of certificate U. Wuthering Heights. Thus, every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy took place outside, for no apparent reason, in rugged landscapes and often in heavy rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, does not speak of passion, sexual tension or love. These are different strategies for negotiating the stultification of eighteenth-century society. What was completely ignored, so that the house of the Bennets was a tumultuous and chaotic place where everyone screams at once, rushes, leaves his underwear on chairs and pigs roam happily in the house; the company's balls are transformed into country country dance scenes just steps from a Matrix Reloaded style orgy dance; and everyone says exactly what he thinks without the slightest respect for propriety. <br /> <br /> Jane Austen's genius lies in the exploration of the emptiness created by a society in which no one says what he thinks or wants to say because of a disproportionate look. for good reason, and the tragic situations of his characters stem from misunderstandings and misunderstandings made possible by this mute void. Thus, Jane Austen's brilliance and the very factor that allows her intrigues - especially in this film - to work have been completely erased. The subtlety in general was nowhere in his film, sacrificed in favor of an overworked drama that questioned the material and the performances. <br /> <br /> It was so obvious to be a "serious" movie. The humor - which IS Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and his call - was almost entirely suppressed in favor of all that poetic-faced melodrama and, when allowed to enter, was treated so clumsily. Pride & Prejudice is a serious story that raises serious points, certainly, but these serious points and these heavier themes are not simply related to humor, they are enshrined. You can not lose Jane Austen's technique, leaving only the foundation of the story and expect the themes to stay. Not even when you replace his techniques with your own cinematograph of heavy-handed mystic-numinous false-mysteries. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature, sensible and lucid. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film as a schoolgirl with an empty head and the second half as a schoolgirl with an empty head who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's spirit, her combative verbal exchanges, her essential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everyone's follies, including her own, her strength and composure, as well as her fantastic foresight were completely lost and replaced by ... what? Lots of laughing and looking away? Rather than being able to keep her head when everything around her was losing theirs, she began to cry and cry at the slightest provocation - and not really furious either; no, they were wheezing. And where the great strength of Elizabeth of Austen (at least in her eyes) was her ability to maintain her integrity and respect while remaining within the confines of society and maintaining irreproachable property, Elizabeth Knightley had no respect for the convention. In addition, she seemed to think that wandering barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version put her beyond all doubt as a strong and lively soul, and that nothing in the written character or performance was to support it. A surprisingly subtle and bland performance. In this quest for blandness and weakness, Matthew Macfayden accompanied him brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland since Mr. Bennet seemed weak, ineffective and confused permanently, with no sense of humor and ironic detachment at the expense of the relationships that make Mr. Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His special connection with Lizzie, as the only two sensitive people in a world of fools, was completely lost, especially because they were both idiots in a world of fools, which completely deprived the end of the emotional impact movie. Mr. Bingley was no longer friendly and well intentioned to the point of madness, but was played as a complete retarder for cheap laughter, and the woman who played Jane was so foolishly inconsistent that she might as well have nothing do with the character at all. The scenario varied greatly between Jane Austen's textual pieces - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and a totally contemporary language that would not be misplaced in a modern romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Get the adaptation of the BBC on DVD and Save your heartache.
