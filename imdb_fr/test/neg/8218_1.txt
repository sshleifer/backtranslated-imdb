The movie starts with a lot of voice-overs, a bad sign. Then he slips into silly and insulting scenes involving trappers and Indians. But, it reaches new and impressive lows when all the merry men of the mountain meet in a high alpine meadow. Meanwhile, the happy Indians will sit down to watch them. It's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in "Blazing Saddles". There is a minor flaw in this comparison; "Across the Wide Missouri" is not a comedy. <br /> <br />
