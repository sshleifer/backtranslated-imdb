Guy Pearce is almost like Flynn, and this resemblance is the only one this film can claim. Nowhere in Flynn's autobiography is the mention of Klaus Reicher's character, the homosexual encounter is a hypothetical fiction, and the film's claims that Flynn treated the native labor poorly are unfounded. Director Frank Howson has not made any memorable film, and I find it a little lame to slander Flynn without foundation to advance his underhanded career. <br /> <br />
