I threw myself into this film hoping / hoping for a shady seventies exploitation in the drive-in style, but what I got was rather a weird western pseudo, with far too much talk and not enough of action. It is clear that this film was made on a budget. the places are dull and badly drawn, while the game leaves much to be desired as well. The plot focuses on a trio of thieves (one father and two sons) who steal a load of gold after killing minors. They meet a cabin inhabited by a girl and her mother-in-law ... and all this is told in flashback by the girl, who currently resides in an asylum. It is clear that filmmakers Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were doing something really shocking; but despite all his efforts, South of Hell Mountain is too boring to shock the viewer. The film lasts about eighty minutes and includes mostly boring characters that launch boring and long dialogues. The only good thing I have to say about the movie is the music; which is good in places. The end is the only other good thing about the movie; and that's only because it's the last thing that's happening. I would not recommend anyone to disturb that ... there was much better waste in the seventies.
