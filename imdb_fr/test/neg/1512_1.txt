As a Christian, I found this film completely embarrassing. The actors sucked, the writing sucked, the cinematography sucked, and the story was so typical. I can not say that this is an excellent testimonial tool, because I would be too embarrassed to show one of my unsaved friends. Hollywood has a lot better, and that's because they invest the best. Christians put their work to work and think that everything is fine because "it is for the Lord". In the Old Testament, people spent huge sums of money making offerings to God. David (or Saul ... I do not remember) spent what would amount to about $ 50 billion in money for building a temple for God. But these days, spending what would seem to be about $ 30,000 to make a movie to "testify" to people with is simply pathetic. It's the person, not the product that affects someone. Do not waste your time trying to convert your friends with this loss of an hour and a half. If you want to make a positive impact on people, show them movies like The Matrix, American Beauty, Braveheart, etc., movies that have something to say and tell you about it.
