This year's Eurovision was a big disappointment for me. I have attended the Eurovision Song Contest every year since 1986 (well, at least, it's the oldest I can remember, and I was only 2 years old at the time). Like any other year, it contained good, bad and horrible songs - nothing new there. However, this year's show was the worst I can remember. Only very few good songs (decent, probably more like that) and a lot of absolutely terrible songs. <br /> <br /> The winning song of Turkey "Every Way That I Can" seemed to me to be a scam of the Turkish singer Tarkan press "Simarik", just sound worse. It did not deserve to win from my point of view. The Belgian song "Sanomi", coming in second place, was a song without language. I wonder what's next? Singing animals? Nevertheless, the music of the song was quite catchy, giving it a kind of dream sensation, to which the "words" seemed appropriate. One of the best songs, but it does not say much. <br /> <br /> After one of the closest races in the history of Eurovision, the Russian duo t.A.T.u. finished in third place, just three points behind Turkey and behind Belgium, with "Ne Ver ', Ne Boisia" ("Do not trust, do not be afraid"). For me t.A.T.u. was one of the few highlights of the series, surprising just about everyone by being one of the most hidden girls of all the participants. They let their song speak and, if we ignore the fact that they did not throw several times in the first chorus, they also let her talk very well. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise when we look at The billboard was Austria. The bookmakers here in Denmark had the biggest ratings on this song - a song that was beyond horrible - but finished in 8th place. Could it be the ass of his being shaken to the rhythm of the song? This performance was the one that made my family and I laugh the most, not because it looked good, but because it looked so stupid that it was really fun. <br /> <br /> Sweden has done what it does best; ABBA. In 1999, they won with "Take me to your paradise", sounding like ABBA. In 2001, they were in the top 10 with "Listen To Your Heartbeat", which sounded again like ABBA, and this year again, they did it in the ABBA way, ending again in the top 10. L England was finally punished for making these songs absolutely horrible and unappealing, as they have been in recent years. <br /> <br /> Ireland stole the 2000 winner, "Fly On The Wings Of Love". And I could go on and on about the gravity of the songs again and again. <br /> <br /> I'm a little sorry for the Australians, who this year finally had the chance to see the Eurovision Song Contest. They deserved better than that. <br /> <br /> I was not surprised by the show. Eurovision 2000 seems to me to be one of the best in recent years. The year 2001 was pretty good, but not so good. The year 2002 went well, but certainly more. This year was simply disappointing. <br /> <br /> Hope this will improve next year. Otherwise for us, at least for Australians. <br /> <br /> 4/10. One for the USA, one for the tight race, one for the buttocks and one for all the others.
