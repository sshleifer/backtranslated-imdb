The first movie is a bit good for me, I enjoyed it most of the time, but I thought it was really not that special. However, compared to this mess, it looks a lot better. I do not understand why they felt the need to make the film, but they should have known that it could not match the game of the first film, because they could only bring back Ruth Gordon to his role. The story follows in a way Rosemary's baby, but in reality, it's a little mess, it does not help that the film is a TV movie and that television shines very well. It also has a comedy tone that hinders it considerably, if they really felt the need to make a sequel, they should have made a movie rated R that contains a bit of nudity and gore. I'm sure it would still have been pretty bad, but at least it would have been more watchable and fun that this movie was not despite its attempt to be funny. I saw this one on Monstervision and Joe Bob had nothing really good to say about it in the intro and I do not have much to say either. I must say it was a sequel that should never have happened.
