I was quite ready to hate that, but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - although the MTV-style shooting style (shot in DV, to boot) is quite painful to the eyes! I liked the scenario's self-mocking style, as well as its central idea: to make the female vampire's main role a hit killer. When it comes to casting, Eileen Daly (better known as "star" of these awful intros of "Redemption") has an undeniable presence on the screen - and remains quite sensual, despite her age; However, the evil leader of Christopher Adamson is obnoxious. David Warbeck has a brief role as a doctor (nicknamed "The man of the horror movie"!) Who performs the autopsy of one of the vampire victims; filming seems to have taken a long time since Warbeck died in 1997! There is a lot of nudity and violence at hand, but not too much meaning alas (especially since his secondary plot involving a secret society of vampires infiltrating the power structures is barely developed); the film also has a very long lens and ends up sinking into boredom during the last half hour.
