The strange thing about Galaxina is not that it is extremely bad, although it is the case. What is strange is that despite being extremely bad, it's not funny. Extremely bad movies have their own mark of unintentional humor - the secret of their success, one might say. But Galaxina is very different, it's the worst nightmare of MST3K, a bad movie in which intentional intention * and * unintentional humor collapse. fail - and the reasons are very varied. Sometimes it's a question of timing. sometimes it's a poorly prepared idea (the human restaurant * could have been hilarious, but it was not); Sometimes you get the impression that there has been some confusion in the cutting room, the line of striking being on the ground; and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes. Bad movies have their laughs of such unintentional snafus. It's harder to understand why Galaxina does not make fun of that. Something is wrong with the unintentional humor in this film, just as something is wrong (not at all subtly) with intentional humor. It's an extremely bad film whose harm is not the redemptive quality it usually is. It's absolutely unique in my experience.
