The legendary Arizal's abyssal action movie is triumphantly sculpting a template for Cinemax's future pap as 'China O'Brien' and 'Do or Die' with Erik Estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star O'Crien with a sad scenario and a can of styling gel at the permanent of her impressive mullet 1984. The physical prowess of this type resemble a woman more woman than Mark Gregory and her next credit would be the second violin of Chris Mitchum in the role from "Tom Selick". Powerful. At least the action is insane and incessant with daring Asian stuntmen who risk their lives for this film that is essentially poorly constructed by teenagers and / or drug addicts with no idea of ​​reality. A poor extra is ripped up badly by an electric hedge trimmer and many others are killed by being hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or a cardboard box. Classic rape scenes are tasteless, priceless, worthless dialogues such as "I'd rather trust a rattlesnake!" are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from third-class polizioteschi voice actors. Random highlight: A crazy guy eats live lizards. The film also holds the record for most cars driven through the walls. 2/10
