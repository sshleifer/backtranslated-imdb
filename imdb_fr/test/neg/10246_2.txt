I have not yet seen STARCRASH (1979) - this notoriously inept Italian critic of STAR WARS (1977) - but it's worse than that mischievous piece of order that, let's say, makes Mel's so-so Brooks SPACEBALLS (1987) looks like a true work of art! In fact, the main reason we remember GALAXINA nowadays is the tragic fate of her main lady - Dorothy Stratten, the Playboy power station, who was killed by her incredibly jealous husband - even before the film's official premiere ! <br /> <br /> Although Statten (who later did two biographies on her in which she is played by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the lead role, she is reduced to being supported for the first half of the film sitting on a chair apparently leading a spacecraft on a 27-year trip to a planet or another; In fact, Galaxina is a versatile Android that also serves zany snacks to the zany crew, puts them all warm, and even goes on a hunt for Blue Star (choral music) once they land! That said, Statten certainly looks bright in her white suit and, even though her role hardly requires the comedian talent she would have, she is not really humiliating either. <br /> <br /> Still, it's ironic that a movie that bears her name is overshadowed by the crazy, wacky antics of her teammates, especially the annoying captain Cornelius Butt (who gives you a idea of ​​the level of comedy presented here), a long-colored guy with ears, wings, an old Chinese, a pot-smoking smoker quoting the proverb and, better still (relatively speaking) a hairy alien creature, eater of rocks and hairy they hold prisoner. The villain of the play is a non-dressed metal-clad who, however, has the most brilliant laugh of the film when, hearing the choral music that follows all his mentions on the Blue Star, exclaims: What is this? "It is useless to enumerate the classics of science-fiction which hinder him in his ridiculous attempts to evade the genre, for they are not only void, but obvious; Incredibly enough, an alien from Hollywood, Angelo Rossitto, apparently plays an alien in the chest but finally beneficent! <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a Western ensemble than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish hue similar to that of the sun and its inhabitants are "human gourmets" (delicacies on the menu include Skin and Tonic, Scots on the Rocks, Thigh Pie, Alaskan Baked, etc.), not to mention a bunch of bikers who serve their own deity (Harley Davidson) and when our heroes escape from behind, they dare not shoot at them, for fear of hitting their "Lord". God (frightful) indeed ...
