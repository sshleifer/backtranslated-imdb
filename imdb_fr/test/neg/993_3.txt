The "head" of the monkeys is one of those particular phenomena that I noticed: when something does not make sense, people try to read and give it great meanings, which is what its creator never wanted. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> The film is a Monkees show of consciousness floating in various sketches, occultations, stagings, etc., similar to those of their TV show. . But while the TV show was played to laugh, it seems to be played only for a sort of deep state, trippy, pseudo-intellectual that this kind of psychedelic imposes. In summary, it is the Monkees who do the same schtick, but now it "sensitizes" because the track of laughter is removed. There is not a point of humor or meaning to the whole thing; it only buzzes with colored lights. <br /> <br /> The music of "Head" should prove to anyone, without a shadow of a doubt, that the Monkees did not have the slightest talent for composition. The airs are mostly garbage; "Porpoise Song", which opens and closes the film, is the only one to be listened to. But the fact is that it was a Gerry Goffin-Carole King song, and although it's above average for the Monkees, it's below average by Goffin and King standards. It's like hearing one of Peter and Gordon's old songs that Paul McCartney wrote for them: you might think it's a very good song, but then you find out who composed it and you go consider it a disposable. Mike Nesmith's song may be passable, the rest is worthless. Davy Jones has, I guess, what the filmmakers imagined to be "the big number" in the photo, because it's the only song presented, As Show Biz, and not cut out in a film montage or a dream sequence, but she falls flat too because the song is not good. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I have always loved the Monkees, the film is a real disappointment. Of course, they were lousy, but they were so gay about it. <br /> <br /> They knew they were lousy and they were calm. But then, they became ambitious. In "Head", they actually joke about the fact that they are a product made of pop, but the truth is that they wanted something more. They wanted to be great musicians and were taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles, but something approaching. "Head" proves that they failed in all respects. 1 * of 4
