I saw this movie at Temple University. I can not imagine that anyone will ever see this movie in a theater (screened on film). The acting game is similar to Saved By The Bell. The plot is simple and unimaginative. The soundman likes the sound of wind and the DP needs a light meter. Vampires, Vampires, Vampires. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money.
