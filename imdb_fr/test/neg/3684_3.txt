The door of hell opened under Moscow. A priest, played by Vincent Gallo, goes to the city looking for a friend who has disappeared from the tunnels under the city to find the front door. Wandering underground, he and his colleagues have to face the inhabitants of the tunnels, human and demonic. A good idea with a good distribution of second level actors goes nowhere like the tunnels in which it is located. I've looked at it twice now and I still do not know why it's supposed to be scary when there's not much going on, otherwise people are talking about the evil and we're seeing shadows. Nothing is clear and honestly, I did not understand the purpose. Give a pay check to the people involved (the second billed, Val Kilmer, is in some ephemeral scenes that do not allow him to leave as in the film.) The idea is really good, the performance is good, the scenario do not go anywhere. Follow the advice of several characters in the film and do not cross the river to see this.
