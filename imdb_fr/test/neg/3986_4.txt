The poor Shirley MacLaine tries to give a little gravity to this film of "well-being" which raises improvidence, but she is trampled by the fugitive sentimentality of a film which is not at all anchored in the reality. <br /> <br /> This was done by Curtis Hanson? Had he had a lobotomy since the last time we heard from him? Hanson can make an effective comedy drama, as evidenced by "Wonder Boys". So, I do not know what happened to him here. This is the kind of film that does not want to accept that life is chaotic and capricious, and that neat and orderly ends (as implausible as they may be) could be a nice closure plan, but look totally wrong. if people watch the movie has nothing to do with what the characters in the movie go through. <br /> <br /> My wife and I created the game of recalling plot points before they happen - for example, "The old man is going to teach him to read and then fall dead." . " Bingo! It's one of those movies where characters make short speeches summarizing their emotional problems, which makes them wonder why they still have emotional problems if they are aware of what's causing them. Toni Collette (an excellent actress, by the way, and one of my favorites if I do not work a lot here), explains very early why she buys so many shoes and never wears them, flashing neon spelling the pattern of clumsy connection of the film. At that time, I knew what I had to do and the movie was a downward spiral from there. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
