You see a movie called "combat space", what will you think? Battles in space with great explosions and everyone is shooting at each other. What do you get with this movie? Well, you get a bit of goodness in the space battle, but for the vast majority of the time, they're just stupid wanderers who do almost nothing. No one is speaking !!!! What is this nonsense ?! We have a narrator and a ton of British computers, but that's about it. The main protagonist must be the worst I have ever seen, as she does not even have a dialogue or sleepwalk (although literally!). Some things that happen are just stupid, as if they were using a rocket (like going into space) as a transport base, why not just use one of these awesome spaceships? In any case, the music is almost non-existent, with some boring and lifeless samples, but the main thing you'll notice is the Atari sound effects used by the ships ... you make fun of me. I can also say that the budget was low, because everything looks wrong, which is not what you would expect from a movie, especially what should be a super cool space battle movie . I seriously think that the budget had to be double-digit, it's so bad, making you laugh more than you should how flagrant it is. I'm starting to think that they paid the actors based on their dialogue, because there are very few of them here (if you do not already know, that's my main problem here, as I probably said three time already).
