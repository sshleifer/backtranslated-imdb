I watched the first 10 minutes and it bothered me to death. So, I'm moving quickly to the end. This film must be the worst of all in the category of low-budget science fiction movies so far. Bad acting, distribution, instructions, personalized imitation of Lara Craft, history, plot, everything! Throughout the movie, I think there may be only 6 to 7 people in the entire cast, but only two of them started in the movie. I was expecting something like the Starship Trooper, but it was nothing close. I got fooled by the title of the movie and the photo on the DVD cover. Do not waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. When you think about it, I wonder why they bothered to release movies as bad as this one?
