I should have known better ... the clues were everywhere on IMDB.com. This film was written and directed by the same guy who has no background. The cast is a group of unknowns with the possible exception of Joe Estevez who seems to specialize in bad movies. Etc. Suffice to say, I see no reason for anyone to want to see this terrible amateur attempt to make cinema. Turn on any broadcast channel at 3am and you'll see better movies. Said Nuff.
