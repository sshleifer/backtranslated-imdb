Nice idea to make Dionne Warwick sing for this film adaptation of Jacqueline Susann's bestseller (at the "Vallée des poupées") ... although it's a pity that this gluer does not have Patty Duke's Neely O'Hara to enrich the story. "The Love Machine" is incredibly dull. Even the last fight (with an Oscar as a combat accessory!) Can not save him. Dyan Cannon seems embalmed in his thick pancake makeup and his heavy fall (although his tiny tanned figure is a beauty to see), John Phillip Law is a block of wood in mind, David Hemmings embarrassing in gay mode as a flamboyant photographer. Where does Robin Stone go in the end? Does he go to the water's edge to fetch sailors? After Cannon has deflated his masculinity, it would be a safe bet. In this case, "Love Machine - The Final Episode" might have been a more interesting film. Certainly better than this drowsy sleep opera. * 1/2 of ****
