John Candy was really a comic actor. His death was a tragedy and we all miss him a lot, but WAGONS EAST, in which he plays the role of a wagon leader who agrees to send a group of pioneers into the wild west, is even sadder. I do not understand why it was even published. The story is useless and weak, and the jokes are not there. It saddens me even more than Candy's latest film is her worst movie of all time. So let's forget about all this and remember him in his best films such as SUMMER RENTAL, AIRCRAFT, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES and UNCLE BUCK. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5
