I met this film on a local television channel last night. Frankly, I have never heard of this movie before. I just lost track of Seagual's recent movies, because each of them is worse than the previous one. Here again, we have a dull Seagal, as if his girlfriend had insisted on making this film and he had accepted with force. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is less than zero and there is not a single aspect for which the film does not fall apart. I just do not know why Seagal made this movie. Dude, it's even worse than "Out for a kill"! If you watch this movie, you'll start feeling sorry for Seagal. He seems to lack ideas, enthusiasm and money. Avoid this movie and do something worthwhile.
