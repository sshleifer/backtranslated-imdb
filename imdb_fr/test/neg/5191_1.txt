Ewe, the opening screams budget zero. Titles that seem to look like my grandson have been released with iMovie. The DVD box gives the impression that you will be treated to the old cinema of the 80's. NAN! Virtually no nudity from a movie starring Traci Lords! This movie really needed nudity too. Instead, you get many perks of lords pointing through a shirt, but they seem to be activated by the hot steam. It's strange, in my world, the headlights light up in the COLD. <br /> <br /> The plot is pathetic, the blind guy is just a joke, and not a funny one. His antics are so forced and predictable. He stumbles on things and we see him getting ready for the fall. He needs to work on his physical comedy. <br /> <br /> Most of Frostbite's nudity comes from a hot tub scene that seems to have been shot months later and inserted to get a distributor. And nudity is not worth it. <br /> <br /> NamoiBucks; it's only a matter of time before Starbucks commits his pursuit. Not even funny. As Billy arrives in town for the first time, they meet Namoi Bucks. He comments: "Wow, they have them everywhere." This leads you to believe it's a parody of Starbucks, but surprise, behind the counter of this place is Namoi herself. Apparently, she loves coffee so much that the owner of this huge chain decided to work in a small cold town. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film has for him is Warren Miller's snowboard movie. Yeah, it's all about Warren, so if you want to see action, get a Warren Miller movie. Leave the frostbite alone. <br /> <br /> This film is not good. There is no reason to rent or buy it, and if a friend offers to lend you a copy for free. Hit him and end the friendship.
