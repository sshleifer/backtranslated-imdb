He borrowed scenes from LOTR, Matrix, Star Wars, etc. The humor is so dry, artificial and silly that you can not help but laugh from time to time at its inanity and the fact that you are watching it. Exactly what you expect from a HK comedy. The average person would enter with an IQ of 100 and leave with less than 80. Stephen Chow is an obvious omission from this movie. Humor would have worked better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this film is not as good as the original in Cantonese. The graphics are poor compared to his Hollywood counterparts. There is an excessive dependence on low quality CGs. My biggest complaint is his end. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the "Journey to the West" (JW), that this alternative explanation does not work well with the scenario. Despite its many flaws, this movie has a much greater entertainment value than Nicholas Tse's other film - The Promise.
