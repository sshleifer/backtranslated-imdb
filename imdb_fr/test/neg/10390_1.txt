Okay, normally, I do not add comments on the movies, but I finally watched a movie so full of bullshit and incompetent that I just had to warn people. The Blackwater Valley Exorcist speaks vaguely of a pedant / pederast / priest and this family of podunk monsters, and sums up the long story of the youngest girl who was molested by the priest but who is in love with the ranch hand hillbilly. Alongside a heroic god avoiding the Mexican gardener who once participated in an exorcism, the husband / pederast / priest manages to save the situation, but not before the demon owner is able to jump to a bitch that the sheriff from the city blew him up. . All in all, this movie is the biggest pile of useless (I could be very descriptive with this part, but why waste my energy for this movie) that I have never seen. All those involved in making this film must be sterilized so that they can not pollute the Earth with unnecessary spawning.
