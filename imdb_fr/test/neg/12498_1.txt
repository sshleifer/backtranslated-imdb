Oh dear! It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's incredibly repetitive; each scene seems to be composed of people who are shot, who run screaming or are kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very dull. It would not bother me if the fight was good, but it is not; the main character Phillips pushes the different morons with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stands at the sight of the Tracker, he is never touched, even if extras and minor characters are shot and exploded all around from him. I have rarely seen a group of actors worse (especially Don Wilson, if you can even call him an "actor") but it's not really surprising, given the dialogue with which they have to work (example line : "Computers killed my brother!"). The plot is a rip off of the excellent Terminator; special effects are laughable. Overall, this movie is absolutely horrible. And why does everything explode?
