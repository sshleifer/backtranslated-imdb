I could not wait to watch the Boondock Saints Brain Self Immunization documentary, one of the most frustrating and futile films I've ever seen. But the makers of "Overnight" - buddies (ex?) Of the brain in question - must also learn to make a movie. Various unsavory remarks, shouting obscenities on the phone and enjoying his alcohol make Mr. Duffy look like a putz. But that does not give any idea why the guy got a contract, what is his creative process or his vision - what is it about Boondock Saints? Is it difficult to meet Patrick Swayze? What are these strange institutional machinations in which our disgusting heroes are caught? Because the film does not try to answer these questions consistently, it does not have to say anything about Hollywood either. So, who cares?
