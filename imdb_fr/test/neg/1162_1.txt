I had this film for fifty cents at a sale in breach of contract. I want to get back my fifty cents. Bad acting, bad script, bad sense, historically inaccurate, even the sound of the film is awful. It is not the subject that offends. I am one of many to find that thrillers and real crime movies are very interesting. The subject could have been treated more seriously, with much more attention to detail and precision, and the lack of respect shown towards the victims and their devastated friends and family members is enough to enrage anyone. In addition, little attention was paid to what could have caused someone to adopt the strange behavior that Ed Gein displayed in staging these horrible crimes. <br /> <br /> Save your time and mental health. Do not watch this horrible film. If you bought it, you have my sympathy. It's not a total loss however ... you can discard and use the plastic case!
