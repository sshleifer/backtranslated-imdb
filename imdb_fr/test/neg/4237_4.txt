The premise of the film was valuable, however, despite the novelty of models selling someone else's furniture to live the high life, this film has nothing. The characters are cardboard. The dialogue is so painfully written that it's hard to stay back and if there were jokes in the movie, I missed them. Marilyn Monroe walking in the walls because she does not want to wear glasses is completely amazing and not funny. The stupidity of Grable is also too hard to believe. Bacall's search for gold is so forced that it's annoying to listen. Why would anyone want to sit on top of me?
