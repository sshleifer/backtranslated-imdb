It was by far the worst movie I have ever seen! My husband and I own more than 600 DVDs, most of which are B-Movies sci-fi and horror movies that are not top notch but entertaining. Dracula 300 had absolutely no redemptive quality! The writing was horrible and the acting game even worse. It took us 3 attempts to cover the entire movie because we could only tolerate it in 30-minute intervals. Surely we thought it had to get better ... we were wrong. I would rather watch a corpse being embalmed than having to sit on it again !!! When that was over, my husband and I looked at each other like, "Uh ... right?" The end seemed to be supposed to be longer, but they exceeded their apparent budget of $ 500.00 and were like "Oh, shit ... we're broke ... let's finish it now ... fast ..." ... credit!"
