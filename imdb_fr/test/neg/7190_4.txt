OK, everyone is so excited about this movie that I hardly dare to add a negative review, but I just did not like it. <br /> <br /> I must first say that I saw the movie in overdub in Russian language, so I will have missed a little dialogue, but not much. <br /> <br /> Pretty things first. There are hilarious moments (the Elvis simulator for example). The actors seem well melted, as well as the Russians. Efremova is great and Goldblum is very good. Which brings us to the disadvantages of this film. First of all. There is virtually no story and we already know the ending: Yeltsin wins. So no drama or suspense. They tried to solve this problem by creating a new relationship between the actors mentioned above, but this story has somehow evaporated. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, the film does not represent reality. The Russians at the level of politics and society described in this film are not funny, they represent a serious and dangerous fate. I'm willing to believe that having used forensic doctors in the United States helped Yeltsin win his campaign, but the real interesting questions are: Who funded the campaign, what did In return, how was the opposition managed for the distribution of certain advertisements? <br /> <br /> So here we have a film based on reality (but strangely avoiding everything that could make it historically relevant, or simply a very good political thriller) without intrigue or subplot.
