I found this movie at the flea market for cheap. I was so excited because I thought it was a skateboard movie. I went home, the rules of preview and the opening scene with the old man rolling in the street on a skateboard were great. At that time, I realized it was a post-apocalyptic film, but I still had high hopes. This film was awful. One of my friends was stunned when we looked at him and even thought it was awful and a loss to be high. I kept falling asleep during the movie because it was so boring and the music was awful. I do not know if, during the apocalypse, all the good music and all the music that is only a kind of shit is destroyed and everyone's memory of how to play it is erased, but I think I would prefer to die than to endure this bullshit. And what happened with the TV studio? I can only assume that this film was adapted from an old Greek play, with the names and title, but some pieces are not designed to fit a futuristic sci-fi setting. Or at least not by the people involved in this movie. If you have to watch this movie, I can only suggest bringing a gun and ending before the end. It would be a good movie to kill yourself too, everyone will understand why.
