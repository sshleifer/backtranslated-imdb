When a losing teenager gets bitten by an insect, he becomes the Dragonfly superhero ... <br /> <br /> The Superhero movie is the last parody film to appear on the screens. Unfortunately, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved in the films Airplane !, Top Secret and The Naked Gun), he still suffers the fault that the latest spoofs have recently ... it's especially stupid that amusing ! The fault lies mainly with gags. It's just not funny enough. Some of the jokes work, like the nail gun scene, but other parts fall flat. The X-men for example, or the whole sequence. Blazing saddles It's not! One of the key elements of the best spoof films, like Airplane, is that while the dialogue is extremely entertaining, the cast is largely completely straight. This makes it even more funny. Even if there is a simple dialogue in the foreground, there may be some fun things behind the cast. Still funny. The other key element is that they all have some kind of intrigue on which they can suspend their gags. <br /> <br /> The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from different movies, SO to try to imitate them. As a result, the so-called plot of these films exists very rarely. Another flaw in these films is that some of the scenes were really funny in the original versions, and in most cases even more funny than the parodic scene! The actors try to get into the required spirit, but with a lot of dialogue and funny scenes, it's hard to get excited about it. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as Epic Movie to leave recently. , Date Movie or the awful Meet The Spartans, but since some of the people involved here have made good fun movies in the past, it's not nearly enough.
