This show makes me (and many others) hate their lives. Let's face it, Zoey is perfect. she is pretty bland, has good grades, everyone asks her advice, she is popular, she goes to a fantastic school with extraordinary rooms. Why I gave this show a 3: 1. The acting is horrible. Sometimes, I just want to hurt people who have put these actresses without talent (especially Victoria Justice) on television. 2. The characters are incredible and incompatible. You have your typical popular girl. An energetic, superficial, stupid, stereotyped girl, who is described by a horrible actress. Then you have a typical jock guy who is a bit normal and really nice. Then the stereotypical intelligent girl who is a monster and obviously does not fit his perfect folk friends. Then a nice, rich and stuck boy who would be happier looking in a mirror all day. Then you want to be an actress who is played by another stinking actress. And finally a normal nerd guy. 3. The plot is boring and lame. 4. I hate how much these characters are spoiled. Can not they just be normal! 5. Everything is perfect for them and we are all aware of the stench of our lives.
