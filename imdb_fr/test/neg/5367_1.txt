There is really no redeeming factor about this show. To put it simply, it's just terrible. Absolutely terrible. It's just a terrible reality show. Not only that, it's a dreadful fiction. <br /> <br /> Imagine this: a group of imaginative teenagers get together one night and start a party "Hey, let's do a paranormal show like" Ghost Hunters "and everything!" So they grab a camera, harass residents and film random landscapes behind a monologue painfully tempting to be dramatic, but failing. This show is essentially a bunch of teenagers who run with a home theater camera trying to make a very bad horror documentary. The only difference is that this show actually has a budget and writers. A lost budget and terrible writers. <br /> <br /> Oh, problems, how can I count you? First, let's talk about this on a personal level. I am not totally skeptical about the paranormal. I'm willing to believe what is paranormal and what is not, and I'm sure there are many people who feel the same way. So, if you want to do a show on the paranormal, you have to convince the viewer that what he sees is paranormal or not because he can easily believe the opposite. I hate to compare, but I do not see why not at this point. Take "ghost hunters" for example. In "Ghost Hunters", you can say that the cast is leveled with the audience. They are not totally skeptical, but they are always willing to keep in mind the possibility of paranormal abnormalities. They have to look at something and be ready to say "it's possible it's nothing at all". And with that in mind, they tried to prove that they were wrong. They use technology and several other gadgets with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal, taking into account that what they watch may have nothing in mind. Not only do they try to convince themselves of what is real and what is not, they try to convince you at the same time. This element of doubt is not present in the "paranormal state". Hit one. <br /> <br /> In "Paranormal State", the cast simply says "there is this sinister place, and it's HAUNTED, so we'll find SPIRITS!" And right now, you know and you say, "Okay, convince me otherwise." The actors are not professional in their interviews. In fact, it sometimes seems that they are only harassing local residents in these so-called "haunted" areas. Apart from the assumptions and theories, they have no concrete evidence to support their claims. The best they can do is someone who "pretends" to be able to contact the dead, without anyone telling who that person is and what their real value is. . They could have easily picked a random person on the street and told him "pretend that you can contact the spirits for our show" and go there. In the episode "Mothman", this happens. Without any convincing proof towards the end of the series, they bring this kind of individual into a random and painfully "scripted" reading of a supposed "haunting" zone in order to convince his audience. Very very very weak effort. I think one of the main problems of the series is that it feels scripted. During one of the episodes, the cast is attacked by one of these "paranormal abnormalities", sometimes in an attempt to be dramatic. This kind of dramatic sequence would make skeptics laugh and even those on the fence realize that what they are looking at is just a pile of hectic garbage. If the goal of the series was to try to convince his audience that these "paranormal" events are real, he does a horribly poor job. Hit two. <br /> <br /> However, there is always the meter. One last point of view to see if the show is really worth something. What if the show did not try to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are simply trying to entertain you with good fiction? It fails even at this level too. If the creators of the series were trying to create fiction to entertain her audience, the writing is too mediocre and, even at the level of fiction, she fails to convince the audience that the members of her cast really know the story. unknown in all its horrible glory. The writing is just not convincing and even, dare I say, boring. Hit three. <br /> <br /> There are only a lot of teenagers who are too eager or too gullible to believe in the paranormal, simply because it's just a lot more amazing than the reality, who left with a camera, a bad scenario and bad actors to do in general a very bad horror documentary. That's all the show is at this point. There is no reason to see it, not even for the entertainment factor, and there is no reason to worry about it. To be honest, it's lame. There is absolutely no redeeming factor about this show.
