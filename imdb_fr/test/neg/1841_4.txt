Do not agree with people who say it's an ugly horror film with good acting and camera work - I would say it's an acceptable horror film. to waste your time with this trash. The main idea behind the film is rather original, given the abundance of fear frights based on deadly dolls that have been imposed over the years; Unfortunately, the story is treated with all the subtlety of Michael Bay's last actor, with a host of characters that are uniformly implausible and played with perfect precision by actors who are presumably on the Korean soap opera. It's not scary and it just calms your expectations for the upcoming Korean horror movie. Never mind.
