Dear SciFi Channel: How are you? How was your summer? I'm fine, but I feel that our relationship is no longer the same and we separate. I do not understand why you do not love me anymore. I just finished watching your original "Skeleton Man" on your SciFi channel and, again, you showed a blatant disrespect for my feelings by killing every hot girl in this movie !!! I mean, I understand you're right there for instant gratification. All that matters to you is to produce a movie where people are cut in pieces by a legendary spirit / creature / legend / Indian. So, you really do not have the time to think and make an effort in something else - like finding a costume for Skeleton Man that does not make him like the Skeletor gay lover of "He-Man". Seriously, his dress looks like a satin blanket and his skull is as smooth as a baby's, he looks almost like a killer Halloween costume for a six year old while walking in the desert on a unleashed murderer. So we're throwing you a bone, because we're not looking for award-winning performances, intriguing intrigues, or realistic character reactions to situations. Because we realize that even though Michael Rooker, Caspar van Diem and all the girls are supposed to be special operations agents, they are all mysteriously transformed into Keystone Kops who can not shoot or see from the front when Skeleton Man appears. And we also fully expect that nothing - bullets, explosions, electrocution, nothing - can kill Skeleton Man as long as there's only a minute left in the film and we need to find a way to tidy up everything. We expect to see blood and guts. But you have the knack for taking the least alluring actress in the entire cast and making her the only woman to have survived. And very honestly, I think you're just doing it to annoy me. Because this film, as silly as it is, has the potential to be a classic of the genre "too bad, it's good" and the slaughter of all beauties spoils everything - and forces me to lower its rating. All I ask is that once, only once, you take into account my feelings and let the sexiest girls survive the movie. Please.
