I will not spoil it for you. Although you do not care, it has been spoiled (you'll know what I mean after watching it). Bad story. Grade B film quality Typical horror - stupid situations - rare timing. I should know, when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add "quotes". Just told me that the movie bombed big time. And they are trying to attract everyone just so they can pay their way to make this bomb. I wish I could take the time I spent watching this. I was stupid and thought there must be something great around the corner. But I continued to let myself down. I usually do not waste my time adding comments to a movie. In fact, this is my second post. I thought I might be able to save you from wasting money on something that is causing a lot of hype.
