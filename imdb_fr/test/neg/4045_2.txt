If you want to see how to destroy a movie, study it very closely. In fact, it's so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone. Note in particular how much of the scenes appear to be assembled in about 5 minutes. Realism escapes this film at all levels. The general impression is that someone has received a lower-than-average scenario, up-and-coming actors, an average director and absolutely no budget. With a formula like that, he had to be sentenced. <br /> <br /> I rented it once and I swear I became stupid looking at it. If you are a humanitarian, buy this horrible and horrible movie, and burn it UNEXPECTED- as a favor to the world. He has no discernable plot, bad acting, and then adds something about ugly and mean women, just to hide the whole thing. I would suggest watching the paint dry before this stupid waste of duct tape! Seriously. The painting would be better. I wish I could give this negative 10 stars.
