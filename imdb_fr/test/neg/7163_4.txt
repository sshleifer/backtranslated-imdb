This is a classic example of how Hollywood does not trust moviegoers and has not fallen for its stars. Christian's character is completely rewritten, the anti-Semitism that Noah faces his own army unit is virtually eliminated, Michael's story is significantly changed and the end result is to decimate power and terrible beauty of the book. I would have loved not to have seen it, because of the ability of movies (sounds and images) to resonate so powerfully in your brain; I would have preferred to stay with the printing of the book. The book could have been written today, it is honest and courageous. The film, either. My advice: PASS the film; Read the book.
