This film is supposed to be about the frustrations of making a movie. It certainly frustrated me with his endless boredom. The setting is a pretty Spanish seaside resort with its usual large distribution. The script is very badly written or maybe there was none. Quite ad-lib. <br /> <br /> A much better film about the frustrations of making a film is Fran√ßois Truffaut's "Day For Night", made in 1973. It shows all the delays and how the cast can behave badly. way. This does not bother the viewer and you gain sympathy for the director who has to sort of finish the film.
