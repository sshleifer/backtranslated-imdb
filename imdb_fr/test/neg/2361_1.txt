I can not believe that this atrocity was able to capture the hearts and minds of a representative sample of the "bright young people" of his day, but I'm sure I would have liked it not to be. In my opinion, it is a piece of gumpf inaccurate, misinterpreted, poorly scripted and directed with pretension. The short outings in an imagined reality show all humor to death. Situations are subtle exaggerations that make already fragile characters even more unbelievable and unbelievable. The romance is dull, the end is unsatisfactory and ruins the film's only reasonable drug message and the simple plot ("Withnail and I", "Fear and Loathing") is put to the test with the motionless motion of the film. In short, this film is a flagrant visual assault, without any skill or initiative. I condemn him to the ashes of history and pray that he will stay there.
