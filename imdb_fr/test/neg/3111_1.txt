I bought this film for about $ 2.5 at a local flea market. I thought that with the cast in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe and Mario Van Peebles all agree), it would be really good. Boy, I was wrong. This film pissed me off. Almost all the scenes drag on. The scene where Rob Lowe watches this girl sing and dance in a hard bar forever! It was one of the worst scenes I have ever seen in a movie. The rest is not a picnic either. I imagine that when they finished the film, they only had 30 minutes of film, so they extended all 3 times longer. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: the current rating of 1.9 attributed to imdb is accurate. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Go watch the paint dry for an hour and a half instead of looking at it! <br /> <br /> If you want to see better films made by this director, watch 'Mean Guns' (with Christopher Lambert & Ice-T) or 'Postmortem' (with Charlie Sheen) instead.
