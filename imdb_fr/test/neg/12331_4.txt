What about this movie? A married couple has more than just one another. After playing for a while, things get more serious. A difficult choice must be made: continue the old situation or start all over again by following the heart. Guess what happens at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be very small budget. But a good story does not have to be expensive. It looks like a piece that has been converted to a movie only by using several inexpensive places (at least very few other visible people) more than the stage, in this one home. From the first minute, future developments are clear like water. Nothing unexpected happens. Sometimes you can think of watching a soft porn movie, in which case you know beforehand that there is no story. <br /> <br /> I find this film disappointing, which explains the vote (4).
