Looking at the trailer, the movie looked pretty interesting. The production of the film is also very good - it looks like they have a good budget and they do not look like a cheap film made. The acting game goes from good (Joe Morton as Simon teacher) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) to bad (James Haven as Don). <br /> <br /> The content and plot of the film are weak. The film begins as if it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed, unfortunately boring turn. Watching the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes of the film would have made this movie OK but everything else makes it an absolutely boring movie to watch. It's as if they had made a short film and then tried to force it to last more than an hour by stuffing the middle of an hour of filler material. <br /> <br /> If you want to lose a good hour and a half, life, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay away from this extremely boring movie.
