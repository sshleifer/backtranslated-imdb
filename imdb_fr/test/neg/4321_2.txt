I can not believe I sat through this whole movie. A friend praised him because the jacket made him look good. In defense, the jacket was correct; there was a supposed haunted room in which someone slept at night. From the jacket, it looked like it was tied with Freddy, Jason or maybe "The Shining". It could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of minimalist and / or surrealist films, you will be able to enjoy it. If you're looking for a good movie of dread or thrill, rent Jason vs Freddy IV - you'll have a better night.
