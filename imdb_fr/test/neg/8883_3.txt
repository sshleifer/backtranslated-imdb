I may have missed something, but I found that GOYA'S FANTOMS were a tedious costume melodrama. As for the story he was trying to tell, I found a confused mishmash that went off in all directions. And perhaps it should have been directed by a Spanish director with the appropriate subtitled languages ​​rather than in an unconvincingly accentuated English. I can not judge the historical veracity of the story, but it seemed to follow the same scenario as a "tragic scenario of the fate of an artist model" similar to GIRL WITH EARRING. Was the film a commentary on the religious injustices of the Inquisition, the false piety, the torture of yesterday and today, or what? I never seemed to be able to understand that. The different characters of Natalie Portman also seemed ridiculously stereotyped. And finally, the film was crowned by the final melodrama of the head and body of a disheveled Bardem, hanging on the edge of the wagon that was heading towards the sunset - followed by Ines and Goya ???? only that?
