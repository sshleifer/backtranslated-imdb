'This Life' is really as bad as possible. Its distribution of mercenary, lascivious, ruthless, duplicates and superficial characters is intended to reflect the frame of its post-80 and I must admit in this regard that it is an exact creation. Unfortunately, this leaves me with nothing to sympathize or heal and I consider this as an additional step towards the payphone on pay TV in the scams; surprisingly bad, cheap, reality and television saturated with "celebrities"; and other anarchistic attitudes that destroyed this media and, indeed, a large part of British society. This seems exaggerated? I do not think it is. In this respect, programs such as "This Life" have been as influential as they are often called.
