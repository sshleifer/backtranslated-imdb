This film tries to be more than it is. First of all, the acting is horrible. You have to overcome the problems of transmission of lines and terrible emissions. The plot is pretty interesting. A sinking occurs (apparently because it was made of string and balsa wood), and two or three guys are on the ground. If that were not enough, some of the name of Count de Sade also lives there. He lives in fear of pirates and has gone completely mad. In any case, he has a big slave, a young woman and some dogs. There is another woman who does not speak and her wife, who is a leper. Anyway, things are not going well because these men have to take care of this business. He is arrogant and likes to pose and deliver lines. The rest of the movie involves an escape attempt. It has an ironic end that I will not reveal and it saves the film somehow. I would not mind if I was you.
