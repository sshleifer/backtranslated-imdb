... when dubbed in another language. Let's face it: Ni Nien and Schwarzenegger are really good actors in dialogue. And given the camp lines they are supposed to say, the situation is vague. Any type of voiceover is an improvement (and it is indeed the case - at least in the German version). <br /> <br /> But this is only a minor point. The acting is bad. Accelerated combat sequences are pathetic. Nielsen could not use his sword to get out of a wet paper bag. This becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of movement presented by the kid (who had a background in martial arts, no doubt) and the athleticism demonstrated by Sandahl Bergman. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger does his Conan thing - nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Some of the visuals are nice, I'll have to give it to you. The Dragon Skeleton Bridge looks cool. But most often, plaster is too obvious. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is not worth seeing. Even 'Conan the Destroyer' is better than that (although marginally). I would have seen Bergman played by Red Sonja much better than she was supposed to be, but I doubt it could have saved this movie - too bad. <br /> <br /> 3/10
