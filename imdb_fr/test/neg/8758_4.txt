Oh, horror! I've seen LOTS of gore movies during my day, but this one just makes me laugh rather than repugnance. I would add that it's a crazy movie, but if you manage to look beyond cheap audio, horrible dialogues, ugly girls, fake gore scenes, and the overall persistence of the movie, you may find some entertainment in this movie. The story tells the story of a cat killer who makes a murderous party every "5 days, from the 5th month of the 5th year" (wow, what an originality), up to two detectives (one of whom makes a brave effort to try to make the dialogue crapy good) to stop the bloody rampage of the killer. The scenes of massacres (made with a plastic knife for toys) are quite brutal (which is a good thing), but very annoying because of the constant repetition of a clearly recorded cry (which pierces very loudly the ears). As for the gore, there are many but it looks very wrong; especially blood-mec, come on, purple blood? But, if you're a fan of gore videos, like me, you'll find in this video something to cherish as I did (the detective talking about shit ... he's the best thing to do for this movie) . Apart from that, all you will find is a senseless nudity band (which is also a good thing, but a pity the girls are whimsical) and a naughty necrophile serial killer. Sorry, but this one is bad.
