I have never been a big fan of Larry Clark, but I have been dragged into almost all his films. Now, I like independent movies, and I grew up a lot in punk rock, and I would like to say that this film is disappointing for both audiences. All punk songs do not include "Oi!" as in the case of this particular film. <br /> <br /> But the real problem of this film is that it changes atmosphere every fifteen minutes and lacks any cohesion. Clark makes a living claiming that her fictionalized stories are "how kids really are," and as such, you'll allow her stupid, ten-minute dialogue scenes that lead nowhere, because that's what the movies are about. even will do. However, when he turns a ridiculous death scene (choose one, aside from the drive-by), the too stylized attempts of what I presume to be black humor are completely out of context, ridiculously successful (in the most cases). much worse than a student movie) and absolutely ridiculous in terms of history. John Cassavettes and "Date Movie" are bad bedfellows, because the incursions in this last style make you come out of any kind of reality to remind you that you are watching a movie - a very, very bad thing about that.
