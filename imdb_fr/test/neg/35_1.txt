Maniratnam, who in India is often compared to great filmmakers around the world and is considered a film genius, proved once again that he could only make frames visually pleasing, without giving food for thought. pure cinema pleasure that can be drawn from cinema as a very old art form. <br /> <br /> Although I do not want to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful films made around the world, still nothing serious and a film buff a bit educated can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenious plots, do not contain persistent effects thereafter and contain mostly a ridiculous end and MUCH of melodrama, seen in profusion in Indian films. <br /> <br />, Maniratnam has successfully confirmed my disgust for his films. <br /> <br /> Sorry for those who, on this forum, claimed the opposite. My suggestion is this: LOOK AT A FEW CINEMAS ACHIEVED IN THE WORLD.
