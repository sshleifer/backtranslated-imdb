How could they have taken such a beautifully animated jewel like Don Bluth's All All Dogs to go to heaven and bastardize him with a suite devoid of charm, cheese and uninspired. The haunting music and the charming characters have disappeared, now replaced by a rowdy animation and an unimaginative plot. <br /> <br /> Pros: Charlie Sheen is sometimes amusing like Charlie, but he lacks the charming tough-guy attitude that brought him to Burt Reynolds' life. I especially enjoyed the songs "I'll always be with you" and "It's too heavenly here". <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: There seems to be no connection between this and the original. At first, Charlie is a friend with Carface, but wait a minute. Was not the same character responsible for the murder of Charlie and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved? I guess everything changes in paradise but why is not Anne-Marie even mentioned? If Itchy goes to heaven, Flo and Killer would not they too? What about the voice of Annabelle the whippet? In the original, it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel, it looked like a whiny parrot. The new characters are not so good (except Sasha). And the animation is better compared to a generic Saturday morning cartoon. The constant "humor" of cartoony is flat and not funny and the "heart" just does not work compared to the original, which had a touch as subtle and moving that makes me cry every time. <br /> <br /> All Go to Heaven dogs is one of my favorite movies of all time. The way Don Bluth allowed this sequel to be done is beyond me. <br /> <br /> LOWER SUMMARY: All suites do not go to heaven.
