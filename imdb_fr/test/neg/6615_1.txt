It's obvious that ESPN drools every time Knight is in the news, but should they make a movie about him? It was the worst attempt of a serious drama I have ever seen. There was everything: dreadful actor, dreadful dialogue, ridiculous casting, inexpensive sets, and so on. Cummon, what's up with the game scenes? Were they in a college gym? And the lighting, well, let me just say it was ridiculous. And Brian Denehy in the role of Bob Knight? Leave me alone. Denehey looked like ... Denehy in red sweater, nothing more. ESPN lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt. They spent millions of dollars on advertising, and then the Prime Minister was a huge disappointment. Bob Knight is not a subject that can be covered by a two-hour movie. ESPN blew it. Even Knight thought it was more stupid than anything else.
