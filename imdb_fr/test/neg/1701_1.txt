I just watched this "latest" version of Macbeth and was pleasantly surprised by the solid and obvious action that was to turn a low-budget historical piece into a full-fledged movie. <br /> <br /> One note however, the music was very lame and added nothing to the intensity of the film and looked like a person with a keyboard and a group of samplers, as opposed to a complete orchestral score. I think Paul Farrer needs to get by !!!
