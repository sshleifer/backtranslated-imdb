Spoilers abound. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed, because this is my first film STREET FIGHTER that I have ever seen (I do not dare to approach the joke of 1994). Very little attracts your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) as opposed to most japanimation. The fighting is hilariously overboard (Shun vs. Zangief was a mocker) and the dramatization is far too dark, especially at the end when Ryu must control everything in his fight against his brother. <br /> <br /> The main street fighter, Ryu, was weakening to become a much darker version inside himself. The frustrations of controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A street fighting tournament takes place in the promoter's mind. <br /> <br /> What about drawing the feet of the artist? Any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. The sweet nature of the story makes the STREET FIGHTER genre far too intelligent and puts much more emphasis on a character (Shun), who is not even a fighter in the video game! A character study on more than STREET FIGHTER's core stars is completely ignored. How many times have you caught Rolento? Adon? Guys? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the imagination of the video game.
