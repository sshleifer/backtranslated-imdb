I did not know where it was going before the end. when it turned out to be a liberal conspiracy to deliver the world to European impostures and the UN. What a load of crud right! Incidentally, the fact that Canada has joined the United States has little to do with conspiracy and the idea has never been developed. The only important point seems to be that this allowed the main character to run for president (but they could have made him American and do without that). Anyway, it was a bull charge that was not worth it. If you do not want to see this kind of thing do well, take a look at the brilliant political thriller of the BBC "State of Play".
