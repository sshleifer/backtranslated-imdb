Ugh, bad, bad, but I've seen worse, that's why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. I just finished watching this movie and I thought it was about as dirty as the flesh on Dr. Chopper's face. The worst replica of the movie should be "I like to introduce you to someone ... meet my inner heart", which consisted of a lonely survivor of the fantastic group of 5 people throwing a bin on Dr. Chopper and then collapsing The scene . Second worst line, "I am the park ranger who will fuck you in the air" What, this monster is not even a cop ????? Did anyone else notice how everyone dies instantly from the magic dagger (no one dies so fast of a dagger, I know I often see him in the operating room), at the except the super park ranger. The guy had a bucket of blood flowing through the wound, twisted it on the ground, and then finally reached the final fire on Dr. Chopper while the inside of the body melted with trembling. And if that does not work out, he does not even have the decency to die like everyone else. Inner b * ch helps her to limp outside and orders her not to die while she seeks help because he is like her only friend left alive now. Since when did they become friends? I do not think a frantic meeting in the woods where he tells you to head to the city can be seen as an opportunity to know your time, but it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Watch this film only if there is nothing else to it and you have nothing to do with your time.
