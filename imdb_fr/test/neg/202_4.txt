It looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, right? And a $ 42 million robbery - it sounds like a dreaded detective movie. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment - I think the stars have had all the money needed because the production values ​​are mediocre. <br /> <br /> But more than that, it is the pseudo tank that reigns in the atmosphere of dogs when the easy crime goes wrong. It's really made for TV. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's extremely disappointing - it scores points for what it is - but loses it massively because it is, frankly, not very interesting at all ...
