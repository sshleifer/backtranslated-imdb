I am quite amazed at how much "the man of the cemetery" is overestimated by horror fans! Now I'm used to receiving movies that mix two or more genre styles and I love just about every zombie comedy I've ever seen. To my dismay, this Italian cult-classic did not really show me much ... It follows the unusual tasks of a full-time graveyard guardian and his belated son-child, Curly Joe attending the research, because they seem to get rid mainly of the recently deceased people who came out of the soil seven days after their initial death. He meets a widow who "moves" in a terrifying atmosphere and quickly discovers a relationship. Soon he is sleeping with her on the grave of her deceased husband. The corpse of the husband comes alive and bites her, triggering a series of events that seem to consume the rest of the film. "Cemetery Man" tries to incorporate all possible elements, such as horror, romance, comedy, action and completely fails in the long run. He walks, never being able to focus on an aspect long enough to make it interesting, such as the report of his crooked sidekick with a live cut head, a motorcycle zombie coming out of the ground, the main character deciding to shoot people at random on the sidewalk, etc. This thing is so complicated and dull that it's almost impossible to take it seriously. Of course, it is elegant and often "elegant", but even the most "artistic" type of film needs the right kind of lineage to make sense of it. "Cemetery Man" progresses, seeming unable to focus on anything for more than a few minutes, which becomes very tiring after a while. People argue that "it's a more sophisticated zombie movie". Frankly, when it comes to zombies, I do not want anything more "sophisticated" than Romero ... There's a bit of gore and nudity - mostly in scenes where he wants to play a "horror movie" but not enough to compensate for its lack of structure without compromise. Terrible film.
