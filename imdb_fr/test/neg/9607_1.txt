As a parent of two girls (14 and 11 years old), I have serious doubts about this show and all the programs for tweens. First, I am always amazed that the living conditions of Drake / Josh, Zac / Cody, Hanna, Carly, Derek, Sunny, etc. always make most houses tiny and narrow. Most people work hard all day to pay for housing the size of which is less than half the size of these shows, but no one comes or goes from work, does not pay for utilities, or rent, or mortgage or insurance, cleaning, sweeping, changing bulbs, repairing toilets, etc. You just have to go in and out (and down the wide, ubiquitous steps that only exist on TVs) to make jokes (most of which involve lies and hilarious results) and avoidance work. I think that the children who look at them will have unrealistic expectations about the hardness of their work and the richness of their lives. Second, there is never an intact family, always a mom or a dad but never both, who always go to sexless appointments but never seem to have the inconveniences of a divorce (alimony, support, arguments ). Again, children may have the impression that if the father and mother get divorced, we have fun (in fact, parents are not often present if it helps the plot). Needless to say, there is no mention of spirituality (forget a specific religion). Finally, there is a theme that troubles me. There are "nerds" who are good at school, good "jocks" in the sport, "goody two shoes" too. The protagonists are not good at school, sports, or charity, but do foolish things about those who are. The message is that you do not have to be good at anything, just be one of the "nothings" that mingle with jokes. Needless to say, I give a zero to all these shows, turn them off all the time, and close to banning them at home.
