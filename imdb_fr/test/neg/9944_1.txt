It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is supposed to be a remake or update of Chang Cheh's "One-armed Swordsman". Punched direction and shitty choreography mean that the fight scenes are not worth watching. The screenplay tries desperately to sound serious, but it is full of clich√©s like "And I knew then that nothing would ever be like before ..." or "If only I had known what a heavy price I should pay." Ugh! And who is this girl who plays Sing? Someone finds it and eliminates it !! She is awful. If you like Chinese martial arts movies, you better do Lau Gar Leung. It stinks.
