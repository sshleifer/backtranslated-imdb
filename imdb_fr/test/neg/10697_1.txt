This piece of shit is actually the BOMB, as in Bottom of the Barrel. I can not know which one is the worst. The lackluster representation of Norris' anonymity (not a remarkable trait in a protagonist of the action) or Christopher Neame's hysterical outbidding. This film does not deliver at any level whatsoever. The action sequences are tamed, the plot is very thin and the scenes supposed to be horrible look like a shot of the fifties. You can not just fill the room with smoke and men in rubber suits and expect the audience to scream in terror. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film does nothing for me. It actually looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn movie and a Miami Vice scam with some spell-Hell. No wait. It should have been yawning infernal.
