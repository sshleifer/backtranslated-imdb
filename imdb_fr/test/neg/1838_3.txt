I was looking forward to this film because everyone was talking about it as a good horror film and finally a European film. So, maybe my expectations were too big. <br /> <br /> It starts with a good horror / shock sequence, but you immediately fall into the following scenes, where the plot begins to be introduced, the motivation / life of the characters is not better than any drama "made for television". It stays that way until the end. <br /> <br /> Regarding the horror part of the movie, it's certainly a good idea and a different idea, but ALL scenes are of the "seen before" type. <br /> <br /> Overall, my idea of ​​this movie was that it had a good concept, which was inserted into a mediocre story, bad behavior and less than tolerable intrigues. <br /> <br />
