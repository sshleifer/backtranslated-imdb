Sensational. I just saw Demon Wind a while ago, and I do not think I'll ever be the same. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, in fact. <br /> <br /> Never before has humanity seen such a change in make-up so gratuitous, for no reason. Or, in the same way, so many bad zombie makeup (?) That make you hungry for these green marshmallows. <br /> <br /> Or so old lady naked, by the way. But then there was "The Shining". <br /> <br /> The plot here is so amateurish that it holds almost a little charm, just like dialogue. The last shot of the movie is so dumb that its description is beyond. It's as if a drunk student meets with friends and decides to start the Bruce Willis dialogue with (I guess?) The teenybopper dialogue of an Elm Street movie. The result is shocking, and it would be really funny if that was what we meant. <br /> <br /> Ah, what is the good time? Anyway, I'm going to laugh. <br /> <br /> My God, gather with your friends and look at them. But make absolutely sure that you are drunk first. Or, you can go crazy. Especially if you are a film student. <br /> <br /> Hi.
