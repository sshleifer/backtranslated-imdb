Now, do not get me wrong, I love seeing half-naked girls squirming. This is part of the fun of a Moroccan restaurant: ogle the belly dancers. But that's not much of a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> My first major problem is music. I have the impression that when Ann Rice wrote "The Vampire Lestat", the Cure was more the style of the music he would have liked (although I could be wrong). I know that talking about the current "gothic" music may seem like a good idea, but they did a horrible job of integrating it. Lestat was an actor with probably a very good singing voice. The fact that they chose Jonathan Davis as a theatrical voice is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Secondly, someone else said: mixing two very complex books into one rotten film is a bad idea. "Lestat" could have been a movie in its own right, and a very good movie if it was well done. Honestly, I do not think "Queen of the Damned" is very good for a movie. Although I would like to see a film that incorporates a story of creation, there is too much to say, how to say that, "inaction" in the book to make it a very interesting movie. And the stories they actually did really messed it up. Now, notice it, it's been a long time since I've read it, I've always thought that "Lestat", "Tale of the Body Thief" and "Memnoch the Devil" were much more action packed and would have made better movies. /> <br /> I know many people (hey, myself) who like a lot of cheese vampire bullshit who thought it was absolutely the worst of its kind to be a major movie. I tend to agree with them there. Aaliyah, however, had a beautiful body.
