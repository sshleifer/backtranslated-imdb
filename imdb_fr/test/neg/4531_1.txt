<br /> <br /> After the spirit and dynamism of Highway 61 and Roadkill, I expected this film to shine, but it was as inflated and illusory as the stars of hard-rock that he parodied. The pace dragged on, not helped by a long sequence of hallucinations, the characters were flat and immutable, and Art Bergmann is not a Jello Biafra. I had to cram myself to stay awake.
