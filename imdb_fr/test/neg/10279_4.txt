"Electra Glide in Blue" is a slow B-movie in which Blake plays the role of a desert bike policeman who wants to be a homicide detective and is involved in a murder investigation. At best, in a mediocre film, "EG in B" features members of the Chicago band, a puff of action, philosophers and a lot, a lot of drama and boring content. Not worth the time.
