Visually beautiful with quality music, this film has a rather banal quality for television. The romance between two characters, which covers a cultural and educational gap, is simply not plausible. Of course, from the beginning, we knew that our shrewd heroine would lighten up, win the local people and find true love, but that does not make it any less unfortunate that the film has to take turns as expected. This film had many promises, which is even more unfortunate that it was not realized. Maybe a nice under-the-blanket on a cold freebie night on the cable, but I certainly would not recommend the paid rent or the purchase. I'm sure the soundtrack is beautiful, though.
