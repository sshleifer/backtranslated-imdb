Yes, it's your typical live video action movie. And of course, they do their best to change things a bit but miraculously fail. Snipes delivers his perfectly bland performance as he always does. Colloca proves that you do not need any talent to play in a movie, but simply a sex appeal. The worst thing is that it did not cover the basics of my bad movie, namely: 1 ?? Naughty looking cheap. 2 ?? One-liners perfectly timed. 3 ?? Intense car chases with massive explosions. 4 ?? The hero talks with the hot chick. 5 ?? Multitudes of women naked or slightly dressed without reason. OK so I lied, it covers that but it's so horrible.
