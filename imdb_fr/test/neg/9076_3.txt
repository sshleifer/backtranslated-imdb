Other critics have talked about the film's openness, especially regarding male frontal nudity. Well, those who have seen Grande Ecole with its often naked actors and expect something similar will have a big disappointment. Apart from a few seconds in the locker room of the judo team, the shower side by side of the two protagonists lasts a total of 15 seconds. The female head has relatively short frontal moments. Much of the marketing of this film is aimed at the gay male public, but those who expect a hint of homoeroticism between the two main men (the best friends who have a three-way conversation with the girlfriend of one of them) will be the most disappointed. There is not even the suspicion that one is interested in the other, or even scarcely aware that the other is part of the threesome. As a film, Cold Showers is curiously uninvolved; the viewer has very little sense of what these three young people are, how they feel, why they behave this way. About an hour from the original cut was removed; it may be for this reason that the final film seems frustrated and unexploited. Stick with Grande Ecole, a French film that holds more than its promises.
