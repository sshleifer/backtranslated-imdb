I really hated this movie and it's Stephen King's first film I did not finish. I was really disappointed, it was the worst shit I've ever seen. What were you thinking of winning three hours? It may be a good story, but actors? No, suspense? No Romance? Horror? No. He had nothing. <br /> <br /> He owns this strange and crazy science man from Einstein, the classic thing. Not at all real. And a man keeps getting younger all the time. Looks like they used the name of Stephen King to make a crappy movie too long without anything exciting. <br /> <br /> I give this movie to "1 (awful)". If they were like -5, I would probably take that instead. It was a total loss of time.
