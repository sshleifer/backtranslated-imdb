Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this movie. If you can even call it a movie. It looks like a freshman art school project, assembled in a hurry. <br /> <br /> The "talents" that you encounter here will subject you to a painful mix of sub-actors and suractors, and virtually every scene has been terribly artificial and pretentious. <br /> <br /> The film does not reflect Malaysian culture or social conventions - no one even talks that way here. I live in Malaysia, BTW. <br /> <br /> Spinning Gasing seems to have been custom-designed to win a prize in the category of foreign films from some Western film festivals. And unfortunately, this ploy seems to have worked. Some critics would probably call it "exotic", but a more precise word would be "atrocious". <br /> <br />
