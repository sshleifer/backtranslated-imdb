Light spoiler in the second paragraph. <br /> <br /> Anna Christie was Garbo's first dull talker. She and Dressler look like the only people who know what they are doing in this movie. The old man who plays Garbo's father (George F. Marion) in the movie is soooo ah-noying !! It just stumbles in a totally false way and scream about "dat old dah-veel sea". He blames Garbo's "past", all his life and everything on the sea! He seems to be stupid x10. Charles Bickford is Matt, the rough sailor who falls, Garbo falls in love with him, and he is doing well in his role, but nothing really exceptional. <br /> <br /> The best part is that when Garbo unveils his "terrible secret" to Bickford and his father. Finally, Marion stops talking about the seasickness and beats her head and her fists on the table in perfect time with Bickford. Then he leaves soon for a tirade on the sea. <br /> <br /> I had to practically force myself to finish Anna Christie. It's too melodramatic in many parts and squeaky. There are many good first speeches, but it's not one of them. If you've never seen Garbo, try something else before Anna Christie, like CAMILLE or GRAND HOTEL.
