I really enjoy Steven Seagal's films. They are usually very entertaining and are a little bit of Aikido. I usually like the way Steven incorporates these martial arts techniques into combat sequences. <br /> <br /> However, this film is a very bad film production effort and it seems obvious to me that the fault lies with the director and the producers, who obviously do not know how to make a film of action, not to mention director Steven Seagal, and leverage his knowledge and skills. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the end of this movie. I went out before the end just because I could not stand watching this bad movie anymore. I am sure that many people also share my feelings.
