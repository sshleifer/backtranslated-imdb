I love the book It's full of passion, romance, tension ... and the film hangs with two brave stars. Kylie Minogue was already a major star in Australia, having played in Neighbors and released her first single. The decision to launch it in The Delinquents was surely a marketing ploy. For me, it did not pay off. <br /> <br /> Kylie may have been great in Neighbors, but she was far too kind and innocent to play the crazy Lola ... and she was not Asian. descent as Lola was. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent Brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was boring. It dragged on, he missed the passion of the book, he focused a lot on Kylie and was generally completely disappointing.
