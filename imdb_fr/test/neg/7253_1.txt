And I'm afraid I can not imagine why. It's really a really awful film and exceptionally boring. In some ways, this is reminiscent of the beginnings of science fiction when each series was created on a Hollywood backdrop from everything around it. Tiny and unconvincing decor (the snipers seem to be about ten meters away) seemingly in plaster, to the actors who are apparently also in plaster with stereotypes "amusing" painted finely on top, to the basin strangely hot in a frozen cave, the survival of the cast unscathed when medium-sized artillery shells burst a few meters away on clear ground, and finally the hideous scenario that reads like a training manual more than a film ... I really can not say how annoying it is. Even having the chance to see if the young James Dean had survived was not enough to watch me for more than an hour. It really is to be avoided at all costs.
