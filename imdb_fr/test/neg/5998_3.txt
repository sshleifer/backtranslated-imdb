Jackie Chan films are typical examples of the superiority of supply on demand. Well, to be honest, what demand? In this one, Jackie Chan is his name, I doubt he even knows it, and he's sort of racing car driver. Well, he drives 10 miles an hour and then the footage is sped up, that way I can do all the stunts myself too. During the grand finale, in which Jackie Chan wants to stop the villain by beating him in a race, we finally see how bad this production really is. Chan's fights, especially in the casinos scene, are decent, but when we talk about special effects, my dear Lord. And there, it's really not safe for drivers, there is not even a concrete wall in the neighborhood. And do not get me started on the kind of horrible story that it has, I mean, it's is Hong Kong, it is probably under the magnifying glass item by eight years, but still, what a mess. I love Chan as much as the next guy, maybe more since I saw "Rush Hour", but the belated cousin of his agent really has to choose his projects better.
