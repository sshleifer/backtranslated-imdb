There is something in this show that makes me look and hope for the future. In writing, jokes are rare and stories are boring. So I guess it has to be the physical comedy and the visuals. <br /> <br /> I like the movement of the camera, the sets and the wardrobe. It's fun and very contrasted with the monotony that reigns. And I'm pretty sure every time I laughed it was because of John or Molly's physical comedy. Both are an incredibly cute couple who make me laugh and want to throw up at the same time. <br /> <br /> So I'm ready to sit down with Kath & Kim once again tonight to see which way to take this production will decrease (or increase depending on the case, with a positive outlook).
