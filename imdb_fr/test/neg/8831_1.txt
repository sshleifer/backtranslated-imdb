I want to make it clear that I am not religious at all. I am an atheist but I could see that Richard Dorkins was contradicting himself again and again. I would also like to say that I am not the kind of person who constantly opposes something against philosophy, but I think that when we compare science and religion, we have to be philosophical and want to question his belief in the main science. as well as questioning religious beliefs. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Richard Dorkins never takes the time to think philosophically about belief. Anyone who thinks long enough about science and religion will realize that science is a religion in itself. Yes, there is a fundamental difference between how scientific beliefs are expressed in relation to other religions, but at the root is faith in a particular human instinct. <br /> <br /> Throughout this series, Richard insists that scientific methods are the only good way to think and that it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence permits. If you deepen the workings of science, you will realize that it is as irrational as religion and that it boils down to faith in the end, faith in the evidence, faith in our sanity, faith in our senses but more than anything except the faith in our instinct to follow patterns of recurrence. <br /> <br /> This is not easy to explain, but think about how the laws of physics were decided. This is because they were and still are the most common recurrence patterns. that we are aware. I think that human beings have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something lasts in a certain state or place of existence, the more we suppose blind faith does it more likely. For example, we do not expect gravity to suddenly turn upside down tomorrow, by which I mean that repelling matter is supposed to attract it. But the only reason we do not expect this sudden change is that we have known for so long that it has always attracted as much as we know. However, that does not mean he could not do exactly the opposite tomorrow or even now. No matter how long something can remain in a certain state or change, there is no rational reason to make assumptions about it but we do it by instinct. I would ask you to think about what constitutes a long and short period of time. There is nothing like it, I do not know exactly how long it took the supposed wise to decide that everything must be made in matter, sound, light, etc., but give them what they would consider as an advanced way! Let's say a lot longer than it was really 12,000,000,000 years ago! Is it a long period of time? With 99999999999999999, 12.00 billion years seem to be an incredibly short period. As far as we know, there could be an extreme amount of change in the so-called laws of science in the trillions of dollars ahead. It's all about comparison. Only when we compare things can we say "it's long" or it's short. It is the same for large and small, large and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak, among others. <br /> <br /> I doubt that a scientist can tell me why he thinks that trusting this instinct makes sense. I certainly do not see why it should be, but that does not mean that we, as humanity, should necessarily stop using it. With this in mind, the most hypocritical comment that Richard Dorkins made was when he said that faith was irrational, "a process of non-thinking," he said. If what we have in this instinct that I described and this instinct that we all have on a certain level is not faith, then I do not know what it is. He is sometimes hypocritical when he talks about the fact that religions are the Bronze Age, "myths about the Bronze Age," he says. I want to point out that no matter how much scientific methods change over time through experience, experience and evaluation, the pure rules of science are getting older! They could even be described as the holy Bible of science. He said he was fed up with the stubbornness of the different religions: "I'm right, he's wrong," but looking back at how rude he was with the different interviewees, he seems to be just as stubborn. To be fair to him, at least he is not trying to bombard religious communities. I appreciate his hatred for some of the religious beliefs that generate the war, but I do not respect his arrogance in his own convictions. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, Richard has the right to believe in science if that's his way. I also have a scientific mind, but I do not think he has the right to convince religious leaders to have hostile arguments, to try to impose their opinion on them and to call them stupid. Despite all his education, experience, and discoveries, he does not seem to have the wisdom to properly challenge his own belief system. I read what he said to defend this argument that open-minded atheists, such as the one I proposed to myself, tell me, what he says tells me that he is totally missing the point . <br /> <br /> Finally, the title of the documentary, Racine of all evil. That said, religion is the root of all evil, it's not true. There are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion. <br /> <br /> The documentary series was full of frustration, narrow-mindedness, hypocrisy and nonsense.
