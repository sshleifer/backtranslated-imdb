I must admit that the title and the summary on the back of the box disappointed me. So I put it in the VCR and I kept waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting for something to happen. But of course, this is never the case. The directors of this film should be strapped to a chair and watch "Saving Private Ryan". Maybe they would learn something.
