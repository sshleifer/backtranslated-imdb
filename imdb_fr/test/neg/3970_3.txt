Parties: Clonus horror is not so bad as a movie. I have the MST3K version on tape and it's hilarious, but it's still not the worst movie of all time. I would go so far as to say that it was better than 80% of the movies they were making fun of. The concept could have worked if they had a better screenplay, more money and decent actors. It could have become a classic if it was not so boring and a little more exciting. Unfortunately, the production was sloppy and ended up on MST3K.
