Companions passionate about black, make no mistake, it's a fucking bad ... poorly filmed, badly played and there is nothing ... nothing here for the movie buff looking for another solid film B of the mine gold of the 1940s-1950s classics. I tried it based on the relatively high rating on IMDb. There is no accounting for taste, but I did not find anything in this movie to recommend to other IMDb members. This is a classic example of watching a movie and feeling cheated after an x ​​number of minutes in which the movie ended. Having Alan Ladd on the cover of the DVD / cassette is almost a fraud, he is in front of the camera less than two minutes and has almost no dialogue! It's not This Gun For HIre people ... it's a classic in the unhealthy sense of studios producing budget-free fodder ... We're all looking for the best ... save time on Gangs, Inc. / Bullets in paper ... it's ugly!
