Boston Blackie's films have some strengths - mainly because the pace is fast and the hero is happily unfazed even in the worst of circumstances. But the plot is often atrocious, and relentless cartoons often kill the rhythm (if the plot turns out to be atypically good) or are simply dishonest and inappropriate. asylum (Steve Cochran in a really mediocre performance) who became obsessed with the beautiful Nina Foch (who does a nice job as a rather subtle performer). Of course, Inspector Farraday believes that Blackie has become maniacal about the homicide (he has at least some evidence in it), and is trying incompetently to put him in jail while Blackie is attacking the real murderer. The plot has possibilities, but whenever a real tension comes up, we have a funny comedy routine. It does not appear that anyone at Columbia has realized that in a film about the pursuit of a really dangerous maniac, pretty little comic scenes about hiding an awkward body from the inspector disrupt any voluntary suspension of disbelief . (We come to the conclusion that our clever hero is an idiot - deadly for a movie like this.) <br /> <br /> This one is not worth it. For a well-planned episode of this series, see Alias ​​Boston Blackie.
