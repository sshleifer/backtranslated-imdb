It's funny how instinct warns you against something. For example, as soon as the company read Nu Image, I knew instinctively that I had already seen a really crappy movie, but I could not remember where. Nevertheless, I just knew that JUDGE AND JURY was going to be bad and it was. Maybe I'm psychic? <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening is rather violent, several people being carried by the breath for no additional reason, instead of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I do not know about you, but I'm getting a little fed up with the exploitive violence on the screen nowadays, accompanied by vulgar language, especially if it's spouted by actors as bad as those of this movie. Be that as it may, the plot revolves around the nasty guy who gets executed and comes back to take revenge on the man who shot his wife. Oh, did I mention the bad guy and his wife murdered two people on their wedding night? Yeah, he's a serious mofo. In fact, he's so mean (and I'm not talking about an actor - I'll come back to that in a moment) that it's impossible to take seriously and that's before he's executed before coming back as Elton John , Elvis, a French chef, etc. I wonder if Keith David was paid for this? because he seems to be having fun on the screen, that's the only reason he plays the role. What a pity that this critic had no pleasure to watch JUDGE AND JURY. Hey, maybe producers could send me Keith's fees? Gawd only knows that I deserve it. <br /> <br /> I did not really like this movie, as if you had not guessed it. . If, like me, you have a bottle of wine punctured on the head or very violent kicks to the ribs several times, you will know that the violence is an obscene and painful thing, but JURY AND JUSTICE will make you believe that if you are thrown through a window, hit a few banners and fall twenty feet on a table, not only will you be unscathed, but you will also be able to distance two enraged devil dogs. We could of course argue that any film featuring Sly, Arnie or Bruce also suffers from this same dishonest projection of violence, but with JUDGE AND JURY, he shot my chain
