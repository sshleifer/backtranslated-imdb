This is the worst movie I have ever seen. And I saw a lot of movies. My friends and I rented this one on a Wednesday night. Dude we had a lot of fun. This movie is the worst shit ever. But it makes you laugh! You will lie on the floor trying to get some fresh air. You wonder why? Praise him and look for the girl who plays the keyboard in this shady Russian bar. My mother would make a 1000 times better movie about her diet with cats.
