I mistakenly thought that this neo-black effort in the Buffalo - Niagara Falls area could be something different. Unfortunately, I was wrong. "The Falls" raises many issues that have nothing to do with low-budget video production. Immediately, one must ask why all this constant narration? My feeling is that if you have a decent scenario, the audience will follow, without being insulted by the narration. The acting game is very amateurish, which is not surprising, but simply adds to the problems. Finally, everything is shot as an MTV music video, which I found totally unacceptable. Narration, acting and annoying video effects are good reasons to avoid this. - MERK
