this movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great. Nothing is good Bloodline ... a lot of blood but without meaning and most of the time without originality. the film is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle box. The creator of the box and his offspring are fighting against a demon but nothing seriously links the 3 stories. Pinhead is in the movie ... but it's not Pinhead, it's just a boring enemy kidnapping kids and killing a bird, and the worst ... he talks too much. One thing I did not really understand is why the hell dog ????? He can not be a cenobite because he has nothing human. Why can the dog be killed by the pressure if the other creature of hell can receive balls without problems ????? Bloodline is inconsistent with the movie series in many ways. For example, Pinhead and Ang√©lique are old friends in this movie, but it's impossible for Pinhead to meet Angelique, because Pinhead is just a World War I soldier and Angelique is an old demon and she's been living in Paris since sometimes 200 years or so.
