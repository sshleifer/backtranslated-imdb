The problem with this - and with all the movies of the Vietnam War - is that they are all too biased. Anti-war films ignore the fact that the vast majority of American soldiers are heroes, while prowar movies ignore the fact that many soldiers have indeed committed atrocities like this one. This film is nil. It is time to move to a film that is neither prowar nor anti-war, nor liberal, nor conservative, but COMPLETELY INEBIT.
