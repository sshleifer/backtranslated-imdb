I'm afraid I'll only be here to watch the first hour of this movie, because it really seemed to be a brain drain TV and a waste of talent. Liv Tyler plays sumptuous beauty, but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to give the play a real boost. As she slowly seduces a bartender into a criminal life, it's hard to feel a real worry for one of the characters. Even John Goodman delivers his faintly comical lines with an absence of panache, as if the humor without intelligence had to be recited slowly in case someone missed the joke. The end is supposed to be good, but the starter and main course did not make me want to know it.
