When Pam Grier shot COFFY in 1973, it was an exciting but flawed film. The plot was serious and satisfying - even though acting was often amateurish. It was so successful that American International Pictures decided to redo the formula the following year with FOXY BROWN - not a bad movie but certainly almost like "COFFY II". Only a year later, the studio had apparently given up on creating something new for Ms. Grier, as SHEBA, BABY was essentially the same plot of COFFY and FOXY BROWN. Because the idea was so recycled and the acting is very tired and it consumes very little energy, it really touches the bottom of the barrel Blaxploitation. <br /> <br /> Exactly like those other movies, SHEBA, BABY starts with some local black gangsters hurry and end up killing someone Pam Grier likes. In the past, they were drug traffickers and pimps; now they were hoodlums trying to manage all lending companies and pawnbrokers outside the city in order to seize the market. And, like the other films, Pam is a successful one-woman training: she does justice and makes a perfect fool. And, as in other films, there is a "cat fight" between Pam and a white lady right in front of "Mr. Big". And, like the other movies, Mr. Big is a white guy who pulls all the strings. And, like the other movies, she's captured by Mr. Big. And, like the other movies, he does not kill her immediately, but gives her ample opportunity to escape (here, leaving a knife at hand). And like other movies, she ends up freeing herself and killing her jive - @ $$. <br /> <br /> Although this formula seemed interesting in 1973, it was frankly boring for this film. Even if you had not seen the other movies, it was still bad because the action was so slow - the punches and kicks seemed so slow and staged. The same could be said for the game of firearms. In one scene, four guys with machine guns, an AR-15 and shotguns attack. Pam responds by opening the fire with a .357 revolver, killing 3 of 4 and forcing the other to surrender !!! Even if it's a good move, it was rather slow and the guys seemed to wait until it kills them !!! Also, even a world champion shooter or Rambo could not have done it with such a one-sided rating - after all, these guys had some very impressive weapons and they were already pointed at her when she "smartly" drew his gun and easily shipped. these professional hitmen !! <br /> <br /> In addition to slow and lame action scenes compared to any other film Blaxpoitation, the film has many logical flaws that show that the writing was terrible, but the studio did not care . In one case, her boyfriend, "Williams", was aware of the yacht and Nu-tronic at the end of the film, but Pam never told him - how did he know? In another, the cops approach a boat filled with hoods and it opens immediately fire. However, the cops had no evidence that anything was happening and the scammers started shooting with little provocation. And the crooks had .30 caliber machine guns and other incredibly powerful weapons, but in many cases they were killed by cops with .38s noses rolled up! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is an excellent example of "having been there / doing this .... quite better". I love Blaxploitation's movies, but this one is too doping and slow to deserve to be watched, except by very dedicated fans of the genre.
