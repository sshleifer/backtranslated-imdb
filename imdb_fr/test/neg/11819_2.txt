And you would be right. Black Mama, White Mama, also known as "Women in Chains", is just the kind of trashy and crappy b-movie that the place suggests. Pam Grier was thrown into a prison on a small island with many other women. This place seriously suggests that the vacation camp where Martha Stewart is locked up looks like a maximum security prison. It is not five minutes in the film that one of the hottie guards pronounces the phrase "Beware and wet them", then we discover a life of prison that resembles the fantasy of a student in first year of 'a middle-school. is like. <br /> <br /> Prisoners soap and rub against each other in the shower as if it were a Girls Gone Wild shoot, then they were all together in their dorms, smoking open jars and chatting in groups being the best way to escape. I have never been to jail myself, but I feel that evacuation plans are the kind of things you want as few people as possible to know, prisoners or guardians, or whatever. The biggest difference between prison life and a fantastic sorority life is that the women in this movie all wear orange cardigans (and no pants, see) who say PRISON on the back. Must be these generic prison jails for prisons that can not afford expensive accessories like their prison name or prisoner number for their uniforms. <br /> <br /> And as expected, a prison that can not afford the identification of prisoners on the back of the uniforms obviously can not be able to find guards interested in keeping prisoners as much as they have sex with prisoners and between them. <br /> <br /> The title conflict of the film refers to the fact that Lee Daniels (Pam Grier) spends most of the time handcuffed to a blonde prisoner named Karen while they are fleeing police officers after escaped from prison. I will not go into detail about how they escaped except to say that you might have seen something similar in The Fugitive if they had not been able to afford to stage a train accident, and this brings us to the confusing history of opposing interests, which is also continuing. these two women for different reasons. Karen and Lee each have their own gang of people hoping to rescue their respective escaped prisoners, and the cops are looking for them all the time. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) So Karen is involved in a lot of hippies who want to revolutionize life as they know it. Meanwhile, Karen just wants to leave the island, which she has been trying to do for years. Is not it perfect that they each need to go to the other side of the island to achieve their goals. So we get this strange couple and, as they are an odd couple, it is not difficult to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the film, but they will appreciate before the end. <br /> <br /> In a film with so many conflicting interests, especially when these opposing interests not only push the two main characters in opposite directions in pursuit of their goals, it is not unreasonable to 'expect there to be a critical moment involving rival gangs at a point in the film. Not intending to leave unsatisfied, they throw a stupid stalemate at the end of the film. Everyone is shooting at each other, killing themselves en masse, while the two women are quietly and quietly strolling across the river in a small boat. . Pleasant. <br /> <br /> Better still, at the end of the film, after a huge massacre in which many people are shot and throw red paint everywhere, the police captain examines the mass of the dead the criminals are covered with terrible special effects, and we learn that he will be commander before dinner. This is not a bad way to end the movie, the criminals kill each other and the cops get all the credit, but here is the last line of the movie ?? "It's better to win, is not it?" <br /> <br /> WHY is the captain going to be promoted to the rank of major? Because he understood that ???
