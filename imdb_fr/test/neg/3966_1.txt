For those of you who have some nice words for this movie, I guess you did not see it when it was released under the title "Parts: The Clonus Horror". <br /> <br /> It was a terribly boring film. He missed the target in at least three ways. It was not good enough to scare; it was not serious enough to be funny (although MST3K did it); and even in 1979, the plot was not original. <br /> <br /> The previous contenders are "The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler" (1971). It's the same idea (clones as spare parts). The film is entertaining and the distribution is excellent. Another is "Sleeper" (1973). Yes, Woody Allen's movie. Do you remember the flattened nose? And "Clones" (1973). The last two plots are not as similar to Clonus as the first, but they are earlier than Clonus. <br /> <br /> These are also several fiction books from decades earlier that deal with the idea, although often the word "clone" is not used.
