Steven Seagal's films have not been really good lately, but it's by far the worst since The Patriot. The plot has no meaning whatsoever; it is never clear what the relationships between the characters are, who works for whom or who is double crossing with whom. The film is completely disjointed, each scene seems to confuse history more than to advance it. Even the action sequences are not inspired and difficult to follow. Most of the blame lies with the director, who does not even understand the basics of making a film, but Seagal does not fare lightly. As a producer of the film, he must also be held responsible. Oh, and I did not even mention how terrible the acting is, even by Seagal standards. Even when it comes to video feed, it's not worth seeing, even for Seagal fans. Give it a large place!
