How to gather all the clichés and stereotypes existing in the horror genre and then insert them into the same massively ugly film? The answer: "Camp Blood". It's an amateur nonsense made on a micro-budget and a bit too obvious inspired by "Friday the 13th". Four of the most intolerable adolescent characters you'll ever see? they are like a combination of ugly, stupid and boring? goes camping and finds himself quickly pursued by a murderous maniac in clown costume. Do not even ask me what the killer's motives were or even who he was, because if that was in the movie, I'd miss him completely. This is one of the worst films ever made, without inspiration or know-how. The values ​​of production were so pitiful that there are actors who play multiple roles without even bothering to make them unrecognizable. "Camp Blood" is the only sequence worthy of the name that is worth living. It is the opening where the impressive voluptuous Meredith O'Brien makes love with her geek scout. Yes, I am fully aware that this is a totally superficial remark to make, but again, it is a juvenile and slow film, so who cares?
