A group of adventurers visit the "Black Continent" to try to find a lost heiress, Diana, who died years ago in a plane crash, and who now lives with a savage tribe who considers her as their goddess. <br /> <br /> Once again, my search for European sordid and cannibalistic films immersed me deeply in the territory of Jess Franco: an endless and endless desert of cinematography teeming with sub-par writers, teeming with scenes camera, and abundant with terrible actors (Lina Romay, a regular on French television, wins this time the prize for her pitiful performance as an elderly and sick woman). It was here that, in this hellish place, I finally came across Diamonds of Kilimanjaro, a sullen jungle farmer, to such an extent that it took me three successive nights to finish watching him. dull, even by Franco standards, this tedious basket fails on almost every level: history is a terribly dull derivative of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan, albeit with a feminine twist; the film appears to have been shot in local botanic gardens, although granular archive footage is poorly integrated, in a futile effort to convince viewers that the action is really taking place in Africa; and scenes of death are virtually bloodless (we can usually count on Franco for some splashing, but despite the initial appearances, it's not a cannibalistic movie and it's not so bloody). <br /> <br /> However, he succeeds in the casting of the sexy young Katja Bienert in the role of Diana, the prison of the jungle. Running and jumping through the undergrowth in a skinny jersey, her body curvaceous, recognizing that she was only sixteen at the time, this nubile beauty made a strong impression. Franco also adds some scenes of nudity with Mari Carmen Nieto as a treacherous traveler Lita (who gives us a glimpse of her untamed areas), and Aline Mess as a naked topless warrior Noba, narrowly avoiding a new assessment of 1 / 10 from me. (Although I'm sure he'll get a lot more in the future, I still have lots of movies to watch).
