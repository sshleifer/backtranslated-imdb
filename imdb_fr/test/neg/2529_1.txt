I can not believe! Were they crazy filming a movie about Connecticut in Southern California? For God's sake, there are palm trees everywhere. In one of the opening scenes, a guy says "Welcome to Connecticut" and throws a newspaper, the newspaper says something like "Greenwich Herald". Greenwich Connecticut does not have a "Herald", it has a "Times" as in "Stamford Advocate AND THE GREENWICH TIMES". (See the newspaper Stamford, Connecticut). The filmmakers might have had to do a little research, I mean my god, at least get the name of the newspaper, or film in places that at least resemble those in Connecticut.
