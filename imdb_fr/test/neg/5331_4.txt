It's one of those movies that I watch every time I look at it, not because I like it, but because it's so bad that I can not look away (like "Battlefield Earth "or" 3000 Miles to Graceland "). The first time I watched, I waited and waited to laugh and I was only lucky about 3/4 of the film, when they put the harassing cops on their underwear and handcuffed them in the park. unflattering way position. Beyond that, the jokes are not funny, the characters are not funny, their mishaps and their missteps are not funny ... add, it's not a very funny movie! Not even at the level of burlesque! And what about the reggae soundtrack? It's a movie about two white garbouilleurs and the music is entirely reggae. Seems irrelevant, is not it? If you like a good trainwreck, this is for you. If you like a good comedy, look elsewhere.
