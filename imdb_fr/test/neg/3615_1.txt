We now know where they got Snakes on a Plane. Frankly, do not pay to watch this movie. If you really want to lose 90 minutes of your life, catch it on a cable or get it for free through NetFlix or Blockbuster. Do not pay to rent this. If you pay to rent this, then you are a stupid individual. The acting was awful, the plot was awful, everything was horrible except for snakes. Whether real or generated by CGI, they were pretty beautiful. But having said that, this movie must always be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even the scene of the naked dance was very bad and I made it move quickly. Do not sit down, I did not warn you.
