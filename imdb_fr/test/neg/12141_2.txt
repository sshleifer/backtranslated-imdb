I grew up watching the "Bowery Boys" over the weekend and even at a young age, I could say that the rent was low, as the name suggests. It was still fun to watch Satch (Hall) get the better of Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs hit him. The East Side Kids movies were never released, even though they were public domain material and probably cheap, but it was just a low level for kids, even though we had than 5 channels to watch. Enter the year 2005 and I'm repossesin on my childhood. I can not find any DVD Bowery Boys but I found The East Side Kids on disk and on a public domain website. Fortunately, I saved my dough and saw Bowery Blitz on the Web for free, and it really blows. Now, I can see that there are Bowery Boys and maybe bad movie buffs here who gave this shit to melodrama a 7 out of 10 but go guys, it does not even try to be funny. It's an East Side Kids drama, not a comedy, so it's not good. The best part was to see Muggs fight in the end, he reminded me of my elementary school years flowing like a girl when I was fighting, it was a little abusive. Leonard Maltin said in his mini-biography that this film was one of the best. So you can imagine the rest. If you want to attend a decent part of the East Side, see Ghosts on The Loose maybe, but the end result is that a humorous team starts strong in his career and dissipates. that they were at best. Still in 2nd place, well below the 3 stooges, they imitate but are fun for those who grew up with them. This function will not bring back pleasant memories of the "Bowery Boys" and it is better to leave it to the fanatics of Monogram.
