Well, I notice that IMDB did not offer any information about the plot ... it's because it's impossible to do it without sounding ugly and disgusting ... because that's what this movie is. .. VILE AND DEGUSTIVE !! I watched it because I'm a huge fan of Chris Noth, whom I met in person and he's a great guy ... but if I see him again, I'll have no qualms about asking him this that asked him to play. something so terrible. He plays a former child prodigy who is now a brilliant doctor, who spends his free time crushing young children with his car, with the intention of mutilating and paralyzing them ... he is not a "spoiler" because all this is made very clear from the beginning ... quite disgusting ?? Oh, it's better ... he's being manipulated to do it, by his incestuous sister, who threatens to restrain his sexual favors if his last victim does not die ... even Clive Barker could not write anything so hideous. . Please, if you want to see Chris Noth in something worthy of his talent, praise "Teddy Roosevelt and the Roughriders"
