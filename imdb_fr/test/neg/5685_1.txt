I have no idea what these people thought when they made this movie. No plot, very limited action, and what about the commentary to the 3rd person throughout the movie ???? Instead of going around the world to film in all these places, they should have spent a little money writing scripts and actors. What acting was, was ugly. It was 90 minutes of my life, I will never be able to come back. I should charge the director the rental fee for this movie. To the director and writers of this film .... please, stop now This movie should have a label on the front of it saying to be wary of boredom. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the computer generation. It's good as the generation is. This film should never have any continuation .... ever.
