This film is on view with The Oscar and Moment by Moment, one of the unintentionally entertaining movies of all time. <br /> <br /> It's worth being praised for a really great laugh. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely ridiculous. Nothing in life would happen that way. It's so amazing. The way James Woods tries to shake the big hitters, then give this supposed pirate two jobs 3000 km from Los Angeles. What a joke <br /> <br /> I like the old VW viruses to show how low they are "I got into life because of all the" tootski ". <br /> <br /> Sean Young is incredibly naughty like, "I'll love you forever, whatever, my wife," you'll never see, it was not so funny that you vomited on the sweet sweetness of Young, who tries to project. And as bad actor as you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> James Wood over-shakes all the way through the movie and he's extremely it's funny, it's too much, it's amazing, Woods seems being a parody of a Saturday Night Live cocaine demon. But watching Woods on `ludes' is worth the rental price. <br /> <br /> I like when Woods says to the guy who wants to give him more ludes he does not do that anymore, just before, Woods just made three giant lines of coke. <br /> This is very funny stuff. <br /> <br /> The end is so comic but at the height of the rest of the film.
