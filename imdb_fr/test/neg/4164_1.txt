The film disappointed me for many reasons: first of all, the description of a future that seemed realistic at first was well-crafted, but only played a marginal role. Then the story itself was a weak copy of Lost in Translation. The Middle East executive, a man and his family meet a new girl abroad, a karaoke bar, camera movements and pictures - all this was a very bad imitation of the excellent Lost in Translation that had also credibility. This film tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not the case. I wonder why Tim Robbins even considered making this movie !? The main actress is awful - did she play the role of precog in Minority Report? And why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this? Lost in Translation did not have to show excessive love scenes. R-Rated just for that? This film is not even worth watching from a video store!
