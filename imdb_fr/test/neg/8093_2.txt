A "comedy" very imperfect but almost watchable that unfolds as a rejection of the Farrelly brothers. The most criminal thing about this is the casting. For a minute, I could not believe Jerry O Connell and Jake Busey in the role of superstuds, who could shoot any woman in a jiffy, and I could not believe (the very beautiful) Shannon Elizabeth as that tough policeman! The story is predictable, but manages to lift the veil a few times, although the "rude" scene, supposed to be a scene of "shocking comic" (one involving an amputated testicle and another located in a sperm bank) terrible . If this movie is on TV, then you should watch if you are bored, but do not waste your money on renting it !!
