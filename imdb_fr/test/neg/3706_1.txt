The capture of Bigfoot is one of the most ridiculous and worst movies of all time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies, but this one is a waste of time. Terrible, terrible, terrible! I watched this movie last night and I could not do anything to finish watching.I understood that this strange crazy wanted to capture Bigfoot, but that's the only thing that makes sense in this film. a few fun things. There was this very nerdy disco club with very bad disco dances that seemed to last way too long in the movie. I think the director was trying to save time. The worst thing about Bigfoot. obvious man in costume looked like a pink fake fur Bigfoot.It was laughable.If you want to see a very bad film Bigfoot, then I suggest you buy this movie.Personally, I lost my time and my money for that -this!
