I tried to look at this and I was very disappointed. Do not expect a smart and insightful humor, like the brother of Amy, David, in the middle of this sinking ... it's the opposite. But if you like jokes of shit, fart and jokes, you'll be in seventh heaven. I guess it's the humor of the bathroom that is, I guess, aimed at those who have had several bangs, which can only explain why many ecstatic critics have called this story "shit like best TV writing of all time ". I guess those who hate this simple humor have not been able to look long enough to be able to submit a critique, but I'm just warning ignorant viewers who are looking for a high-end comedy. The characters turn on. The shock factor is set at 10. And the bursts of laughter are set to zero (unless of course you are looking for a juvenile and discreet humor.) <br /> <br /> I did it in 40 minutes, while praying it would turn the corner into entertaining entertainment, but alas, it only got worse. And beware of Amy's ubiquitous and irreproachable expression - she will put you in the eye. It was nice to see actors of recognizable comedians that I appreciate, but I can only assume that they agreed to participate as a favor to the Sedaris family. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for those who liked it. . it's my opinion. It was so bad that it inspired me to write my first review.
