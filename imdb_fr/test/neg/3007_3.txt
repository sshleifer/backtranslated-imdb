This is one of the most beautiful films of recent years. The fact that this was done pretty much (about $ 1.8 million on the DVD: they infer that they ended up with even less funding) makes it even more impressive. Not just photography, but design and especially places (Eastern Montana) that are both authentically American and extraterrestrial. <br /> <br /> Too bad there is no consistent film to accompany it. An extremely promising installation consisting of clearing a rural town in 1955 before the last 48 hours before it was flooded, because a dam is carried away by a pretentious gibberish evoking angels and a dying child. And what is presented as "the real world" is desperately arched. Note to the Polish brothers: The Coen brothers are funny - you are not. <br /> <br /> No doubt many filmmakers will find the abundant symbolism and impenetrability of "Northfork" as marks of depth, sophisticated types struggle all night in cafes, while intrepid crowds watch "Charlie's Angels" or something. (Sigh) If you insist .... <br /> <br /> In the meantime, recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for its "flawless technical credits and photographic beauty.
