But it's not. The plot is not so bad, the actors are not all terrible, so it should be decent. Despite a good starting point, the plot continues to suffer and suffers from many of these moments "I can not believe he / she is so silly" are so often used in horror movies to get things done . It frustrated me sometimes to watch part of the decision made by the main character. In addition, it took far too much time to get to the best part of the movie. Anticipation is good but you can not spend more than half of the film to build it. A shame also because he had a decent show after his release and hit just before the big Halloween season. Even if I feel that it will have at least a sequel, if not more, perhaps they will be able to rely on the powerful general plot to finally publish something suitable.
