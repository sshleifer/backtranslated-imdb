It had its moments, but overall, when I watched this cartoon as a child, I was very bored. The only thing that made me look was the fact that it was a cartoon, probably my first exposure to anime. It's also one of my least favorite anime, I remember others involving a giant spaceship in space that made no sense, but that was more enjoyable because they were in space. I also remember one of them with these people dressed in birds that was a bit strange, but more fun. I do not like motor racing too much, I did not like it yet, that's probably one of the reasons I did not like this show, even though today I'm a big fan of cartoons. The characters were a little awkward too, and then there were the horrible scenes where virtually no action was going on, which would probably have served to reduce animation costs and complete the show. The gadgets in the cars were cool and entertained for me at the time. Overall, I find that this show is rather unassailable compared to new anime and some of the same time, but it's a personal opinion, I'm sure many other critics like the show, which is cool.
