I watched part of the first part of this film and some very small pieces of other parts. I may be wrong, but I do not think this film really deserves to be watched. The strange characters and events attract your attention and are rather interesting, but there are also negative and negative aspects. The magic and the mythical side of this film dissuaded me, and for most Christians, this film would be neither very suitable nor worthy of being watched.
