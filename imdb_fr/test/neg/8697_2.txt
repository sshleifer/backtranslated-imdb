This film could have had a lot of potential. Certainly, with the current technology, one could expect real special effects. But movies are not made only with special effects, it is of course necessary to act. This film was missing at once! <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say to those who are unhappy not to follow the Bible: why can not a film take an artistic license? If you want to know more about the story of Moses, read the Bible. I have seen very few films that follow a true story. Watch the film of his artistic qualities. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version. It fails miserably in that. Heston and Brenner had PRESENCE. They became their roles. You do not see that here. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not compare, standing alone, this movie is too hurried. The parts where a scene should be developed are not. It becomes boring. <br /> <br /> My advice: skip this and look at each other. Although camper is, it's by far the best movie.
