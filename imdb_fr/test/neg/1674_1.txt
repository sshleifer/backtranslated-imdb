I do not know if this type of film was as clich√© as it seems now. <br /> <br /> Given the number of "Bad News Bears" films already released in 1980, I think however that this kind of film was already a tired idea. <br /> <br /> A former football player is partially paralyzed in Vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair. The Chicago Bears offer him a PR job but he wants to become a coach. At the same time, his minor nephew is arrested for armed robbery. We are told that he has already been arrested more than a dozen times and that he must now face a difficult period ... which turns out to be less than a year! <br /> <br /> Of course, the kid is actually a good kid who only needs a tough male model in his life. The same is true for all children in the detention center. Yes ... even the one imprisoned for attempted murder! I'm sure you already know what's going on so I'll try to keep the rest of this brief. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist becomes the coach of the children's football team. He overcomes the cynicism of offenders and earns their respect. His team faces a local high school team (yeah yes!) And gets kicked. Now more determined than ever to prove himself, he asks for a rematch. Will these poor children with hearts of gold, with golden hearts, be able to improve enough to win revenge? The terrible execution of football sequences ruins any possibility of excitement in this film. "Coach of the Year" should be punished for hurting my brain. 1/10
