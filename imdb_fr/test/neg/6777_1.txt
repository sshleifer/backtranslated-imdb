I saw this drawing by accident on television one night when I could not fall asleep. It did not help at all. I found myself staring at the ceiling, trying to forget this face. I could never see this caricature again, just because of his face. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, I love fairy tales and rhymes as much as anyone. But this twisted and terrifying interpretation is simply disturbing. It's mostly the cruel laughter and the exaggerated features that terrify me, and I still have nightmares because of that. Please, I urge you not to allow your children to see this. It's far, too scary. Please, please, drive him away.
