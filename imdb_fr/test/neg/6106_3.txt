My mother told me not to go and see "Kadosh" - but who is listening to his mother? <br /> <br /> I was so disgusted by that as I watched. I thought I had lost my feminist credentials before going to the theater. So I checked with feminists who wore cards the next day. No, they also thought it was much more an anti-orthodox scape than a pro-feminist statement, portraying the Orthodox on an equal footing with the Taliban. <br /> <br /> While this Israeli film takes care to show the sect The story tells that it is the ultimate ultra-Orthodox messianist, it's so mean that it is incredible (in addition what the non-fanatic orthodox fan-rocker (!) of which one of the sisters is in love is incredibly sexy-- even in Israel it must be fantasized). <br /> <br /> The theater was crowded, so there is a pent-up curiosity to see Israeli films; Too bad this vicious film is one that gets a wide distribution. It was almost enough to take me back to the tasteless Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 29/04/2000)
