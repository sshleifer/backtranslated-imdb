The Cheesiest movie I have ever seen, Not scary, just bad. First film made by WWE, and believe me, the only person that this film could please, are the fans of wrestling. This is the worst staging I've seen so far. I found myself laughing at the script, and bad actors. I saw that WWE people were really trying to put a lot of wrestling moves into eliminations and several camera effects. I think they copied a lot of silence Hill. This film is not interesting either, so if you see it, you will find yourself listening because of the lack of suspense. The end is the worst, no matter what, you're going to want to get your money back
