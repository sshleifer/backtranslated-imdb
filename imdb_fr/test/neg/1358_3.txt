From time to time, an independent actor arrives with an impressive cast and a story that seems really interesting and that can not be missed, but the film is nil. Some recent movies belonging to this unfortunate category are "Levity" and "The Safety Of Objects", and here is "The United States of Leland". <br /> <br /> Outstanding players include Ryan Gosling, Kevin Spacey, Don Cheadle, Jena Malone, Lena Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein and Kerry Washington. Gosling plays Leland P. Fitzgerald, the teenage son of a famous author (Spacey) who commits a troubling and unforgivable crime (murdering a belated child), but does not remember it and seems to have no motive. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle plays a teacher in a juvenile room who tries to understand Leland (and operates it by writing a book about it), and Jena Malone is his ex-girlfriend. We see their relationship deteriorate (due to heroin addiction) in the flashback. It sounds like a great little drama, huh? I thought so too. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this film is fair, poorly written. The dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and loaded with irritating platitudes on "life," the characters are all two-dimensional independent clich√©s, and while he manages to make Leland friendly in some ways, he conceals his crime. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is no problem with the acting. Gosling (who was worthy of an Oscar in "The Believer") is an extremely talented young actor, but, in the way they are written, none of these characters (the least of Leland) even feels like real people , so he can not do much but murmur his fine lines and look sad. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone is the most memorable. She has one of the most expressive faces I have ever seen. Even playing a character in a bad film like this one, it can break your heart in one look. When she has good material to work with (like in "Donnie Darko" or "The Dangerous Lives of the Altar Boys"), she is truly amazing. <br /> <br /> But it's not a good material. After a massive rewrite, it might have been worth it, but "United States Of Leland" is heavy, inert, and for a film that seems to love "depth", it is really superficial.
