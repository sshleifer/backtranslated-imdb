Not as bad as 1992's "Nails" (where Hopper plays an unstable cop) but pretty bad. How can a movie with such a big cast go so bad? This film manages to find a way. The story was pretty stupid and Hopper's direction seemed never to have been directed before. All the long shots at the beginning were annoying. Many meaningless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue.
