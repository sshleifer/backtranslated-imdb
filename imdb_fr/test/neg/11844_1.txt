The defining scene of this movie is when the fat boy leaves, but the devilish doctor just gives him one last homework, check on the dinosaurs. Keep in mind that he does not have this job anymore and that he does not pay for it at all.Also keep in mind that it is a dinosaur and that the doctor in whom he is supposed to trust is a devil and does not like him. I can go mountain biking between them, but hey, other than that, the people of Paraguay are very kind.Eric Roberts gives his worst performance so far, there is no adjective to describe what he is bored Corbin Bernsen records what is to save and you start to pick on himself, but they must stick to the formula of course. How far can your acting career go? Special effects are so embarrassed You expect a "Studio 3" sign to appear in the frame. She's not even honest, she's drawn from "Carnosaur", who even sucked on her own. And then, I wonder why movie.
