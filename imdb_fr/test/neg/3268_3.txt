Caddyshack II is NOTHING compared to the original Caddyshack. But, there are legitimate reasons for that. (1) Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this movie BUT he did not like the script, he wanted to change it, his request was refused, he did not shoot the film. (2) It was a small budget, Bill Murray had become a superstar. Ted Knight died in 1986, and Chevy Chase "the so-called ace" of the first movie (though it was Rodney all the way) could not last more than 5 minutes because it would cost him too much. BUT you had Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack, Randy Quaid and Jackie Mason, all helpful replacements, who had no better performances.
