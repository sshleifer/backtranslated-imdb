I rented this one by accident. I raised the video and looked down and thought about "Blair Witch's unscrupulous scam". Then, in a moment of carelessness, I grabbed 'The Francisville Experiment', thinking it was something else. My horror on arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this movie had to offer. Boring characters, bad acting, and a feeling of "we've seen the Blair Witch project and we could do the same thing" permeate the action to the point where fast-forwarding will take you straight to the credits. I'm not one to blame filmmakers for being lazy or hopeless, but after this yawning party, I felt the need to warn everyone: do not waste your time, you have a life.
