I bought the DVD to get Julia Ormond. Well, I got it shoveled. She was adorable in romantic scenes; Too bad that Bill Paxton flies in autopilot during all the effort. I almost lost my lunch when he pulled out his big white suit behind his flight suit to say "let's get on with" Julia. <br /> <br /> I realized that Julia had a good command of French while looking at her in Sabrina '. I watched 'Sabrina' with the French soundtrack to see if Julia doubled her own dialogue. They used someone else. Anyway, Julia was chosen for this Dutch film compared to a French speaker whose English is enough to communicate with the American public. Maybe they wanted at least a household name for the Anglo-American market. For my unknown look, Julia's features could be considered as Belgians. <br /> <br /> The whole movie had a strange nature. It was a Dutch film about Belgium during the Second World War. I imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic resistance from the Dutch to the German invaders. Belgians were much more passive during the occupation period than the French or Norwegians. The wildest fight of all took place in the Balkans, where the communist supporters of Tito have given reason to the Germans. <br /> <br /> In another review, I noted that "dbdumonteil" thought that Julia Ormond was an American rather than British nationality. Maybe Julia's acting skills were enough to take away that impression. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie several times, I suddenly realized how out of season the movie was. It takes place on January 16, 1944 when the American plane crashes on a Belgian farm. The trees seem to be in mid-autumn with lots of leaves and it's hot. People walk around in light clothes and the grass is always green. There is not a trace of snow or ice. The winter in Belgium was the sweetest of all times. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie was a disaster. Where to start? For all those interested in the history of the Second World War, the film is a joke. The reconnaissance aircraft used was a huge converted four-engine bomber. Such planes existed, but they would have needed a massive escort of hunters for a chance to survive. In reality, smaller and faster planes were readily available and would have been much more suited to the task. The vital code books of the film would never have been carried on the plane. The crew did not need this information to carry out its mission, but compromising this information would have been a huge defeat in intelligence matters. Even considering the principle of the film, the first items to be removed from the plane would be the code books. They would have gone to Berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of German troops at the crash site. <br /> <br /> The house of the Daussois, where the "commander Brice" had taken refuge, was a farm where nobody had any interest in agriculture. The food would have been very rare in Belgium at that time. The Germans would have needed substantial amounts of locally produced food to support their forces. The family truck was expropriated long before the arrival of the American traveler. In any case, he would have had no fuel to make it work. <br /> <br /> The plot in which Henri Daussois transforms jealousy in America is pathetic. He would have had to reveal everything he knew about resistance to be able to live. It should have operated as a dual agent to counteract any effective opposition. The woman on the secret radio would never have survived the war. <br /> <br /> "Major Brice" was taken in civilian clothes towards the end of the film. This made him a spy under the laws of war and punishable by defenseless execution. He would not have been obedient enough to be interrogated without the Geneva Convention hindering him. Better to force them to kill him and spare his friends if possible. <br /> <br /> I have not read the novel on which this film is based. If this film is a faithful adaptation, it shows a lack of abominable development in the novel. Regardless of the novel, writers could have easily produced a high-quality screenplay that would not miss the opportunity to make a much better movie.
