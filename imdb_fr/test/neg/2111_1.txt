Can I start by saying that I'm a fan of bad movies? And it's a very bad movie. There are 100 passengers, 3,000 snakes, but I think it is more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes. <br /> <br /> Snakes do not do anything interesting, the whole movie is actually just gaffes with little going on. Although from time to time there is a good bloodshed in Goo's arms and go-ahead (the bad movies have to get the green light, do not they?). <br /> <br /> But the end comes and will literally hit you. you are sitting in hysteria. and for that, this movie gets a bonus of up to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> There are some movies in the world that you will want to show your friends, so you can see their reaction when a certain event occurs in them. <br /> <br /> For example, the arrival of "Big Man" in R Kelly's "trapped in the closet" "The LINE" in "Shark Attack 3" (you'll know when you hear that) L Mama Shark's arrival in 'Shark Attack 3' Almost all scenes from 'Troll 2' The end of 'Dracula 3000' (just for disbelief and confusion) and the end of this movie stands proudly in this category. It's worth sitting down just for that. So, get drunk, fuck yourself, whatever your poison, and watch this movie with friends. <br /> <br /> Simply, if you like bad movies, go get this, but do not confuse it with 'Snakes on a plane' ... there is no relationship. <br /> <br /> And do not pay more than one dollar for that either ...
