I had never left a movie before this one. I had the idea a few times, but this time, I slipped to see the end of another movie, but I had to come back to see the end of Rage while I waited for my friends . They told me that I did not miss a lot during my absence. The film as a whole has generally offended me, so dramatically that I can not even describe it. My instinct told me to get out of the theater. It was a visceral reaction to a horrible movie. The plot centered on the cruel actions of some reprehensible teenagers against vulnerable and disturbed people. There was no ray of light, no sensitive or friendly person to create a contrast. I found that even the "good guys" of the movie did not do anything to me, that they were stupid, stupid, ridiculous or simply ineffective. repugnant. (Not in a way "I am easily disgusted", but more in the representation of the non-respect of humanity). And in addition to the repetition of this scene, in slow motion, from many angles, the other visual aspects (interesting photographic work, etc.) had potential, but sometimes became troublesome. I am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them. Usually, I can find good things to counterbalance the worst of any movie. I'm not saying that this movie was not good, but I say that, whatever it may have been, I do not remember with all the other bullshit that drove me crazy. I'm really sorry for that too. Maybe the best parts were the clips of the classic original.
