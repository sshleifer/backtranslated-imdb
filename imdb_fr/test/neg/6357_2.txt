<br /> <br /> As a fan of bad movies (and MST3K, and member of MFT3K), I must say that I have seen my share. But damn it! Even the worst I've seen has at least had a soundtrack. While George Lazenby walks stiffly into Hong Kong, doing who knows what, you can be sure you will not be distracted by this ambient music that fills the cinema of today. Or all that music that fills the elevators. I do not think anyone in this movie hums. <br /> <br /> Now, that's not quite true - there is * a * sound track. if you listen carefully, you will hear the sound half a dozen times during the movie. Of course, the timing will be totally inappropriate and will not last very long, but something may be called "music". However, your best choice is to seat your toddler, armed with a wooden spoon, in front of the television, with a collection of pots and pans while you watch. The rhythm and fluidity would be better than anything the film offers. <br /> <br /> Watch Sammo Hung as a villain in this movie. Are not we all happy that he found Jackie Chan with whom to work?
