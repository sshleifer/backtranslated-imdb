Danny Glover and Carey Elwes have obviously forgotten how to play when they made this film, the acting is absolutely atrocious. The result is even worse. I'm sorry for Danny Glover, I hope he was well paid for that because it makes him look completely silly, the same goes for Mr. Elwes. An absolute slap in the face of any horror movie fan. Contemptible. It's probably the worst representation of veteran actors I've ever seen. I wonder if they bothered to watch the screenplay, or if they did, he had to say "forget everything you know about acting" because it makes them ridiculous. It is appalling for two veteran veterans to act, I hope the pay check was very large. I thought at first it was a travesty. If you can find satisfaction in this movie, then more power for you.
