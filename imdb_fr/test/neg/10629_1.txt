I rented this movie because it would take place in a jazz club - you know, those trendy and trendy places you could fall on Saturday night. Well, there is not an ounce of "cool" in this ridiculous movie. The score is wacky, the original songs are awful, the singing of the two main actors is continually distorted (to be nice) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than "boy meets girl", the game is laughable and the only decent cinematic moments are the archival scenes. The jazz club scenes present a sophisticated dialogue, stifled by overloaded organ music. This Joey de Francesco should keep his day job (unless his day job is useful for movie music). Is it possible not only to recover my four dollars, but also to pay for my therapy sessions? Curiously, this movie is so bad that you might want to watch it. A bit like driving by a serious accident - just look at least once. Just prepare the earplugs!
