I have not laughed so much in the theater for years. The only problem is that the movie did not intend to wring my throat because of the laughter. <br /> <br /> This film is full of bad CGI, an absolutely terrible duologue, a terrible * game *, and enough The references geek so that everything is only whole cheese. <br /> <br /> As a gamer and geek girl, I recognized all the obvious references of the game in this movie, as well as geek STUFF was thrown in the background as a candy to the eye (Steamboy's poster, thinkgeek.com t-shirts and j-list.com), and that never bought the movie back. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have been good at EVERYTHING was the ghost-like characters deliberately misplaced in CGI to give the impression that they were part of a game, and stolen OBLIGUALLY in Japanese horror movies. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it was hilarious, and it was something expected from the broadcast of a b-quality Sci-Fi channel for movie television. Do not expect more than that and you will have a good time. Just do not take a soda or you'll spit it everywhere when you get phrases like, "Why did you introduce this game into our life? WHY ?!"
