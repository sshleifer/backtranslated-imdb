A complete and total waste of my two precious hours. The entire film could have been shot in less than 60 seconds simply by showing people being hit, a broken car, people giving in, people having sex, people crying and people taking more. The slogan of this film should have read "Come see how much our characters are screwed up!" They are smashed! They are coke junkies! "Give us your money please, because we do not care about nothing else! "An absolutely terrible film, it never happened anywhere, we never got to know the characters (they never even said what these people had done to win a so big house and so much money, cars and coke), and that was downright boring.You might like the movie a bit more if you're a stoner yourself, but for the vast majority of them we who are not, this film is a loss of film and time.
