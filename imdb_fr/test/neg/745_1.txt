The filmmakers were clearly on drugs. That's the only explanation I have. How else do you explain this parody of an adaptation of Jane Austen? Northanger Abbey is a parody of a Gothic novel. But this film was made as if it were a Gothic novel. Strange music and dream sequences suggest to me hallucinations caused by drugs rather than a naive and innocent girl endowed with an imaginative imagination, as Catherine of the novel ... <br /> <br /> bug-eyed all the time. Peter Firth seems to be at least 10 years old too old to play Henry and he seemed a little cheerful. I do not see the attraction between him and Catherine. John Thorpe's performance was rather strange, but Isabella was actually not so bad. But nothing could save this movie PIECE OF CRAP! One last thing: this film invents a character who does not appear in the book, a French friend of General Tilney, "The Marchioness". Why exactly they added it exceeds me. It must have been the drugs. She looks scary, with a white background, red lips and black lines painted randomly on her face (dimples?). <br /> <br /> One would think that it would be at least entertaining in a "so bad it's" good quality "but unfortunately it is not, it's just BAD.
