"It's like this city has the power to suck your head." -Patti <br /> <br /> Patti (Christina Ricci) is a sarcastic teenager who is bored with living in a small town. Bored until a woman is kidnapped and finds what she believes are clues to locate the poor lady. Now with the help of his precious cat "D.C." and an inept agent of the FBI (Doug E. Doug), she must find her. <br /> <br /> This Darn Cat is a bad movie. It's pretty stupid and it has humor that often falls flat enough. There are however some buds of talent. Doug E. Doug was good at Cool Runnings. His performance as `Senga 'was really funny. Here he is lost as an FBI agent. He still has a good scene when he imitates the cat. Micheal Mckean plays Patti's father. His character must be the most understanding parent ever to have lived. This poor guy has his dear cigar crushed, he is arrested for picking up his own cat, and gets pissed off by his snippy wife and STILL does not get angry with his daughter for causing all her troubles. I wish my old man was like that. The only real performance is that of Christina Ricci. She is amusing like Patti, always bored, but her very bad occasional dialogue lowers her performance. You can also recognize Peter Boyle (the young Frankenstein, Everyone loves Raymond), the old lady of Wings and Cliff of Cheers, in this movie. It's a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget. Even the cat is not very good ... I really can not recommend That Darn Cat from 1997. Some young children (under 8 years old) might enjoy a little, but everyone else should go elsewhere. If you are looking for a good movie about Christina Ricci, I suggest the values ​​of the Addams family, The Opposite of Sex or Sleepy Hollow. If you're looking for a fun family movie, try Snow Day instead. <br /> <br />
