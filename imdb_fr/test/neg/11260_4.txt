This is a disappointing adaptation of James Lee Burke's novel "In the Electric Mist of Confederate Deaths". It is rather badly acted mainly because of the bad interpretation of the main actors. Tommy Lee Jones, a normally good actor, does not capture Burke's "Dave Robicheaux". As the main enemy of Robicheaux, John Goodman does a sloppy job as "heavy". The guy who plays actor-boyfriend Robicheaux does not look like a former leader of "A". The rest of the film is mainly composed of local names that do not do justice to a great novel. <br /> <br /> Jones's film and performance are far too hurried for one thing. Robicheaux, in Burke's series of novels, gives the impression that he fits well into his environment most of the time, that he is relaxed and slow. It's like the deep south and the south of Louisiana. Sometimes, Robicheaux is almost maniacal in his efforts. Jones moves quickly through the entire movie. It does not vary. Ned Beatty is wasted. Mary Steenburgen is out of place. About the only good thing about this is the parameter. Overall, the film gives the impression of a TV movie.
