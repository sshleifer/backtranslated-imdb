Bloody Birthday opens with a shot from the Meadowvale General Hospital. Three babies are being born exactly at the same time during a total eclipse. A legend informs us that it is now "Meadowvale, California, June 1, 1980". Two teenage lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) go to work in an open grave. They hear noises and Duke investigates. Duke and Annie are both murdered. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is perplexed and has only one hint for a child's jump rope that Annie was holding. Unfortunately, before Sheriff Brody can solve the case, her younger daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends, Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman), murder her. . Just as they are finishing Sheriff Brody from another boy in their class, Timmy Russel (KC Martel), the three killers do not know how much he has seen. Shortly after the incident, Timmy plays with Steven and Curtis in a break. Curtis locks Timmy in an old locker. Timmy manages to escape and warn his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but she does not believe it at first. The three children continue their murderous adventure. Their strict teacher, Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg), a couple in love (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbie's older sister, Beverly (Julie Brown), are among their victims. Joyce begins to have suspicions about Debbie, Curtis and Steven, which makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Can they convince the authorities that these three innocent 10-year-olds are really soulless killers? <br /> <br /> Co-written and directed by Ed Hunt, I do not really like this movie. I think it's absolutely horrible and it does not look good, it's an 83-minute race. The scenario of Hunt and Barry Pearson gives us no explanation for the motivations of child killers other than the solar eclipse that blocks Saturn and, therefore, for a strange astrological reason, these three children have no consciousness. They are the only children born of this birth. a total eclipse? If this is true, why are they waiting a little before their tenth birthday before starting their slaughter? I guess it suddenly comes, right? To his credit, he's pretty well paced, but I've always found him incredibly boring and tedious. The film as a whole is not very exciting and predictable, the kids are revealed as killers in the first 10 minutes and, as I said, no motive is given. It's also very stupid sometimes. Watch the scene where Debbie stops Steven by throwing him a bowl of water! The sheriff's death is imputable to him. Some injuries, caused by this type of accident, will not be the same as if you were beaten to death with a baseball bat as it actually was, regardless of the competent doctor. or the pathologist would have spotted it within 5 seconds. There is not a single drop of blood spread throughout the film and all lame murders are bland and unimaginative. Debbie loads 25c to let the boys look through a hole while her sister Beverly undresses. There is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the microphone is clearly visible at the top of the screen, not even a little bit. The general incompetence persists throughout the film. All production is bland and instantly forgettable. The acting is always mediocre, these three children are very annoying and have pissed me off since the beginning. They made this film even more painful, especially Curtis in his oversized giant glasses. I hate this movie really, as simple as that. I can not think of one good thing to say about it. Certainly one to avoid.
