The Other Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with the book on which he claims to be based. This film is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand that they were changing or developing some things. The book is not perfect, but it was well written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make it a little more faithful to what really happened, to what Anne Boleyn was - but it's not even close to historical accuracy. It's just down. Fluffless, made up. A real shame. <br /> <br /> For starters, the writer and director seemed to think it was a good idea to stage the story as if it were a reality show. Seriously. They have the Boleyns sitting in front of the camera, confessing what they REALLY feel about what is happening in their lives. Anne Boleyn sits in a confessional (not the kind of church, the real world genre) and chooses what she wants to say and why she just wants to sit and smile. She looks stupid to have to use such a modern movie machine in a film set in the 1500s. It's "The Real World: Tudor England!" <br /> <br /> Jodhi May is a very good actress and after "The Aristocrats" and "A Turn of the Screw", I became a real fan. But she should never have been chosen as Anne. In fact, I think she would have been a better Marie. Natascha McElhone was a bad choice. She is a good actress, of course, but she has very modern features and does not seem convincing in period costume. (Honestly, I spent the first half of the movie trying to figure out if she was "this girl" from "The Truman Show." She was too.) She's also too old to play young Mary, so for a reason unknown, makes Mary the oldest of the sisters. It makes no sense, I know. It's as if the BBC seemed to forget that these people were actually living. They distort history and invent things left and right. I feel ridiculous to have to correct the BBC for historical inaccuracies, but REALLY! <br /> <br /> Apart from the two sisters, the rest of the cast was very well chosen. Steven Mackintosh seemed to me a brilliant choice for George, and his casting is the real reason why I decided to look for this film. Big mistake. He does a great job, of course, but he is barely there. How can one claim to adapt The Other Boleyn Girl without mentioning George Boleyn? It's just absurd. Philip Glenister was another very good casting decision, but again, was hardly in the finished product. <br /> <br /> The real problem with this is the script. There is no way around that. It's bad. It's really, really bad. It's too melodramatic and not engaging. Anne is represented as an aerial head, Mary as the leader and George as the follower. Mary's first husband is barely mentioned, her relationship with the king is never explained - they simply do not tell the story that Phillippa Gregory wrote. All this seems like a huge waste. I have no desire to see this thing a second time. I guess I'll just have to reread the book and hope that Natalie Portman's version, which will come out next year, will be much better. <br /> <br /> * Note: to date, the only way to get it The American miniseries is on the last record of the miniseries 'The Six Wives of Henry VIII.' It's an excellent miniserie, but it can cost between $ 50 and $ 60, and it's way too much to spend if you're just looking for that waste.
