As a fervent Disney fan, I was not totally impressed by this film, and I'm certainly not motivated enough to see it in movie theaters. I'm so glad I caught him on DVD and watched the special features. <br /> <br /> You MUST consult the "Moose commentary": the entire movie can be viewed with the comments of Rutt and Tuke, the comic relief moose of the story, which is voiced by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas . Two veterans of the famous comedy troupe Second City ad-lib - in the role - for an hour and a half about a movie they clearly love. I laughed all the time. The pleasure I got from this comment completely compensated for the lukewarm reaction I had in front of the movie. Do yourself a favor and listen to it!
