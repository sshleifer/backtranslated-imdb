This movie was horrible. If it had never been done, the world would be better. Come on, a flying wagon? What were they thinking? It was a sub-par movie with a horrible hitch, and I'd like a written apology from the studio that produced it, as well as some cookies to help me pay back the time I lost in that party. shit that I will never be able to recover. If you paid to watch this movie, I'm really sorry because I watched it on TV on a Sunday afternoon when I had nothing better to do and it almost ruined my whole week. A freaking WAGON flying?!?! And is that supposed to compensate for having a horrible mother who cares more about her needs than her children? No wonder they do not have the sense to tell someone that he beats them, their mother teaches them nothing but what she wants comes first. Absolutely horrible.
