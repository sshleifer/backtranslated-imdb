Okay ... she's on the boat with this guy, realizes he's ready to kill her, knocks him out, then finds out the reason he wants to take her, that's the record that killed his colleague. So what would a rational person do? Maybe bailing him again to make sure he's really out ?? Tie it ?? Listen, darling, you're lucky enough to escape while the guy has not been here for so long. Until you know how long it will take you to escape, make sure he is not able to pursue you. I hate those stupid roles of female victim. The rest of the movie was just a series of completely complicated twists and unbelievable to keep interesting.
