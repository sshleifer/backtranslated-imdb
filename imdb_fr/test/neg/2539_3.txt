On a return flight from London, I watched She is the man; Apparently, Air Canada has a shit policy. This may not be the best way to start a critique of this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves football so much that she claims to be her twin brother to be part of a team at a boarding school in the city. Even if you check your mind at the door (on a 6-hour flight you must), the story is implausible and ridiculous. There are some moments of humor, mainly of comedian David Cross as a principle, but the complex love polygon does not really inspire emotions, although it is cleverly mixed (with the warning of an unthinking plausibility ). The end is as ridiculously stupid as the rest. I guess if I was a 12 year old girl, I might have really enjoyed this one.
