Well, there is not much to say about this movie. it's just trash. very bad acting, mediocre story and lame story ... well, the actress, (I do not even know her name) who played the main role, (not the blonde one but the latina) acted well, but has played the main character's friend ,,, his acting level is just like the high school game, so like most other actors in the movie. In addition, zombies ,,,, very bad acting as well. and, history itself really does not make sense. Well, if you're really bored and you really have nothing to do, but you want to waste time, you might want to watch this movie, but it's still millions of B movies better than this shit. its total waste of money and time.
