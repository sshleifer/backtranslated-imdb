I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see that it was made cheaply. Wrong scenario and very bad acting. I read several versions of the book of different authors and I also listened to a version of an audiobook. We could not take the film seriously because of the missing elements that it should have contained. It was as if witch Blair had visited Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy using a bowl and show the contents. The witch throws the contents on the boy and the whole family laughs. I thought it was nasty and very strange. I really can not understand why anyone would think it would be fun. This shows another scene where Dr. Mize arrives and Betsy Bell is urinating on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers. Instead of the mother taking her, he is the brother. How sick The little boy in the first scene of the many scenes dealing with how your body eliminates garbage calls for toilet paper, goes to the house and gives these cheering faces joyful sound effects. I think they should have left all that aside. Reverend James Johnston's makeup as an elderly man does not really suggest he was older. That made you think he was soaked in fish dough. The blood on Joshua Gardner when he falls off the ladder is even worse. The scene of John Bell's death gives the impression that they have taken out some flour and tried to do something to make it look like a seriously ill man. For me, a disgusting comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the fall of this image. These people would do better if they were running commercials for local TV channels for their bathroom products. They chose a good subject and were unable to produce it properly. I note this movie Capital F less.
