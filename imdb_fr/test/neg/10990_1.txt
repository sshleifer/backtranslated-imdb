I had a different experience with this movie - it has never been charming, delightful or fun for me. A big clue that it was not your typical film was that the label gave no indication of the language (s) spoken in the movie. another problem was the lack of choice regarding subtitles. <br /> <br /> The lack of dialogue was embarrassing, especially if it was accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions, as was always the case. The madly incoherent development of the weak plot was confusing. Were there characters, or only vague gestures? Was there even a plot? <br /> <br /> on another subject, I am asked to correct the spelling of "dialogue", with the suggested substitute of "dialogue". Maybe this movie in its entirety, including the IMDb part, is designed to puzzle or marvel, but I'm starting to get more pissed off than amused.
