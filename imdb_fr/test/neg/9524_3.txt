AKA <br /> <br /> Format: 3 x 1.78: 1 in a setting of 2.39: 1 (triptych) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> 1978: On the move The teenager of the class (Matthew Leitch) assumes a false identity and gate society, where he learns hard lessons on the divisions between Rich and Poor. <br /> <br /> Autobiographical article by director Duncan Roy (JACKSON: MY LIFE ... YOUR FAULT), an expos√© of the pre-Thatcherian aristocracy, through the eyes of a low-rent "commoner" whose the vision of the world is transformed by his adventures among the upper classes. Unfortunately, Roy's script says very little that we do not already know about the excesses of the idle rich, and the narrative is only briefly inflamed by Leitch's relationship with a handsome boy of self-destructive income (Peter Youngblood Hills ) who proves to be no less hypocritical than the people he seeks to imitate. Also starring Diana Quick (scandalous snob who believes the working class is "embarrassed to be alive!"), Bill Nighy plays the black sheep of a wealthy family, Lindsay Coulson ("EastEnders"), Blake Ritson ( DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS) and Georgina Hale in a typically flamboyant cameo, showing her breasts to everyone, regardless of the world! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, much of the film's impact is tempered by Roy's insistence on using a Triptych effect (three separate 1.78: 1 images are sent to a mailbox in frame 2.39: 1, each offering a different perspective on each scene.), which reduces the image and keeps viewers away from onscreen events. A long film useless, too personal for a broad appeal and embarrassed by a cinematographic process that does not reconcile history. A version for a single image is also available (framed theatrically at 1.85: 1), with the title on the screen, AKA: Lies are like dreams.
