The Jaws scam is the most trash of Italian "genres", and director Joe D'Amato is the second behind the great Jess Franco in producing trashy movies. Put the two together and what do you get? A huge waste, of course. Unfortunately, this is not pure waste either, Deep Blood offering more annoyance than hilarity. To the merit of the film, he actually tries something that borders on the plot; but to take the credit of the film - the plot is hogwash. This has something to do with a group of friends taking an oath and then an Indian curse that manifests itself as a shark. Or at least I think that's what was happening. Anyway, the majority of the film is stuffed with boring dialogues and "dramas", and the shark itself - which we do not forget - is the only thing we really want to see - is just in a cameo role. Or not even since most sharks are actually archive footage! Although this is a kind of trash, there are a lot of fun scams at Jaws; but with this one, Joe D'Amato clearly shows that he could not even be tempted to try, and the result is what must be the worst Italian shark movie of all time. Avoid these slags.
