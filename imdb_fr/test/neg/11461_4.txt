This continuation of the above - and the last entry of the series "Kharis" - is slightly more pleasant overall, but it is also more artificial (damn it, we even have a singing waitress / hostess!): Peter Coe is by far the least charismatic of the various Egyptian high priests whom we have seen in these films, and Martin Kosleck, his henchman, seems to be losing interest in the proceedings; Kurt Katch then struggles with a ridiculous accent while the man who discovers the newly reincarnated princess Ananka: the latter, in the form of Virginia Christine (later a popular actress in the character), gets his most substantial role . , the sequence of his resurrection of the marshes is a highlight, not only of this film, but of the whole series. Unfortunately, here too, Chaney does not have much to do, again, the focus is on Ananka, as I said; his mom (in which he came back most often to Universal - apart, of course, from his iconic role as The Wolf Man!) is undoubtedly his least memorable monster for the studio.
