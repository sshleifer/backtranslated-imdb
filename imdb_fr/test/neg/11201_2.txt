Have you ever done this? I go to my local video store and see some news in the "black film" section. I see a copy of the newcomer of a movie I have never seen is called NAKED ALIBI. It is one of those mail order companies that offers (mostly) dupey copies of hard-to-find titles. The description on the box sounds good. The film has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame and Gene Barry). So I bring him home and look at him. About ten minutes after the beginning of the film, I started thinking. About half way through this movie, I started to dislike. At the end of the film, not only did I hate him, but I despised him. The film begins with cops questioning Al Willis on suspicion of theft. In addition to being drunk, the police have nothing on him. When he pushes a cop and asks to go home, the cops beat him. Detective Conroy arrives, lets the cops finish being beaten and announces that Willis is in the clear. Willis swears he will take revenge. Later, one of the policemen is shot. In the absence of any other proof that Willis is "sore" about the beating, Conroy makes Willis his only suspect, despite the fact that his boss names a pair of mobsters as suspects. Conroy stops him but, for lack of evidence, Willis is released. The next day, two more policemen are killed by a bomb. This time, Conroy goes to Willis' bakery and tries to make him confess. Conroy does not know, but a local journalist whose newspaper accuses the police brutality department of Conroys takes a picture of Conroy trying to strangle Willis and Conroy is fired. But Conroy continues his pursuit and Willis flees to Mexico where Willis has a mistress. Conroy manages to convince his mistress (which Willis treats rather brutally) to help prove that Willis is a killer. What is missing from this film is a compelling storyline. The script seems to indicate that only a rough draft was written and that the shooting started before the end of the script. Things happen, character personalities change, plot twists happen for no other reason than the script calls it. Aside from the fact that Willis likes to break a drink now and before, there's nothing in the first part of the film that makes us think he's a crazy killer who cheats on his wife. He treats his wife, child and employees well. At the beginning of the film, we have the impression that it's his Conroy who is a loose cannon. He seems to approve casually police brutality. Conroy, Willis has a criminal past without any reason. He seems to follow the motto of the old Bulgarian communist secret police. "Everyone is guilty of something, we have not discovered it yet." Later, Conroy shows kindness to Al's mistress and her young son. We are now supposed to love him. Sorry! The first impression I got from Conroy was too long. And he's also a stupid cop. It was only after his dismissal and his departure for Mexico that he checked Willis' background and discovered that a warrant was issued against him in Maryland. Why had not he thought of it before? Because this movie did not take enough time. The casting is good. Gene Barry does well considering how badly his role of Al Willis is. I'm a big fan of crime thrillers of the '40s and' 50s, but not only did I not think this movie was good, it left me with a bitter taste (which many modern movies do, but older movies seldom do it) ).
