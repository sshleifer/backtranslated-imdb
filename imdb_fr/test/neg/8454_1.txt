I caught him during a brief run in a Philadelphia theater. Despite his local provenance (and his connection to a tragedy of his hometown, namely the sudden death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I really have to seriously tackle this film. The director, for reasons he knows well, decided to shoot the film in its entirety as a guerrilla, with non-stop mobile cameras and quick cuts. Such a technique may be suitable for scenes of violent violence, but is completely inappropriate for the rest of the material, which is the majority of the film. A stroll on the sidewalk, a brother-to-brother chat on a couch, hell, even a kiss on a first date are all turned to cusinart, thus preventing the viewer from getting into the drama. Martin also compromises his speech by addressing too many topics: besides the birth of violence by the crowd, we have anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental abuse ... have I forgotten something? Perhaps a better distribution (and a more targeted direction) would have united these links, as Martin surely wanted, to show that a moral defect leads and supports a host of others ... but the good ones intentions do not necessarily have movie do. Just a sprawling mess. Martin, I know you're from my hometown, and I'm with you guy, I'm really ... just doing a better job next time, like you did in Two Plus One.
