It sounds like an exciting prospect, an "Othello" in modern costume with Christopher Eccleston, who was terribly good in "Shallow Grave" and (especially) "Jude" and Eamonn Walker, who brought such intensity and introspection to its central role on "Oz". One might think they are both natural Shakespearians, but the two performers have flops: Walker's Othello is more like a biscuit cutter, with a discreet delivery that does not have much impact; and Eccleston rejects him frightfully like Iago, winking at the camera in an almost outrageous parody of the role. It is likely that his director motivated him. His flourishing approach may have worked better with the Elizabethan language, but it seems a discordant and pretentious choice for this modernized scenario. And the scenario itself is less disappointing to be modern than to be obvious ?? it's as if Andrew Davies had sketched the famous plot and then wrote the dialogue that first appeared to him. All in all, a failure. 4 out of 10
