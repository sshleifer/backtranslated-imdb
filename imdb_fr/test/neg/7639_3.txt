A lack of development of the character is fatal for this film. The character of Valeria Golino, Grazia, begins to look like a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. The other characters are thin, probably the fault of the author, not the actors. Filippo Pucillo, his youngest son, is the only exception. His energy and bravado are fun and convincing. <br /> <br /> I guess the petty cruelty of children is supposed to help create a dark atmosphere and emphasize the invading primitive spirits in the city, but for me, gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to general boredom of the film. Some scenes were fun, but not necessarily intended for this, for example, when abused dogs are big and healthy and seem to be ready to be shown. Pretty cast and frame make an attractive trailer but can not wear the entire movie.
