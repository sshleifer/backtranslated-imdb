This is another remake of a Hollywood movie by Bollywood. Hitch ... If I'm not mistaken. <br /> <br /> The film contains great moments that will make you laugh out loud and come frankly only Govinda, become a legend in the Indian cinema and always bringing his A game in terms of comedies. Rajpal Yadav is another bonus; who is hilarious like the gangster who imitates "Don", an Indian movie icon. Lara Dutta is an asset ... I know I look shallow, but it's mainly because I have a thing for her, she tries to be funny, but it seems forced. Her game is weak ... but she still shines. Salman Khan is atrocious, he tries to bring back the cool and charming depths but fails miserably, he acts and continues to shout for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> "It's not a companion, it's called a mental challenge" <br /> <br /> Katrina Kaif is just bad ... not very good for nothing. No charisma, no talent ... and I do not see why people consider it pretty ... The plot was far-fetched and I had a hard time believing that Katrina's character was attracted by far by Govinda. The only good thing is the music ... "You are my love" was the best of the soundtrack.
