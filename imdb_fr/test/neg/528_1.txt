I lost 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before giving up. The main character is completely clueless and incredibly unfriendly, but there is no humor in his clumsiness. Upon arrival in Germany, the screenwriter pulls the old "there is only one room in the hotel, you will have to share a room with a pretty girl" stuntman. Come on, at least you could let them develop their relationship a little bit first. Watch "It Happened One Night" to see how to do it right - or any of the thousand movies since. <br /> <br /> The acting game is still in the third class and the improvised dialogue should have remained in place the floor of the cutting room. It meanders without any plan, despite the fact that the film indicates the destination of the relationship from the introduction of Greta. <br /> <br /> The first song, in the conference room, is slightly funny and badly sung. The rest of the songs (well, to be honest, I only heard those of the first half hour) are simply useless and awful. Most singers are painfully out of order, but not intentionally humorous.
