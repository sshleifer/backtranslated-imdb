It's definitely the worst vampire movie of all time. I started watching this just after Interview with the vampire and I was completely disappointed. The scenario of this film not only had craters as big as the grand canyon, but the film seemed to jump from one scene to another, leaving the audience completely perplexed. The vampire Lestat played by Stuart Townsend was terrible: having a good body does not make you an actor! The end of the queen was too easy and sudden, insulting the intelligence of the viewers. I'm going to give this star because Aaliyah did her best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. Otherwise, I would advise Anne Rice to take an ax and start hacking those who destroyed her brilliant story.
