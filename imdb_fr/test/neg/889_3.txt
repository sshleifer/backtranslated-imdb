I do not know why the producers had to exchange the name of a rather successful film franchise, because the title suggests that it is a continuation of the first three films ... which is not the case. Although Marques Houston appeared in "HP3", he played a totally different character (he was eight years older) in this movie. Ok ... so Reid and Martin were not the most talented and could not make a film alone .. but talk about the HP franchise seems to have made some sort of reference (even minor) to the first films. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was "deceived" - thinking they saw a sequel - not a totally different movie with a familiar name. And I'm sorry ... Kym Whitley is not funny, and did not stand up to Robin Harris, Ketty Lester or DC Curry in previous movies. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual deviation ... I have to give this a heart stroke !! Naming the movie "Until the last minute" would have been good. In addition, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three films) did not participate in the production of this film.
