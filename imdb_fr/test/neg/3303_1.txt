Above all, you should not take this movie seriously. Unfortunately, it is taken seriously, but we can not help it. This ninja animated film must be the ultimate success by canceling what could have been an engaging story, so original, with twists of conspiracy, ridiculous cuts that kill time, and a scandalous guest appearance that will make you laugh or cry. , like me). <br /> <br /> Although I'm usually a fan of anime ninja / samurai (Ninja Scroll and Rurouni Kenshin, to name a few), this one must be exceptional. For the record, from a technical point of view, this film was very well animated and built. It's just the plot that stank. The authors of this film have clearly decided (for what rational reason, I do not know) that they could compensate for the lack of scenario if the character on the other side of the world in search of a treasure that his father had fought and died for. In the process, he rescues a black slave named Sam, meets a French girl who lives in an Apache village, befriends a ninja clan whose members then try to kill him, meets more family members than he no longer knew how strange he was. places and circumstances (and all of which subsequently die at some point in the film). <br /> <br /> Even so far, these ridiculous rejects of intrigues could be excused, but then come the two "apparitions". # 1: After a ridiculous confrontation with two cowboys, Jiro meets a man who introduces himself as "Mark Twain". At this point, you probably say "What the ****? !!" This "meeting" has one goal: it totally discredits a film that tries to add an educated historical background. I found it disappointing that the authors did everything in their power to research the United States in the 1860s and did not know that the real name of "Mark Twain" was Samuel Clemens. # 2: When Jiro finally finds the treasure, it turns out that it belonged to Captain Kidd. I can now hear the moans of disgust. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are the scenes running. These scenes show various characters running, the landscape moving statically behind them for several minutes, and there are many. These are the scenes that make this film, which lasts 2 hours 12 minutes, seems to last a week and a half. <br /> <br /> If you and your friends are looking for a bad subtitled movie that just wants to have fun, that's it. Feel free to make fun of all possible aspects and have fun. Do not take it seriously. 3/10
