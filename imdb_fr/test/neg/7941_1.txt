"Assault on Precinct 13" original is concise, witty and - perhaps more importantly - short. This remake is ruthlessly padded and talkative. Worse still, the African-American hero of the first film is replaced here by the handsome white boy Ethan Hawke, which makes this "assault" less progressive than that of the 1970s. My god, John Carpenter, his improbable intrigue and sense of strange humor I miss. His list B players, who are better leagues than Hawke and his company, I miss. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I care about the new villains in this version: they stretch the little credibility that history has ever had. at the limit. The female characters are useless, the criminals are all generic and Gabriel Byrne gives another of his bored performances. The music is just as wrong - it's bland action stuff that lowers tension. Simply horrible.
