I think I finally saw the worst film ever made, and it hurts me to say. Great amateur of independent cinema, gay or other, I had high hopes. A few minutes after the beginning of the film, the sheriff appeared and voted for the worst actor of this century or any other century. His performance, and the dialogue he was forced to perform, caused me the unusual stop of stopping the DVD. A few hours later, when I had enough courage to press the play button again, it was not better. <br /> <br /> Aside from the sheriff and his racist cartoon deputies, the film has an appealing cast for which I felt sincere sympathy since they had such a miserable script. The idea behind the film is good - use the lynching of homosexual men in the "New South" in the same way as on black men in the Old South, leaving a "strange fruit" hanging on trees. <br /> <br /> With an accomplished scriptwriter and director, we might have had a movie. Instead, we get fake detective work, platitudes about homosexuality and a clich√© with a white man trying to save the situation. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that racism is still flourishing. The FBI is currently investigating a white bus driver in the Louisiana backcountry, who forced black children to go to the back of the bus. But this city is a cartoon and it's hard to believe everything you see or hear. <br /> <br /> There are some secondary intrigues in a weak attempt to try to make the main character more three-dimensional, but most of the time, they also fail miserably. <br /> <br /> For real masochists, the DVD contains deleted scenes that will let you run to the shelter. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first film makes me believe that the writer / director should pass a test and get a license before being able to make a movie. I would be anxious to see many of the cast members in better films, but it would be difficult to see anything else from this director.
