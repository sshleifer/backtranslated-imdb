I find it almost touching to see how Star Trek fans are desperately trying to love this movie despite its incredible number of flaws. <br /> <br /> For starters, none of the familiar characters is really a character so to speak. Scotty is portrayed as a clumsy handyman instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series. Uhura ... Gods, I can not even think of what they did to his character. His whole dialogue was painful to listen to. McCoy seemed to be a neurotic stepfather for Kirk instead of his trusted friend. Spock ... well, let's just say that Leonard Nimoy was terribly wasted. He was given a bad dialogue ("I do not think you've grasped the gravity of your situation, captain." Gravity, get it? Get it?) And you've made it almost a joke. Kirk ... oh man, do not throw me. William Shatner is a talented actor. To allow him to direct the film is to invite disaster. That's what we got. <br /> <br /> The plot is beyond ridicule. Giving a brother to Spock is a pretty hopeless story and a useless soap opera. But, let's go. The search for God Again, a weak base of ground. Do not you believe? OK, let's go with that too. So, assuming that the two elements of the plot above are healthy, what's wrong with the script? Well, on the one hand, it recycles a lot too much. The company, for example, is not functioning properly yet. Should we assume that Starfleet would send a badly failing ship with a small crew in a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to handle the situation? If that's the case, why not put it on a better ship as an advisor? Adding to that ... the crew is grossly incompetent. Scotty has the ship in pieces (and is apparently strong enough to bang his head while there are enemies on board!), Nobody seems to have noticed that the Klingon ship was taking off at a crucial moment (although the sensors are clearly showing the ship within firing range) and the crew seem all too familiar. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. If it's Starfleet's flagship product, it's amazing that the Klingons have not overthrown the Federation. <br /> <br /> As for the personal fight against pain, it was shit. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor, but even he could not save this turkey. In short, no one could. Of all the people involved, I guess Leonard Nimoy is the most embarrassed. I hope he is still. <br /> <br /> God be praised, the original cast did not give way to this crazy opus.
