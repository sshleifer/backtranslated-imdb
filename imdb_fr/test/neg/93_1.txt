I liked The Wrecking Crew (1999), the last of the three films in this series (the first being Urban Menace (1999), which I have not seen yet). I know it was baaaaad, but the three leaders did a decent job, all things considered. <br /> <br /> This, however, was really atrocious. Ice-T was terrible and he's the producer! I can not say I've ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who apparently never learned to spell), but his performance was one of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Miss Jones played very well in her small role, although she continued to make atrocious and racist "jokes" on her radio show after the tsunami in the south-east of Asia (and other occasions unfortunately). Well done, girl ... <br /> <br /> No one else has credit. Strangely, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (who are both very bad here) are much better in The Wrecking Crew, which was created with Urban Menace, at the same time as Corrupt. How does it work, I do not know. <br /> <br /> I will now try Ice-T's comment, to see if he apologizes for the movie or if he tries to make us believe it's a great piece. of filmmaking.
