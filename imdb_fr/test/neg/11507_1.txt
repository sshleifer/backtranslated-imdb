OMG, what Disney has been doing lately ... most of their new series are really nil. The suites of Zach and Cody are pretty good, but other series like Cory in the house, Wizards of Waverly Place are nil and unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sadie is just stupid and stupid. This is a teenage girl named Sadie who loves science, growing up and going through her daily life. There are his friends Margaret and Rain and his older brother, Hal. There all boring and stupid. Especially Margaret, who thinks she's the most popular girl in the school and thinks she's too pretty ... it's just awful. I hate all seasons of this show, it's just terrible in every way (the first season was better though). <br /> <br /> If you care about your life, you would not look at this shit, it's painful and stupid
