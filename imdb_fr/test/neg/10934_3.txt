The only reason I watched this was because of its stars, CASPAR Van Dien, Michael Pare & Eric Roberts & Catherine Oxenburg * & Jeniffer Rubin, all capable and have performed well in the past ,. NOT THIS TIME, a low serial killer story, You can guess who is the killer in the first scene. Very artificial in all respects, there is nothing to recommend in this disaster, my rating is * 1/2 POOR
