I tried to watch this adaptation, but it was so horrible that I could not torture myself like that. The performances were pretty poor except for Ariel. Fonda far exceeded the objectives in a role that had to be managed with some subtlety. I studied Shakespeare and saw many adaptations, and it's by far the worst I've ever seen. I wonder why someone made this film on Earth. Shakespeare can, and has been, beautifully adapted in many cases. This is not one of them. If you have to watch this movie, can I offer you a drinking game? Have a drink every time they come out of the book of the original idea and two glasses whenever Fonda surpasses. You should be pretty drunk in a very short time.
