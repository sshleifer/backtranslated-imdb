Seriously! Just watch this movie to understand everything that's wrong. It came out at a time when everyone was trying to make family films that everyone could enjoy (The Little Rascals, Mr. Nanny, etc.) but lacked charisma or enthusiasm. Each character in the film is angry, with the exception of the mother of Trixie, who shows only annoyance and weariness, probably because of the tired clich√©s enjoyed by this film. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, the biggest flaw of the film is not the acting, nor the shooting, but especially the writing. The lines we receive are reminiscent of Disney classics, though this film is heartbreaking, which He 'Walt has managed to remove. Junior's father (John Ritter) makes you angry without doing anything, simply because he lets Junior run unattended and warns him badly only when he writes a 200-pound monster on a blackboard. <br /> <br /> In addition, Junior's grandfather is particularly atrocious. For those of you who have seen the first, found this nauseating, and therefore, have not seen the second, "Big Ben Healy" as it is mentioned in this movie, is still a total shower. He rushes into John Ritter's house uninvited, settles into Junior's room, even though he says he hates Junior, and does nothing to speed up the film or support the film of any kind. way that it is. Instead, it marks the public by becoming a lazy free charger. <br /> <br /> Finally, we discover a wide variety of new characters, such as the poor, hateful, Trixie, who carries dynamite in her backpack, which she lights first, and then returns to Junior, who just looks big. In addition, Gilbert Gottfried returns in this film, this time playing the unpleasant director of the new Junior Elementary School. If Gilbert Gottfried is not strong enough to get the message across, I'll just summarize it: This movie stinks! <br /> <br /> Two stars out of ten, because the actor's convictions are reflected in the film, even if the scenario is zero. .
