Another French film to the absurd. Fuck Me (F * ck Me) tells the story of two young women who gather to kill and flee. One of them is a porn star who escapes from her community after being raped and killing her boyfriend. The second is a prostitute who kills her roommate and sees her boyfriend being killed. After these incidents, they meet at a subway station (both missing the last train), then everything starts. They find a connection and come very close. They sexually abuse, drug, drive across the country and have a lot of sex. It's all about fuck me really. We can see that they have no mercy for their victims. They even killed a woman for her money. The two actresses are real porn stars in France who affect the film in two different ways. They look so comfortable in the sex scenes, nevertheless, they can not make the whole movie interesting to watch because, for me, the movie does not need any more ability to act than that . It's a version of Thelma and Louise on a different level. I could recommend a lot of things to do instead of looking at Fuck Me. So, take the trouble to watch if you want to see a useless and perverse movie. * out of *****
