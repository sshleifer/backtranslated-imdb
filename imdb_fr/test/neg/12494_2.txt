This film was obviously made with a very small budget, but should they make it so obvious? It seemed like they were making no effort to make the "future" futuristic. For example, the first scene takes place in an 80s office building and all the exploding cars date from the late 1970s (I guess they did not want to blow up cars costing more than $ 500). Moreover, it is quite obvious that Don "the Dragon" drives his personal car during the film (after all, he partially financed the film). Finally, they emphasize at the beginning of the film that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new society "cyberpunk". Not only does it never become important in the film, but later, when don needs surgery without anesthesia, why does not he just go out to get legal heroin or morphine? All the movie is sloppy like that and totally anticlimatic since Don easily explodes an "unstoppable" Cybertracker about 25 minutes after the beginning of the film. However, if you find this movie cheap or free, I watch it, the last scene is almost worth supporting all this movie.
