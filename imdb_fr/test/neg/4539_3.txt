Everyone who sees this film will notice that the producers have invested a lot of money in this movie. It's interesting, they called it "The Hole"! Production values ​​are good for a short film. The hole is trying to seem big budget and in some ways, but is hampered by the video format on which it was shot. I think that if it was shot in 35mm, it would look incredible and increase the content somewhat. Many Hollywood movies have good looks and are enough for an audience, regardless of the story and content. <br /> <br /> My opinion, 3 out of 10 for this effort. Maybe the next Ishimoto film will deliver.
