I found that this movie was mainly a POSit was small budget, but that's not the problem.The problem is, the movie is just nil.It does not really make sense. Yes, that explains why things There was no reason for all this. The film has also evolved very slowly. The last ice age was faster than that. Plus, I think they went a little too far in death. That means they were too rude, but the murderer just seemed to spend too much time hitting his victim on the head or stabbing her. maybe I'm petty, but I just did not like the movie. Everything seemed like a low-rate version of "When a Stranger Calls" and that might be the problem. Stranger Kills "is a 4/10 *
