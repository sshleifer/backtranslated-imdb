I'm sorry, but it really looks like a modern Apollo 13 match. Totally implausible (at least Armageddon felt like a comic book! It sounded like a bad movie project in high school), playing was as clichéd as possible, and ... landing on a space shuttle on a Los Angeles expressway? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking? And all the clichés: the wife of the pregnant astronaut, the curious journalist who annoys everyone, the devoted director of "Go Fever". And it's one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or anything to make an entertaining story, but at least make it GOOD! Facts and science were totally slaughtered for that. The space shuttle does not have a fuel tank in the wings and, even if it did, it could not move by changing fuel between them (nor a DC-10). <br /> <br /> If you like bad acting, bad story, low realism and cheesy shots, this one is unbeatable!
