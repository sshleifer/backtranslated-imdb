This film was a complete disaster for me. There's one thing that movies have to be able to be watched, and that's * a * psychological credibility of the characters ... unfortunately, here is not the case. The main characters behave irrationally most of the time, and even if they have a reason to do so, the director does not reveal it to us. The character of Sophie Marceau is particularly annoying: he makes pictures throughout the film, while we could expect something more rational (for example, a meeting with his mother in the hospital). .. and why exactly did she marry her? (No, it's not a spoiler) The plot sometimes seems to be ripped from a soap-opera, and although the performance of the actors is not bad, it does not help much. Overall, I just could not find a way to communicate with this movie. Not that I tried too much after the first hour, though. I never left the cinema during a film, but this period was the closest to my life so far.
