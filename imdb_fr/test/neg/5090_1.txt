This is by far one of the most boring movies I have ever seen! And if you do not believe me, look at it yourself. <br /> <br /> The film begins slowly, the narrative makes no sense. People who fight do not make sense. I could not understand what they were talking about during the movie (in most cases, I did not even bother). This does not stop you from watching the movie, the only advantage being the cinematography. New Zealand looks great. The actors do their best to keep us awake, but unfortunately, you will sleep instead. <br /> <br /> Do us a favor, even if it goes to "On demand", do not watch it!
