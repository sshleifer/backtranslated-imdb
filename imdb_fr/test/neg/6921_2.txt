Sometimes, during televised debates, a good current affairs debate provokes interesting opinions from the public. Unfortunately, there is always a desperately sad person who seeks to be accepted and who will end any interesting debate by getting up and saying, "Everyone should get along and love each other" as they know they will be guaranteed applause and affirmation, because no one would dare to disagree. <br /> <br /> Well, it's the same people who called this film a good one, why did they do it? INSECURITY. In any case, that's all I'll say about it. <br /> <br /> The film begins reasonably interestingly, so you hope it will be built, and if like me you settled with a nice wine and cheese, then you will give him even more luck simply because you can not be disturbed to move. <br /> <br /> But then, you dream, you go astray, your mind drifts on other things, why? because the director did it too! he took the foot on the gas, then he realized 'ooops' to compensate, he accelerates strongly, but then he drifts again, and again you too, the story slows down, the plot is diluted and almost disappears, you you even ask yourself 'so what happened again?' As you think, your screen will show Nick Nolte running for a supposed purpose, but you'll worry about what he's been doing for a long time and he'll no longer appear as a screen saver in the background of your dream. <br /> <br /> Michael Moriarty who plays John Converse has an amazing ability to speak without moving his lips or even his face, a bit like a ventriloquist, he had to go to the school of facial actors without expression of Nicolas Cage, where he was attacked by the Phantom Botox injector. <br /> <br /> Tuesday, Weld was to interpret Marge Converse, but she interpreted Mia Farrow to perfection. <br /> <br /> In all, there are hundreds of thousands of movies to watch, so let this one to one of the last, you see that I just lost an evening watching it while I could have looked or done something else, learn by my mistake, the nights of relaxation are precious so do not lose one to look at this boring tale, do something else, dust off that old game of Cluedo, practice Gurni In the evening, or you argue with a loved one, cut the nose hair, get rid of unused files from our laptop, it will be time to spend what you want.
