I knew it would be a bad movie when I praised it, but I was hoping for a bad movie. Oh, I had fun making fun of the endless sand trail, eating camel dung (well, aubergine) and a funny grin on the part of an actor, I think. The DVD needs the director's comments so that I can know what he thought ... or if he did. I can not believe they went to England, Austria or elsewhere to film this ... could have been done EVERYWHERE. It would have been better if they had managed to put her naked. The best line of the film? "He's waiting for his updates." "Yeah, still waiting". Now that it was funny! If someone has more than 3 pages of dialogue (beyond the narrator ... SHUT UP ALREADY), I saw him again.
