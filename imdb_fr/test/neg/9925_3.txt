Even though I love Ellen Barkin (who is really underrated), I have to boo this movie. If you do not know who did it AND why, in the first half hour, you have obviously never seen a psycho-sexual thriller nor ever watched 20/20. It's as if the filmmakers and the actors were making fun of what they are doing and the way they play the characters is a deadly gift. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is used to light the dirty movie perverts who like to mix violence and sex. It's not a fun movie, but if you like Ellen Barkin, it's nice to see her take a hard place.
