It must be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Charles Band made the best film of 96 'in this little gem seen. Very realistic and incredibly stylized - with a visual flair that David Fincher would have envied, it's not hard to understand why Band went on to make classics such as 'The Regina Pierce Affair', 'Killjoy 2: The Rescue of Evil'. , 'Virgins of Sherwood Forest' and 'Timegate: Stories of Tramps on Horseback'. <br /> <br /> This film, very sophisticated, has a tiny body and a big head. He controls a family of crazy people who perform experiments on naked women. being a bit too much for young viewers and only for the most educated viewers, but for those who see it, Band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece. The head is the symbol of lost love and self-aspiration, which we all face at one time or another. It is for this reason that I was able to engage in this film on a deeply personal level. Although many previous critics have compared Band's film to Re-animator and other smaller works, it's still above average. It is more gorier, but not without reason. The gore in this film is well designed and used to improve the screenplay, rather than to get a cheap roar among the audience. In addition, the special effects of this film are absolutely top notch and are without a doubt the best work done in a horror movie since ... well ... never! In this film, Savini's effects resemble those of a blind, legless hobo. <br /> <br /> The only problem I encounter in this film is the large amount of frontal nudity, which was ultimately useless The composer's goal is to create a timeless epic that will forever remain in the story as the greatest movie of all time. If it were not the case, I would have given this film a perfect 10.
