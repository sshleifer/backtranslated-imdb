I usually do not classify a move as boring. I'm not a big fan of action movies and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie. In fact, I appreciate a good rational logical dialogue and a story. Unfortunately, this movie does not have any of these features. Diane Lane is the only saving grace of this movie and even her beauty can not save it. Terribly dominant music is tantamount to dialogue and moronic play. None of the actors actually connect with each other and therefore the movie does not connect to the audience. I suppose that the scenes where the townspeople walk somewhere were supposed to add to the story, but it seems that they were inserted only to fill the space. The scenes seemed jerky and inconsistent. There were some nice pictures of the ocean and the beach that were beautiful.
