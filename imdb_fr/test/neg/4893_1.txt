This movie was ridiculous from the beginning. Let me spare you all the time watching this movie. A woman who sells corn liquor to the local population takes her cousin or nephew and convinces her to open a coffee shop downstairs. She does it and she and her cousin become close. There is a scene later where she closes her lips with him. Later, the woman discovers that an old boyfriend comes back from prison and is stretched between them, leading to a fight in the coffee. The cousin / nephew of the woman is in love with the man. The end was awful, the story was awful, and if I could recover the time lost on this film, I would appreciate it. A definitive leap.
