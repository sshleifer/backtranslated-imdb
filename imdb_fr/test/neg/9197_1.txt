I'm sorry, that may have been a firefighter praise since September 11th, maybe it's an old-fashioned story, maybe it's not supposed to make you capsize, but I'm sorry, this movie is awful. As in the title, shot 49, I think he has at least as many shots. It's a monotonous story (managing to be awesome when there are dangerous fires and lives saved) about a firefighter. And his sad life, told in a "scene from now" useless, returns to the past style. We begin the film with the hero at risk in a building collapsing. The whole film aims to make us love this guy, so we have some tears to do when he meets his end in the final stage since the beginning of the film. I had a hard time worrying and would have liked it to go up in smoke earlier. The clich√©s abound, such as: death of the best friend, love in the first place, hazing in a new job, first-born, worried wife with a husband engaged in dangerous work, boss in father / superior figure, 2.4 children (good 2 but close enough), sacrificing your life to save others, rewards for courage .... and so on. This is the life of every firefighter, every police officer, nurse, doctor in a way. It was lazy, if it was a "life before his eyes" at the time of his death, while God help this poor boy, I'm surprised he did not suck more smoke to go faster. The flashbacks are mostly mundane and predictable, acting realistically and with a soundtrack that could put The Cowing Cow out of business so it was corny, it sounded like muzak or stuff without copyright! !! Avoid at all costs unless you need to watch granny on a Sunday night. Or maybe if you are bound to a firefighter - warning - your life will end horribly or you will be scarred for life if you are a brave firefighter according to this movie. Unless your John Travolta (strange Velcro style hair in this one !!)
