It is high time that critics and American fans begin to demystify their uncontrolled and neglected veneration of such films as Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America". The checkered story of this opulent film (and the great fantasy myth associated with its production and many versions) conceals its mediocrity at the narrative level. The film moves forward and backward intermittently, its central characters adrift and seemingly out of place, surrounded by decadence ersatz dominant scenery, the minutia of the details of the production and the beautiful but magnificent cinematography made in 1984. the audience . The scenario of the plot is confusing, complex and laborious, which leads some critics to imagine that the opium of the figurine Noodles is supposed to be the antecedent of a future "dreamlike reality" as well as memories in sepia. This overly exciting, exaggerated interpretation by a young boy conceals the glaring narrative irregularities on the screen. Even at this hour (?) Full, the characters appear and disappear with an alarming suddenness: the character of Deborah is fleetingly established in the shape of a child, a woman "trophy" cold and inaccessible, not even referring to gravity with which she will reestablish In her relationship with the Noodles according to the prison, this new union now sounds completely wrong. The pace of slowdown is a little to blame, some sequences lag too long, stagnant, meaning very little, suggesting a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obliged to take the maximum of his time on the screen to show off his production, fatal for a movie that contains numbers so sullen and distant. The trajectory of the life of the characters is presented to us as a microcosm reflecting the historical trajectory of American adolescence through prohibition and its booty, ending with the ruin (questionable) of its moribund central figures (except Deborah - a department of makeup escaped or intentional). We are wondering). This notion is banal, even banal. The troupe of characters as it is imagined in the "one note" scenario (written by seven Italians no less) is interpreted in a flat and clumsy manner by all the actors except the youngest ones, who have at least some variants of expressions facial. This is understandable given the almost unworkable material. Some critics say that the characters may seem so impenetrable, but are actively seeking their own goals, assuming others are complying (for example, when Noodles gets out of jail, Max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him whether or not That's what he wants and then does business assuming Noodles complies). This explanation of their abrupt and abrasive features is unsatisfactory and serves merely to highlight the complex endings of the film's unwavering viewers in defending their positions on a film that sadly lacks meaning. Although Ennio Morricone's score is highly venerated, it is undeniably schmaltzy and repetitive, it springs from an emotional force that the scenes themselves, often violent, do not justify. At times, one might wonder if Morricone was watching the same movie as his work was so incongruous. As a paean of American Filmmaking, he succeeds in terms of mood (assisted by a few masterful editing moves between different periods) and visuals (not helped by the score), but lacks cohesion and narrative fluidity.
