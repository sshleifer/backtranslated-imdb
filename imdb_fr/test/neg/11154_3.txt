What does this film have? Many shots and expensive effects. Nothing makes sense at any other level. <br /> <br /> Observing Arnold crying is so serious that it is laughable to act. The plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you think the devil will be impressed by a bad actor with a machine gun, this movie is for you!
