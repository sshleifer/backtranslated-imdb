This film was Flippin Awful ... I wanted to find those hours of my life. For God's sake, stay away from this horrible film halfway at all costs. It's not worth mentioning the title, but the ratings of this movie are quite generous for a movie like this. And where should I start? The beasts A ** in the movie ..... The plot or history without history? Or the very bad act, teenage angst insinuation? $$$ # @% @! God, that never ended! ..... I remember thinking that I would have preferred to kiss the floor of the cinema, then sit down again in front of it. <br /> <br /> But what are you waiting for? Most people with the brain power to look at reviews will not be the target audience at all, so GO SEE Pirites 2 again, or Jet Lee's, if you're fighting for yourself. Look, this movie will only cost you your soul, your money, your energy and your brain cells. BROKEN WARNING.
