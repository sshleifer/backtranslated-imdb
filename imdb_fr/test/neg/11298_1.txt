Hannibal must be the most horrible film I've seen in a long time. In fact, I want to get my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal development of the character, arguable reasons, mediocre dialogue, mediocre game. What else can I say? If you have not seen it, do not worry. I would not even rent the video and if you go on TV ... change channels. The only reason anyone could see this movie would be to see if the gratuitous violence responded to all the hype (which, frankly, is why they added it). If you want to see a kid eat his own brain, do it quickly. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of this film? It's like someone just asking, "I wonder what Hannibal is doing so far" and we just flew. He is free at first and free at the end. Between the two, Anthony Hopkins and the filmmakers indulge in a lot of self-indulgence. Julianne Moore valiantly tries to breathe some life into her Clarice, but they gave her a sub-standard script and, for me, she was set up to fail. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is only a very very bad story in every sense of the word. The only reason he has made so much money is because of the insane violence they have added, leaving you with a feeling of disdain greater than the horror you are supposed to feel. <br /> <br /> I give him a big raspberry!
