Unlike some of the reviews written here, I did not hate this movie. It's a movie that could have been a lot better than it was. Not Oscar material, it's true, but much better than it was. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot had a good hook and a good line. Admittedly, this film was badly written. And TERRIBLY realized and produced. I mean, how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have? Why were we here? What exactly is the point of the opening sequence? It seems that the producer or producers have watched American Beauty a little too often and have said to themselves: "I will use this in an action movie! I thought the movie was not so badly played. Wesley Snipes did a credible job, he just went wrong in the wrong direction. And once this film arrived in the production room, the situation got worse. I think the main actress had the same problems. Some of the other actors were suspicious, yes, but it was a low-budget movie. Once again, I would say that it is the director's job to take this up and correct it. <br /> <br /> As a general recommendation, I agree with the first review I read that says this movie is not newsworthy. Or maybe it's worth seeing if you're a film student and want to see what NOT to do. <br /> <br /> 3/10, and that's to rent it.
