This was done in 2004 for the sake of the gods, what happened to our advanced special effects? What happened to our hard on the edge but still good actors? The actors in this movie were incredibly horrible, there were one or two that were not bad, but the rest, big downside. Could not stand listening to the poorly written dialogue, I mean, who the hell did this script write? Please never write again! Special effects? Do not even get me started on special effects. SURELY, they could have created green balls of better quality than false appearances in the orbits. He looks so old and..lama frankly. Even the easiest thing to make them look real .. teeth, they looked so fake and stupid that I would almost wipe a tear from my annoying eye. Come on, I can not believe that this has even been shown to the public.
