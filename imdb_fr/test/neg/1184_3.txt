I do not get these reviews! I can not help but think that they are written by the type of LOG fan who would love everything they do without wondering if it's really good. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the program, but I thought this movie was a useless project. I could forgive the ridiculous plot if I left the cinema after laughing more than twice. At one point, I thought maybe it was just before realizing that almost no laughter sounded from the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a lot of conspiracy (very few TV comedies resist being stretched over 90 minutes) but thought a bit of a classic LOG dialogue or visual joke (as at the beginning of each program) would carry a movie. After 5 minutes of the seventeenth-century plot, I urged it to end (I did not know it would continue for the rest of the movie). It was not funny. <br /> <br /> I was massively disappointed and I can not see the story too nice, even if some hardcore fans write enthusiastic reviews.
