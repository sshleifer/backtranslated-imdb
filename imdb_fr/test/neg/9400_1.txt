Yes I really found this film unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I did not like Sandra's character Oh, she really annoyed me. It is unlikely to be accepted in rural Italian life because it is not white. it was a bit absurd of PC. <br /> <br /> the film is also shocking for Italian men. For example, the only man she (Diane Lane) has an affair with is a cheater on a shopping cart. But guess what: in the end, your typically plasticky American brickhead appears, all smiles white and tanned, and she finally finds what she wants: a true American, and she has now colonized another part of the world. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is quite racist in its description of the Italians and the way in which they submit them as lothariens or backward peasants. <br /> <br /> the picture was good but the film and its attitude were garbage.
