You've seen the same stories, characters, sit-com stories that are exhausted and worn out as sit-com stories - nothing that excels at sucking more than others. First and foremost, there is not a single character in this series that is even friendly enough ... especially that of Michael Rapaport. Dave Gold is by far one of the biggest asses of all time for a TV screen ... disgusting comes to my mind. If in real life, a father was so implausible, cruel and simply unfit to be a parent ... the fratricide would be your only option. Calling the remaining characters of the stereotypes would be too complementary. If these characters ended up on support for life, the line to pull the plug would last light years. How this show finished a full season, let alone 2 is a mystery. FOX cancels "Arrested Development" and maintains this broadcast live ??? You tell me that terrorists do not win.
