Based on Earl Derr Biggers' novels, 20th Century Fox's Charlie Chan series proved to be a public favorite - but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the studio feared the audience would turn against its Asian hero . It was a miscalculation: actor Sidney Toler played the role of "poverty row", Monogram Studios, where he continued to portray the character in eleven other films made between 1944 and his death in 1947. <br /> 20th Century Fox Chan's films were considered cheap "B" films, but the studio took a lot of care: the scripts were often ridiculous, but the pace was fast, the dialogue witty and the actors (who starred Bela Lugosi and Ray Milland) always expert. The result was a charming charm that has stood the test of time. Monogram was another matter: Chan movies were clear and simple "B" movies. Little care was taken of the scripts or actors and the resulting films were flat, at best mediocre, virtually unassailable at worst. <br /> <br /> Thanks to an adequate distribution and some interesting scenario additions, THE SHANGHAI COBRA is one of the best Monogram-made Chan films - but even so, it barely manages to reach a consistent mediocrity. In this particular entry, Chan (Sidney Toler) is called to investigate a killer who kills with what appears to be a cobra-like bite; at the same time, he decides to make sure that the public radium supply tucked into a bank vault remains secure. Do these two seemingly unrelated plots come together? Well ... could be! Sidney Toler is still nice as Chan, but most of his performances in Monogram seemed to be "called" - and that's as true of COBRA as any other Monogram Chan movie. As usual, the most enjoyable interpreter is Mantan Mooreland. Times change have led us to consider Moreland's comedy as humiliating for African-Americans, but he was an expert and comic actor, and taken in the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s, his work has an extraordinary charm and innocence. <br /> <br /> Fans of the 20th Century Fox series will probably find in Mon Chan's Chan a big disappointment and newcomers, who appreciate Monogram films, will probably consider them third after meeting Fox movies . Like other Monogram Chan films, THE SHANGHAI COBRA is best left to determined collectors. Four stars, and it's generous. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
