Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere on the web. This one is a good portrait, even if I do not quite agree with that. Taran is a businessman and therefore has only views from his perspective. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, which looks like a political party) has created a marvel at Rangeela. This one seems to be the pale reflection. one in some parts ... I will not even compare Urmila and Anthara .. both are good! The first has a better acting talent, although the latter is catching up well. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like the character of Anthara. She is faithful to her art, feels no unnecessary emotion and is certainly not too practical. She's a dance scientist, she's so sure of her theories that even comparing her to a scientist would shock her. Hey .. Donald Trump ... maybe you should drop Melania, this is Anthara and you've already built a Taj Mahal ... is not that easy? Abhishek, meanwhile, is a practical man, who wants money, power, glory, and so on. These two people were struggling to find a place in the film industry, they can not get along, given their different styles and approach to life. It's very typical, but what I like in the film is that it says what an Abhimaan would say in his total execution, in a scene! What's up? This film takes a different angle for the film industry and how different people are interested in it. There is always something different in RGV films, this one too, it's way too slow for its standards. In some parts, he is almost asleep. <br /> <br /> Note It is difficult to notice anything other than Anthara in the first half of the film. I think this show of skin was necessary for the dance sequences involved :-) In addition, it seems that Anthara is a professional yoga, she is too flexible, almost like a Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby improves as an actor in each film. I'm sure his blood-star movie brings rich dividends. The title song was really good, the music in general was above average.
