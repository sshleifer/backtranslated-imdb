Skeletons In The Closet brings the father-adolescent genre to new levels. It's a movie that is useless. The plot is presented in the first minutes, there is no suspense, the characters are clich√©s and despite the twists of the plot that try to blur ideas, everything happens exactly as you think. Halfway through the film, I could not stand the snail's pace anymore and started to move quickly. The film ended exactly as planned. Linda Hamilton is great, as always, and the other players are above average, given the total lack of direction. If you really believe that you need to see this dull and uninspired little prankster, watch it fast forward.
