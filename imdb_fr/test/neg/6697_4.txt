A coach who was good but had to move to a new area to get away from what he did before; a team of no-hopers; the star player who has a row with the coach; the assistant coach with a problem with alcohol, the little guy who gets screwed up to score the winning basket; the whole city against the coach (except the main one). This is the old story - straight out of the British comics, where a team of particular geeks and fatties face the Brazilians in football and win. <br /> <br /> This film, certainly well prepared, is full of clichés. The only thing I did not predict was at the town meeting, that the star player suddenly decided to join the coach. No reason has ever been given. It seemed very strange to see that everything was going as before. Maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy. <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays in a locker room, Popey Doyle. I'm sure an actor of the caliber of Dennis Hopper did not find anything particularly provocative in his role. The same can be said of Barbara Hershey. <br /> <br /> In the end, a movie full of clichés that could have been done much better than it was.
