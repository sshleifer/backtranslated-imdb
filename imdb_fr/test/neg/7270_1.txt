I officially vomited in my own mouth, thanks to this film. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the worst with this film, but I was expecting an absolute worst comforting and enjoyable. It's just terrible. Absolutely terrible. Terrible like the Nazis spreading the Black Death. Let me explain: The Ewoks speak English. It's horrible. <br /> <br /> The nasty girl seems to have been part of the future group of Power Rangers. I really want her to get up off the ground and say, "Finally, after ten thousand years, I'm free! It's time to conquer the Earth!" The putties ... uh, I mean the big bad guys no matter what they are ... they growl a lot. Many of them look like an even more sophisticated version of the Cryptkeeper. Cryptkeeper was pretty cool, but these guys were not cool. <br /> <br /> Paul Gleason was the only credit for this film. This film might have been better if he had addressed the wicked and told them, "If I have to come back here, I'm crying skulls." It would have been even better if one of the Ewoks was played by Judd Nelson, who uttered his words as he said. <br /> <br /> Moreover, this little fast creature is rather bold. Word to that. <br /> <br /> No word to the film, though. I want to give this film a two. I want it so much. There is a passage that I memorized: The journey of this film is fraught with pitfalls by the inequalities of terror and the tyranny of the horror of fallout. Blessed is nothing, for this film blows.
