The director spent a lot of time making the scenes real, to the historical photos and all the sounds of old Western agitation. Too bad the producers and screenwriter / director Michael Cimino did not spend any time on the historical facts of the Johnson County War. Much of the war was about how public lands should be used for grazing. Breeders did not want the poor sheep farmers on the land to compete for fodder on this cold, windswept plateau. The epic as a whole makes no mention of grazing sheep, one of the most important reasons for war. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired assassins. The peasants are shown surrounding the gunmen as would a group of Indians in much older Hollywood movies. In reality, Sheriff William (Red) Angus of Johnson County, with 200 to 300 men, intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn on the TA Ranch. I doubt that women took part in the siege. <br /> <br /> Ellen (Ella, also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged during a lynching mob about three years before the county invasion from Johnson. Ella has never been a prostitute. It was a duck spread by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) to discredit it. The fact that the plot turns her into a madam serves only the interests of the WSGA. <br /> <br /> I oppose the use of real people's names in a plot that is obviously a fiction. There is no fact in the events, timelines or backgrounds of the characters. Why would Michael Cimino use real names of people who were vaguely related to the Johnson County War (and the events that preceded it) beyond me. <br /> <br /> The film could have been much more interesting if he had lived on the political ramifications of the federal government's intervention in the affairs of a state government and on what happened after the armed men of the WSGA were saved by Calvary. Efforts have been made to prosecute cattle breeders accountable to Johnson County Attorney. But since Johnson County could not afford court costs and Wyoming Governor Amos W. Barber had supported the WSGA, the charges were eventually dropped. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think the movie is just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert nude for a good part of the three and three quarters of an hour DVD version.
