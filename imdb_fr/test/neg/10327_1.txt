This film is so bad that I lost too much time talking about it. Soo bad ... really ... ... BAD ... and I'm not even so critical ... .. I'm almost ashamed to admit having seen her ... The minutes of Sandra you show how much she really did ... I really mean that everything that follows is really worthy of an Oscar for her ... I guess the only way for her to look at it is that it There's no way except to get up after this one ... I guess she had to start somewhere ... but really ... soo bad ... ... really horrible ... bad is too good word for that s ** t .... but i do not wanna be naughty now ... but really how not to be able after having lost 90 minutes ... 90 minutes of my life i will never come back ... 90 minutes that I could have done better ... like sitting on the back and staring into space ... it would have been better time spent ... (walks away shaking his head )
