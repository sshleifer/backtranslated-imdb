This movie was not too funny. It was not too bad either. Just a fun ride aboard Soul Plane. It is a black-owned flight service with a fantastic disco, a magnificent bar and pompous stewards. The plot takes you through the whole idea of ​​a plane belonging to a black (no race or color, but style) with the same style of black humor. Sometimes large scenes are rare, for example when the main character uses the sink "normal" in the plane "normal". Check this. There are lulls, however, and this is what I find most often in the character who played the role of Soul Pilot. Look for who it is. All in all, it's a funny movie. Tom Arnold adds to the fun with his attitude of "cracker". This is a movie to watch when you play poker, when you are drunk or vegging.
