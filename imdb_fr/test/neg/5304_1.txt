OK, my brother-in-law bought me that a few Christmas ago, which took me to see "Get Shorty" at the movies, which impressed them a lot. And watched both become shorty and be cool one after another. I read reviews of people who did not see themselves becoming shorty and who thought this movie was pretty good ... I just think it's another way for film companies to cheat the paying client. All I have to say about this movie is WTF? After almost 10 years and Chili Palmer had become a cat .... The scenario was basically the same, they associated Travolta and Thurman after the success of Plup Fiction, and threw two or three big stars (plus a crowd of nothing) . and thought it was going to be good ... Vince Vaughn's character was just annoying, despite the fact that I'm a fan of him and Rock, both actors were underused and unrealistic. Basically, I'm glad it was bought for me as a gift, as if I had paid money for it, I would have been super bored.
