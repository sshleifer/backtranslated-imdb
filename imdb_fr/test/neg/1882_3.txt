Contrary to the terms of Endearment and Steel Magnolia, I left the movie theater with a VERY disappointed feeling. I started to get into the characters and their complex relationships mother / daughter and father / daughter at first. I even cried. But I had no sympathy for the characters with the end. The final act did not seem to fit the character of the mother at all. So, although the game is pretty good, I thought the film as a whole was disappointing.
