It is clear that for this film, they wanted the plot of the story to be guided by the characters. But immediately, the scenario makes you love the new main characters. The flight over the island and the dinosaurs below had no impact and looked almost like a cartoon. The entry of all the actions on the island is simply a repetition of the pieces of the JP 1 and 2. The scenario is predictable to the point of annoying and it is a totally unsatisfactory end that let me feel cheated. It left me with no choice but to award the film 3/10!
