I can not believe that I even lost a NetFlix rental on this complete piece of CRAP. How long did it take to make this movie? 15 minutes? On a budget of what? Fifteen dollars? I can spend a few hours with my Sony camcorder and offer something better than this piece of treacherous bile, and it is even available on DVD !? !! It is very sad to think that classics like The Stepfather have not been published on DVD, but this piece of steaming dung is going to format. Hoping that my rating of ONE ONE ONE ONE will lower the overall rating (already) pathetic 2.5.
