I often wonder how movies like this are made, and the most shocking thing is that people really pay to watch them. <br /> <br /> It seems that the director has invented the story as it goes, adding twists when he liked, no matter how ridiculous they are. The script was non-existent with insane dialogues such as "Jo Sheena Roy pehenti hai, wahee hota hai mode" and "Yeh Versace hai Madam" (yeah right). <br /> <br /> Each of the characters was superficial and underdeveloped. To act was frightful. Constables (Lycra for Udita and awful costumes for an imposing Emran), places (the many houses used for the interiors did not even look like a Victorian mansion), scenario, etc., one word. /> For those who love Hashmi and his movies, watch him. As for me, I will never find those two and a half hours. The only redeeming factor was some of the music that was decent.
