What trash, is there really no part II? If this film ends well, everyone involved in this film should be ashamed. This movie does not look like a movie like Outbreak, which was actually a pretty decent movie. This film was pressed in hopes of winning a few easy dollars. I started watching the film on the assumption that it would be bad, but I never imagined it would be so bad. This film was nothing more than a way to exploit the fears of the American people for profit! If you have not seen this movie, do not worry. The film is full of undeveloped characters and bad actors. I really hope that the production of this film only lasted a few weeks. Stay away! Do not be fooled by the hype!
