All the movies at the airport are pubs, but this one is the biggest turkey of all. The formula was different for this one because it focused on TWO disastrous flights and a lot of intrigue taking place on the ground, while the other films concentrated on a single disastrous flight and less intrigues on the ground. The cascades with the Concorde are worth the spoils, even if the special effects are not as bad as I would expect for a movie of this quality shot in 1979. The sexist statements of George Kennedy are disgusting and his appointment with a prostitute in Paris is totally useless (and made me gag a little). Poor Martha Raye was relegated to a role where she only relieve her bowel many times in the Concorde bathroom. There are no big stars in this movie compared to previous movies, which gives you one more reason not to watch this one.
