I saw this movie but not in one sitting. What happens when he plays on TV, I watch for a few minutes, find that I have everything I can take and then leave the room. During these few minutes, I do not laugh once, I have no pleasure in watching and I find myself more depressed than angry. Interestingly, I am told that psychological states are incompatible, that is, one can not be angry and depressed at the same time. This film tests this theory. <br /> <br /> I think part of the problem is that I spent almost 10 years in Chicago. Looking at the scenes, I think of my own experiences in this rotten city. I clearly bring a lot of my luggage to the room. It is quite possible, I concede, that if you are not a Chicago resident, you will find the play amusing. If so, I envy you. <br /> <br /> And yet. John Hughes shot his films in Chicago and those movies worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first class writer. I think it's obvious that he knew how to comically balance his situations, while making his characters friendly and believable. In a comedy (as opposed to a farce), this balance is vital. And it's not easy to achieve. If that were the case, everyone would make good movies and we would not have to worry like in the real world about when genius will appear. In "Adventures in Babysitting", this is not the case. I hated these characters. <br /> <br /> There is a difference, deep and real, between friendly and simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> For me, every scene in this movie is a horror. There is no humor, no humanity, no people that can be recognized. All the players have to do is read their lines as if they could do everything in their power to prevent them from screaming at them, some who would finally be laughed at, this time for sure! It's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. It's embarrassing and after a while, usually as I get up and go, I start feeling sorry for all the people involved, which is kind of an emotional connection, I suppose. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. She does not act, certainly not comically, and it is quite possible that she can not. But how lord she tries. She looks to be over 17 and behaves much younger like a seven-year-old girl in a school play, convinced that this is the way to get a reward. And she is not alone. It's like everyone can not relax and let the story flow. As if everyone had no idea what they were doing. <br /> <br /> This was one of the first efforts of Chris Columbus, which would obviously improve. Having better writers (for example, John Hughes himself) has certainly helped, which may allow a bit of forgiveness. But the film stinks of despair. Yet, as I said, it can work for some. If any of the above interests you and some commentators have made it clear, then go get the DVD and knock yourself out. Otherwise, avoid this mess like in a dark lane of Chicago where, in a hurry, you can only see shadows and hear whispered threats.
