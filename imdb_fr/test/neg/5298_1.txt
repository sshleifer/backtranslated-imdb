Travolta and Thurman deserved a better movie. This one is very secondary in all aspects, not a single fresh idea. But the biggest problem is the ridiculous philosophy of this film. A band of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even the massacre of people become almost positive heroes resembling Mickey Mouse who perform on stage and give rewards at the ceremony. Maybe it corresponds to real life. But to show it as a perfectly happy "happy ending" is beyond the imagination. "What's wrong with shooting two bad Ukrainians if they are not politically correct?" - the show must continue! This makes me think that Hollywood writers have a big problem with the separation of good and bad, even if the genre is supposed to be a "black comedy".
