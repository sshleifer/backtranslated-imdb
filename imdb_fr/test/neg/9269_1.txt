It's hard to decide where to start. I bought it for a few books and it's the worst of the few books I've ever lost. The back of the DVD did not contain any images and some lines of summary of the plot, that should have warned me, but I usually like bad movies for laughs, so I decided to give it a go. The film is composed of three short stories, each of which revolves around someone who was on a bus at a given moment (its meaning is never clear, nor the city in which it is located) <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS (as if there was something to spoil) The first story is about a man persuaded, by a car, to buy it, against the wishes of his wife. The car is a bit like a demonic demon his life. <br /> <br /> The second concerns a man who never cleans his fridge and a bacterial monster will come out. <br /> <br /> The third concerns a woman who goes to a dating agency, only to discover her date is not all that is normal. <br /> <br /> Between these, we are treated by bus (or a bus anyway) while a narrator slice on a load of garbage about relationships (really, it looks like it is on order to say "relations") <br /> <br /> The movie actually has no redemptive functionality.The acting, the costumes and the little Spfx are all disgusting There is not even any Attractive female member to admire. Quite simply, this film is a debacle.
