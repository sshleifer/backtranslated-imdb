As a fan of the author Gipharts stunned and humorous books (which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best), I was eager to see this movie. However, I did not see her at the movies and, after seeing her on television, I am terribly happy not to have bought her on video. From a good book, they managed to make one of the worst films in the history of Dutch cinema. All the good parts have been left out, the story is changed and not its benefits. All the humor has been cut. What's left is a nasty, dramatic and non-coherent film that I never want to see again. <br /> <br /> I condoned Giphart for this result and I'm glad that Robbert Jan Westdijk had a hell. from a better job on Gyphart topper Phileine Zegt Sorry. Go see that one!
