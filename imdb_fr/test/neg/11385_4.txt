The gorgeous blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young widow who does not sleep much in the hill mansion, telling her story to a television reporter in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the group of well-heeled riders in the community, she is suspected of having participated in the death of her older husband. It's James Brolin, confident babe in arms. Teledrama flashback made in Canada, based on an article in the magazine Vanity Fair. It must be true! Anyway, it's much more a romance than a mystery and a very familiar tale. Henstridge, a long-legged star, as a palliative care nurse? It could happen, I suppose. And it's good to see Brolin in an important role after his annoying turn in Antwone Fisher, even if he does not get to the end of the stage. The end of the photo? He can not even get to the beginning of the picture. That's why flashbacks were invented, of course.
