Reba is bad. It sucks hard. It's about this horrible country singer trying a comedy. They might as well call this show "generic" because that's what it is. It's stupid and generic. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad your delayed show was canceled because you fear, just like Brock, Barbra Jean, the redheaded teenager, this jockey guy and the 12 year old boy who has been knocked down. You are all nil and none of you are funny. Oh, and I heard that Reba was in fact a follower of the gay devil who idolizes Hitler and tortures animals. And she puts subliminal messages in her show and in her "music" in the hope of killing parents by their children and by themselves! But it was just a rumor. Anyway, this is the worst series of all time, Reba is gay, I do not like it, I think The Office is better than this show and this show sucks.
