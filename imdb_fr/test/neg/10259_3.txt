I just finished this unofficial adaptation of H.P. "The Lurking Fear" by Lovecraft, shot in Louisiana. Apart from some changes (names, settings), this follows the short story, point by point, during the first 70 minutes, but then tries to inject its own "twist" by ending what you could see coming from one kilometer further. Anyway, it is a much better adaptation than THE LURKING FEAR of Full Moon. Too bad it's a terrible movie. The director David McCormick pulls the thing with all the talent of an industrial short film. I swear I counted maybe two camera movements. The design of the creature is not expensive (we are talking here about store-bought masks) but it is turned dark (intentional or not) where they are a little scary. The most impressive thing about the picture is the abandoned mansion, but McCormick does not exploit it either. File this one under good adaptation, poor execution.
