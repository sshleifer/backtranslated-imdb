I'm sorry, but I have to say that I really can not understand the overwhelming feelings that everyone feels when seeing this movie ... <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I looked at my watch to see how much from time to time I passed with this absurdity of kindergarten. <br /> <br /> So why this verdict? <br /> <br /> First of all: the film tells a story that arouses no excitement! It's not even the funny and distorted reality of a Quentin Tarantino that we knew. This story could have come out of every little child's head. There is nothing clever, inventive and it lasts for hours ... the story has appropriate content for about 30 minutes. The rest are just terribly improved scenes that are supposed to leave a pretty cool picture. It does not work Even the previously seen cuts that Tarantino uses often confuse and are by no means cool. <br /> <br /> Second: Some men go to Germany and kill the Nazis. Ah really? Do they? The only Nazis they killed were a handful of men, one of them being man enough to die rather than betray his companions. Is it the ugly face that Tarantino wanted to give to the Nazis? A brave soldier who is more valiant than any of the "Basterds"? Certainly not -> fail And what will happen to the terrible Nazi-killing Basterds? Well, they are all killed by the Nazis except two who are taken hostage -> wow, what terrible vengeful monsters they are ... <br /> <br /> Third: Characters? Yes, one! The only role and the only hope for the whole film is Chritoph Waltz, who is building here a really deep and very detailed character. Excellent game! Brad Pitt really fears and is completely overwhelmed by Waltz. Never seen such a weak performance of Pitt ... And the rest? Well, Germans that you have never seen and you will never see after. When the movie started and I saw the group of seven Basterd, I was hoping to see something like the "Magnificent Seven": a group of amazing guys, each with a distinct character, heading for their destiny without fear and knowing ... I was so disappointed when I saw the "Basterds without glory". No details at all, no characters, no real men, just random guys that you will not remember and who have not been given the slightest chance to stand out ... "Except that Pitt is barely playing a role in this movie ... <br /> <br /> So I was really disappointed, and seeing this movie instead of 40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about it leave your mouth open ...
