It starts with the company's credits informing us that it is by World International Network. I knew I had seen this credit before, but I did not remember where, but I knew it was at the beginning of a very bad film I had seen, so I seriously thought about changing chain. The only thing I had seen was every movie. on other channels, which is one of the problems of being a reviewer of the IMDB. What I thought would not matter if WANTED was good or bad because I could always review it for this site. <br /> <br /> As I expected, WANTED was not that good. It's a conspiracy I've seen so many times (too often) before involving a runaway fugitive, much like the INCREDIBLE HULK television series without the shirt tearing up. Jimmy crosses the crowd in a totally artificial way and leaves on the run. He finds himself in a totally artificial way and works in a school of Catholic reform. Have you noticed a description often used in the last sentence? "Fully manufactured" is the answer. Let me repeat for the difficult to think that it is an entirely artificial film where everything rests on a coincidence. Another problem I had was the school of reform led by the church. It's far too compassionate and kind. I am convinced that this type of establishment gives Alcatraz a country club feel. I say it's a fact, but the chief priest looks like Donald Rumsfeld's spitting image, you get the impression that a lot of sugar is being coated. <br /> <br /> To be honest, despite the ridiculous twists, etc. WANTED is not really a bad thriller. although it is terribly good either. I never really wanted to turn it off, no matter how artificial it became, which is a compliment on hand for the movie
