*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've seen in recent years "The Village". An insult to anyone of any intelligence. Badly written and surprisingly artificial. Nobody, especially in Los Angeles, speaks like these characters. Not subtly at all. If the purpose of this film is to say "we all have a bit of fanaticism in us", it does a horrible job in stating the obvious. Not only was his point of view clearly at the base, but every character in this movie was incredibly stupid. The scene of the stolen car almost made me go out, with the rescue and oh, do not forget the WHITE COP of DUTY Rookie who picks up a black hitch hitch and ... I could go on and on. Horrible, just horrible.
