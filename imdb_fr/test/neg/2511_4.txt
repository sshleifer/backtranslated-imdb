Alien body thieves in the desert. Small blue rocks that look like cheap plastic. The general story is not bad if you like that kind of thing, but the acting is so far beyond the poor that it amazes me that some of them have really entertained my movie in The X Files ! And the special effects? Hello?! Where did they get their FX team, high school? I mean, come on! there was so much more they could have done! It was amateurish and extremely basic. That did not particularly please me (and my father fell asleep during this time!) And of course, our hero falls in love with the main woman! It's so typical and very predictable. Bleugh !!!!!
