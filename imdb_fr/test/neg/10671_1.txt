I have to raise my hand and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last !!!) to see this movie. Where can I start is a complete mess. The main attraction was of course the soundtrack. What goes without saying is great - that's what Himesh does best. But as they say, do not give up your day-to-day work - human resources absolutely should not. <br /> <br /> The role of human resources is clear and simply horrible. Even if the film had a plot, what baffles you the most is why this man is on the screen and what the hell is there. Two HR tips: give up acting and, second, use a stick. <br /> <br /> HR is not on the screen, does not have acting talent and the female lead seems a bit too young for him. As for Malika Sherawat, the same old vampire shit from Bollywood. <br /> <br /> You can pack the product as much as you want, but if there is no substance, it will not hold. Do not waste your money ...
