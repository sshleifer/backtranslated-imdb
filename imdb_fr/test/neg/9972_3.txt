This film tells the story of a woman who falls in love with a friend of her boyfriend. From that moment, she has to share her time between the two little friends: Jack during the day and Joseph during the night. <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was made with a minimum budget. The majority of the film takes place in an apartment with minimal furniture. There are only three main actors, all the other actors listed in the credits only make a momentary appearance. The designer of the wardrobe does not seem to have much to do, because the actors wear very down-to-earth clothes and, in reality, most of the time, they are naked anyway. <br /> <br /> The film is very full of dialogue, which should have filled the gaps described above. However, the dialogues seem too composed and clumsy. At the beginning of the film, most of the dialogue consists of a person who utters a very long sentence, then she says "me too". After the frenzy of agreement, the dialogue sinks into a mess of word salad disjointed and confused. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this film that I can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet that not only transmits men who can be unfaithful. <br /> <br /> This film is a big disappointment.
