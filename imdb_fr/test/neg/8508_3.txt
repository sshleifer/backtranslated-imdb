First of all, I'm a big fan of Tolkien and, as such, I'll base most of my criticism on his books. <br /> <br /> The film is a standard adventure movie, well made with great special effects, nice sound. follow and play well. Now, if this movie was called something other than the lord of the rings, the critics would not be as good as they are here. <br /> <br /> The problem of the film is that it takes the basic story of Tolkiens. books, but then it goes and "hollywoods" all he can, many scenes of the book are missing or have changed a lot, the characters are changed from the book too, which, in my opinion, should be punishable! What's missing from the film is the deep insight of the characters in it, I know it's almost impossible to make a good movie with a good book, and it did not work here later, the motivation characters usually remain fuzzy. better. <br /> <br /> As an adventure movie, it would value 7+ / 10 As an adaptation of Tolkien, it would be worth 2/10 <br /> <br /> I mean honestly, that did Arwen make Rivendell Ford? And as for the comments that this film "is the best of all time", I can only say that the younger you are, or you have not seen good movies ... <br /> < Peter Jackson should have called this movie adventure movie based on the Lord of the Rings.
