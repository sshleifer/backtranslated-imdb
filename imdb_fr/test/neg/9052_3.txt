An Asian assassin attacks victims in Niagara Falls and New York before being run over by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden, Janet Agren, who received the hilarious nickname "Southern Belle" to show she comes from Alabama) finds a link between these murders and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and is preparing to investigate. This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a tiny guide (Robert Kerman, American porn star R. Bolla) $ 80,000 to help locate her sister. After barely crossing a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally locate Diana, who is under the control of the Jim Jones cult leader, Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas performs the typical tasks of the crazy guru's style, such as passing the LSD, initiating a group's suicide, threatening to kill all those who disobey him and raping Agren with a giant dong dipped in cobra blood. From time to time, a character looks to the right or left and sees a bloody scene directly from JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or MAN DE DEEP RIVER (both also led by Lenzi). I'm sure they also use at least two scenes of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Here we have scenes of expected animal slaughter (evisceration of a gator, the natives eat live snakes), as well as additional nudity and castration. Me Mei introduces herself to give her breast implants another training session by playing with a widow who is gangrened by three of her beautiful brothers on the ashes of her newly cremated husband. Mel Ferrer appears briefly as a teacher and does not have much to do. <br /> <br /> In short, with MANGIATI VIVI! you get pretty much a promise filled with all the nudity, gore, dead animals and bad taste that you expect with any of these titles, so if you're a hound, look at it well. Personally, I got bored at about halfway and just wanted it to end. The first (heavily cut) American version of 1985 was titled "THE EMERALD JUNGLE" to make people believe that they actually rented John Boorman's EMERALD FOREST. It was also called DOOMED TO DIE and EATEN ALIVE CANNIBALS!
