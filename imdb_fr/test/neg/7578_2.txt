I do not know, but the movie was too similar to the other movies I saw. The Ring, The Eye, Dark Water, they're all the same to me. Do not get me wrong, it's very well done, nice camera work, great graphics, but this story is too .. too common. In the end, it's the score that makes the suspense, you know: screams, rumblings. The characters in the film do not react very naturally, moving very slowly, surprised by everything they see. I know people who like this kind of film, and if you like it, it's a well done movie, I guess it does not hurt to watch it. But if you've seen the movie I mentioned above and you did not like it, I suggest you do not bother.
