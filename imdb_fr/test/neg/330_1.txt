Dude, this movie was bad. There seemed to be seven different tracks at the same time and they all made little sense. The special effects, the costumes and all that stuff were terrible. The acting game was particularly bad. Everything seemed so constrained, especially the features of the woman with big eyes and the little child (his "Noooooo" because he is buried is so unenthusiastic that it is laughable). A good part of this film is still quite funny. The death of a woman where she sticks a knife in a toaster, is electrocuted and magically transforms into the craziest mankind in the world laughed my friends and I for a good ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If you like watching really horrible movies, look for this one. Otherwise, run for your life.
