In fact, the mother-in-law and the father-in-law had lunch with the couple the day after the wedding and gave him the money in public. This young Elisabeth so troubled that she never forgot the problem. Remember that she was only 16 years old. She was so embarrassed that she kept her life scared of sex. Maybe it started to appear as a trauma. Also, the constant interference of her aunt and mother-in-law. As you say, she kept all her children away from her, criticized her manners and manners (which she deemed inappropriate for an empress), and when Sissi finally went to Venice with her husband and children his eldest daughter died and his mother the law reproached him for this unfortunate and premature death. She never recovered.
