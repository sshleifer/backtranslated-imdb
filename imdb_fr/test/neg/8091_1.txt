It's a ugly film, it's really funny, but I do not laugh once in the whole movie. Do yourself a big favor and do not waste your money on it, do not waste someone's money on it. I gave him a 1/10 believe me I would have given less if I could. I'm a 15 year old guy and I thought it was rubbish if you want to see a good movie go out and see Jay and Silent Bob fight back.
