... in search of the film "so bad that it's good", I have repeatedly laughed at the first 15 minutes of different movies, only to stay disappointed and bored at the end. Not this time!!! My eyes widened, my belly and my cheeks ached to laugh so loud throughout the film. Of course, Hulk Hogan is a sub-actor and the plot is quite predictable, but everyone dive into this movie knowing all that. s and "WHATCHUGONNADO" flying from his infamous mouth of goat. And if the on-screen Hulkster is a little ridiculous compared to the ring Hulkster, the ultimate cheese-seekers will certainly not be disappointed by this jewel of setbacks. A riot of laughter.
