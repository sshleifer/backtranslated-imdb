Sad and useless following a classic of good faith. An American werewolf in London was unquestionably a film gem: humorous, insane, with just a pinch of romance and so, very British, it made me want to get up and sing God Save the Queen at the end of the film . Then came this abomination. You know that you have big problems when the tracks are so completely unimaginable that you are happy to see them slaughtered and you start applauding the lycanthropes. Tell me the truth, my friends, I'm only halfway to this CGI simulacrum before losing the desire to live and extinguish it. Absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyone's time.
