***** Spoiler or two, it does not matter ****** <br /> <br /> Two things emerge from this film. The first is entitled "Bruno" and "The dress code", and if you have seen this movie, you will see the irony of this film. <br /> <br /> Second, you completely solve the wall problems. . The adventures of a transvestite primary school are not a crying need for a film, nor a topic that would interest most people. Shirley MacLaine manages to circumvent gender issues by linking Bruno's desire. wearing a dress to religion, which probably opens up a still thornier Pandora's box - what was she thinking? <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a bit of humor and it is not directly shocking, but the kind of disturbing feeling of the beginning continues to grow. That does not do much except repeat the liberal mantra that "different" people should be accepted (or perhaps excepted?) Anyway. <br /> <br /> That's good ---- but for people to live in a society, everyone must give a little to get along well. Bruno does not just want to wear a dress, he wants to appear as a miniature Gladys Knight at the awards night and his final costume makes him look like a cabbage-shaped Cowgirl doll. Yet all the other children dress and behave like ordinary children. So what gives? If all were summed up, we could all declare ourselves as special or different and behave as we felt, and the result would be total chaos. <br /> <br /> This acceptance of people who are "different" is also defined very narrowly. I doubt that we can ever see a film about a child who discovers his true identity and wants to wear a wetsuit, hunt goose, and go to tractor pulls, and demanding everyone to accept him as he is. "Bruno" is a stupid movie and a total waste of time.
