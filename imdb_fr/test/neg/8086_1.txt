This film, literally, has no functionality that redeems. The characters are one-dimensional, clichés, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. The screenplay seems to have been assembled by 100 other films, the acting is horrible and some of the "rude" humor made me nauseated. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Grégory Poirier, Thinking about all this would be funny or interesting! <br /> <br /> The worst film I've seen in years.
