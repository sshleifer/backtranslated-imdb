I saw this film n I can say that it's really a bad movie. The director has gone crazy ... of course ... he knows a lot about the army, but he is certainly a cheap guy. There are also many technical problems in movies ... <br /> <br /> Okay ... here's my doubt - in the end, when they help the family (including a girl who has just being raped) ... why are they leaving them outside of their homes? I did not see an ambulance in the area! There are a lot of aspects to the film that are real ... but then, I would have liked the major to tell / help / help another good director who made the film. <br /> <br /> Mohanlal certainly deserves best director!
