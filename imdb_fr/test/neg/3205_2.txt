It's a shame for the name of the entire saga of Critters. Why writers feel the need to make the film unbearable to watch by all standards of quality. The Critters are cute and adorable as always, but their murderous behavior has been transformed into that of a killer baby. They are not so terrifying, horrible, some what spine-scary and funny as they have been described in the movies before. I loved their porcupine shots, but now they are hidden as if we thought they were repetitive and boring. And what is with murder and not eating. I thought this movie would have been cool but everything was so wrong. Why did Ug have to be mean and kill Charlie? This film makes me sick. Disgrace! Disgrace! DISGRAAAAAAACE !!!!
