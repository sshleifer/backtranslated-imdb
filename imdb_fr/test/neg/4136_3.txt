I can only assume that the previous posts came from executives of the production company ... <br /> <br /> Assisted at the British Premiere tonight. Zane and Brook were present (they probably knew I was going to be there) and are definitely stars, but what turkey of a movie. I sometimes felt sorry for them when the audience burst out laughing at what was a serious thriller scene. <br /> <br /> But maybe I missed the point. Perhaps a tongue-in-cheek element was planned. If so, pure genius. If this is not the case, career genocide. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Zane is still shining and Brook can act a little. As the other half said (when we missed the cinema, with broken ribs), we can forgive them for this movie because they both seem to be nice people! The screenwriter, however, should be abandoned.
