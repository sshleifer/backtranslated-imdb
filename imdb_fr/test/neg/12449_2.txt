Return to the sender, a.k.a sentenced, is almost flawed. The only good thing about this movie is that I never got bored. That being said, critics who describe this film as a low-budget hit may not have seen the same movie I saw. <br /> <br /> Rather than writing a comment and telling you what's going on and what's working and what's not working. does not work, I will simply point out that nothing works. There are holes in the plot in this movie that you can drive in semi. The game in the movie is not very good, although it may be the result of a scenario so poorly written that it could have been ghost written by George Lucas. There was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate. Did I mention that there were some holes in the field? At the end of the film, you wonder how a blind guy can be such a good shooter with a shotgun, why Kelly Preston trusts Aidan Quinn, why she would fall asleep the night before the death of her client, how Aidan Quinn can travel 400 miles in such a short time with a car that breaks down during the rest of the movie, why Aidan Quinn did not do it by a fifth instead of a pinch, etc. <br /> <br /> With That being said, it is indeed a film B, and in addition to a terrible film. The misfortune is that it is not serious enough to be good. If you appreciate your time, let it serve as a public service message to stay away from it.
