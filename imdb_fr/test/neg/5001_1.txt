I am not sure of the interest of this film, but I did not find it. It's a very long conversation, barely believable, just lucid between three guys on the same set. <br /> <br /> It does not move, the characters are totally bizarre, the underlying plot is just as much. It's lost for me, it's definitely an exit movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents you from going out is the still unrealized possibility that it may have some sort of point or significant climax, and the fact that, all irritation aside from the mundane personalities, they have acted reasonably reasonably. But you have to prepare for an endless dialogue, wishing on many occasions that Teach simply closes the% * & * for a moment.
