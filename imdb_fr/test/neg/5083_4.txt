This is the price that made me lose all respect for Hugos. <br /> <br /> If such a distinguished "committee" can not see or care about the obvious storytelling problems of Battlestar Galactica, then what is the value of their price? The answer: not much. <br /> <br /> Award-winning programs should be examples of creativity and excellence that do not exist in BG, this episode or any other event I've seen. <Br /> <br /> Turning into a dull video is not "artistic", it's just cheap. Shaking the camera is not "creative", it causes vomiting and is lazy. <br /> <br /> All that BG has shown is how much of the "academy" is really corrupt and how easy it is to buy rewards. with a lot of money PR.
