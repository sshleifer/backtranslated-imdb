Why does Guy work for Buddy? Probably because Ari was not there in 1995. Why does Dawn want to be with Guy? To access Buddy. Why does she stay with Guy? I am not sure. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things about this movie that I'm not sure about. But Kevin Spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami like Buddy Ackerman ?? and totally believable because he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> Frank Whaley's guy is definitely out of his element who works for Buddy? he wants to write and make meaningful movies, not be a gofer who is verbally abused for getting equality instead of Sweet & Low. <br /> <br /> Dawn by Michelle Forbes, who also wants to make significant films, seems to stand out from Guy. <br /> <br /> The end leaves a lot to be desired.
