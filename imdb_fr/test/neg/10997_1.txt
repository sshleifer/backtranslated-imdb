I saw this on the cable. Someone had to lose his job for giving the green light to this one. It's not because a movie is made that it has to be shown! Savage Instinct should be shown in ALL movie classes. This is the ideal model for not making a movie. The assembly alone is so confusing that you will think it was assembled by a team of trained monkeys (badly), traveling across an unpaved canyon road to the back of a jeep, blindfolded and drunk. The audio is often unreadable. Acting? I can not call anything from what I saw playing here. Recite? Hmmm. I can not call that either. Fail? It works. All that being said ... IT'S HILARE! I can not emphasize enough that there is no reducible factor in this "film", except for the hilarity derived from its own incredible ineptitude. Fun, in a strictly masochistic genre. Look at him ... if you dare.
