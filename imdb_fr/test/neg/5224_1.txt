It's possible the worst movie of all time. I know people are telling how ugly Ed Wood's films were (Plan 9), but this film gives Plan 9 a breathtaking look. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris makes an appearance, why I have no idea. Maybe to ruin his movie career. In addition to Chuck Norris, the cast of the movie consists of extras in soap operas of the day and Mike Norris ... that's right, Chuck's son. <br /> <br /> This director does not even have a resume and I do not know where the plot or scenario originated. It must have been lit in green by an awful Southern Baptist pastor who had somehow a first cousin who owned a studio (which I am sure was closed). <br /> <br /> I do not really know. what more can I say about this film? I would like to give you a summary of the plot, but I am lost. There is something about Jesus and Satan ... an eternal battle. Other than that there are Indians. And a bunch of weird kids who do not know how to play ... they're just clumsy and should not be filmed. I do not know what was happening most of the time, but I know that the movie was very funny. Mike Norris pushes his daughter (on his bike) on the street one way or another ... but on the spot he is in the middle of the park. So, one way or another, she learns to bike with a speed equivalent to that of the Flash and is overthrown by a car or a bus ... I do not know. But she is dead. It's actually the funniest scene in the movie. I know it sounds sick, but once you've seen Mike raise his hands to victory, then hold his head and scream in terror ... you'll understand. It does not show that her daughter gets hit or anything ... you just have to assume that she was hit by a vehicle. But the film is not clear. So maybe she was completely independent and died of cancer. Anyway ... after that, the movie gets really confusing and I have no idea what's really going on. I am a Christian and I do not know at all why this film was shot. I do not see any value for this film in a religious or non-religious sector. It's probably the first thing they show Film 101 students ... that's what you DO NOT want to do. <br /> <br /> Just see it ... you hate it and I suggest you see it.
