Critters 4 begins, and I quote 'Somewhere in Kansas 1992' & a cover of the last minutes of Critters 3 (1991) while the recurring Charlie McFadden character (Don Keith Opper) is about to turn the last two remaining Critter eggs the universe which, we are informed, would mean the extinction of the whole Critter race, which is opposed to a kind of intergalactic zoological law or something of the sort. Ug (Terrence Mann), Charlie's bounty hunter friend, is now known as Tetra Advisor. He is a senior official of Intergalactic Council. He orders Charlie not to shoot the eggs, but to place them in a container that will soon land nearby. Indeed, the land is nearby very quickly and Charlie puts the eggs well, but it is also caught in the basket that, I guess, cryogenically freeze it, because it has never really been explained. Critters 4 then informs us that we are "somewhere in the Saturn 2045 quadrant" where a lifeboat falls on the gondola drifting into space (the credits are barely finished and Critters 4 is already stealing entire ideas from Aliens (1986). )). Rick (Anders Hove) decides to claim unidentified people, anyway, pod & try & pulling some money. With the help of his crew, Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), Fran (Angela Bassett), Al Bert (Brad Dourif) and Bernie (Eric DeRe), the basket is recovered successfully. They get in touch with the Intergalactic Council and the Tetra Advisor say to go to an abandoned space station where an exchange will be made for the pod and its contents. Tetra also tells Rick not to open the pod. So, in the pure tradition of the horror movie, Rick opens the capsule, thawed Charlie and the eggs of creatures that hatch, kill Rick and escape into the space station ... <br /> <br /> Co-produced and directed by Rupert Harvey I thought that Critters 4 was a rather useless movie and rounded the Critter movie series with a moan rather than an explosive way. The scenario of Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is both predictable and clich√©, the space station with an unstable reactor that will explode in a few hours, the protagonists having only the means to escape neutralized so as to remain blocked , the race against time to flee, the constant quarrels and arguments within the crew, the separating people and the loser who turns into a hero and saves the day, yawning. Many plots seem to come directly from Aliens and he snatches Star Wars (1979) with a compact scene. The characters are not better and you probably will not care. While other Critter's films could be described as comic horrors, Part 4 can not, it still seems to be deadly. Critters 4 is also incredibly slow, storyless and dull. More than 30 minutes had passed before the Critter egg hatched, and after this short clip, it's almost time before we see them again, why create a film and barely introduced by Critter? This can not be because of the expensive special effects as they look like glove puppets anyway, oh & how can a creature of a few hours exploit an entire space station and draw a path to Earth? How do they even know what the Earth is? Why did Capatin Rick want to open the pod anyway? What are we talking about with the woman scientist and a rubber alien who is only mentioned once? Why does the Intergalactic Council so much want the Critters? Why send only four men? Why is this beautifully beautiful space station completely deserted again? Critters 4 seems cheap with unimaginative, bland and dark scenery, and even steals images of Android (1983) for its scenes of spaceships and space, Critters 4 was apparently so small that filmmakers could not allow no optical effect or what it takes. from Android look seriously dated. For the most part, only two creatures are used, although others begin to hatch, but it's late in the day when that happens. For most movies, they are barely visible and their effects are the worst in the series. Forget all traces of blood or coolness, because the Critters only kill two people during the 90 minutes of racing, which was not enough to keep my interest. The acting is also rather mediocre with the exaggerated melodramatic reaction of Angela Bassett who saw some particularly trustworthy Critter eggs. To watch Critters 4, it is a production as inexpensive and unusual that you could hope (do not) see. The end of Critters 4 finally saved the universe from the Critter threat. Hopefully it will also save us, as well as our local video libraries, the threat of a party 5 ...
