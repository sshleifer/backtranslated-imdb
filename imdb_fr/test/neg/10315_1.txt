This movie stinks more than limburger cheese! If you find this at a garage sale, leave it there! I love Sandra Bullock and yet I HATE THIS FILM ... Although I am ashamed, I own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that Sandra Bullock is in the film. They play as "a film by Sandra Bullock". She has only a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that, but she is young and has not yet learned her talent. Well everyone has to start somewhere ...
