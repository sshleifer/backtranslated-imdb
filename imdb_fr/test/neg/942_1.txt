I do not see anything funny - even remotely - in this silly movie. An unrealistic, stupid and ridiculous idea - just completely ridiculous. Hard to believe that the main character, who seems so articulate, intelligent and imaginative, would not be accepted in any college. Even more difficult to believe is that no one has closed the place. The actors depicted characters straight out of Characterville. We have seen their lot many times in many movies. Nothing new here. I found it on TV late at night, and since there was really nothing else, I watched the movie boring and stupid. What a total waste. Maybe if you're a teenager, you'll find it fun. Movies are made for an immature mind, so teenagers, go for it. The rest, no way.
