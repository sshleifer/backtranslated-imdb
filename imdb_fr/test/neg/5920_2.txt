I thought this movie was awful. I understand that the shooting was done on a small budget, but the acting was awful and the movie itself was just silly. The plot was predictable and the central character was an unsympathetic idiot. In fact, all the characters were unfriendly and none were fully developed. The public does not concern anyone in the film. It was supposed to be suspensive but if you do not care about the characters, it's hard to get into the movie at all. I felt like a stranger forced to listen to someone tell me a stupid story. All the twists in the end were just a little too much - I laughed when I guess I was supposed to be "shocked". Overall, I thought it was really a bad movie.
