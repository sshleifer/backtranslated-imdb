The first official version of World Wrestling Entertainment's film division is a pretty basic horror movie called "See No Evil", featuring Kane, one of their great wrestlers known for his intimidating presence, his punchy moves, and the one of the most complicated stories in the fight. And do not shoot here; Although this film is presented as the greatest horror film of all time (mainly by the WWE), it goes without saying that after seeing it, I can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all the time. <br /> <br /> "See No Evil" sees a group of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel for cleaning. Of course, a monstrous murderer (played by Kane) also lives in this hotel and we all know where it's going. Without revealing too much of the film's script, this movie has all the look and structure of a slasher film from the early 1980s with most cliches intact, but without any of the frights they accompany. And that's sort of the main problem of "See No Evil". He tries so much stuff involved with his predecessors in the genre that he's unpredictable; Experienced horror fans will easily recognize some of the gadgets in advance and even those who have only seen a few movies should tell what will happen next. It's too generic to scare. <br /> <br /> The movie is gore, no doubt, but this is only for the effect. The dark atmosphere that reigns in the film releases this feeling of terror at first, but when you approach the end, you feel uncomfortable and tedious. Death scenes are not as horrible and bloody as they are laughable, though some are quite inventive. <br /> <br /> And playing in this movie is pretty bad too, as are the main characters. are not developed enough for us to worry about when they are finally hurt. Some can not even describe the fear correctly; they only shout and cry in vain effort to be moved. So when they die, it just adds to the comedy because you do not care enough about them, you consider them the equivalent of Starfleet Redshirts to the Kane monster. <br /> <br /> As for Kane, he's just portrayed it. his movie character in the same way he describes his fighting character, except that he uses axes and hooks instead of hell fire and sulfur. There is no doubt in my mind that Kane can be a great asset in the horror genre. He has the look and the presence for that; he simply needs better materials (with a script that was not written by someone writing wrestling shows) to work. <br /> <br /> Now, despite what may seem a harsh criticism, I really enjoyed the movie. This is one of those ridiculously bad movies that you can not help but watch and enjoy. My main complaint with the film, again, is that it's just an exercise of filming Gory Wills and that there are no frightening or shocking moments. I liked that, but I liked it because it was easy for me to laugh at some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie. If it happened because it had to be that way, the movie would have been better rated. But that was not the case. It made me laugh because it's a B-movie and the director's previous experiences were porn movies and music videos; not really complicated to manage anyway. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br /> If a movie B or a fun horror movie does not bother you, I strongly recommend that you do not see the harm. If you are a true genre lover, I would wait for the DVD to come out before watching it. Everyone should probably look at something else.
