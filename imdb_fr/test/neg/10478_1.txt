First, I must admit that a separate peace is my favorite book. So, of course, I am somewhat against any attempt to adapt it to a feature film or TV movie. But when I started watching this movie, I was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. The original version of the early 1970s, although shot at the Phillips Exeter Academy where the author of the book was at school, remained as faithful as possible to the book, but lacked real depth and did not capture the essence of the books. characters. The original just seemed to go through the motions. By reading the anecdotes about the film, you discover that it was mainly composed with non-actors. Thus, the original has an amateur aspect and eventually fails. <br /> <br /> This new version, although I agree that it better captures the aspect of the period than the original, seems to have thrown the book all together. The scenes are rearranged, the characters imposed where they do not belong, the created characters not appearing in the book, and no attempt has been made to deepen the deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling. And the capital sin of all: the tree is not treated as the vital character, almost central, but in the book. It is an inexcusable oversight on the part of filmmakers. How could they minimize the role of the tree? Why was not it introduced immediately? Why the beginning of the dead poet? And what was in the name of God with Gene's accent? This film is, to be honest, garbage. A separate peace should not be a difficult book to adapt to the stage or screen. John Knowles wrote it in a perfectly fine and linear style. Filmmakers should have trusted the story as it was written. make changes, of course; beautify here and there, of course; take a slight dramatic license, of course. But destroy one of the pearls of American literature in the process? What were they thinking? In their corruption of the story, they cut off any possibility of suspense or drama. The entire film falls flat and fails miserably. <br /> <br /> If you're a high school or college student reading this book and you're thinking of skimping and watching the movie, do not even think about it. This movie will not help you. <br /> <br /> Alas, we will have to wait even longer for a version of this story to appear on the screen and make it really fair.
