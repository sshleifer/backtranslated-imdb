The Bone Snatcher talks about a group of miners looking for a crew of missing miners in the Namib Desert. When they find them, they are nothing more than clean bones and they could not have died more than six hours. The story keeps you interested in what caused this. The characters are doing well and the acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> About an hour and ten minutes after discovering the cause of the destruction of the bones, you sigh "Oh, that's really stupid." The film is ruined by bad writing and a non-exciting end. Until then, the film was pretty good and it's a shame he took such a bad turn. I can not recommend this movie. I gave him a 4/10.
