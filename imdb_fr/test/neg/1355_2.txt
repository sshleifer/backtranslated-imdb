As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and a movie fanatic, I made a terrible mistake. I went to see "The Women", the remake of one of my favorites of all time. I have seen the original many times, in fact I own it. My hurry to see the remake was based on Diane English, the woman responsible for "Murphy Brown" My opinion was: how bad can it be? She must know what she is doing. Well, I do not know what to say. I do not understand what happened The botox√©e woman is a rather depressing affair. Meg Ryan or whoever plays Mary - she looked a bit like a grotesque version of Meg Ryan ... another actress with maybe a Meg Ryan mask - she brings nothing to the character except Norma Shearer did it in 1939. The news is a tired and unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce. The "friends" Annette Bening, Debra Messing and Jada Pinket Smith are as disconnected as anything I've ever seen and if that was not enough: Eva Mendes in Crystal, the character created by Joan Crawford in one of his best and more funny performances. The casting of Eva Mendes is in fact the sign of the falseness, the bad conception of this commercial attempt. I did not respect 1 of Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman
