The bottom barrel stinker is so serious that it's funnier. The "conspiracy" concerns an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the film, he is called "military advisor" but we do not really know if he is part of the American army or not), helping the army of a Latin American country to fight guerrillas who end up joining the guerrillas when the government turns against it, imprison and torture it. Shannon Tweed is a "sports equipment salesperson" that he picks up in a bar struggling with the plot. This description gives the film a better sound than it does, because it's really a buffoon with almost biblical proportions. Is it bad? Shannon Tweed plays the role of the most professional actor of the film. If this is not an indication that this turkey is what it is supposed to be at the 12th time, nothing is the incomparable sound effect to a musical score that seems to come from a horror movie "Z" level of the 1940s (and may very well be) at the same sequence (ie armored transport vehicles taking the same path in the jungle) continuously reused for some of the scenes "d ' action "the most unjustly organized recent memory, this funny mud festival must be seen as unbeliever. Tweed seems bored, Brown looks hangover and at the end of the process - if you can stay that long; I could not - you'll know exactly how they feel. <br /> <br /> Although there are many explosions and shootings, it can not be considered an "action" image by an effort of imagination. It's boring (there is a scene in the back of a truck where everyone looks at each other for three or four minutes), repetitive (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" killed several times), illogical ( when a group of rebels are caught in an open field by a government fighter helicopter, instead of breaking to hide, they stay there watching it), inept (soldiers and rebels falling "dead" when no fire is heard, a shooting in a house where fighters standing against the walls are machine-gunned, but miraculously, the walls escape unharmed) (when the "governor" says to offer a reward for the capture of Brown because "someone" could denounce it, you know exactly who will be this "someone", and that turns out to be exactly what you thought you were) and just stupid (just about everything else in the photo ). Inept, brainless and stupid beyond belief Do not waste your time.
