Maybe you have to be an old hippie to understand that, because apart from old-fashioned fashions, music and dialogues, he does not really have anything to do nowadays. <br /> <br /> Four passionate colleges art students enjoy worry-free days to paint nude models and ride motorcycles. They take acid in a scene and go to a zoo. A sign flashes on the screen to indicate "Do not feed the animals". Suddenly, they are in a cage laughing and are hanging on a chain balance (?!). A nasty artist (Larry Swanson) tells art career was almost ruined due to a crippling hand disease. He sends zombies in black to kidnap people, then injects them with a serum that deforms their faces. He is trying to create a new form of abstract act (I guess, the details provided are a bit fuzzy, to say the least). Meanwhile, Jason (Ross Harris) prepares to save the day after the murder of his friend Scotty (Chris Martell) and the abduction of his girlfriend Janet (Eugenie Wingate). I thought the zombie makeup in ZOMBIE LAKE was awful, but wait to see it here! It's by Douglas Hobart, the star of DEATH CURSE OF TARTU. Brad Grinter, the director of BLOOD FREAK, plays a small role much more pleasant than this deadly and dull turkey (aka NIGHTMARE HOUSE). <br /> <br /> 1984 The video version of Regal presents the bad cast (for THE BRIDES WORE BLOOD) printed directly on the label of the video! <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
