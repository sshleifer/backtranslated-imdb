Words can not express the poverty of this film. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, the acting is awful, basically the whole movie is a joke. <br /> <br /> Lasting 97 minutes, it's about 96 minutes too much. <br /> <br /> It may have been a good sketch for a humorous show, but the premise is far too fragile to work during that time without boredom. Avoid this one, rent a good movie instead!
