There is not a single character on this sitcom with any quality that redeems. They are all egocentric, odious or two-dimensional. My husband looks at him, saying there is nothing else, but I would rather not look at anything. <br /> <br /> The only sitcom that I could think it was worse was Yes, honey. At least this one did not have nine seasons. <br /> <br /> Being overweight does not make a comic book genius, and Kevin James does not have the talent of John Goodman, Jackie Gleason or John Belushi. Leah Remini may have talent, but if she does, she is devastated by the thin woman. Jerry Stiller is convincing as an annoying old man. Maybe there is a reason for that. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect example of why sitcoms are ridiculed.
