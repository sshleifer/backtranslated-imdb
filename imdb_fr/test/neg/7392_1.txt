I went to see "TKIA" with high expectations, which could influence my opinion about it. I have seen all Dogme movies and this TKIA is by far the worst. The story is closely linked to the themes in Shakespeare's play King Lear, but never captures the audience and makes them aware. The staging of the actors is very flexible, even for the Dogme style films, and gives rise to a mediocre indefinable game. The story lacks any dynamics, and I quickly lost interest. Some scenes in the film shock the viewer, but I do not think they have improved the story at all. Mifunes sidste sang and Festen are two Dogmefilm movies that have proven to be well directed and have good storylines, so I will be delighted to have better Dogmefilm movies in the future. Maybe Aake Sandgren's An Invisible Man-Dogme 6 will help improve quality. Because he is, like Vinterberg and S.K. Jacobsen a qualified and educated director.
