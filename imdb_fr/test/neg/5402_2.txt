Many people who have seen this are confused, obviously. The original title of "Cottonmouth Joe" would have put things in perspective for most viewers. I personally experienced the condition of cottonmouth (often accompanied by a very bad hangover after a weekend bender) and this actually looks a lot like the movie Skeleton Man - a dry and disgusting film that causes regret for the choices recent and pray for a hot shower. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the distributor has finalized the choice of "Skeleton Man" for the title (probably the work of a certain studio running hollywood no nothing that just did not get it) and not "Cottonmouth Joe". Those of us who have seen the movie know that the skeleton man is actually Cottonmouth Joe (a skeletal and manic appearance, not a real skeleton man). The deception of the people who sell this film is unforgivable, and just for that, I can not give a high note to this film. Imagine this: when the future filmmakers come together to create Skeleton Man's definitive film and need a title, they will be totally ruined and we are all, as real fans of the genre, diminished for that. <br /> <br /> Cottonmouth Joe could have become a horror movie icon alongside Madman Marz, Black Claw, Mansquito, Humongous, "Nature Boy" Billy Conners, Morty the Wooden Doll, Boogen, Eegah, The Beast Moon, Bloody Bill, the Driller The Killer, Mickey Rooney, etc., but we will always remember him as a dummy skull wielding a sword and wearing a hood, his face tied to the side of an aspiring man -skeleton. <br /> <br /> It's a shame. .
