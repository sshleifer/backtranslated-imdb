What can be said about a movie about a gangster gangster? Not that much. With the making of an average independent style film, this movie does not have the right timing. The editing is just horrible. As for the history of gangsters, it might have been successful if the gangsters were not lacking in character. Everyone just seemed to be there for some sort of typing line. None of them were funny. The usual suspects in this film are the heart-throbbing whore, the father of the dying mafia who wants his son to make his business legitimate, the best friend of the "zany". But the main character, the gangster who likes to disguise himself as a girl. Only his motivation to dress like a girl is that he was attacked by a woman? Bizarre. The end of the film was to be the highlight of the coffin. It was anti-climate for the least. I mean, I understand that independent filmmakers do not have the equipment they need to shoot well, but they might as well use water guns. Overall, I would say that the hype that preceded it (first on the red carpet in Vancouver) was a disappointment.
