If this film wins the Lumi√®re prize for the best French-language film, what kind of waste is coming out of France lately? <br /> <br /> This is an important subject: the situation of African economies held hostage by the international organizations that are supposed to help them, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of the government budgets of several African countries go to pay the Western debt, while their people suffer from disease, dehydration and illiteracy. <br /> <br /> ... but the subject has been treated in the most fashionable way that could be conceived by a drier man than the Sahara that surrounds the country of Mali in which this film takes place. More monotonous and action-free than any documentary I've ever seen (and I'm a fan of the genre), one "witness" after another unfolds in this "lawsuit" that is "captured" in a film that condemn the world. Bank and IMF. Some critics may spot the colorful visuals in the film, but they were out of place and had no complementary soundtrack when on screen. They belonged better in a table book than in this film. <br /> <br /> Even the characters in the movie say something like "This test is boring" and "When will it be over?" Everyone in the theater laughed. Were these people on the screen reading in our heads? <br /> <br /> Danny Glover had a brief appearance in this film. It's a TV movie in "Bamako" that was shot in Morocco or Mali. It was also more ridiculous than any Western spaghetti I've ever tried to avoid. The only redeeming part of the lost five minutes was when a Caucasian malefactor accidentally shot an African woman carrying a baby and showed no remorse. It may have been a symbol of the insensitivity of the World Bank and the way it inadvertently kills Africans. <br /> <br /> And one last technical detail, the subtitles were difficult to read with as many light colors on the screen and not enough black outline for the subtitles themselves. <br /> <br /> I have already summarized the film for you. Do not be fooled by the hype. No need to see this movie. You will never find those two hours in your life.
