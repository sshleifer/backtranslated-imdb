Okay ... so you have a dam, tons of water (which seems to sink very slowly) and a small town just below the road to destroy the dams. Add a greedy wolverine, a seemingly mentally unstable and disgruntled architect, and his son, and then, to spice things up, add a weak plot and bad acting. Overall, when you watch this film from the point of view of a paying customer ... I would feel extremely annoyed if it was a movie Ã  la carte. If you want to laugh ... then you really have to watch this movie.
