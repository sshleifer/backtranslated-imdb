Carson Daly must be the only talk show host late at night who is not a comedian. What was NBC thinking! He is not funny! The writing is horrible! All the sketches are painful to watch. The new karaoke is not funny at all, especially since it tells you what they will sing before singing! The escalator talks are stupid and needless to say, it's not funny at all. All his jokes, especially during the monologue, are the least intelligent, stupid and funny jokes ever on TV! I mean, every time he makes a joke of Jessica Simpson, he ends it with "because she's stupid", which cancels any fun of the joke, which was already very low. Any 3-year-old could have invented any of the jokes and sketches of this lame excuse for a show. Seriously, do not watch this show unless you are about to commit suicide and want something to push you to the limit.
