It's an extremely horrible film. And if you think you've seen another horrible movie, just like this one before, you've probably done it before. You probably saw Scarecrow 2 shot in 2003. Yes, that's what I said, Brian (the director) stole the idea of ​​the movie. And not only did he steal it, he could even have made it worse. I bet even the actors were scared to tell people that they were actually in the movie. In addition, I must mention that the director was trying to compensate for this feeling by showing as many breasts as possible. The scenes of kisses were also assembled as a porn movie. In fact, it's probably all the director has ever seen and tried to make a decent movie, which will never work.
