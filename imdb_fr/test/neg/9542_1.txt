Wow - this movie was really bad! Are you talking about a formula, a typical movie scenario? Watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. The transitions continued to want to be cool but failed. The plot at the end, where we find out who the villain is, was unexpected, but did not make much sense before his monologue. Even then ... The amount of blood in this movie does not help either. Are all these images necessary? My last complaint concerns the plausibility of pieces of the film. Would the PD really send an officer alone into an unlit warehouse, subway tunnel or anywhere to find a body, when the author's location is not known? And why does romance in the end happen suddenly? It's as if the author was trying to fit into every Hollywood cliche he could. Do not waste your time seeing this piece of ... something.
