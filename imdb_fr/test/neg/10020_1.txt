Of course, most of the 80's slasher films were not worth the film they were filmed on, but this video nightmare could be the dullest product ever. <br /> <br /> . <Br /> <br /> Six smoking potty students decide to go camping. Of course, <br /> <br /> and you already know, they start getting killed one by one by an unknown <br /> <br />. The highlight is a ranger trying to get to <br /> <br /> teenagers in time before the latest pretty girl becomes a buzzard <br /> <br /> as bait. <br /> <br /> John Carl Buechler, my favorite guy from B-movies, used the lousy makeup effects <br /> <br /> here. The cast presents Carel Struycken, "The <br /> <br /> Witches of Eastwick" and the films of the Addams family. Unfortunately, it only appears at the very end of the film and is covered with make-up, which makes it unrecognizable. Steve Bond (who remembers him?) Is here at the beginning of his role as a victim. <br /> <br /> Brown's instruction and the script he co-wrote, they both feel the <br /> <br /> present brown bears in the woods. He filmed the film with <br /> <br /> so many wild footage, I thought I accidentally rented a special <br /> episode of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. A large part of the distribution <br /> <br /> sits around the campfire and eats, then walks and sits and eats again <br /> <br />. The Ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever <br /> <br /> in a slasher movie: he tells a joke about a wide-mouthed frog to a baby <br /> <br /> deer . Jackie Coogan, who surely forgot to once work <br /> <br /> on silent movie legends, has two scenes and is involved <br /> <br /> in the second strangest scene ever organized in a movie slasher: <br /> <br /> he and the lucky ranger discuss about cucumber and <br /> <br /> cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread .. yeah. <br /> <br /> This is not a minute of suspense here. The killer, a forest fire survivor <br /> <br /> looking for a companion, monitors the students from behind the trees. We know that it is the killer because the filmmakers have doubled in a heartbeat effect that serves a useful purpose in waking the spectator <br /> <br /> every few minutes. Avoid this pile of pine sap and rent it <br /> <br /> "Halloween" instead. <br /> <br /> This is noted (R) for Physical Violence, Light Armed Violence, Gore, <br /> <br /> some rudeness, brief female nudity, moderate sexual content, sexual references, and addiction .
