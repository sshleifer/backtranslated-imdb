I am in a movie club at my school and I had to sit down and watch this film absolutely lamentable. The story of the film is not bleak, but the whole film is extremely morose. The game was absolutely horrendous. The children were too whiny. A metal pole could have done a better job. I desperately wanted to fall asleep, but because the TV was so noisy, I was not at peace. The monkeys are neither cute nor funny. The drama is worthy of laughter. I do not remember when I saw a more dreadful movie. The story is weak, thin, predictable and completely wrong. Adults try to be good actors, but they can not break stereotypes. The girl even seems to want to leave the film falling from a hill during the film in order to leave it, I do not blame her. Micheal Anderson should apologize publicly for this film. Not just for me, but for all those who have been forced to watch this horrible film. In fact, I apologize to you. Although I have nothing to do with this project, I apologize for this movie because it means at least someone will do it. This film goes beyond the despair of Rob Schneider and Cheetah Girls. I would go so far as to say that it's even worse than Hilary Duff's movie collection, but that drives him. Please, do not see this movie, otherwise you will be pushed to write a criticism similar to this one about its horror. I am really sorry.
