I watched this movie again and again since its first release. I was fifteen and even then, I knew it was corny. There was such potential and I constantly rewrite the script in my head. Capoeira ruined what could have been a good drama. I loved the fact that it was shot on the spot. Too bad the characters are underdeveloped. It's as if they had written a first draft script and then made the film right away. I could have written a better screenplay at fifteen! Some scenes and dialogues seemed to come out of nowhere and there were still a lot of unanswered questions. And was it just me, or did it seem that Lobo was sexually attracted to his cousin? "Elena has become a kind of woman!" And the way he always touched her. Elena would work for her drugged cousin who is also a pervert. Too bad they missed the target on this one.
