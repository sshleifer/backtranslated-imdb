When Jim Wynorski announced for the first time that he would make a new sequel to my favorite series of all time, the series "Slumber Party Massacre", I was delighted. I was waiting for a new down payment for literally years. So, the production started and very small pieces on the set and the actors involved were released until the shooting was finished. Then, the announcement of a title change. This new sequel will not be called "Slumber Party Massacre IV", but "Cheerleader Massacre" instead. I was a little disappointed, but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a movie I had waited so long. I was always extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see him. <br /> <br /> A month or so ago, very advanced copies of the film were distributed to extremely lucky viewers who had the chance to see the film. months before its release date. Some critics filtered through the net and judging by them, I started to fear Jim Wynorski's "Massacre of Cheerleaders." <br /> <br /> Tonight, I was able to see the movie for the first time in its entirety and I'm still scratching my head. As I read in another review, "Cheerleader Massacre" is certainly not a new article in the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, but a slasher movie. And a bad one to that. <br /> <br /> Before going into the details of the film, let me first say what a big fan of Jim Wynorski's films I am. I always thought he was a true camp genius, with a winner almost every time. Yes, his films are made on a tight budget and do not contain the most talented actors, but they are nevertheless fun. They are what they are: movies you watch when you want to have a good time. From "Sorority House Massacre II" to "Hard to Die" to "Chopping Mall", Jim has made the goods several times. One of the reasons I was excited about this film being his last project. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" does not reflect (in my opinion) any of the films I've seen this director / screenwriter create in the past. First, the production was extremely cheap and the film was shot on a videotape, which I had never seen Jim do before. The actors were mediocre to say the least, and the story is almost laughable. The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your old stuffed grandfather than the escaped madman. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is littered with feminine nudity. It's a Jim Wynorski film we're talking about, dear friends. But some of the boobs seen here seem almost to have been made for the time. There is an extremely long shower scene, containing the cheerleader's coach, that seems to last forever and that dramatically reflects a shower scene in Jim's "Sorority House Massacre II". The girl bathes even in almost the same way. <br /> <br /> "Massacre cheerleaders" is also extremely clich√©, it's the least we can say. The opening scene is literally something we've all seen in hundreds of past slasher movies. A guy and a girl going out, about to consume their relationship when ... you guessed it. They are divided into pieces. <br /> <br /> Brinke Stevens, whom I have never really considered a great actress, also gives one of her most rigorous and forced performances in her little cameo. We are talking about possible landmark maps here. She remembers some incidents of which her character was victimized by the murderer who was seen here by the police twenty years ago, while images of the original "Slumber Party Massacre" are broadcast. Why were the images from the original film used if it was definitely not a new "SPM"? I have no idea. There are also two explosions in this film, which, I'm sure, have been recycled. <br /> <br /> Not only does this film recycle FOOTAGE from previous films, but it also recycles scores from other movies. . Some of the music used in "Humanoids from the Deep" (which was also previously recycled for "The Coroner") can be heard throughout the film. There are at least two others that I can not identify, but I'm sure they have already been used. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie in this appalling film, a ridiculous story, nonexistent special effects and a camcorder As for quality, the career of Mr. Wynorski seriously worries me. Has the man who enchanted the public with films in the past finally lost his niche? Only time will tell. Oh, and let's not forget his new movie. A new episode in the movies "Sorority House Massacre", now titled "Final Exam". I think I see a model here ...
