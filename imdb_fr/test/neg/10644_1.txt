Hellraiser: Bloodline is just an average movie. I believe this is the fourth installment of the Hellraiser series. <br /> <br /> I missed the beginning and all I remember was topless women and a box-shaped thing on a computer screen. But, using my intelligence and intelligence (and the Info button), I soon discovered that the villain (Pinhead) had been released from Pandora's Box, which, in my opinion, is a gateway to hell . <br /> <br /> Anyway, Pinhead gets out of the box and terrorizes the Toymakers' family. And that's about it. Oh, and not to mention the random tortures of various people who cross each other in his path. Yawning. <br /> <br /> What happens mainly in this film is that Pinhead captures the child, then drops the dog on his wife, then kills a person at random. Then he comes the husband, blah, blah, blah. We do not care? Why does it fail because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too old to scare. Examine the creatures of Pinhead: a cheese dog that looks like it has been turned over, two men whose head and body are connected, (Siamese twins in a horror movie?) And a person who is supposed to be a Princess Trier. (I have not seen the previous movies.) Now, look at the main villain. His name is Pinhead. Is not that the name you call someone when they are stupid? He has pins in his head and hooks sticking out of his fingers and he has blue skin. I guess he would make a decent villain if he did not have such a cheesy name and a cheesy talk. Somewhere in the movie, two cops approach him and say, "Do not hurt us!" Pinhead answers "Pain? How dare you use this word! I AM pain ??" Blah blah blah blah blah. It seems a little clich√©. <br /> <br /> Do not forget the last half of the film. Characters (and the public) are more vulnerable to torture when Pinhead attacks a futuristic haven. Someone we do not recognize (maybe he was in previous movies, I do not remember him at the beginning of the movie.) This scene is basically something that is played over and over again: > <br /> A guard will inspect a mysterious sound. <br /> <br /> Another guard: "Oh no, he's shot, I'll go watch him, all by himself." <br /> <br /> After he dies the same thing happens again. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) Here is the thing I did not get. In the film, Pinhead was sent to Oblivion at the end. So, how does it come back for four other films? Are they prequel? Why is not he dead in the previous ones? Geez. Manufacturers must find an idea for a different series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser: The lineage is bloody and full of scenes of torture, but has little sensations and value. Forget that. Bad special effects with bad - everything else makes it more like a sleep party than a good horror. <br /> <br /> Good: Some people may like to topless women at first. Plus, Pinhead's voice is pretty cool. I suppose if you like ultra-violence, you might like this too. <br /> <br /> Bad: None of the reasons above is a very good movie. Corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad. And who names their villain Pinhead? <br /> <br /> Feel free to send me a private message about this comment.
