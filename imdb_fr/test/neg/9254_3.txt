I saw this movie only because it was on the DPN Video Nasty list, and I'm glad I saw it because it's now another "nasty Video Nasty" - in itself, Andy Milligan's movie is really not worth bothering with. There are, of course, far worse films on the infamous list; but it does not make the pain to see it easier. The film was obviously shot with an extremely small budget, and it was translated into the script. like Blood Rites works on an idea often seen in horror cinema and does nothing new with it. Basically, the plot is centered on three couples who find themselves in a house waiting for the results of a will. It's not long before they start getting caught ... blah blah blah. For most of the film, nothing happens; and then when we finally arrive at the scenes that justify the ban on the film, they are so amateurish and stupid that they are impossible to take seriously at any level. It is a very good thing that this film does not have a long life, otherwise it could have been used as a particularly unpleasant method of torture. It all comes down to a very tedious end, which also succeeds in being a non-event of epic proportions. Apparently, this film is still banned here in the UK; but anyway I doubt it is because of its shock value. Basically, Blood Rites is not worth seeing and personally, I see no reason to recommend it. Unless, of course, you set yourself the goal of seeing everything on the Video Nasty list ...
