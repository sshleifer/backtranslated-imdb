Identifying this movie as a vampire movie would be technically correct. Just because he's going to suck you up. <br /> <br /> The Vampire Effect is an insult to moviegoers around the world. The plot is almost non-existent. The makeup is just horrible. And the acting is just not there. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if Jackie Chan owed a huge favor to being persuaded to appear in this movie. <br /> <br /> movie at the rental store because there was a picture of Jackie Chan on the front (as if he was playing the main role) and thought that a good movie of JC would be fun to watch . This movie was interesting to watch in the same way that you can not help but watch the wreckage of the car as you pass by. You realize very quickly that the movie will not get better, but you keep watching, amazing how bad it will go
