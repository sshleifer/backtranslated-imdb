I saw a lot of movies. In fact, I love horror B movies, they are one of my favorite genres. However, this "trash" (I refuse to admit that it was awarded the honor of the film) is the worst shit I have ever had the torture to watch. In fact, I registered on IMDb only because I needed a way to say at least how horrible this "Waste" was. I watched "Films" (at least they deserve this honor) made in basements by students better written and directed. I only have pity for the poor actors of this "trash" because they were just trying to win a paycheck. They will now and forever have this spot on their records like a virgin who has been raped and who has received a herpes! If screenwriter / director John Shiban still has any dignity whatsoever, after obviously bowing to countless people, he should never again be able to approach a camera and try to apply his so-called "Gifts" to something that would suit him better ... Like the mop of a Peep Show !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
