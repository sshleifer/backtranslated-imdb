This film was released shortly after the Conan films, a kind of Conan, Red Sonja, played by Sylvester Stallones' ex-wife, Brigitte Nielsen. She is unfortunately not a very good actress, as Rocky IV and Cobra prove. The whole film seems cheap, but strangely Arnold Swarzenegger appears in this film, but not as Conan, although he looks, acts and fights like Conan from Conan's two movies, I do not know what matters. Anyway, it appears only every twenty minutes or so and does not stay long. Maybe Arnold filmed that while he was filming Conan the Destroyer or something? Anyway, the movie is a slow and boring way for an action movie, skip this and look instead at Conan the Barbarian.
