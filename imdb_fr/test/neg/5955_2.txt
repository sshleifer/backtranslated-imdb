There is a reason why the world has forgotten these creatures: they are dull. This is a hammer production, which means anyone who shot this film should be hit with a hammer, many times if possible - and where it hurts the most. Most people think more about taking a dump than these idiots did to make this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously now ?? The film begins with cavemen looking for an antelope. Now, antelopes must have evolved a lot since prehistoric times because they attack and kill people here. After that, it's time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, dummies and even some very old grannies and grandfathers with gray hair. These old geezers have obviously never heard of cavemen not older than 30; they refused to bow to the will of logic and prehistoric documents in order to stay alive. One of the cavemen is not bearded; he is clean shaven. Not quite as shaved as Tarzan, the lord of the shaved humanoids To shave the jungle since childhood and without a razor, but pretty much. <br /> <br /> The following is the mandatory earthquake / destruction of the lava molten sequence that causes a lot of our friends not so hairy to meet their fate. It is interesting to note that before the earthquake, the models showed more of their breasts. After that, they must have been shy or something like that because they covered their chest for a while (maybe they were covered with ashes so I thought they were covered). More action follows in the form of two dummies struggling in the sand; the second best thing to the female wrestling in the mud, I guess. After crossing a good part of the desert, our black-haired tribe meets another tribe - how could it be otherwise - a blonde tribe. Yawning. <br /> <br /> Other haunting tips follow. There's this red-haired model who is worried about a cave teen killing a pig-hedge thing. There is also the scene of a woman dying at birth: these models of caves are so frail. Finally, we meet a tribe with even darker hair, namely the evil tribes. One of them becomes WWF champion after beating (!) A huge bear deal in a wrestling match. 1,2,3 ... and it's done: the bear is the loser. We also see a jealous caveman miraculously recovering from two major wounds: first he is stabbed with a big spear in his thigh, but he walks away from that as if it were a scratch. Then he is thrown from a cliff - on a big boulder - by the blond caveman Goodie-two-shoes, but he walks away as if he had been thrown on a giant couch. In the end, we do not know if he dies from the fall of an even higher cliff or the fall of a crushed voodoo doll. Oh yes, the voodoo was used in prehistoric times by the white tribes living in the desert and whose women were models. It is always important to learn movies. <br /> <br /> The film's message is both informative and informative: the cavemen loved to fight for local power and they also loved their models. As if a self-respecting caveman was fighting to become the leader of such a desolate group.
