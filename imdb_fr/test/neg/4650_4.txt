This is a treat for fans of Z-grade movies. Here you will find that writing and acting are bad enough to compete with what Ed Wood has ever produced. The veteran bad actor Cameron Mitchell is a former make-up artist of "Paragon Studios" who, after a perverse acid-acid incident at a social gathering, becomes a mad scientist Mad Scientist (tm) with a rubber scar on takes revenge by removing actors from Paragon and turning them into living statues in his Secret Laboratory (TM), located in the local wax museum. Or are these zombies doing what he wants? He is not sure. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of your favorite shots are here. Check out the bad guy's lab! These mysterious steaming tanks of liquid? Test tubes of colored water without purpose explained? Yay! And what is there to see spare arms and legs laid out a little relaxed on a wooden support? You betcha! Marvel at the annoying detectives who act straight out of Plan Nine! Now, enjoy a stupidly tamed car chase and hear more stunned bimbo yelling than you could wish. Raise an eyebrow at the intricate plot, made even more opaque by the meaningless end that seems to have no connection with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Trash with cheese and a lot of fun for the bad movie lover.
