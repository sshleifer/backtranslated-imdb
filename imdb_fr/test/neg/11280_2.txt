I gave these 2 stars out of 10. <br /> <br /> I went without realizing what it was - and I discovered that it was apparently a kind African music - because people sing songs every few minutes. None of the songs rhyme, most of them do not say anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent melody - if you could call it "melody". <br /> <Karmen is a tall and spectacular young woman, with the longest braids I've ever seen. [The actress seems to have done the dummy.] <br /> <br /> The film starts in a women's prison, although it's not a prison I've ever seen or heard of - the inmates wear this they want. wish - and seems to have a party. <br /> <br /> Karmen is dancing wildly, and the woman guardian of the prison, Ang√©lique, [a beautifully beautiful woman] is definitely interested in eroticism. She and Karmen dance together. Later, Karmen visits the guard room and they make love - unfortunately, the scene is not detailed and is very short, although there is some nudity. <br /> <br /> Karmen then escapes from the prison and we see her dancing next to another group where a man, named Lamine, maybe a colonel - it was never really clear who he was, was watching her. He is with a young woman who does not like the seductive dance of Karmen and there is a dance between the two women. <br /> <br /> Then, the story [as it is] becomes even more confusing. <br /> <br /> With Lamine in prison, out of prison, and who knows where. <br /> <br /> Karmen can be involved in a group of smugglers or thieves. <br /> <br /> There are more songs. Even more dancing and a scene of Angelica obviously suffering from grief. <br /> <br /> The film ends up getting confused and I have a sigh of relief that it's over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
