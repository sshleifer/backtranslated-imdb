Synopsis: Kid is not accepted in any college. He creates a "college" where he and his friends can party using their parents' school fees. <br /> <br /> Wow. A paean to ignorance. <br /> <br /> If you think everything is fine, this movie is for you. In addition, you must understand that: <br /> <br /> 1. Children have everything in them - they just need to let them out. <br /> <br /> 2. Teaching really stifles the innate creativity with which everyone is born. <br /> <br /> 3. Someone else should pay for you to follow your passion. <br /> <br /> 4. 300 adolescents can live together in harmony, provided these restrictive rules are removed. <br /> <br /> 5. Improvised speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. <br /> <br /> 6. If the Board of Education allows you to open a "charter school" with "non-traditional teaching techniques", it's because they have your interest at heart. (That's not to say that they are willing to give up underperforming students who will eventually work anyway.) <br /> <br /> This movie is like a college comedy, Animal House. It follows the pattern pretty well. What is new here, however, is a total attack on higher education, not a parody of bad elements. He lacks the friendly initiate, a teacher who embodies the useful part of university life. <br /> <br /> This lack of balance will condemn this film to the last lines of Blockbuster. It was so one-sided that I wondered if it was an ironic reference point of any kind - for about a minute. The film has no deep meaning, no layers, no introspection. It's as if they let children who have never been to school do what comes naturally. And what is natural is the name of the school: S ***. <br /> <br /> (I never thought I'd say that: go see something with Will Farrell, his comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)
