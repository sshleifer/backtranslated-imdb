It's hard to say who this movie is for. the characterization and style evoke a series "Children's ITV" crossed with an Australian soap opera, but the subject, the nudity and the language are addressed to an older public. <br /> <br /> The first half hour has heroine Justine philosopher about the loss of her virginity and is extremely embarrassing for people over 18 years old. A total scam for "Ferris Bueller", from the conversation to the camera to the graphics on the screen. <br /> Her nerdy friend Chas leads her to a computer show where an explosion when using a virtual reality machine turns her into a man. Or in fact, create a male alter-ego of her, called Jake. Do not look at me like that; I simply tell it the way it was shown. <br /> <br /> After that, the movie is slightly amusing for a while; Of all the drama cases in a theater school, only Rupert Penry-Jones brings a comical touch to his role as Jake, the body of a woman trapped in a man's body. There are funny scenes with Jake dealing with his new body and new feelings. Nothing you've ever seen before, but in this movie you'll get an idea of ​​everything that's entertaining. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Justine and Jake meet and hilarious antics follow (I wish), involving the owners of the virtual machine who wants to kidnap Jake to have sex with him, or the examine, or something like that. Anyway, this is just an excuse to complete another half-hour of explosions and car chases. for such a cheap film, the explosions are frequent and strong, suggesting that the money has been spent in bad places. <br /> <br /> Finally, the heroine realizes that she can not fall in love with herself, suppress her alter ego and end up with an evening with the nerd to lose her virginity (it's probably this which is supposed to be a happy ending in the 90s). But only after removing his glasses and put some hair gel and a leather jacket; God forbid, she does have sex with someone who looks like a nerd. Of course, this is a bit subversive - in these days of PC movies that tell you to love and be yourself, and that everyone is special in their own way, it is pleasantly reactionary to have a film that screams "CONFORM" at home and treat virgins and nerds with the contempt they deserve. <br /> <br /> The characterization is simple and terrible; the nerd is very nerdy (room full of computers, thick glasses, social retardation, virginity, no leather jacket), there is a slut, she is very slutty (blonde, tight dresses, orange tan, music accompaniment vampy), there is a jock, it is very ... well, you get the picture. You can get away with this kind of characterization in a broad comedy, but "Virtual Sexuality" is not very funny. This is only slightly fun in some parts, and atrocious in others. It takes a woman as cute as Justine (played by Laura Fraser) to annoy me, but she does it. <br /> <br /> Do not rely on the title; the film has absolutely nothing erotic, and it does not deal with the way in which the new technologies of the communication modify our way of seeing and acquiring relations (unless you really think that there is a chance as your PlayStation explodes and changes your sex.)). <br /> <br />
