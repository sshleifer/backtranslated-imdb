This film is a real trash and gets worse even closer to the end, very long! <br /> <br /> The plot is confused and laborious, the actors have an indifferent attitude (maybe they were paid in advance - bad movement or they knew they would not be paid), and the sets were featureless, boring and cheap. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep twice and I actually decided not to worry about the last 5 minutes, because I thought the actors would have fallen asleep at that time. More wasted life time wasted! <br /> <br /> If you have to watch it, bring it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once. But maybe you will need an antidepressant instead! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's good for celluloid to break down.
