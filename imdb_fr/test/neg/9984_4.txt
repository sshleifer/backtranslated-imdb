Although its plot is inspired by the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not in the style of epics of the sword-and-sandals like Spartacus or Gladiator. (This style of film was out of favor in the late seventies). On the contrary, it looks more like a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a nasty video. At least the abridged version of 150 minutes does it. I've never seen the full 210-minute version, but judging from the descriptions on this page, it would seem closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a nasty video. <br /> <br /> As can be expected from a film produced by the publisher of 'Penthouse', we see a lot of naked flesh and the film lovingly lists the sexual perversions of Caligula, including his Incestuous affair with his sister Drusilla. What may be unexpected in the magazine publisher so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as visible woman and distinctly homoerotic nuances of many. scenes. The obsession with sex is counterbalanced by an equal obsession with violence, as if Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass were trying to kill two birds with one stone. (It's a remarkable coincidence that the director of such an audacious film is called "Brass" and that the screenwriter of such a bloody movie is called "Gore"). The characters are put to death or mutilated in various sadistic ways, and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape. <br /> <br /> Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their debauched lifestyles, so the film's concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily inaccurate in the past. I wonder, however, if such concentration is necessary to help us understand this period of Roman history. The fall of the Roman Empire and the Gladiator were put under the reign of Commodus, an emperor as cruel and licentious as Caligula. In neither case did the filmmakers consider it necessary to transform their film into a mix of "Up Pompeii!", "Emmanuelle" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Both films are much better artistically than "Caligula". <BR /> <br /> The role in the film is not particularly bad, with a few exceptions, like the horrible wood Teresa Ann Savoy in the role of Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes a suitably crazy Caligula. (This is appropriate in the context of this film: The true Caligula was undoubtedly both cruel and eccentric, but historians have debated whether he was really mentally ill). The great mystery is precisely the reason why so many distinguished British actors should have accepted to take part in such a trashy production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only lady in the British Empire to have played the role of porn star), he was probably linked to his rather unfortunate tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the ladle, but only the sky knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing. Unlike other famous actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud has not always been completely comfortable in the movies, but here he gives an interpretation worthy of the role of Nerva, a decent and honorable senator of the old school. Unfortunately, in the context of this film, any attempt at dignity is as misplaced as a pearl on a dunghill. <br /> <br /> Guccione has clearly achieved his ambition to make this film a classic of the cult of decadence. (One wonders if Brass and Vidal had about the same ambition because the film However, the film does not succeed at any other level, whether as an art cinema or as a study of politics. The dictatorship, even considered erotic, is second-rate.
