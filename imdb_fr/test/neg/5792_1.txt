This film hurt my face. I do not understand it ... things just happened, inexplicably, and they usually resulted in someone singing and dancing. I do not understand how people can praise this movie with praise. There are B movies, then B-musicals, and then Rockula. <br /> <br /> The songs made me want to go headlong into a wall. The only thing that saves is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a music video, which alleviates the pain, without justifying the reason for its existence. The most frightening section of the film is Toni Basil's insidious dance accompanying his strange song. But on the bright side, she manages to find the notes she seeks, unlike the sensations of pop music Rockula (aka Rapula) and Mona ... wow, can you say your deaf. So, if you want to interrogate life for about 90 minutes, watch this movie. If you hate your life, buy it.
