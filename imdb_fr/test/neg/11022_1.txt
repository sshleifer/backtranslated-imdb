I begin to wonder, after reading some of the opinions expressed here, if I watched the same movie as the other critics, but after verifying my facts, I am forced to the sad conclusion that I must have. <br /> <br /> This unscrupulous wannabee screwball comedy must be one of the longest 94 minutes I've ever spent, and one of the funniest things I've seen in ages. . Now, do not get me wrong, I love comedies to aim at, but this boring and frozen workout is so far from the dizzying heights of Preston Sturges and Howards Hawks that he does not deserve (to mix up my metaphors) to be thought in the same breath as those big ones. Writer / director Charles Martin's dialogue is neither witty, subtle nor interesting - and so much so. He also does not know how to finish a scene, with ruthless cuttings, especially people coming out of the rooms and saying goodbye, the pace of the film would have been accelerated, and the fact that the limited number of characters do stupid things. and things without motivation for the sole reason that it is supposed to be a comedy would have been a little less obvious. The characters in this film fall in love with each other, and come in and out of apartments at any time to advance the little plot that there is here. One moment, people are desperate for a person, the next moment they are getting married to someone else - after being courteous and dismissed off the screen, we do not know anything about it until one of the characters tells us, "Oh, they are getting married! "(usually after someone has made a misstep or jumped to the wrong conclusion.) If we had known that these two characters were in love or supposed to be engaged before, the public could have appreciated the experience of seeing someone a foolishness in front of them.As they are characters that look like selfish and petulant idiots, we have no sympathy for them. <br /> <br /> The sets are limited and the action that is theirs confined in such a way as to make the complete ensemble look like a badly filmed play.The only relief from this boredom is Keenan Wynn, who seems to have been lost in a different film and has decided to hang out and be slightly funnier than all the insignificant things taking place around him. <br /> <br /> Very avoidable.
