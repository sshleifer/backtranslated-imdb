the photography is good, the costumes are good, but the editing is bad. The different scenes are cut or stopped at the wrong time, and the conversations are tedious and tedious. This slowness continues the whole show. It's a very tedious sight to watch. . . . I think more scenes should have been added, but that would make it a longer show. It is very slow. The writers should have just made a one-night show and not prolong our agony night after night. There is nothing else, otherwise I would change channels (the first night). I feel bad for the Indians of the day and I am angry at the white men for what they did to the Indians, but that's our story.
