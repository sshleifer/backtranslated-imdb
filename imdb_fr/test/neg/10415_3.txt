The only time I think I'm looking at IMDb's comments is when I saw a bad movie. I guess I'm trying to make sure it's not just me. For me, then, Lonesome Jim was a humorous film filled with incredible characters in incredible situations, limping from a weak and boring conclusion to a worn-out conclusion. So I check what the others have to say and feel a little like Jim's head, insane, while page after page, several stars and applause leave me doubting my critical faculties. However, I should perhaps check the parameters of the presentation of comments, because after a while, the gush faded and I am relieved to see appreciations that reflect mine. I feel justified. It's a garbage film, it does not stay hooked and it's not a lost night. Praise to related spirits.
