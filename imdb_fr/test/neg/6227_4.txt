This film is not very good at all. It's pretty stupid, pretty annoying and very badly done. I only really saw this film because one of my friends told me that they hated this movie. Although I do not hate it so much, I always thought it was a very bad movie. The only thing that's really good about it is that it was a little entertaining from time to time, and I felt that if it had been done a little better, it would have been just as good. What I mean by a little better is that if it had been totally overhauled, it would not have seemed to have been shot for a film festival, and if the script had been improved, it would have been a good one slasher movie. Instead of that is not what it is today, but a shitty movie. The acting is atrocious. I felt like I was watching two teenagers playing for a Halloween show or thrill ride or something. movie itself), and basically everything else is of lower class. In general, this movie is really bad and you will not miss anything if you decide to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> 3.8 out of 10 stars
