This movie shows what you can create if you have a camera, cardboard and paint spares, a toy boat, some friends who played in a community theater and the mistaken notion that you can make a movie. The end result is a waste of unassailable time that you will spend unless you take it out of the DVD player and throw it out of the window first. <br /> <br /> The acting game in the opening scene (especially the round Lee Morgan as "captain") and the toy ship "crashing" into the rocks before the credits is a good one Indicator of what you expect (with all the foam, it looks like this "special effect" has been shot down a kitchen sink, I guess Boyette was thinking of saving a few cents by doing the dishes at the same time). As far as bad cinema is concerned, the funny thing is that "Harrow Dungeon" seems to have inspired (perhaps by chance) the winding end of "Manos: the hands of fate". Yes, it's the same lame "I was the victim, and now I take the place of the crazy villain" ironic end. The irony is that two incompetent and unskilled filmmakers could make two horror movies equal to Texas, filmed in the same way, and get away with it. <br /> <br /> The monotonous nerdy Russ Harvey is a noble in a great family lineage (why they were great, never touched), boring us while lamenting the death of his family line and his coat of arms even before his ship is crashing (we are also dealing with a deafening narration throughout the film). Unfortunately, we are not so lucky. The toy boat of his family crashes on a styrofoam in a sink. He is disembarked with his bloated captain and a woman, conveniently deposited on the island of a mad count. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the count is visited by an evil spirit who, dressed in a Blackstone's Magic Kit, assails him with various puppets (spiders, snakes, bats ... all these thorny things). The Earl (William McNulty) behaves worse than Shatner and is obviously struggling to keep his serious face to the typical delusional madman. <br /> <br /> I would be angry too if I were to be in this disaster. The woman is quickly killed by the ferocious dogs of the count and the two tremors are captured by his servant. The count accuses them of being pirates (apparently his biggest fear), he slaps his servant very much (apparently his greatest joy), Fatboy gets tortured, there is a woman who is a servant and one who is a nurse , the rotting leper wizard A countess in a wedding dress in the dungeon (she digs the Nerdy Noble and is the only thing effective and terrifying in the movie), a lot of insane dialogues at a dining room table, the captain blubber himself killed while escaping pathetically (watching a sloth fight a group of lions). . . all this is an ugly mist for me. I spent most of my time on the fast forward button. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the noble jerk and the nurse make a getaway and think that they will be rescued by three men in a boat on the lake (yes, we are supposed to believe that 'a lake is the ocean). They do not, since the hair of the nerd has turned gray and scares potential rescuers. Honestly, I think they just took the opportunity to leave this hideous film while they had the opportunity. They return to the castle, the nurse begins to rot like the countess (and your stomach at the moment), and we finish with these two who are preparing to go down in the. . . THE DONJON OF ANGER !!!! Blech! <br /> <br /> I like old horror movies, but they must have a playful value. I feel scammed, even at the lowest price of $ 5.99 for this cookie. Mystery Science Theater would have a hard time making this one fun. Some crazy critics told me that this movie had a scary atmosphere and moments. False! Avoid these guts at all costs, and do not even waste money if you find it in a dollar tank somewhere. This film makes Corman's "The Terror" a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.
