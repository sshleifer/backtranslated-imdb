I consider myself having a good sense of humor, but this "movie" left me stunned in my chair. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that it just could not have been worse. I did not laugh once in the jokes sadly tempted by this film. I watched and enjoyed several parodies of great movies, but unfortunately this one will always be the one I remember best - in my nightmares. <br /> <br /> The only reason everyone should want to watch this is if they want to go into a coma for a short while. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie of all time.
