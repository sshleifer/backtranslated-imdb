THE RIDDLE was written and directed by Brendan Foley in what appears to be an attempt to uncover the mysteries of Charles Dickens' novels in a contemporary story, but this attempt is thwarted by choosing to use the two formats of "riddle" is solved . Despite a cast of well-known actors striving to obtain this film directly on DVD, the end product is a tedious and amateurish mess that can only be considered entertainment if the viewers are fans of the film. movies. <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a journalist who only reports on dog racing events as he dreams of major reporting missions. A series of similar killings includes an old friend of Mike, Sadie (Vera Day), who runs a pub on the banks of the Thames, after discovering a previously unpublished manuscript of Charles Dickens, and who has a heart of gold. sandwiches to pathetic creatures like an old beach hobo (Derek Jacobi). Sadie's murder attracts Mike as a detective journalist. With the help of policewoman Kate (Julie Cox), he begins to link the investigation to the clues he finds by reading the Dickens manuscript. The use of flashbacks in Dickens' day disrupts the course of this rather simplistic story while Dickens (again Derek Jacobi) tells a rather personal story of particular murders. The parallel between the stories and the footage between actors may have worked in the hands of another, but the finesse of this type of project escapes author / director Brendan Foley. He ends his story (finally) with a tiring end to the Hollywoodian. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jones, Jacobi, Cox and Day, the film caught the attention of Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng, PH Moriarty and Mel Smith: their contributions are minimal but entertaining. This is a piece of fragile molasses leaving the viewer wondering how films of this quality find funding. Grady Harp
