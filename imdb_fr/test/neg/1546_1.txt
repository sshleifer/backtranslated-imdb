I already commented on this movie (under the name of TheLegendaryWD). But I see there are others who have commented since. All I can say is: WHAT THE F ** K!? I can not believe that 16 people have commented on this film, or even seen this film, add to that the fact that a couple gave him excellent reviews (probably the directors of the film who went to one of these places in a shopping center offering an internet service and have written a good review - knowing that it is impossible to pay or pay their own ISP ... just watch their movie Even though I always recognize that I have a weakness for this film, I thought some people writing on this one might have confused this with another ... until I read the reviews ... especially the no one who has identified the slogan on the front of the box: "The ultimate in frontal lobotomy" (what does f ** k mean to mean anyway? front-end lobotomy?). .. I had totally forgotten this until I read it in the People, we are u n small number ... I say that we meet once a year to see this movie ... wait, is there still one? please contact me ... I'm dying to get drunk.
