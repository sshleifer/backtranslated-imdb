At the heart of almost every real crime thriller is a highly thought-out, methodically planned and planned super-crime, committed 9 times out of 10 by a group of friendly outsiders with grizzled morality for whom life is not fair, for whom to recover to man is, well, something that deserves to be encouraged. James V. Simpson's screenplay for the first time for Armored goes in the right direction. He was extremely dubious that we only felt sympathy for the recently orphaned war veteran Ty Hackett (Columbus Short of Stomp the Yard), who is about to be kidnapped. his house by an evil bank was there). And he gave Ty a good friend of the family, Mike (Matt Dillon), who is super nice and who finds him a job in the armored car company where he works with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and a strange French guy ( Jean Reno). These guys like to have fun and joke, but they are also serious armored car guys, which means they carry weapons and are tough. <br /> <br /> After a short moment, as we are watching them theoretically, we could start thinking like me, that maybe - or maybe - it's going to be some sort of awesome movie, idiot, fool, with some characterizations on the nose that move the story on its natural course, raising the personal stakes of all those involved in the hope of revealing a really very intelligent plan with many potential moments of "holiness". I mean, the music alone is a classic book - scathing, daring, beating overtime, because we're dealing with close-ups of characters who say things like "Actually, I do it" and "Are you crazy?" "For about 45 minutes, the film had a serious gender potential. <br /> <br /> Then things start to get really bad, these guys, these idiots, have no plans. no scene "Ok, here's what we're going to do ...", no plans, no explosives, no black van or ski masks (despite their "trial run", as we can see in a caravan.) No, these guys are going to steal $ 42 million from their own trucks (which are only tracked by HOURLY on the radio, even though they're equipped with sophisticated and sophisticated GPS technology), and they do not They're not even going to sit down and talk about it. "Damn, Mike only talks to Ty about the plan the night before, which is completely ridiculous, but of course, Tony has to think about his house, as long as Mike promises that "No one will be hurt," he's on board Guess what, though, somebody is hurt, why, because in addition to driving in a disused factory to hide the money, they have no plan. That was it. It was how far they thought. So, of course, things start to deteriorate. These cats deserve all they have to be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> This script, frankly, gives the impression that it is the product of a bad improvisation game: "An armored car stolen by its own guards ... GO!" In spite of some decent achievements that might have brought the film in some interesting directions, the story is completely torn apart and soon, NOTHING makes sense, nor even far plausible. <br /> <br /> When filmmakers do not have a cool "hook" for their heist, their characters seem stupid and clumsy. And when the characters are stupid and jostled, it's hard for an audience to invest in them and their story. And when that happens, all suspense drains to the bottom of the film, leaving a hollow and laughable envelope. <br /> <br /> Ignore it. 3/10
