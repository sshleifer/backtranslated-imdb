Unfortunately, producers do not know when to leave alone enough or prefer to recycle their products to the point that each waste generated by Hollywood must be returned to Alpo. It seems that all science fiction adventure films have to undergo a sad list of follow-up films, and Robocop is a tragic example. The first film, directed by Paul Verhoven, was a wild and elegant adventure, even going so far as to find the time to make a small social comment about what the dark side of bio-technology is capable of transforming us. This film does not have anything of that, except perhaps to tell us that the drugs are bad for you and could make you do things that you would regret if you were sober. Robocop 2 does not have the vision, the deeply frightening vision of what we are becoming, and takes us awkwardly on a boat ride to discover how nauseous drug traffickers and their victims are. Social commentary be damned. This one really bit the big one for me. If you do not like anything other than SFX, go ahead, my friend. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this yeast-free cake and keep warm the first accurately weighed and precisely measured pompernickle of the first film. It's so simple.
