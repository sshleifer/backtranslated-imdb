A little too much of Mediterranean machismo for me. The cast was beautiful, nice to watch in all the romantic scenes. The place was beautiful with azure sky and azure water. It just was not convincing to me that such a powerful regime could only attract beautiful, vulnerable women. Only in the Mediterranean, I suppose. Certainly in no world that I know. The macho men were really odious, and I had a hard time believing that female characters could have something to want for so long. The scenario, the cinematography, the realization, etc. were set up to produce a class B movie, the main effort being to show scenes of beautiful women's breasts. It was aesthetically pleasing for a while but it could not stand a very poor movie.
