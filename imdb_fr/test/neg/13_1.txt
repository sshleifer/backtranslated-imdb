An obvious vanity for Julie in her first film with Blake. Let's see. Where do we start? She is a traitor during a world war. she redeems him by falling in love; his friends (who are presumably patriots because they are German citizens) are expendable and must die; and she ends up as a heroine. OKAY. The scenes with the drunken pilot and the jesters who work for the French intelligence can not even be described, and we will not even mention the romantic scenes of Rock with a woman. (By the way, when they visit a museum, take a look at their eyes - I watch them on video and it's invaluable). Is it a joke or a romantic classic or a war movie? I do not know and neither do you.
