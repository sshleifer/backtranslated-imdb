Well, do not worry. This film looks so tired, the acting is so old-fashioned and the plot and the characters so sad that you have to study it instead of watching it. It's really a waste of horrible film; Stereotypes, clich√©s, nonsense and amateur cinema. I watched him with incredible fear with my mouth wide open. How to make such a movie, and more interesting still, how can we find it funny or observable? Old, tired, neglected ... a junior-high sketch, at best. There is nothing visible there, except for a very old movie study. Not good movie, just old. It's not Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. It does not make sense. The acting is so bad that it may be worth watching for laughter. Some movies are so bad that they are good. But, it all around the corner and becomes bad again.
