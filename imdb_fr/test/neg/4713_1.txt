I remember seeing this at my local Blockbuster and picked it up because I was curious. I liked the movies about mythological creatures. I like movies about werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. This is based on a half-caste, a half-human, half-leopard creature that attacks the peoples of Africa. <br /> <br /> The movie is horrible! The actors are terrible! There is no script whatsoever! Everything is improvised! Everything is filmed at night because they say it's the only time you see it. It's obvious bull * bleep *! They film at night to scare. But they failed to scare me. After the first person was killed, I put it back in the case and brought it back to Blockbuster. One of the most boring movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now, you're probably saying that I'm not allowed to see a movie again if I have not finished it. This is one of the movies that did not deserve to be watched. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. It's really BAD!
