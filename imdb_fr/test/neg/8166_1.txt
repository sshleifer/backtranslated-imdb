Well, I only caught the end of this movie on HBO, only the last 10 minutes, but I must say it probably contains the most laughable representation of the distance traveled NEVER recorded! I am a serious runner and an avid sports fan. I have already seen many painful demonstrations in the cinema. However, nothing could ever have prepared me for what is shown on the screen in the last 10 minutes of this movie, it literally defies any belief! The description of the runners is even more ironic given that the African riders completely dominate the sport, they are elegant and graceful. The female protagonist is dragging herself around like an overweight pregnant woman, and her "highly skilled" supporters are no better. Well in the race, this so-called world-class runner is surrounded by obese, overweight people, many of whom are walking! I find it interesting that the director decided to let her lead the women's competition. Yet near the end, she shows people who seem to stagger on two broken legs! Must we believe that this incredible stellar athlete has only passed a crippled person at the very end of the race? The director may think that runners can not run more than 12 minutes, and of course he has never heard of athletes like Paula Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba. <br /> <br /> Even if you are not a fan of running. you will be surprised by the incredibly inaccurate description of running, and this film can only be viewed as an unintentional comedy. Here's a note to the director: The next time you decide to make a film about a sport, it may be worthwhile to hire at least one person who actually watched the sport in action.
