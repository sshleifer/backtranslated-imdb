Great actors, good filming, potentially interesting plot and what should have been a good dialogue. Nothing else is good about this movie. Perhaps the writer or director thought he could make an incitation to thinking with annoying characters as deep as a cup of coffee. <br /> <br /> In less than 10 minutes, I did not really like Caroleen Feeney's portrayal of Kim as it had become a distraction. Although Kim is supposed to be an unfriendly character, I'm not sure I'm supposed to want to physically abuse her. The first (among many) strange things that happen is that Wesley (David Strathairn) goes from "I miss $ 50.00" to "She stole $ 50" in about 3 seconds. It was quite implausible, since she (Kim) never had access to her wallet or to a main pickpocket - there was simply no rational reason to suspect her. Most people have lost / misplaced money and assume that is what we LOST. Same thing for Kim later. Any very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be (I think) a look at real people. Kim's character was, at a minimum, suffering from a BiPolar disorder. Wes had huge problems of mismatch, Nancy was just boring and Matt was delusional (especially when it came to music). In fact, I disabled this function to about two thirds. However, to write a valid comment, I forced myself to reactivate it hoping that something materialized in this film. No, sorry, it was always bad. Make sure you miss this one.
