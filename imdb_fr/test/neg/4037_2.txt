I let a friend convince me to watch this movie and all I can say is: I want to kill him. <br /> <br /> It's an hour and a half of my life that I will never come back and I'll always regret it. <br /> <br /> If you've also had the misfortune to see this movie, you'll agree with me that it's absolutely the worst movie of all time, EVER! <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie and are thinking of seeing it, let me save you some time and warn you: DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, HE DO IT !!!! <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie fails, the attempt at comedy and sex appeal - it just turns out to be stupid, trashy and disgusting. Try to have women in the film who are really attractive and sexy and who are not fat, ugly and disgusting to watch !! <br /> <br /> The acting is laughable, just like writing. Obviously, this was done by total amateurs, I can not believe that these people were allowed to make such a stupid film, is there no law against that? There should be. <br /> <br /> There's a whole bunch of good "b" movies if you like that kind of thing, but do not waste time on that lousy movie you want. <br /> <br /> PEACE
