I find that the documentary work of Herzog is very uneven. Fata Morgana, a play that accompanies Lessons of Darkness, lacks not only the heartbreaking spectacle, but especially the insightful eye of an author. It's by comparison, in search of an amateur, of pots without aim left and right in the desert, as one would expect from a German tourist equipped with a camera, the camera from the window of a car collecting all sorts of images of fences, abandoned buildings and earth stains crossing the lens in random order, interspersed with plans of sand dunes. At one point, Herzog meets a group of hungry cattle rotting in the sand, but the image is presented in the same way as you and I, perhaps worse, the camera scanning the camera. one device to another. For a documentary that attempts to be a visual feast, a hypnotic and surrealistic journey into unexplored landscapes, the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author is lacking. It is everywhere, boring and tedious, the myths of the Mayan creation recited in voiceover, then another text that Herzog sought for literature. It was only towards the end that Fata Morgana jumped alive through a series of strange encounters. First with a man and a woman playing music in a room, the man singing in a distorted voice through a microphone, both of them apathetic in their task. A man holding a turtle. A group of elderly people trying to get out of some holes in the ground. Apart from this, this one seems to have very little substance to offer or visual splendor to offer.
