Ok, enough. Whenever I think I've seen such a bad movie, so bad that I think no one could find anything to rent, I just come to the IMDb where I'm greeted with the usual ineffective "Undiscovered chef-d ' "" GREAT movie "- honestly, what movie do you watch, because it's certainly not the mess I just watched on the new Fox / MGM / UA DVD. There are about three funny lines and a plot that gives a new meaning to the inconsistency. And then, after ninety-three minutes endless, it stops and the end credits begin. Then there is another scene. The DVD is pretty miserable, which suits the movie. The source material is almost completely faded and becomes an ugly brown. It's hard to imagine that this movie followed Get Carter. Critics and the public got that phone call back then - it was outrageous and a box office disaster, and rightly so. But you, the experts, keep trying. And I will continue to try to find a movie that DOES NOT have anyone who loves it.
