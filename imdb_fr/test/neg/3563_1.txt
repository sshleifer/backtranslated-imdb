Conclusion: very, but very, very boring, but I looked to the end, hoping for an effect backwards, but the end was worse, because it was nothing. The old black and white game did not help at all, it usually helped the psychological movies, but it was not the case. The script, the plot, etc., were linear, without substance, without content. When you deal with psychological, you deal with the analysis, so with the details, this unity-diversity formula ... there was no essence, no detail. Just a story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and difficult to forgive with the tools and creativity of the filmmakers ... well, it's not that one.
