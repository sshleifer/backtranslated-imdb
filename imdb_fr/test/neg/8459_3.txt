Unnecessary and stupid movie which is simply a compilation of clips of horror movies, sci-fi and suspense. Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are members of the public who turn to the camera to explain why we love horror movies. This is not a bad idea, but all the explanations are obvious ("the horror of film helps us face a real horror", "you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theater") and rather banal. In addition, the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are a little shocking. And, out of context, these bits are not scary at all. And it's REALLY short. I saw it in a theater in 1984 and was outraged that I paid $ 5.00 for an 84-minute movie! enjoy. For those interested in learning more about terror, this could be fun and interesting. But if you're a horror fan (like me), you'll probably be bored stupid. Good idea, bad performance (no pun intended). I give him a 3.
