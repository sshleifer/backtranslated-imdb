Feeling Minnesota, directed by Steven Baigelmann and performed by Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio: The tense relationship between two brothers, Sam (D'Onofrio) and Jjaks (Reeves), is pushed to its breaking point when Jjaks arrives at Sam's wedding with the bride, Freddie (Diaz), a former stripper, marries Sam to repay a gambling debt due to the owner of the nightclub Red (Lindo). Baigelman's early writing and directing is a frustrating mess, full of hateful and inconsistent characters. Placing Keanu and Diaz in the same film should at least give a treat to the eye, but Baigelman even shuns criticism by silencing his actors with little positive effect. Very poor.
