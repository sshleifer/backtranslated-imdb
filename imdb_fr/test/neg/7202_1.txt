This is about the worst trash I have ever had the displeasure of attending. The story was embarrassing to amateur, the graphics were awful, and the acting ... I've never seen worse in my life. A kindergarten class could come up with a concept that is more scary, better written, and more fun than this one. I pity all those who waste their time on this film, as well as the actors who agreed to do the work. It was obvious that they had not received the proper direction. Screenwriters must have spent their time at the movie school in the "back room" playing at Peaknuckle. Many teachers have lost a lot of time on these two. I would be really embarrassed to admit that I knew them.
