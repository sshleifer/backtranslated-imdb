From the terrible special effects, I realized absolutely how everyone can make a movie. Let's say it: I have absolutely no experience as a director, and for the first time in my life watching a movie, I thought, "I can do better than that! while I was watching this pap. The role in this movie was terrible, I guess the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man, but the Frenchman from Aliens3 was so wooden that I wondered how he got the old job. The scenario was mediocre and I suppose, like most movies, that if the rest had been done well, he would have risen. I do not usually write reviews here, but after seeing several people assign a good rating to this film (it must be actor / team), I felt the need to say my article to avoid that someone renting it accidentally or wasting money on it. Cack.
