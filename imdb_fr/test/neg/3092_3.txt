This film should have been much better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor but he could not save this story of a young woman searching for the truth about her sister's death. Spoiler Warning: In reality, the older sister (played by Diaz) is a spoiled, selfish, superficial girl who has taken too many drugs. Not really a twist and not interesting either. The film is also overloaded with too many flashbacks and dubbing and lack of dramatic rhythm. All in all, it's worth it to miss - not to recommend.
