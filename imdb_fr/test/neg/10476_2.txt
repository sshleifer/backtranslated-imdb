John Knowles' modern masterpiece, A Separate Peace, is one of the many subtle, and is the watchword, themes of love, hatred, jealousy, denial and regret. The 1972 version tries to deal with this style and the book - A love story with the war in the background. <br /> <br /> The 2004 version does not use subtly, but frankly in the description of the story. When you read the novel, what is on your face is a love story, and yes, it may be questionable, a gay love story. In the 1972 novel and film version, there are sexual nuances throughout writing and dialogue. In the 2004 version of the movie Showtime, these tensions were omitted and the actors were in the late twenties playing teenagers, which caused a maturity to dispel any tenderness or hesitation. innocence in youth. <br /> <br /> I did not like this remake for more reasons. The hair that broke the backs of the camels was that Phineas had received a last name on the letters he had received from the boards! Finny is a character who does not have or needs a last name. John Knowles did it intentionally. <br /> <br /> Although I accept the 1972 version, the acting was sometimes a bit amateurish, so what, he tried to be sincere towards the novel by turning on the site of the Phillips Exeter Academy. Devon Acedemy was based on; which was also attended by writer John Knowles as a student. <br /> <br /> The directors and producers took all of Exeter's teenage students, with the exception of Parker Stevenson who had attended The Brooks School, to play in a Paramount movie! Class act interpreted by compared to this shot of the Canadian College, played with adult actors, politically correct, platonic version. No - Veto on this simulacrum, try again. The 1972 film version with John Heyl and Parker Stevenson was the real deal for A Separate Peace on screen. The 2004 Showtime movie designed for the wired version was not.
