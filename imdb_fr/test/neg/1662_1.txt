I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. He set the standard. I will never give a 1 to a movie unless it's as bad as this one. I totally agree with the other comments on this film. But since I'm Dutch, I've watched it with a Dutch translation. Apparently, they did not have money for a correct translation, so they decided to say it. With sometimes hilarious results. <br /> <br /> Do not smoke, do not drink, do not use drugs, do not look at Demon Summer. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the actors (Wow, I can not believe I just said that.) I did not hold the script (was there any?) in their hands during shooting. I think they also did a good job on ... Well ... Uh ... No, they did not do a good job at all.
