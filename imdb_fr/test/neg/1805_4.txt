In a sense, this film did not even compare to the novel. However, it was good to have a visual of what Congo looked like and also natives if you are not good at visualizing while you read. I would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book. I hardly even suggest watching this film, let alone any other film based on this literary work. This film; and many others, have not filled this book. An important missing element in the film is MArlow's feeling about how the lack of government there in Africa was a beginning of genocide. Also in the film, MArlow and his companions did not stop to fetch the note and the wood. Similarly, Kurtz's African mistress stuns Marlow towards the end of the story that has a major influence in the story but was not in the book. In the novel, Kurtz died on the ship, but he died in his hut in the movie. The fiancee's reaction to Marlow's interpretation of Kurtz's last words was also different. This film is only effective if you want to visualize the novel more clearly.
