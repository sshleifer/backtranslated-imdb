A teenage couple has some sex on the beach in the 1960s. That's all. They say they are fifteen, while one of the actors is actually twenty-five. Perhaps this film was somewhat revolutionary in 1978 in its way of touching "taboo" subjects, but I can not imagine that at that time, everything that was presented in Esmiko Limon was considered taboo. <br /> <br /> Shallow dialogues are mixed with disco music that is even less profound. The selection of songs includes only well-known "classics" that are still heard on all radio stations today. The plot of American Pie is not very different but it is at least a little funny. Eskimo Limon is dull, flat and not aesthetic. Almost incredible that he had six suites!
