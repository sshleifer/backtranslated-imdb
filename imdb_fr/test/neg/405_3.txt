36/100. This should not be confused with decent arachnophobia, this film is a very low budget and cheap scam. This one is so bad that it does have an entertainment value at this level. There are many scenes of laughter very involuntary (I think). I did not expect much from the movie, and it was actually worse than I had imagined. <br /> <br /> It's an unpredictable and predictable clich√© that has a direct impact on video mess. Fortunately, it does not take too seriously. The game of actors, as expected, is not quite the caliber of the Oscars. The special effects are mediocre, worse than I thought. Badly edited and the score is intrusive.
