After watching Darwin's Nightmare, we must have the impression that Tanzania is a living hell, a quasi-slave population delivering the best fish to the well-fed Europeans, while leaving the fish bones to the starving population. In exchange for fish, they get Western-made weapons that the majority of the unemployed are eager to use because being a soldier is their only source of income. <br /> <br /> It is therefore quite dark in trade. incarnation of evil and source of all misery? Not enough. Fortunately, Darwin's Nightmare only shows the dark sides and completely spares the positives. In fact, the documentary says almost nothing about the economic and ecological importance that victoriaperch has for the region. <br /> <br /> For the countries around Lake Victoria, the victoriaperch is the second to the third source of income. Salaries in the fishing industry are well above average. Tanzania has banned huge trawlers from securing the jobs of thousands of fishermen. Adjacent states have reached agreements to keep the fishery at a sustainable level. Lakeside towns receive taxes that fishermen pay for each kilogram of fish caught, as well as taxes on exports and profits from factories. In addition, Tanzania has banned the export of local traditional fish, which still plays an important role in feeding the local population. <br /> <br /> Ignoring these positive signs, the documentary discourages consumers and Western investors badly needed and threatens the situation of Africans. <br /> <br /> To find out more, I can recommend two articles written by the German newspaper of the alternative wing: http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/09/02/a0013. 1 / textdruck http://www.taz.de/pt/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text
