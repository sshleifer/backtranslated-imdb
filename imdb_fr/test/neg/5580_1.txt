From time to time, it's good to see a very bad movie like this, so you know how decent a Keanu Reeves actor is by comparison. The premise of this story is good: teenagers go by boat, meteors land in the water, aliens kill teenagers. Why not like that if you like thrillers? But I should have known that something was wrong when I read that it was only 75 minutes. I thought, "I hate judging movies based on their length, who said a film should last 90 minutes?" But once I brought the DVD back to BBuster, I was shocked by the mediocre quality of the production, the acting, the staging of this completely amateurish junk. The only reason I watched it all was because I do not have cable TV and I have already paid four dollars. However, there was a ray of light: the actor who played "Chris" is actually decent, and outclasses this dreck by far. First, the special effects were inexpensive and unconvincing. Then the extraterrestrials - the costumes seemed interesting (rubber costumes) but as most of the film is set in the dark, we do not really see them! And virtually none of the actors were convincing enough to suspend disbelief. Finally, I must say that the jacket of the DVD was made with much stricter production standards than the film itself, which looked like a scam, so beware of this when you rent other DVDs. Save $ 4 and buy a pint of beer.
