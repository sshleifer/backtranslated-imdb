Although he worked for the worst government of the twentieth century, Erwin Rommel is generally regarded by historians and World War II buffs as a gentleman, a soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. If only Hitler had given him the troops and equipment he had wanted in Africa, the argument would be that things would have happened very differently. And that's probably true. Rommel was in fact a military genius and, obviously, a man of integrity and honesty. <br /> <br /> But this film tries to represent him as a quasi-saint. He does his job, trying to win the war for Hitler, but the FÃ¼hrer constantly intervenes to give him ridiculous orders, which Rommel (James Mason) expresses with amazement, but seldom questions and never disobeys. It is only when it is obvious that Hitler is driving Germany to ruin that Rommel is thinking of betrayal against him. This dilemma is the main theme of the film: a good man in bad circumstances tries to do what is right. <br /> <br /> Mason, it's good like Rommel, but it's far from a memorable performance, say, George C. Scott like Patton. Of course, Rommel was not as colorful as Patton, but this film is so determined to make him look like a decent human being he forgets to make it interesting. He sometimes falls into the heat when he meets his wife Lucie (a young Jessica Tandy, well-trained), but Mason is usually called on to give a tough British performance ?? as if the British were trying to claim Rommel for themselves (even if in fairness, all the Nazis have English accents except Hitler). <br /> <br /> Made cheaply, all scenes of battle sweeping archival footage and the beaches of southern California doubling for Tunisia, nothing particularly recommends this film. A remake could be interesting (I would choose Ed Harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and, well, Harris can play), even if it was a little more spicy, but this film showed me especially how much we had become more demanding. in the last fifty years; a biography so bland would not cut it anymore.
