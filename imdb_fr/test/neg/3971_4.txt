The only reason I even give a 4 to this film is because it was shot in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The horrible scenario is only slightly obscured by the total inability of the characters Act. The main role is an actor that I have never seen elsewhere and it shows. No chemistry with the interest of love and so bland that you do not care what happens to him. Dick Sargent was not convincing as a villain, but this guy was supposed to be super evil ... he was more annoying than anything. Peter Graves is the only person in the film who has not been horrible, his role is small and he can not even compensate for the lack of talent of his co-stars. In 2004, someone tried to start all over again, his name was The Island ... Personally, I did not see this movie, but from what I understand, it's the same movie. If you want to laugh at this movie, get the episode MST3k, it's really funny ... full of bewitched and biographical references, it is finally watchable
