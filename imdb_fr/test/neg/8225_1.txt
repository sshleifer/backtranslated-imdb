Garden State must be one of the most artificial and pretentious films of all time. The plot is simple: a young man returns home after the death of his mother and discovers love. But really, the plot is not important. What is important for Zach Braff - writer, director and star ?? is it able to suspend from the plot all the necessary attributes of an "independent" or "artistic" film. So we are presented with endless cute characters and scenes that do not exist for reasons of plot or character development, but simply to give the film an artistic credibility (at the Wes Anderson - or hope Braff ). Unfortunately and a little surprising, Braff has not only attracted many users of IMDb, but also some critics who should really have known better. <br /> <br /> Of course, the free use of the eccentric by Braff does not make a bad movie Garden State. Braff's script is what really makes Garden State a stinker. He simply does not have the writing skills needed to make this film, and the dialogue and characterization are catastrophic. Braff often has to resort to blunt processes and symbols to achieve what he can not do by writing. For example, his indifference to an impending plane crash is indicative of the numbness of Braff's character (it can not be integrated into the plot and must therefore be in a dream!). against his circumstances by crying in a bottomless abyss (life = an abyss without bottom, Mr. Braff very intelligent). These two scenes must be among the most ridiculous and ingenious ever seen on a movie screen. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the acting is passable despite the lack of material with which the cast means a script), and I really admire Natalie Portman for her efforts as a love interest - a a character so badly written and implausible that she is only a senseless doll that Braff shapes in his imaginary wife. <br /> <br /> It has apparently taken Braff 3 years to write the screenplay for Garden State (3 years to write such a bad story - he's really incompetent!). So I hope it will take a little while before he makes another movie.
