This movie is stupid, made by stupid people. I guess the plot works pretty well for a horror movie, but the actions of these characters are incredibly STUPID! Like, incredibly stupid stupid to the Nth degree! Basically, the entire movie is made up of these 4 captured idiots, many times, despite many, many simple ways and opportunities to overcome their captor. It does not make sense and is not entertaining. Hitting in the eyes is more rational, and probably more fun than watching that. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS **** The end is hilarious !! The only good part of the movie! I almost died laughing at the end! This stupid movie, and it ends with the stupid girl getting shipped to a crate in white slavery in Asia !! Hilarious! I thought it was a totally great ending for a really great movie.
