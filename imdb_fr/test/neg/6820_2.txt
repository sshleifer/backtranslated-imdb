Dooley and his canine partner, Jerry Lee, are together again in this second sequel (? !!?). I honestly had no idea that they had made a sequel let alone two. And for a slightly better film than "Turner & Hooch"? After the retirement of Dooley, he has to mate his dog (with other dogs and people) and wait for Jerry Lee to poop. Real chic stuff. I mean come on now. The original had at least some good laughs. This one has only one. Jim Belushi just looks old and worn. The two Belushi brothers were great in the 80s. If John was not dead, would he be so mean today like his brother? This thought makes me sad for some reason. <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: USA network
