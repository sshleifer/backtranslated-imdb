I think Downey may have been inspired by the French new wave. <br /> <br /> Who was not? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, what he ended up creating here was more like a new-wave crackhead. <br /> <br /> A synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and Downey seems to have lost a lot. <br /> <br /> Just say no, indeed. In more ways than one. Including watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not stand it after a while and I started to move quickly. It would have been wiser to simply ignore it.
