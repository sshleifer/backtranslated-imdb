This film was shot in Randolph County, central North Carolina in 1968, when a film crew in that state was a rare thing. The localities were the municipalities of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding rural countryside. This is not a particularly good movie. It was Merle Haggard and he brought the hinterland to life for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is classic. Cinematography is that fuzzy material from the late sixties and early seventies. The people of the area were thrilled to be part of the company. <br /> <br /> If viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this film, a copy is available in Asheboro, NC. <br /> <br /> The uncredited actors are Ben Jones, Mimi Pravda, Tommy Hull and Bill Nunnery.
