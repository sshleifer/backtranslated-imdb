It was full of holes in intrigues, inaccuracies (would the stopwatch not stop for injured players or the loss of helmets in football games in Texas?) And not so much redemption (so your father beat us for once, then he will love you and make him useful). <br /> <br /> Either make the film on a team and his quest for a championship OR make a movie about a player on a team and his staff fight, but instead, this movie has tried to do everything and came more than a few meters short. The book has probably shown the whole story a lot better; the film should have chosen an element of the story and stick to that. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie jumped from a character dialogue to flashes of play and then to another character dialogue a few months later without actually telling you who the character is. were or why they were important - the QB calling his brother to take care of the mother - what happened with that? Because the mother was consistent at the end of the last match, does that mean she is no longer crazy? The sound quality was its quality. Buy it and watch SportsCenter highlighted while Iggy Pop plays in the background.
