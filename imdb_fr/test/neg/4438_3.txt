The things I find irritating on the screen, the things that I eat and annoy the people who try to watch movies with me are those where the writer, the director, the set designer, the on-screen caterer or whoever do not think so until the end and by a single act of omission - or commission - cancels all other work done by all those who worked on the film. This moment of "Wait a minute bloody ... What just happened?" it stops the story in its tracks. (It's not that the narration of this film has required a lot of stops, because anyone who has already seen it will know that Quintet's narration is well fixed before the end of the first shot.) There are several moments of this movie in this movie. And you're too late to think about it. The film lasts two hours and the scripted dialogue is probably five pages long. There is plenty of time to reflect on its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in a frozen Earth. Another ice age has settled and the whole world is dying. It's cold. Very cold. In fact, it is very cold on the screen. The film was shot in Canada in the winter and there are ice cubes and real snow and people's breath is escaping from each mouth. We remember time and time again how cold it is. People wear big hats, diapers and layers of clothing and curl up like overdressed Weeble people. It must have been a horrible shoot. My nitpick comes in a sequence when our hero goes to a hotel room. Awakened in the middle of the night by voices coming from the next room, he catches a conversation of vital importance for the meager plot through a large grid in the wall separating the two rooms. I do not wonder why there is a practical grid in the wall between the two rooms. What annoyed me was the fact that the long-term tenant with the noisy visitor had not blocked the gate. If you are trying to keep warm, the last thing you need is a huge gaping hole in the wall that leads to an empty, unheated room. Believe me. I live like that, I watched this film sitting on my sofa in the living room under a duvet with a hot water bottle. My breath fogged as much as that of the actors. If this huge hole were in my wall, I would block it with something. This may not be the best choice of movie to watch in an unheated room in the middle of winter, but good God pointed out to me the lousy isolation of the movie.
