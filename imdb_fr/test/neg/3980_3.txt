Like most people, I saw this movie on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Although he has received some well-deserved criticism, it is one of the best movies to feature on this show. <br /> <br /> The principle is better than even the average of your Hollywood blockbusters; this poses interesting moral dilemmas. Although the score is sometimes invasive, it also offers some nice moments when Richard walks along the river. Looking at the movie, you can see where many intrigue developments have probably looked very good on paper. Richard's discomfort in modern society is an interesting problem to ponder, and the end would probably have been a beautiful 1970s style if previous business had not been so crazy. <br /> Unfortunately, the film obviously cheap, which makes the flaws more obvious. The "farm clone" is obviously a university campus and a beer can is a favorite place. Lena and Richard have no chemistry. We are supposed to believe that this is a meeting of related minds, but there does not seem to be a brain cell between them. The "old grumpy couple" schtick also gets very old, very fast. Some mistakes can also be attributed to poor director choices, such as the decision to hold a decisive conversation out of reach of any audio equipment. <br /> <br /> In short, a noble effort, but nevertheless better view on MST3K.
