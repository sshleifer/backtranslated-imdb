Sometimes Hallmark succeeds - like The 10th Kingdom - but many of their fantasy films work badly, and this is the last category. The version I saw may have been cut off (a demon [?] Featured in the trailer and still photos did not appear), but anything that could shorten the film can only be a blessing . <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS If you are not familiar with the original fairy tale: <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film updates the story at the beginning of the 20th century (?), And made of Gerda and Kay (here called Kai - being a Lexx fan, I was still expecting him to say: "The dead do not solve puzzles"), aged 18. The basic story of Hans Christian Andersen is followed: the boy gets a flash of ice in his eyes, goes badly, is taken by the Snow Queen to solve a puzzle in his palace and Gerda goes looking for him, enterprising various adventures. <br /> <br /> Since the two main characters are older than the original, you spend a lot of time gathering and loving them. Unfortunately, I have never been convinced that they were particularly in love, and certainly not loving enough to make sense of Gerda's quest. At the moment the main plot begins, the film's rhythm has slowed down at a frantic pace. Alas, when Gerda begins her search for Kai, she only manages to take the pace of a quiet walk. <br /> <br /> There are some strange additions to the story that seem to be going nowhere. At the beginning of the film, the Snow Queen kills Gerda's mother, but no explanation is given. A polar bear living in the palace of the Snow Queen is more than it seems (but that may be because the producers realized that the Bear's feelings towards the Queen of Snow would be acceptable in a fairy tale, but not in a modern film). Again, this is never explained. In addition, allusions that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai are abandoned, but never followed. The screenplay is also full of anachronisms that will really put you out of the "fairy tale" atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The production is beautiful, although there are traces of pennies: the palace of the snow queen is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived covered with ice. The three main characters are played with more or less success: Kai is as bland as Gerda at first, but once she's gone to find Kai, you'll warm her up. Bridget Fonda looks great as a Snow Queen, but she seems to belong to a film different from all the others. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is not satisfactory. It looks good, but drags and lacks magic.
