First, let me tell you that I live in South Africa, where rugby is by far our most important sport, and that our national team, the Springboks, has won the Rugby World Cup twice . So it's a big problem here. I have played all my life and I am shocked by the low attention to detail in this movie! At first, I thought the film could be a good movie considering the cast of Neal McDonough, Nick Ferris, Gary Cole and Sean Astin, but this film proved to be a mockery of the sport. They write it roughly with your ordinary American football movie. <br /> <br /> My first problem is that this film supposedly captures the values ​​of rugby, but the discipline, or should I say its total absence during the games, is contradictory to that. In the final, it looks more like an NFL game where Penning was hit in the ball several times, in front of the referee ... that would have immediately led to two red cards, because such a game would never go unpunished. by an arbitrator, from that I can assure you! You also could not find a world rugby coach who has so little control over his team. Any coach would take a foot on the head of a player if he intentionally stiffened the arms of an opposing player or doubled it as he had done in the final ... red card and some suspensions, stop full. <br /> <br /> Secondly, It is absurd that a coach will take a brand new player, who has been playing all his life in the wing, to place him in the hooker position which is a highly specialized position and say that it's for the sake of the team ?! What?! Hooker is a highly specialized position at the forefront where you have to be able to play extremely well and, preferably, be able to throw the ball at the time of the line, which Penning NEVER does for one reason or another. Moving a kite to the hooker without prolonged long-term training would first kill your team at the time of the scrum and secondly, the poor child would probably break the neck! How is it good for the team that I ask you? Finally, the high emotional content of the film is far too much, because even though rugby is a great sport, and it creates good friendships and team spirit, it rarely gets out of hand. I've seen real-life football dramas with less emotion than this movie and it's been great, but in this one, Sean's (Penning) acting skills are pushed too far and the Movie attempts too constrain the audience to react emotionally, which ends up being boring and hard to watch from time to time. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has made great sports movies over the years, but the next time they venture into a sport that has just grown in the US, they should try to do your homework and maybe put some experts in the fray. <br /> <br /> DO IT OR DO NOT DO IT AT ALL!
