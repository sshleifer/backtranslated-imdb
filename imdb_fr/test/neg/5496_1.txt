R.I.C.C.O. is the most awesome movie ever made. I can not believe that my dad bought this shit. This film should never be done. If this film has been widely known, believe me, it will be at the forefront of the worst IMDB. The acting is horrible, it's scary, that's why it's horror. This shit piece had no horror at all. It's an urban action, which is funny, because I could swear it was a comedy. When people were shot, I could not help but laugh. I am the only person who has examined this and I hope that I am the last. With this vote only, I hope it will come in first place at the worst !!!!!!!
