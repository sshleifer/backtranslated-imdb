The main problem with 9th Company (9 Rota) is that she does not know if she wants to save Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket. Spielberg's attempts at sentimentality are embarrassing, like Sergeant Burley crying in a field of red flowers !!! The training sequences have neither the intensity nor the realism that Kubrick gave them in his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Another bone of contention is that Afghan fighters are called ghosts because they strike and are almost never seen. Here, they attack a Russian fort almost in training, without trying to cover. I'm sure tactics have evolved since Waterloo. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this film has already been seen in other war movies and has been significantly improved. <br /> <br /> I have to ask: Why do all talented shooters have to chew a match? <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm always wary of a film that begins without a narrative to qualify the end. <br /> <br /> "We won!" ... uh ....... no you did not do it.
