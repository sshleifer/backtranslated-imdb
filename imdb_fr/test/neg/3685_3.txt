This line is a good summary of this movie. If you've read it and watched 20 minutes of the movie, you'll know exactly how the rest of the movie will behave. A researcher named Surgei (pronounced SirGay) is looking for hell in the underworld of Moscow. However, he seems to have disappeared and his friend Oven follows him with a team to look for him. Could they have found a more boring plot? Some bad actors looking after an old man on the subway. The acting is very bad, the romance is really useless and false, often there is no good reason for the way the characters play, nothing is scary and above all: there is nothing interesting in everything the film. They just walk, interrogating gang leaders and other types on the way, complaining, finding the old man, then running, and finally finding a way out of the underground. <br /> <br /> The only thing that allows me to give this film the lowest price of all odds is the atmosphere. If you just want to see a movie for that, it may be a good choice. It is dark and it is mystical and troubled. However, the rest of the movie is really dull. You sit all the time waiting for the movie to start or something happens. In fact, some things happen, but they are not very well executed. For example, I did not really notice the disappearance of one of the characters and I swear I was not sleeping or something. And I do not understand what's dangerous with these kids ... They run together in the basement, scratching at the walls with sticks (I guess it's supposed to scare somehow). <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if you immediately need some obscure moods.
