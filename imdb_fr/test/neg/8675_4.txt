Oh dear! The BBC is not about to leave its base to absorb the period dramas of it. I agree that Jane Austens' novel is difficult to describe, especially to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly an Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not made for the hearts of women to miss. However, I must say that I was hoping for an improvement over the last one and I was unfortunately disappointed. The basic story has been preserved, but the dialogue has been so modified that Jane Austen's tone, manners, feelings, spirit and depth have been diluted or even lost. If some adaptations of the past can be considered dated, the weakness of it must be that it is too modern ("his life is a long party" ?????) The casting was usually enough, but I think Billie Piper was wrong choice, it needed someone more sober, I had no impression of depth hidden under a submissive exterior, it looked more like a child frolicking. I see that I have to wait for the BBC to weave its magic again.
