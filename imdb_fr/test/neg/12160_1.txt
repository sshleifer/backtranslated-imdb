I saw this movie today. Very disappointed and wondered how this could be in the list of Oscars. The saddest things are: <br /> <br /> 1. It's very slow. <br /> <br /> 2. How can Ghengis-khan, the cruel and mighty emperor of Asia be played by a good and good actor with warm and charming eyes - all through the film except a scene? <br /> <br /> 3. Many holes in the plot: there is nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spent 20 years between his childhood and his maturity. We see an old slave without money, without power, without friends or at home. Click on! - the second that follows, he heads the huge army, without any reason to be a leader. <br /> <br /> 4. The magic of Ghengis-khan arises is only kindly explained by the help of a wolf / god / whoever it is. <br /> <br /> 5. Can a man make love to his wife this way after not having seen her for years? <br /> <br /> 6. Is it enough to win the sword fight if you ride your horse through enemy lines, sit there with two swords and everyone around you dies? Does Ridley Scott know it? <br /> <br /> 7. Why, after 20 to 30 years, Khan's mother does not look older? <br /> <br /> 8. What is the motivation of the main character? (No. Literally.) <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. Really. The work of the filmmakers is good; nature is exceptional - but the film can not be made without the director and the script. The real Ghengis-khan would execute the director in a moment. <br /> <br /> Sincerely.
