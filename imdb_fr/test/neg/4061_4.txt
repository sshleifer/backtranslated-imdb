As a big fan of DM, it goes without saying that I have seen this movie many times. However, I only watch it for the concert sequence ... the rest of the film is, uh, rather ugly, it's sad to say. <br /> <br /> The famous rock music director DA Pennebaker followed the 1980s Fashion Tour, Music For The Masses, which promoted the superb album of the same name. Title 101 comes mainly from the fact that the concert material included comes from the 101st and last concert of the Pasadena Bowl tour, but also refers to the fact that the film is a "beginner's course" for the band and its unfolding, c. -to-d. Depeche Mode 101. Among the footage of the quartet playing live and exploring the United States, there is a second story story that covers a group of DM fans who have won a contest to meet the band, tour their own bus and attend the final concert. . <br /> <br /> Now, as I said above, the concert sequence is excellent. The modes are here above their form as rock stadium gods, which was a rather unusual feat for an electrorock band at the end of the 80s. Although the film surprises the group before recording their leader 1990, "Violator", there are still countless excellent titles such as Behind the Wheel, the majestic Never Let Me Down, All in all, Do not get tired of it. Vince Clarke, Shake The Disease and many others. <br /> <br /> When Mode is on stage, they are brilliant. When they are not, they are very boring. Nothing interesting, even vaguely, happens for the boys when they go to the United States in the last days of the Reagan administration. As an example, the likely "highlight" of the document is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. Not really exciting. I know that not all groups need to be foolhardy and reckless idiots, but they make the Mormon Tabernacle Choir look like Rammstein. <br /> <br /> The only real excitement comes from several clips featuring the band's lead singer, Dave Gahan. Gahan appears on 101 as being slightly psychotic, speaking of a violent power in himself that he can not control, remembering a strange attack of rage involving a taxi driver, etc. There is a moment in the film where he launches a temper tantrum at a poor guy behind the scenes - really embarrassing. The man clearly had problems at the time, which were happily resolved. Composer Martin Gore and keyboardist Andy Fletcher are presented as highly articulate men, clearly massively talented, but also completely colorless; Alan Wilder, fourth member somewhat enigmatic, is the only member of the quartet to succeed the character of rock star with a kind of aplomb. <br /> <br /> And as for the "fan tour" thread, well, it's unassailable. . Let's not kid ourselves. Maybe it's just because it's all very advanced in the late '80s, but the group of young devotees do little to me but arouse irritation. They are, for a person, singularly superficial and insipid people, whose antics are commonplace when they are not ridiculous. Let me repeat .... nothing happens in sequences that are of no interest on the stage. Nothing. Innumerable scenes of children combing their hair, arguing, changing clothes, getting lost in the cities by going to concerts and finding their partner in bed with another winner of the competition make me wonder one thing: if Cure fans were also laid back in '88 / 89. The love that young people have for the group is something that I can certainly understand, and that is sometimes a contagious joy, but if what we see is what that there is more interesting in what was filmed, then I would hate to see the events. <br /> <br /> But music is all that matters and in this respect 101 excels. The Pasadena concert, one of their best concerts of all time, makes the film worthy of interest. The recent DVD edition of the movie is accompanied by a bonus disc containing what's left unpublished concert sequences (about 80% of the performance), making it a must-see DVD for fans. The group's audio commentary (less Wilder, who left Fashion in the mid-90s) on the first disc is also, oddly enough, much more interesting than the film itself. <br /> <br /> As a document Deporn Mode boys 101 of Basildon at the time of the idols in the amphitheatres. But if you're looking for excitement, you'd better get the live double album that comes with it (now available in Super Audio CD format).
