Boring, cliché and predictable. The only original element was the location of Brighton for the gangsters. It's definitely not "Lock Stock etc ......." Hannah was friendly in "Sliding Doors". In "Circus" I did not develop any empathy for his character and I could not tell what had happened to him or his girlfriend. Although this film was so cliché and predictable, its end was not a surprise, I was so indifferent that I did not even care why the movie was called "Circus" ....... Booooring .. ..... Don 'Do not visit this tent.
