Albert Pyun presents his vision of the lost city of Atlantis - and it is a vision so cluttered with claustrophobic decorations, strange costumes and "weird" minor characters that one thing is certain: you want to put an end to it quick. possible (unfortunately, it will take you about 80 minutes). The story of "Alice in Wonderland" is sinuous and uninspiring, and there was probably no actress in the world who could have turned it into a good movie, although Kathy Ireland makes an appealing attempt (annoying voice and other).
