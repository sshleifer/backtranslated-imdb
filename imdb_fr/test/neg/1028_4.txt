I guess only a select number of audience members were really interested in running a scammer in New York, but I'm willing to bet that even those brave souls were upset by the irritating patchwork technique and by the sound recording deliberately muffled display here; the fact that these inherent "flaws" are directly related to the experimental nature of the low-budget / underground / experimental film is, I would say, completely irrelevant. Anyway, for those who wish, the film features a great male nudity and Joe Dallesandro, rightly, has become an underground ...? and gay ?? icon! <br /> <br /> The episodic structure illustrating the daily routine of the protagonist of the hustlers offers two slightly interesting scenes: his encounter with an eccentric older artist (who finally poses for him); the one where Dallesandro expresses his point of view on his unusual work and describes his particular modus operandi to a couple of potential "colleagues", including perhaps the most unfaithful of the scammers ?? a nerd with glasses! Fortunately, perhaps, the film only lasted 89 minutes, while the IMDb had claimed that its total length was 105 minutes (but it could be a mistake)! <br /> <br /> I had watched some of Warhol's "films" and this one is definitely not as satisfying as the most tolerable example I've seen so far, ADB ( 1977), and barely superior to the likes of MY HUSTLER (1965) which were essentially tiring. The fact that it is only the first part of a trilogy does not bode well, but, as the saying goes, you have to do what you have to do and the other two "chapters" must follow quickly ... <br /> <br /> Despite my generally negative reactions, FLESH nonetheless has an added value as a time capsule of the 1960s and as a prototype of the underground scene of that time, both in terms of cinema and real. For the record, an image of Dallesandro of this film adorns the cover of the first eponymous album of 1984 and the transsexual Candy Darling (which appears here rather banal) was immortalized in "Candy Says", the first title of The Velvet Underground. 1969 eponymous album. Although this last group is my favorite of all time, and one of the reasons is that, thanks to their absolutely unique and revolutionary music, they described a lifestyle so different from mine, it's really a case where I experience something rather than visually!
