With so many good movies coming out in 1995 (especially "Mortal Kombat" and "Seven"), unfortunately, bombs were also needed. This film indeed falls in the last category with a boring end conspiracy. It seems that Antonio Banderas has not managed to find a decent scenario since "Desperado", his only remarkable film. Anyone with one-eighth of a brain could tell who the DeMornay stalker was from the beginning. His flashbacks about his mother's death only clouded an already thin story. Too bad Dennis Miller was wasted in this movie; this part looks like its strangely similar role in "The Net". <br /> <br /> The complicated end made me shake my head, as I did pretty much throughout the film. Plus, any movie that portrays animal cruelty in any form, no matter how false it looks, automatically takes me on an adventure. <br /> <br /> In short, if you want to live a good thriller, avoid it at all costs. Never speak to strangers ... especially to those who recommend this film. 2/10
