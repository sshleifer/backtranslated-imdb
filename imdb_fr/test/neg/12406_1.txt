The staging of Wong is perhaps the worst film history I have ever seen. This film is my worst movie of all time in 2000, Courtney Soloman's Dungeons and Dragons looked like an Oscar. The flaws of this film are beyond any explanation. The most important is the lack of depth. Each scene does not develop completely as if the editing room did not know how to do its job properly. It's a pity that such a cast of stars and a famous traditional story can be wiped out by this lack of vision. <br /> <br /> I'm so disgusted and hope that great directors like John Woo or Ang Lee, decide to redo this movie and do justice. I'm not even sure to rate 0/10 ??
