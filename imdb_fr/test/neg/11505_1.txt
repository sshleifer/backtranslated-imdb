Of course, Sadie is by far the worst show I've ever seen, it's such a piece of shit ** and filled with complete crap **. I did not find any funny or clever gags, it was awful jokes. <br /> <br /> The acting game is nil, many of the characters are people faded to play, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is a terrible actor, the other characters are also void (Magaret, Rain, Hal). <br /> <br /> The plot is not unique and creative and the show is so predictable. This is one of the worst series of all time, it should not even have been done. The idiots who are responsible for writing this garbage should be returned (if they had not already done so). The first season was watched, but the second season was just a disaster, it is too difficult to watch this show, it is more than terrible.
