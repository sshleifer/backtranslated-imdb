Dr. Seuss would surely be angry now if he was alive. Cat in the Hat proves how cinematic productions can turn a classic story into a senseless pile of goop. We have Mike Myers in the infamous role of Cat in the Hat, big mistake! Myers proves that he can not play in this movie. He acts like a prissy girl show with a thousand rounds in his sleeve. The kids in this movie are fine, somewhere between dull and boring lines. The story is like the original with some modifications and like most movies based on other stories, never change the original story! Bringing the wrong neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain who would never end up in life. This film is like a cartoon rejected by the newspaper if you think about it. The movie really looks sticky! Of course, there are funny jokes for adults, like the one where the cat cuts the tail and the censor before saying a naughty word, slightly funny. At least Grinch had sperm and the movie was really good! This film is a cartoon snot bright colors and mediocre game. Mike Myers was he even in this movie? And another thing, the fish. What is with this stupid fish! The first time you see it, it's a real fish. The next time you see him, he's all busy and talking. But it looks like an animated piece of rubber modeling clay! This film is a total wreckage off target. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised there are even good jokes, like the water park joke, it was good. So please, if you have a choice, watch the Grinch instead of this mess.
