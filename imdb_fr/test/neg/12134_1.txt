We have all seen bad movies, this one takes the cake. I have often seen this box of junior film come back from my many travels in the horror section of the local video store, and I was a little interested, it seems like it pays homage to the Chainsaw massacre in Texas, so I said 'get it. Fault! Junior sucks hard, long and with commitment. In other words, it's really bad. Although he wins my prize for the most creative use of a bikini top. TO AVOID!!
