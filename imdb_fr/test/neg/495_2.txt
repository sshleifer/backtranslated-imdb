No emotion. Bad music (and I'm a reformed 80s metal guy, so I'll be vulnerable to good things.) Everything is half done. The brother is a parody, there is nothing to hold us except to see what horror of the eighties they will tell us. The leader of the tour tries to bring a humanity to the thing but does not have enough time. Wahlberg is fine and Aniston is running out of steam. We know she does not need the money. Is this the only role she could play in her summer vacation? She must surely hit her forehead every time she appears on the VH1 - which is only slightly less than Ozzy's. He is barely qualified as a TV movie. It's hard to believe that the movie was released in theaters.
