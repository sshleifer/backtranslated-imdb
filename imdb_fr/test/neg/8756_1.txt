A majority of low-budget drama films exclusively designed for video and dating back to the 80s always smell worse than old hot socks. This particularly casual and amateurish basement, established in Chicago and without a budget, "the necrophile necrophilia in the bloodbath", is a depressing affirmation of this unavoidable and marginal fact. A wild-eyed psycho-hippie fruit cake with wild hair, long hair, long hair, long hair, bearded hair and shirt, launches into a horrific killing at random, graphically slaughtering young libidinous couples who indulge in an exhausting coitus every time the deranged lunatic attack of Mansonesque. (Hmm, do I detect a pretty obvious, puritanical, puritanical message "have sex and die here?" Yeah, that could be, man.) My boy, is this mental imbalance really a real puppy: After stabbing her female victims, our cracker killer loves to make love with their freshly killed bodies. (WARNING: Possible * SPOILER * in front of you.) Towards the end of the picture, the fool copulating the corpses is brutally interrupted by the cops as he is doing the unthinkable with a nubile corpse, thus causing the Rude pervert to run wild with an understandable misunderstanding and the cry of "Nooo!") Now, is this gonzo not a definitive lover? <br /> <br /> Too bad that this film is so badly done; if it had been made with a minimum of talent and skill, it could have been a shabby little gem of a horror exploitation object. Alas, the punchy direction of Wally Koz, Lamar "Larry", motionless still and motionless cinematography, Frankie "Hollywood", Rodriguez's tasteless and monotonous hard rock score, uncomfortably cheap and unattractive makeup, flat, visibly uncomfortable plywood acting ugly and imperfect, lethargic regime unattractive (too much time in front of a screen is tired by the meager efforts of the police to catch the fiery), a particularly shocking "surprise" (true identity mysterious killer is guaranteed to make you groan with disgust), consistently boring characters, constantly bickering and positively braindead, and a steady succession of dull and soft sex scenes that are about as erotic as watching two guys romp for 90 minutes. A few minutes in a row, all this gives a soft and soggy noodle of a shabby clinker. However, to be honest, this film has a stellar virtue: the rabid dog slasher undeniably tastes great in Hawaiian shirts that are too tropical, noisier than ever.
