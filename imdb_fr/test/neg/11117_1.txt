In case you wonder about the jester, Loren C ***** (Cryptozoology Inafame) is a living idiot and any information he provides is to be thrown in the trash. The guy is just a newspaper cutter. <br /> <br /> As for the scenario, it was a predictable train wreck, the actors were mechanical, the light was horrible and the accessories / clothes were cheap. /> <br /> Bobcat Goldwait should have played on the clowns of this movie. I was physically sick after seeing ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are still alienated / delayed monkeys who take care of the movies I see. <br /> <br /> Dan
