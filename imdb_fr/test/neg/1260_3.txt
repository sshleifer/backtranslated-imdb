It was more of a love story than an angel coming here on earth, although the two angles of this story receive a good deal of the movie. <br /> <br /> If I took this film to heart, as a person who knew and believed the Bible, I would have kept it pretty quickly, but I do not think the general atmosphere was petty, be blasphemous. It was just ridiculous or just stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean, John Travolta like a dirty angel? Smoking? To scratch the groin? Quote the Beatles? An "angel at war" who knows nothing of Heaven? An angel who flirts with all women? Yes, everything is absurd and certainly biblically incorrect. <br /> <br /> I could tolerate all this, but I do not know how many people, whatever their beliefs, could endure a boring movie, which turned out to be during the second half of that -this. He begins to slide when the romance begins between William Hurt and Andie MacDowell. Part of the dialogue during this love story is so stupid that it insults any discerning viewer. <br /> <br /> This is another film directed by Nora Ephron. Dude, I can not believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has written or directed. At least she is consistent.
