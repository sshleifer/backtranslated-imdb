I never want to see this movie again! <br /> <br /> Not only is it terribly bad, but I can not bear to see my old and sick Stan Laurel hero. <br /> <br /> I can not stand watching this awful movie! <br /> <br /> Frankly, there is no reason to watch this horrible movie. The plot is just stupid. The actors around Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really bad and Laurel and Hardy have been more fun in their previous films! <br /> <br /> I warn you that you do not look at it, the images will haunt you a long time!
