Oh. Well. Grief. <br /> <br /> I saw the title of this film in the television hours and I thought: "I have to watch this movie, tear Snakes On A Plane, it will be terrible but, hopefully, laughable too, it sounds terribly bad. " Well, I was half right. <br /> <br /> This film is horribly bad and, unfortunately, not even hilarious inadvertently. It's just bad. Even worse, it takes almost an hour to come up with something that looks like an action. For the first half of the film, we must endure a mumbled foreign language (Mexican or Spanish, excuses of my ignorance) and a terrible behavior, a woman vomiting snakes for reasons that we only discover later. We then have to endure even more terrible acting, and we discover that those who mumble in the foreign language could speak English anyway, while the snakes eventually get loose on the train and that things move from sedative to ridiculous. <br /> <Small budget does not always mean "bad" but, in this case, it does. What we have here is a film without any thought, a terrible scenario, a bad distribution and not even the sense of capitalizing on its very weak assets. I give two notes for some decent special effects and a whacky ending, but it seems a little too generous. To avoid if you can. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: Stagknight, the remake of The Wicker Man, a terrible CGI.
