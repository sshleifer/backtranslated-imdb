During production, this LWT series was titled 'Rocket To The Moon', a title that everyone on the set at the time found quite cheesy. Then, it was announced that it had been renamed "Reaching the Moon", as if this addition of this new word would evoke heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters. This same blatant lack of subtlety and understanding is evident in the very fabric of the entire series, and the same tired and boring scenario of the love triangle is actually spread over 7 episodes! Any television program that decides to use the "love triangle" scenario for a single episode pushes it, but it is unforgivable to spread it over seven episodes. There are, however, reasons to watch, with the landscape of the Isle of Wight certainly offering a magnificent setting, and the seemingly effortless performance of Lynda Bellingham that strikes all the marks of comedy. This is not enough, however. A number of performances are remarkable, especially when placed against the static and emotionless wasteland that Jonathan Kerrigan calls his face. I already mentioned Lynda Bellingham in the role of "capricious mother" (yes, regarding the development of the character and the past), but I was impressed by the actor Maurice Roeves (who is by far the most experienced actor in the world). having played in many classic films such as "Oh, what a charming war" of Richard Attenborough, "The Eagle Has Landed", and on television, including Baywatch, Holby City, The Bill, Eastenders, Cheers, Doctor Who in the years 80, Star Trek, and even go to Hollywood with Judge Dredd of Sylvestor Stallone in the years 1995, whose performance reminded me a lot of the teachers I met - men who are often incapable, whose life is full of a sad sadness. It is heartening to see Roeves continue to work after appearing in the 1998 British film "The Acid House" and, more recently, alongside the marvelous Maria Bello and Sean Bean in "The Dark". The main reason to watch this series, even if its appearances are very few. Another actor who does his best to raise the program is Ben Miles, in the role of brother 'typical man' crazy sex (again, what an original character!). As for Roeves, the resume says it all. After having raised this level, Miles has since appeared in the Hollywood movie "V for Vendetta" and the 2001 star movie "The Affair of the Necklace", alongside Brian Cox, Adrien Brody, Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce. Unfortunately, the fairly competent actors I mentioned are resigned to relatively modest roles compared to the dramatic driftwood of Kerrigan and Saira Todd, both of whom appear to have been injured too long and have not yet learned to play. . Even the tolerable Frances Gray suffers in the presence of theatrically fetale models, and unfortunately for her, the imperishable memory that I keep of her from the shoot is that of the DA asking for another relatively complex shot, because while taking she unconsciously "pulled her panties out of her slit!" Familiar faces appear in each episode - children in CBBC's programming and dramas such as "2 Point 4 Children" and other regulars such as Mr. Ben's ("they will remember me for that"), Lynda "the Oxo lady". Bellingham and others I do not even want to remember. Each episode tries, without restraint, to "deal with issues" such as teenage pregnancy, disruptive students and rocket construction (!) ... Things that Grange Hill did better when my parents were young! Overall, this series was a disappointment and a missed opportunity to develop a truly interesting and well-developed drama series. Unfortunately, for them, they have taken the easiest route, both in writing and (for the most part) in the casting. I would recommend both "Waterloo Road" and "The Street" to fans of good dramas - the latter in particular who have achieved this goal. If you love the Isle of Wight, do not go for the moon but the holiday brochure: it probably contains more character development!
