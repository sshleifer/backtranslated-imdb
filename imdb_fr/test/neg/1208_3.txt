This film is the proverbial film of the 80s that shows the viewer that as long as he tries something, he can be better than the pros. The main character, Doug, demonstrated his ability to fly a Cessna aircraft, which was equivalent to being able to fly a jet plane and kill people. We would all like to have a few million dollars to play with ... maybe make a good investment, make a donation, buy a few things, but the filmmakers decided to do Iron Eagle ... not once. .. not twice ... not even three times; yes, four times. The thing we should expect the most is the multitude of "Hollywood endings" in this movie. Just when you think that the movie will end after a sequence of end of cheese, there is another sequence of end of cheese. Then another. Decidedly, a movie that you have to watch to believe it ... and maybe own to remember how the 80s must have been great.
