It's boring as a kind of girls movie. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a neurotic woman struggling with the concept of marriage as a commercial arrangement, the romantic nature of an evening, and the uncertainty and pitfalls of the real love. <br /> <br /> Most of the motifs in the story are reminiscent of other recent KST films (eg, English Patient), but are much less successful. <br /> <br /> After the first half-hour, I started looking at my watch, wondering if I could go home in time to watch Leno on TV. <br /> <br /> I let "Gladiator" pass to see that!?!
