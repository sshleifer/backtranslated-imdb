First of all, I refuse to even consider this work as a video clip ... I consider it a short film using excerpts from the song "Thriller" in its soundtrack. For me, a music video should not be longer than the song itself, and the song should play the full duration of the video. Calling it a music video is like calling a poem The Great Gatsby. On top of that ... let's face it ... "thriller" is a boring 14 minutes, including the extremely old transformation of the werewolf, Vincent Price's silly poem (just because VP recites it does not mean that it's not lame), and the least threatening zombies I've ever seen. Of course, it was a cultural phenomenon, but remember, that's what happened at the same time that the A-Team was the # 1 TV show. So do not give too much credit to the culture for that one ... One last point about the impact of this film on the media on video clips ... what does that exactly add to the equation that "Billie Jean" and "Beat It" have not already added? As far as I can tell, this only added to the practice of stopping the song for an unnecessary dialogue or dance scene ... so you can say that this whole video was really about giving Puffy the inspiration needed to make more awkward clips.
