So many movies are now in a genre described as "Comedy / Thriller", as it was this one. A beautiful cast, an interesting premise, but what an unpleasant movie to watch. In hemp movies? Then either "Saving Grace" or "Lock, Stock ..." are much more enjoyable movies. Rating: Only 2 out of 10 Roach Clips
