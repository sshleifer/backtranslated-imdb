The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely canine. A gangster will be killed for showing a sign of weakness because it would become a handicap. I have no problem with the human side of Gansters being portrayed but Bugsy runs too far in the direction of gentle, comical men. The film is nice, but it is only a light entertainment and not a biographical film of an exciting man, but extremely dangerous and formidable. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent and the direction is very solid. The places and times are very well represented and the themes are very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?
