I think a lot of friends of the people who acted in this case had to come and note that because I tell you, it's just awful. The acting is worse than soapopera bad, the effects are like what we could see from an episode of Doctor Who in 1970, the story is, well, there is no story. And they continue to use the same song for 2 minutes again and again. And the werewolf? It's like the muppets they used in Wing Commander, giant cats, remember how much they looked? The werewolf is so bad. Seriously, the guy who directed this film is terrible and should never be able to direct anything else except maybe his son's play, but even then he should pay the public for the see. Ghostwolf is just a bad joke.
