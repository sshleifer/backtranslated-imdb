I must not have seen the same movie that the comments refer to here. First, I think they should have numbered Ghost Story if they wanted to film it at all. The truncated version they found was awful. I felt that the performances were handled and so left out of the story that the interpretations of masters such as Astaire, Douglas, Houseman and Fairbanks seemed to be in the making. Alice Krige was superb as Eva, however. Craig Wasson is a good actor, but he only played the role of the protagonist. The decision to play Patricia Neal and truncate her role was not good. Imagine what Anne Bancroft would have done with this character! I blame the script, which was poor. The production values ​​were dark and the pace was slow. A pedestrian effort disappointing. <br /> <br /> The book is one of the top five horror / horror novels of the 20th century, IMHO. But the film was disappointing, although it was an excellent introduction for Krige.
