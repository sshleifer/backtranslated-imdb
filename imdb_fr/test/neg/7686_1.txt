I only watched the first twenty minutes of this film and personally, I think it's the worst film of recent years. <br /> <br /> The plot was so bad that it might have been a year old child wrote it. The acting game was also sloppy with an almost unknown cast and not just the fact that the action sequences especially in the first half of the movie were so terrible that it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the producers got the budget to film this film but the production company must regret it now. <br /> <br /> To anyone who might discover this film in the near future, I advise you to avoid this movie joke.
