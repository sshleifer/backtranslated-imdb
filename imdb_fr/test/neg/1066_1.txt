I hate and sincerely despise this film and the filmmakers that underpin it. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm all for making a hard-hitting and honest film about youth and youth culture. "River's Edge" from 1997 is a great example. of a teenage drama done well. However, what bothers me is the childish, dirty and sensational approach taken by the creators of "2:37". <br /> <br /> An eloquent example is how it raises so many problems without failing significantly. way to comment or come to a resolution on even one of them. <br /> <br /> My other major problem with this film, apart from his complete plagiarism of "Elephant" Gus Van Sant (surprised that Van Sant did not sue) is his attitude of " bull in a porcelain store "dealing with fairly delicate issues such as incest and suicide in particular. <br /> <br /> In short, avoid this film like the plague and all that this filmmaker is involved later. I heard that his motivation for doing "2:37" might or might not be based on lies. After seeing the mediocre result, it does not surprise me at all. This is a glorified student movie exercise that has absolutely no place in the cinema or on DVD. Pure and simple.
