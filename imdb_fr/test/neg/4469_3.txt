(very serious spoilers) <br /> <br /> This film was a huge disappointment. there are so many problems that I do not know where to start. so, I'll talk about what's good in the movie. <br /> <br /> The distribution was excellent. steve martin delivers a truly fun performance of a middle-aged, upper-class, and stuck white man. Queen Latifah plays a big, beautiful, urban, black gal. and eugene levy, well he's playing pretty much all alone. add white betty and smart jeans and you have great distribution - everyone has done a good job. and if watching these guys for 1.75 hours is worth 8 dollars, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes. First, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend anyone. all whites are tense bigots. all blacks are ebonic speakers of the ghetto. blacks are hip, cool, with and poor. the whites are nerds, stiff and rich. (Except eugene levy, he is clearly caught with Queen Latifa and "speaks jargon" - so Latifa calls him a "monster" so - if you are a white man and you like black women and you know him slang of the street, you must be a monster). the film is littered with obvious racial slurs against members of the black cast and, in return, whites are described as morons and breasts. <br /> <br /> By putting the card aside, we will look at the main flaw of the film: they destroy the latifa character. she comes to Martin under a false pretext, but Martin likes it anyway. she is supposed to be wrongly accused of theft, Martin takes his case. 3/4 of the film tells us that Latifa's character escaped from prison. so, our sympathy for her goes out the window. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot. the film moves from one scene to another, latifa presenting itself in a place where it is "not" supposed to be (as in a country club or martin) and where Martin tries to hide it. it's the gag running. then in the final minutes of the film, they decide that they will finally deal with Latifa's claim that she was wrongfully accused of bank robbery. Martin will take cover as a boyfriend extracting a confession from the ex-boyfriend of latifa (and let's face it unusable), and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> finally (but there are many more problems in this film) this film seems to be a hodgepodge of other film clips. the premise is clearly borrowed from another martin film "the house-sitter". where goldie hawn comes to live with martin and upsets his hard bourgeois life. martin and latifa meet online - ala "you have a mail". the set "the weird nanny sets the life of a rich man" goes back as far as "the sound of music" and "Mary Poppins". <br /> <br /> I would not see this movie for free.
