A film of Almodovar always sends a tingling in the back. The capital print that opens the latest feature film of the Spanish author instantly makes you think of salacious nuns, sweet necrophiles, frivolous transsexuals - and I have not even been as far as the beginning of the young man's work. enfant terrible. And after a beautiful editing opening, while the camera was walking in a wind-swept graveyard, animated by a treasure of widows who rubbed feverishly the gravestones, I thought that Pedro had me again under his bad luck. <br /> <br /> Yet once my nostalgia had collapsed, there was very little room to fill his place. For a director who loves to bring humanity to murderers and rapists, he does a very poor job of finding emotional depth or endearing quality for his women. Penelope Cruz is Raimunda, a stubborn housewife whose life is complicated by the accidental killing of her daughter who abused her husband. Fortunately, she lives in Almodovar Spain where your friends will gladly help you dispose of a corpse to offer you a series of cocktails. Add to the melting pot the ghost of Raimunda's mother and a host of other matriarchs with eccentric hearts. "Volver" literally means to come back, and Pedro seems to be recycling old materials. The sub-plot of incest has the feeling of being considered as the mandatory "taboo". Instead of commenting on or reversing the problem, as with his treatment of pedophilia in Bad Education, he feels forced and unconvincing amid the sentimentality of the film. I suggest to Almodovar to call his next film Salir (to move on).
