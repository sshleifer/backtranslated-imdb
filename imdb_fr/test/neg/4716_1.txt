I swear I had never seen a film as bad as Half Caste's. Not only because it makes no sense, it's a huge piece of egoism and self-confidence that makes me throw up. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Apocada (in Spanish, Apocada has a pronunciation similar to "apocado", which means "out of life and happiness") made here a film composed of a single army, thinking that it was Sam Raimi or the boys who led the Blair Witch project. This is the Blair Kittie project, with a small and expensive budget. <br /> <br /> History, two American filmmakers who go to Africa to make a documentary on the half-caste, makes no sense. How to film, the insertion of high-speed shots with slow-motion shots, only revolt your stomach more than stupid lines (what is this dialogue on Bestiality? ) Or lame performances. By the way, I do not think this cast (or this caste?) Is American, they all seem European to me. <br /> <br /> Finally, let's just say that the filmmakers made a smart move to sell the movie film. They put a false price (like the most original film) and a nice cover (in Spain, the cover had a negative black caste image), so I feel unhappy, because I can not claim my 14 euros of return.
