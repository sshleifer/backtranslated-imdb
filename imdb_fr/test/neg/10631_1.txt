After enduring this film last night, I turned off the DVD player with the feeling of deserving a medal to have the stamina to go all the way. Throughout the film, I had the impression to look at the filling images found in a big-budget porn movie. the acting was stiff and tense, the work of the camera was appalling, and the sets and sets were so poor that they felt like they had borrowed from the local high school "Amateur Dramatic's Society". <br /> <br /> The only way to save lives this movie was that it had Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris in his credits, except that it was a pure dribble.
