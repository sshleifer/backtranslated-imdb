Honestly, I do not understand why people like this show so much. One of my friends is watching this and as I love science fiction, I've been trying to watch since the plot of the show seemed promising, but in reality it's really a very boring show. The only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the CGI effects of the video game and the total overuse of muppets. Note that I call it muppets because they really look like muppets and not extraterrestrials as they should be. <br /> <br /> Speaking of that; the muppets and makeup effects are horribly overexploited in this show. You have this guy who could be best described as an alien / hybrid dwarf, you have a pale girl who looks like a vamp-girl cheese, you have a frog-floating frog-extraterrestrial ... useless and even to the point of you feel distracted by the story of a lost astronaut. <br /> <br /> Each episode is also an isolated event. The creators of this series have made it so that each episode looks almost like another series. At least until you see the main characters / muppets again. The whole plot about the return of the main character to the Earth is too much in the background. The acting game is also pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: if you want a good science fiction, just look elsewhere. In my opinion, this is not even a true science fiction, because the show is more focused on fantastic elements with all the puppets and strange dreams happening. And if you just want to see some muppets, then I suggest you watch the Muppet show and feel happy that this abomination of a show has ended. <br /> <br /> By the way; Has no one ever had the concept of a living spacecraft? Ohyeah that's right; Doctor Who launched this concept almost 30 years ago! This show is like a collection of sci-fi remains. Scripts and events that were abandoned for good reason, but were taken up by this horrible show.
