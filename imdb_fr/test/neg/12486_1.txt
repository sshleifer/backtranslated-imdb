I'm a big fan of Zack Allan and I was disappointed that I had only one scene in the film. It was also my favorite scene where he confiscated the weapons of a character and directed it to Down Below. Unfortunately, unlike Thirdspace and River of Souls, most of the actions took place off-station. I did not care about Garibaldi after the first three seasons and I think Sheridan is fine but not Sinclair. I like Lochley but she has only a short time on the screen. If you like crusade or space battles, you should enjoy it. Personally, I can only give him 1/10.
