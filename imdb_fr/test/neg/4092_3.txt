The biggest problem with this movie is that it does not look like Bruce Allmighty. The first film was aired according to the dream of each dreamer to be able to control his environment as he pleases. Evan's experience, however, is totally different. He has no control over which Jim Carrey mocked and the story is centered on the power of belief. It would have been nice, since the first film preached the same message. The problem is that following is his preaching at the expense of comic relief. And to add insult to injury, he also casts intrigue into politics. You have the distinct impression that this film has a clear message and that its main purpose is not to make you laugh. To summarize, this film is a failed mix of Eddie Murhphy's The Distinguished Gentleman and Charlton Heston's The Ten Commandments. I'm not sure that Steve Carrell is at fault here, you get the impression that his character is limiting his abilities as a comedian. Former news anchor Evan Baxter is not supposed to be funny, he's basically an antagonist turned into a protagonist. which in this case only adds to the confusion of what the message of this film is supposed to be.
