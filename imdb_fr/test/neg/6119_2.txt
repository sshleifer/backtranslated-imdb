I liked the whole game with Caesar's palace, the Roman guards and the advertisers in toga. This event also marked "the passing of the torch" as far as the WWF's voice goes. Gorilla Monsoon, who has been playing game after game for every WWF PPV so far, opens her doors and gives the typical introduction giving the impression that he is there to announce another PPV. But then, we introduce Jim Ross, who makes his debut at WWF, and JR continues to make comments from WWF to date. But apart from that, this event is pure waste. The good old scientific struggle has been thrown out the window and marks the beginning of the gadgets. For me, it's the fact that the WWF started going to the bathroom and did not recover until the era of attitudes of the late 90s. Here is a report of the event. <br /> <br /> International Title Match: Tatanka (Challenger) vs. Shawn Michaels (Champion): A first win, but considering what Shawn is capable of doing, it was very disappointing. I do not know why the WWF was determined to put Tatanka in power. They should realize that Shawn was the future and Tatanka was just a hyper wrestler in an Indian Gimick. The end of the match was very lame. Shawn grabs the referee and the spell, and is called for a count. Although it's fun to watch Sherri get beaten up, this match was simply unforgettable. Shawn had to support this match and had trouble doing it. <br /> <br /> The Stenier Brothers vs. The Headshrinkers: The Steiners win with a Franknsteiner. This match has had its moments, but the crowd does not seem to be there. There was no heat behind, I think it was a match just to put two teams into play. <br /> <br /> Crush vs. Doink the Clown: TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! This match was completely nil. Two things very lame. A clown and a Hawaiian dressed in weird colors. The end took everyone by surprise. In the coming months, Crush turned his heel and Doink turned his face, but none of the fans seem to care. Unfortunately, it was not the worst game on the map. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backland: You have a brand new heel that goes very well against a wrestler forgotten for about 10 years. The fans snicker and laugh when Backlund comes out. And like Hogan / Rock in WM18 and HHH / Owen in WM14, the heel wrestler is heard louder and louder. Fortunately, this match was short. The good guy won, but I wish they had Razor completely eliminated and crushed Backlund rather than win by a small package out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Tag Team Champion Match: Ted Dibiase and IRS (Fields) vs. Hulk Hogan & Brutus Beefcake with Jimmy Hart I'd always like to know the full story of what happened to Hogan's eye. Never mind. The crowd was really in this game, but there was not anything. Hogan and Beefcake were obviously suffering from ring rust since both wrestlers were on the board for at least a year. Dibiase, as a great technical wrestler he was, helped make the match a real mess. The end was a surprise with Dibiase and IRS winning the victory via DQ. But to please the crowd, Hogan and Beefcake played as usual at the end of the match, as if they had won the match. <br /> <br /> Lex Luger vs. Mr. Perfect: The best part of this match was the four hot chicks that accompanied Lex Luger in the ring. Other than that, it was completely forgettable. The Mr. Perfect gimmick was born for a role in the heel and he just missed the warmth of a face. And Luger is just a waste of time, no matter what gadget it is in. Luger wins via a backslide despite the fact that Perfect's feet were on the ropes. Then Perfect passes the match after the match to be kicked buttocks. First, Luger stuns him with the running elbow. Then, when Perfect regains consciousness, he returns to the locker room to find Luger and be beaten by Shawn Michaels, creating a quarrel HBK / Perfect that could be a classic, but the WWF will abuse. <Br/> <br /> Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales: Absolute chaos! What did the WWF think had brought such a horrible wrestler as Giant Gonzales? Of course, he had the size, but I prefer to watch the Brooklyn Brawler in a match than him. It's not even worth commenting. <br /> <br /> WWF CHAMPIONSHIP GAME: Bret Hart (Champion) vs. Yokozuna (Challenger) You have one of the greatest technical wrestlers ever against a guy who has only one advantage. what he is a gigantic lard donkey. Bret was able to support the match, but a fairly predictable end with Mr Fuji throwing salt on Bret's face. <br /> <br /> POST MATCH: Yokozuna vs. Hulk Hogan Pure shit here. Hogan returns to the ring for no apparent reason and Fuji challenges him after a match, while Yoko has just won the title. Even hard-core Hulkamaniacs find that it's a total BS.
