Directed by Jim Wynorski (Chopping Mall, The Return of Swamp Thing), Cheerleader Massacre is the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series. Think about it: it's the fourth chapter of a slasher series that nobody really cares about! So, how could this be good? Well no! But since when should slasher movies be good? Cheerleader Massacre is entertaining, that's for sure. But in the field of entertainment, we have seen better, that's for sure too! As you can see, I'm not sure of my position on this film. Those who watch slashers only for nudity will be more than satisfied. This movie is all nested, but unfortunately no blood or not enough. I think I'm generous with this movie because I had a good time watching it and I really like watching slasher movies, even as bad as they sometimes are. If you want me to be sincere, The Slumber Party Massacre Part 1 is the best and all the others are a waste of time, so I guess I have a lot of time to lose !! For more fun, watch Sleepaway Camp 2 and Cheerleader Camp.
