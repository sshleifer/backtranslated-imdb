George Zucco was a good actor, often playing villains with lascivious intensity. However, even though he could not save this drab and flat film, B. Zucco embodies the usual mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron, who believes that the blood of a wolf, injected into man, can create an invincible army of wolfmen who can win World War II (go figure!) Experiencing handyman Pedro (Glenn Strange) Zucco creates a werewolf that looks quite like the one Dave Allen used to play in his sketches Hilarious! Pedro is obviously based on Lennie from Of Mice And Men, and you almost expect him to say, "Duh, all right, George!" There is a surprising moment when the werewolf kills a child by reaching out the window, but most of the time it is a routine and a very pedestrian pedestrian: a walk of 77 minutes to through all the old clich√©s much better done in others We also have the reason for the revenge of the Devil Bat, a loan from Son Of Frankenstein! <br /> <br /> Zucco is lost, and you only have to see it in movies like Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes, The Mummy's Hand and Dr. Renault's Secret to see how much it is wasted. Some scenes of atmospheric swamps are all there is to offer, really. And the scene where Zucco shows his wolf-man technique to those who doubted him (again from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) is unintentionally hilarious. <br /> <br /> Not one of the best 40s B movies.
