This film should fall into the annals of the fief as one of the worst of all time. I will stop to say that it's the worst movie of all time, only because I have not seen all the films ever made. I can not make such noble claims until then. The story is bland, the acting is horrible, at best, the special effects do not exceed a few pounds. Dry ice and a fan. Someone must have been linked to someone to make this movie. Mr. Busey posted this one! The dog is well trained and cute, which makes it the only quality that redeems this film that should never have been done. Two hours and $ 3 of my life, I will never come back.
