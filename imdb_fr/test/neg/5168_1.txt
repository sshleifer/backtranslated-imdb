Of all the negative comments on this film and add them up, I feel the same way. Australians may be weak, but brave soldiers. In this film, it was very terrible and too graphic. I did not see enough heroism but just more cowardice, which is just because it is nothing that I read. We do not need extreme violence like that. We can use our vivid imagination of what they have experienced. It's like saving Private Ryan, where the Nazi slowly pushes his knife into the soldier. For example, Mel Gibson is an extreme filmmaker for his films, not because of violence, but for his degree of historical inaccuracy. Letters of Iwo Jima was one of the war movies close enough to history (though I may be wrong), except for Flags of our Fathers and the Kwai River Bridge. You'd better read it, it's an insult to the victims and the victims if you do not say it correctly, and the film lasts too long, there's nothing interesting in the dialogue and not enough compensation for the Australians to kill Japanese. soldiers. Just read the story on the Internet, in magazines and in books. Movies always kill the sense of achievement. What they did to the prisoners of war in Singapore and the Philippines was a terrible disaster for civilians. It just makes me proud to see goodies defeating the bad guys, but movies like this ruin it.
