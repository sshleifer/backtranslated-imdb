I'm not really kidding when I can honestly say that this movie is not suitable to be viewed Sunday night on ITV4. <br /> <br /> The underground scenes are simply awful when London is supposed to be under 30 feet of water, the character of Robert Carlyles is dull. The police commissioner's outfit reminds me of something Kate Moss said and Nigel Planer looks VERY VERY old. In fact, I'm afraid he was a victim of a stroke during filming. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle's father who was "right from the beginning" obviously had too much Ketamin and although he played a major role in this difficult adventure, he deserved to be killed before he was caught in the act by Kate Winslett (Titanic), then Thames Barrier. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but I beg you to avoid at all costs the movie lovers.
