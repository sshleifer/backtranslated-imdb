The absurd principle of this film is related to the recovery by Argentina of the Falkland Islands, which failed by force in 1982, impregnating European women with Argentine sperm, thus diluting ethnic purity to favor Argentina. Yes indeed. The recognition is done by our hero / villan, Fabian, who pulls his fish-eye camcorder from the pillar to the pole to secretly film his encounters with the Falklanders, including his courtesy and the eventual conquest of a woman, Camilla. An indie and fraudulent documentary unfortunate, this film favors us with a lot of boring tourism pulled from the hip .... yada, yada, yada. The film has no plot potential and only begins to become interesting as Fabian and Camilla make their way through the usual moments of discomfort and uncertainty as they head from the handshake to the bed. "F * ckland" is only for cinema purists who can appreciate the austere and unadorned sadness of the jigglecam austerity of Dogma Indians.
