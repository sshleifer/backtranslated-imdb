I just watched an episode (S1- # 5, a boy in a bush). My comment may not be very honest. <br /> <br /> But based on this episode, this is a very bad version of CSI, the acting is shit. The main character, Dr., whatever his name is, is so wrong that it really hurts. I would not throw it to make an announcement for dog food! <br /> <br /> The other thing that hurts is David Boreanaz of glory "Angel", a good actor, does a great job, but he is wasted. idiot game of this woman. <br /> <br /> The secondary cast is OK, but everything is ruined because of this stupid game of Emily Deschanel. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing version of CSI, sorry to see it appears on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved. <br /> <br /> This woman is really sh # t, at least in this episode. But based on this view, I will not even invest in watching it, even if it was displayed on an elevator screen.
