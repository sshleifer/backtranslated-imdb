Really, I also love Lucy ... a comic genius yes ..... MAME ... EVER ... she was as ridiculous as Mame ... just like the movie adaptation of Divine Secrets of Ya Ya. Both just missed the point completely. Roslind Russell was, is, and will always be the first and only Mame. As a young starlet, Ball might have been able to play a role like this, where her beauty and youth would have allowed her to carry it through ... but it seemed like a desperate attempt by an older star show that it was still viable in the field. . The reason why there are so many fans of Russell's version (aside from the fact that you can not improve the original) is that Russell was present, she absorbs every scene, while Lucille Ball could just as easily be a pattern on Mame's wallpaper for all the attention she commands in the role.
