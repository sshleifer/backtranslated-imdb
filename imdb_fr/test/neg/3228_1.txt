It's more than stupid. <br /> <br /> Two high school graduates travel to Nantucket for the summer and find absolutely shocking situations. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore shares the star role in this one. As was the film in 1986, was Ashton Kutcher just a baby in the woods at that time? <br /> <br /> Moore's grandfather passed away and his home is about to be sold to ruthless people with a father and son who bring new meaning to the term mean. <br /> <br /> Bobcat Goldthwait, with that obnoxious voice in the movie, along with two brothers, who make stupid appearances more and more intelligent. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely ridiculous. The salient points of stupidity are when one person says to another, "Have you ever noticed that when people die, they appear alphabetically in the newspapers?" <br /> <br /> I rest my case.
