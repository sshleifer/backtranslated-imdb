I agree that this film is too pretentious and that it is not easy to know where it is going. I have been teaching literature and film for many years, and I find this film is one of the most overrated, according to some of the previous critics. <br /> <br /> However, I want to remind you that it is the same director who has to his credit The Love of religion (The smile of my mother) - a jewel of film! <br /> <br /> Did he try to beat Fellini's 81/2 here ???? The scene with dogs, which has also been underlined, is absurd and excessive ?? just an example. Others would take up too much space and some commentators have already noted them. <br /> <br /> All in all, a most frustrating and annoying experience!
