The sadness was the emotion I felt after the darkness of the screen. Intrigued, was another. Why are two experienced veterinarians like Matthau and Lemmon involved in this putrid project? I have the impression that they did not read the script before the cameras started spinning. All the actors are wasted in this insignificant, uninteresting and uninteresting film. Unfortunately, this was one of the last projects of the elegant Edward Mulhare, here in heavy version. Dyan Cannon tries, Hal Linden looks bored, Donald O'Connor recites some lines loaded with blasphemy. (?? !!). I am not with the "Legion of Decency". My point is that they were spouted purely for the strangeness of hearing him use a wrong color language. It is a desperate attempt to infuse "humor" into an image. He actually delivered the only piece of entertainment in the movie when he went around the dance floor. I keep my toughest criticism for the tracks. Walter Matthau should have known better. He always delivers excellent solo performances (IQ, Dennis The Menace, etc.). Its character, although affable, is rather dull and one-dimensional. I saw it once, I saw it all. Jack Lemmon gives another of his trademarks, weepy, portraits of men "just too sensitive". When he starts this mode, I want by proxy to give him a box of tissues. OUT TO SEA is terribly funny, and anyone who has produced this mess should be forced to walk on the board.
