Another try, another miss. France may be doomed to not be able to produce a good horror movie. I mean ... the least they could do was shoot the movie in the Brocéliande forest, but even the forest is wrong! It was shot near Paris! The subject is useless, the actors are really insignificant and the text makes you wish to be deaf. Nothing could save him. <br /> <br /> Bad ... on the bone. I was not warned. I want my money back.
