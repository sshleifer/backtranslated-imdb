Hard to imagine what they thought when they made this film (ie writers, directors, producers, actors, publishers, etc.). Christopher Plummer, a veteran of 129 films, has fallen into ruin among dozens of other actors apparently having no more motivation than collecting a paycheck. I guess there is nothing wrong with that, but once they are paid, it does not mean that anyone has to watch it. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that there are good reviews for this movie here at imdb. Art? If you want to see art go in an art gallery, do not watch this movie. The comedy? Watch the Flintstones rebroadcast, about the same parcel, with less time wasted. <br /> <br /> Dabney Coleman gives his usual performance, for better or for worse. And some of the young actors may have gained a good experience making this film. But Plummer ???? It was embarrassing to see his performance. In fact, I was completely upset throughout the movie, knowing it was the glory of Plummer of Sound of Music! I see in his biography that he called Sound of Music "mucus sound", so he does not like him as much as the hundreds of millions of people who loved him. <br /> <br /> I wonder if today we asked him how do you compare Sound of Music to Where the Heart Is, what would he say .....? <br /> <br /> Probably something like "Where the Money Is" ....
