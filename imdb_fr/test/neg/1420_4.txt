Interesting and short film depicts some of the machinations surrounding Carson's replacement by Jay Leno as the host of the Tonight Show. The film is currently very timely given the public drama surrounding Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. <br /> <br /> The film arouses audience interest in events and shows some of the concerns of stakeholders, especially NBC executives. Ovitz's portrait was particularly convincing and interesting, I thought. <br /> <br /> Yet many of the characters were only briefly briefed or tackled, and some of the actors seemed superficial. Nevertheless, an interesting story.
