Some of the films produced by Roger Corman's New World film company in the 1970s represent the best type of B-movie, where genre limitations act as a kind of liberating influence on screenwriters and filmmakers. Classic films such as "Deathrace 2000", "Hollywood Boulevard", "Grand Theft Auto" and "Caged Heat" have emerged from this environment. Unfortunately, his former confederates of American International Pictures were out of breath in the 1970s, especially in the absence of Jim Nicholson, and they often produced second-rate imitations of Corman's films, sometimes featuring his own stars. . "Black Mama, White Mama" is one of those movies. It's basically a cheaper imitation of "The Big Doll House" with some of the same stars doing a lot of the same things. Yes, it's a co-production of John Ashley (yes, the same John Ashley who was the hilarious Elvis that I want to be in "How to make a monster" and paired with Debbie Walley in "Beach Blanket Bingo") with all the brands of his productions - women's prisons where everyone except perhaps 2 or 3 main characters, including inmates and guards, is Filipino actors in essentially non-speaking roles, where we see women-type supermodel assume the roles of revolutionary militants, and where the film's prime joy comes from a rudimentary exploitation of S & M. <br /> <br /> The imprint I've seen Lately, it's been horribly damaged by the light (Will Viharo described it as "Yellow Mama, Yellow Mama"), but I think that even under the best conditions, photography and making are extremely routine. There is also very little visual value here ?? Corman must not have much to do with wi The film itself because he was always insightful enough to at least give his films an extra production value by filming in free public spaces that would give the movie a more awesome appearance . This movie does not look impressive, it does not have an impressive soundtrack and you just feel embarrassed for anyone who shows exceptional talent. Pam Grier is a brave whore who wants to escape life, Filipino actor Dindo Fernando is his indulgent pimp, and Sid Haig is a cowboy-like mercenary. The story places Grier and co-star Margaret Markov in a low-budget female version of "The Defiant Ones," but does very little with the melodramatic possibilities offered by this premise. Basically, this is just an excuse to make sure the two protagonists can always stop for a good fight in the mud while they try to escape together. All this is in the spirit of pleasure, but the film ultimately fails even as exploitation, because there is a certain advantage and brutality that should be present in such scenes that are replaced by a sort of gaping predictability under the hand of this director. <Br /> <br /> Will the film be of little value to fans of unconditional exploitation value ?? at least in the version I saw, it's not more explicit than "Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!" more than ten years earlier and much less interesting visually and thematically. For those who just love to laugh at movies "so bad it's good", this one could be fun, but it's not at the top. People would be wiser to look for "Caged Heat" or some of the others who revel in their own brutality to the point of becoming a camp; This one looks more like less ambitious efforts like "The Muthers" of Cirio Santiago. Unfortunately, the best thing about this movie is the title and presence of Pam Grier, who was better in other films at the same time (including Jack Hill's "Coffy"). This film may be halfway to Miss Grier's journey between Corman's secretary and the film B Queen-For-A-Day, but its "historical" meaning as such will have little value even for the big ones. Grier fans very little to work here. <br /> <br /> It's worth jumping, unless of course you do not see it in a movie theater with a lot of friends and a lot of beer like me. And even in this case, its value is debatable.
