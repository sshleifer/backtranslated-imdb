Okay, it's a children's movie, and it's not one of those movies that adults will appreciate too. However, there are unintentionally fun times, most involving holes in the story. For example, the kid needs a computer to bring his father back to normal and he does not have the money. So, does he ask the dough for his father? No, he steals and gets caught. Children, if I become invisible, I will advance your allowance, okay? Moreover, while this kid is at the police station (probably on the verge of being charged with lame criminal acts), his beautiful blonde schoolteacher comes in, announces who she is and where she works, and then gets out of school. SLAM BEFORE THE POLICE! To make matters worse, instead of going on a getaway, they sit in the parking lot of the police station and mock their exploits. You know, I hate to choose, but the kid stole something and should suffer the consequences, but maybe this movie is a punishment enough. Avoid it!
