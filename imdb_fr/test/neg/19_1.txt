This film can not be serious because it has a nerdy kid named Curtis who kills people. The other two psychopathic kids are pretty cute, but this boy from Curtis is so ugly because he wears those huge, ugly brown glasses. The actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to Revenge of the Nerds. <br /> <br /> Another thing I hate so much in this film is that Curtis is taking advantage of his time to photograph people. I kept my finger on the fast forward button because he was taking too much time and what was going on with his voice? He looked like fourteen, not ten. Another thing I hated was that he continued to smile like an idiot and that it was useless. <br /> <br /> Then they put this boring kid in the freezer and found a flashlight inside. It made no sense and neither did music. The music did not match any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> This film is slow, boring and a waste of time. Watch a different movie for your birthday.
