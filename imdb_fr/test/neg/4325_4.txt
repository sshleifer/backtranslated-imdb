Whenever possible, try to look at the five universal "mummy" movies in order, not so much for the continuity between the films as for their obvious lack. Of course, it goes without saying that Boris Karloff's classic, "The Mummy", should not even be mentioned in the same breath as the "sequels", which all present themselves as campers or cults. <br /> <br /> This time, it was revealed that the mummified remains of Princess Ananka went to the United States. And again, while your eyes are deceiving you, Kharis the Mummy is not really dead for the second time in "The Mummy's Tomb", but is alive and looking for her lost love, Princess Ananka, with the rhetoric help nine tana leaves brewed during the full moon cycle. To complete the mythology, Kharis needs a guardian, skillfully occupied by a lean John Carradine, named Yousef Bey, tasked by Andoheb, Arkan's high priest of George Zucco. <br /> <br /> Kharis and Ananka must be returned to their last resting place in the Arkan Hills in Egypt. But as we have seen before, being entrusted with the duty of high priest is a winning bet, it is a failure because the character of Carradine falls under the spell of the reincarnation of Ananka, Amina Monsouri (Ramsay Ames). It's shocking to see Yousef Bey and the stung bandit attacking the beautiful Amina. <br /> <br /> Riddle me this - in "Tomb" and "Curse", Lon Chaney portrays the mom with a soft right arm folded over his chest. When he meets Amina, unconscious, he lifts her without any problem. as soon as he raises his right arm, he returns to his crippled position again. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is remarkable - the monster catches the girl! But it's a short-lived victory, as the mummy and his kidnapped wife succumb to a swampy grave, an ancient Egyptian curse is fulfilled: "The fate of those who defy the will of the ancient gods will be a cruel and violent death" .
