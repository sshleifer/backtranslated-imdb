I had seen this on Italian TV when I was a kid and I remember enjoying it - because of its mix of real action and animation; However, it was universally solved at the time ... and, catching up with it after all these years, I must admit that the critics were right! <br /> <br /> What must have seemed wonderful in the eyes of a child is actually very poorly done, not to mention the boredom for a fantastic adventure; fatally, both the star (ex-"angry young man" Richard Harris) and the director (expert in action Hunt) are ill-suited to the subject! At least, Michel Legrand's score (with lyrics provided by writer Don Black) is useful - if not exactly inspired. By the way, many personalities are part of the voice of this Belgian-British co-production (Bessie Love, Julian Glover, Murray Melvin, Robert Rietty, Vladek Sheybal, Graham Stark and work, Michael Bates). <br /> <br /> While most of the plot of the classic novel by Jonathan Swift (the "giant" Gulliver becomes the pawn of a war between the small people of two neighboring countries and eventually escape in a country of real giants) emerge here, this is done at a level strictly reserved for children (with stereotypical characters although, fortunately, a small intrusion of the comic / romantic variety) - which makes the company a little useless , apart from its inherently experimental nature, since Max and Dave Fleischer have already made a splendid comic book version of the book in 1939!
