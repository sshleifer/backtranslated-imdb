Three young college girls, Simona (Iva Krajnc), Alja (Tanja Potocnik) and Zana (Pia Zemljic) embark on a canoe adventure on the Kolpa River, separating their Slovenia from neighboring Croatia, in this 2002 Slovenian film by Maya Weiss . What could have been an East European version of the famous and thrilling "Deliverance" of 1972 turned out to me, for me, totally devoid of sensations with flat portraits that deny any friendly identification with the characters. <br /> <br /> Alja and Zana are not at all convincing as students, although Alja expresses the desire to be a writer, and both use what seemed to me to be excessively bad. Alja gets bored with her boyfriend and seems to drift into life. Zana, even less scholarly, is an absorbed adventure seeker who loves other women. I felt sympathy for Simona, a relatively innocent and relatively innocent teenager. The very idea of ​​these three trips together just does not work for me. Zana and Alja's disregard for Simona makes no sense - why would they have chosen her as a traveling companion to begin with, when they must surely know her behavior and attitudes? <br /> <br /> The three begin a carefree journey. the river on two canoes, without being discouraged by news of the disappearance of a woman along the river. Things get worse with the mysterious, sometimes real and sometimes hallucinatory appearance of a conservative politically rabid fisherman (Jonas Znidarsic). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the scenes along the river and the small villages visited by the trio. It may be because of a lack of cultural understanding, but the film did not move me otherwise. I was surprised to see that the film won awards.
