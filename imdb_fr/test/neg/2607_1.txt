Sensational. After seeing this film, you will know why the American youth still does not have the intelligence or the traits to contribute to the well-being of society, except that it is no longer able to function. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is one of the stars most irreproachable people imaginable, who basically lack the talent or brains to make anything of themselves (especially Bam Margera and Steve-O), and the only option for fame was to make a living by entertaining those as stupid as they are. A guy drinking horse sperm? Just disgusting dish. A man puts a hook in the cheek and acts as a "bait" for sharks? It's not humor, it's a proof of its institutionalization. <br /> <br /> Overall, I left theater without hope for humanity.
