In fact, this monstrosity was not funny! This film was a complete abomination. The absurdities of this film almost made me want to throw up! I think the makers of this film have taken advantage of their audience. They took a relatively decent film series (I said decent, not good !!) and totally ruined it by trying to put money in their pockets. The manufacture of the plane! was a way for Hollywood to catch up on this shabby movie. The worst part of all this is that none of the people in 1979 understood the events of the movie (like the Concorde door torn from a ruthless altitude or Patroni pulling a flair gun through the window at Mach 2 in order to to avoid a NUCLEAR WARHEAD!?!?!? .... what were they thinking ???) were totally unrealistic or they did not care! I think it's the last of the two. The writers and directors of this "film", if you want to call it that, have really tried to suck the dynasty from the airport with this shit!
