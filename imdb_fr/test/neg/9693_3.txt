Dramatic? Yes ...... Historically accurate? Not quite! .... This film diverts the details of the Bible from the flood by placing Lot meeting Noah during the construction of the Ark. A fascinating time trip to Lot, done in part by NBC! ... .... being Lot was not born until 2136 BC, 234 years after the floods (2370BCE) ... It's like George Bush meets William Shakepeare! And what's going on with this guy who sells things and nicknacks to Noah? <br /> <br /> You can make a dramatic movie based on historical facts, but do not twist it to place people where they are not .... especially when it comes to the Word of God .
