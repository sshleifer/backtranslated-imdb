I was excited to see this show when I started seeing A & E promos. I've been fascinated by ghosts and paranormal since I was a kid and love catching "Ghost Hunters" when it's on (SciFi Channel) ). I have tried to watch three episodes of "Paranormal State" and spend only my time commenting on it, because it is so serious and perpetuates the idea that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible maniac. "Paranormal state" is more than lame. A voice-over "Direct's Log" that will leave you wanting for Captain Kirk. Cheese teasers that go into commercial breaks completely out of context. All that is paranormal in this series is automatically considered to be "evil" and the work of a demonic spirit. Then come the exorcists, demonologists, psychics ... as in "Poltergeist", you almost expect the team to leave and say "This house is clear." I really like the "ghost hunter" approach, which consists of refuting the assertions and then removing everything they can ... and they are almost always reassuring for the client (if they find something ) that hating does not mean evil. "Paranormal state" is not "so bad that it's good" ... it's just bad. Was not A & E "Arts and Entertainment"? The artistic part has long since disappeared, and the entertainment factor is also weakening.
