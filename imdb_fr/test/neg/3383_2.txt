What an absolute joke of a movie. The case of this film would have you believe that it's Duel meets Jeepers Creepers meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Three good movies in itself and you could think that by using their plan, MM could not go very badly. Well that's what I thought, and I got very, very wrong! <br /> <br /> We follow two students as they travel miles through the desert to a wedding. They catch a girl (no, she does not undress), then they are pursued by a Leatherface scam in a Monster Truck, which they rightly call F ** kface (AKA Monster Man). <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> </ p> / p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ P> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <nC2 I'm sure of many showers, that's , I admit, a very cool vehicle, but less than suspensive pursuit scenes ruin its potential. <br /> <br /> Then MM decides he has something to grudge and chases they lose him for a while and stop in a bar filled with amputees, then they go to a motel where the main character Adam sleeps with hitchhiker Sarah (although they both wear underwear!). Then they are caught by MM, taken to his home where they escape death and try to kill him, but fail, hence the organization of the suite. Apart from a slight "twist", that's it. <br /> <br /> If you can go beyond the first 2 minutes ?? where Adam's friend, Harley, just hid in the back of Adam's car to try to scare him, without any explanation as to how Harley got there, how many time or how Adam did not even realize? without thinking that you already hate it, then you can just enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Monster Man has a very poor quality of cinematography and direction, which is immediately off putting. This is the kind of movie you can choose from these movies in a box of 20 horror movies you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> What is so irritating is Blockbuster. stores so many of these low-quality films digitally shot by some amateur film students, and that's exactly what MM is (although IMDb says this director was born in 1961). <br /> <br /> The acting game throughout this film is atrocious. The scenario, which the author obviously considered funny, is irritating and childish. You have the impression that only one draft was written before shooting started. In fact, the script makes many of the film seem improvised, full of those boring, non-entertaining conversations that are only funny or important to the people involved. Imagine that you filmed yourself with your friends conversing, of course, the points are fun ?? TO YOU, but it's mostly garbage. This is what the script looks like for MM. <br /> <br /> Do not look for gore either ?? it's pretty minimal and there are a lot of better gore movies out there (Bad Taste, Evil Dead and others ??) <br /> <br /> The Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, even with their holes toss and of the plot, are far superior to these film. Compare the intro of Jeepers Creepers to the Monster Man intro and you'll see what I mean.
