I like ghost stories and I will watch a movie until the end, even if I do not really like it. I rarely feel like wasting my time ... BUT, this adaptation of Bell Witch's story was horrible! <br /> <br /> It was not scary at all. What about comic relief moments? The dialogue was tedious. Act incoherently The film was MUCH too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn for me. (As for the birthday party) <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say is that the costumes and accessories were done well. <br /> <br /> I'm curious to know another adaptation, but until then, I'll stick to reading the story.
