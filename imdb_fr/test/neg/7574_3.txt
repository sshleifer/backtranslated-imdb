Amando DeOssorio has never been left behind by a lack of budget that prevents him from telling one of his stories. His "Blind Dead" series started well at first, but had some really laughable moments, such as shots of a small boat model in a water tank for "The Ghost Galleon". In "The Snake of the Sea", he touches the bottom of the rock and takes with him some remarkable actors, telling the story of a stupid sock monster who terrorizes Google with the help of a few tanks of water and water. miniature aquariums. <br /> <br /> A vague opening sequence paves the way and shows an aborted military mission where American pilots, for some unknown reason, lay an atomic bomb (brazenly drawn as part of the film) somewhere in the world. ocean off the Spanish coast. The military commander gives this order from an office with a prominent American flag and a disturbed portrait of Ronald Reagan, one of the few things that make this film really like the eighties. The other two are the hilarious inept subtitle that declares the year "1,985" and the dated Tyria Power hairstyle, Sheena Easton, that would really look cool next to some torn neon sweats. <br /> <br /> One of the most eccentric monsters you'll ever see pops up from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. We learn that the wandering atomic bomb has killed a large part of the local fish. Unfortunately for our distribution, it has no effect on the sea serpent, which quickly descends on the Spanish coast for a kind of miniature chaos. <br /> <br /> Now, when I say that the monster is unrealistic, I'm not exaggerating. . It's not just a "kind of" false pretense. I'm sure the filmmakers did their best with the ten dollars they thought they were allotted, but most of the time it looked like it was made from Crayola markers, a ping-pong ball and an old sock. Not only that, he has this sinister music that accompanies him wherever he goes, a music that sounds so much like the theme "Jaws" that it's amazing that no one is sued. <br /> <br /> With Tyria Power, Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland are trapped, and the dialogue could not have been more dreary. Through a series of plot machinations, our main actors are mixed in a quest to ... well, I'm not sure of the purpose. Bottoms and Power must prove that the snake is real in order to save their buttocks (he is blamed for a sinking caused by a snake, she is locked in a trash after an observation). It does not matter, because at the end of the movie, nothing has been solved. Nobody admits that the snake is real, and he's not even dead. In addition, Power and Bottoms are always protected from the law. <br /> <br /> As illogical as it sounds, only our heroes know that the snake exists (despite many disappearances, a destroyed lighthouse and a crushed railway bridge) and embark on a long, non-adventure down and chase the monster ... do not kill him because they know they are not up to it. Their big plan is to use flares to scare them. Although their project is sloppy, the snake causes a big explosion in the water after attacking a bridge support (do not ask), and the giant sea serpent is so frightened that it goes away. The critical viewer would wonder why the snake was not scared earlier in the film when it caused two big explosions after crashing on a platform. But whatever. He swims away, and our heroes are sure he's gone forever. The end. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine the horror felt by the stars when they saw the finished film they had just worked on. A lame script and some reactions of weak reaction would never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing the time spent in front of a screen with a beast / spliced ​​motion motion. At least the secondary characters had fun screaming and being swallowed by a giant snake's head. I'm not sure what happened when they made this movie. the monster is cheap, but there are rather elaborate miniature sets, so someone spent time making them, not to mention the stop-motion animation. It's apparently played right, although the sense of humor of this film has gone over my head. In the end, the film is nothing more than an easy target for a drunken comment. Watch it at a party for best results.
