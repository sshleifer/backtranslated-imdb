My brother plays "Moose" in this movie. Although most of his scenes were left on the floor of the editing room. The funniest line is the movie is "nothing wong with stat." Anyway, it's filmed in Portland, OR, where we grew up. The dance club is called / was called "Up Front FX". What I liked in this film is that the main character (who is not named on the box because Bolo gives more weight) is supposed to be a police detective ... an excellent opportunity to drive in a red convertible Porsche. I have to get a copy, preferably from the director, to be able to see all the scenes in which my brother is. The only scene in which he finds himself is the beginning when they are in the dance club. He had this place because he was dating this cheerleader from a semi-professional football team called The Oregon Thunderbolts. This is interesting because its name appears as the first entry in IMDb. Glory has him, fortune, not so much.
