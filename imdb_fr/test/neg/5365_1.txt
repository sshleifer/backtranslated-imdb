I was very excited when Paranormal State first arrived at A & E. I thought this could bring more interesting ghost evidence. The value of the production looked good and I really like the logo. Then, after a few episodes, I started to think that this show might not be looking for evidence, but had an ambitious religious agenda. <br /> <br /> It seems that all the cases they are investigating have a powerful and powerful demon that I can not even move a cup of tea in front of the camera, yet everyone is terrified. Then comes a ritual of the power of Christ that saves everyone. <br /> <br /> In addition, the attention paid to other members of the team is very limited. The whole series is about Ryan and he feels like one of these people is giving you brochures about his church on the street. <br /> <br /> Did the paranormal phenomenon and the demons become the new missionaries of Christianity, frightening the people who would be converted? Really, it should be on a Christian network. I was very disappointed.
