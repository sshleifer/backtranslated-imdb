This is the only word I can think of to describe this film. No loss as a waste of time (the time spent with these characters is never lost), but a loss as a waste of opportunities. <br /> <br /> When I see this movie, I think of all the Star Trek. written novels that would have made a film much better than the story chosen by Shatner. The setup looked like an average TV episode, while the finish looked like the climax (if you can call it that) of the first movie. <br /> <br /> Nimoy, in the realization of II-IV, focused on the character of Spock - how he confronted the Kobayashi Maru outside the classroom and how he handled his lived emotional now that he had a chance to start over. Shatner could have done the same thing with Kirk here, but he did not do it. We do not know much about Kirk that we did not know before. Again, one of the novels would have been better - try "My enemy, my ally" for a study of the very interesting character of our friend James T. The minor characters are mainly used for cute pieces, and the subplot of Scotty-Uhura seems well out of the left field, especially since the subtext of the original series was Sulu-Uhura. <br /> <br /> Even the most seasoned fans do not find much to appreciate here. Sorry, but it's true.
