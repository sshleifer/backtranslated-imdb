"Shuttle" is / was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start, but after half an hour, it ended in the worst imaginable way I could imagine. This movie has lost its story, if you can call it a story? ... after half an hour. All the following scenes are totally out of proportion. The driver is a kind of superman, because he survives every attack with a knife, and so on. even after being stabbed in the leg, he managed to put it in the box. But what a coincidence that there is a box in this garage. I really felt sick and misled at the end of the movie. It could have been such a good story if the story was much better. In my opinion, even a child would make a better story. And why send the girl with water and food. I stopped counting the holes in the plot halfway. And when the film reached its final turn almost admirably sick, I had completely abandoned (better say "throw up"). The worst aspect of Shuttle is that it can only be worse than the worst. Perhaps screenwriter / director Anderson will learn from this lesson and provide us with a decent thriller next time. Think about it better it will change of kind. Fingers crossed. But from now on, I will read the commentary of his next films. before looking, a waste of time.
