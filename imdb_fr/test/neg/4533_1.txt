Short film poorly made (filmed in high definition or betacam, it appears). He screams throughout the film or video of a student. The premise is limited in scope and the short film actually seems much longer than it runs. Some interesting gaming moments and a decent production value, but not enough to get this movie out of the "hole" in which it fell.
