First, let me just say this ... Ghost Story .... hello!?! <br /> <br /> If any of the people who criticized this film from beginning to end realized this fact, their reviews would have been very different. The fact that the characters disappear each time the protagonist turns to look, should have been a lethal gift. This movie was not presented as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store, not even a hint, and this is the biggest mistake made by the studio that marketed it. It was deliberately on their part not to sell it as a ghost story to confuse you as the main character is confused when you try to make sense of it. The problem is that they have lost too many viewers. the ghosts appeared "too human and real" without any of the usual signs, images or special effects that Hollywood usually uses to let you know that you now see a ghost ... and that's what they were trying to make. The main character does not know that she sees ghosts, any more than the viewer. Now you get it? As long as you understand that the main character is seeing ghosts, you will understand the movie and you will not be so irritated by what is perceived as a major oversight in continuity or conspiracy mistakes. <br /> <br /> That being said, it was still not a good movie, but not as much as everyone pretended. If you intend to watch this movie, know that everything you see is not always what you think. 4 out of 10 for acting, 3 for originality, 5 for plot and 5 for the scaring factor, although there were gores and spooky moments. It's still not a good movie, just misunderstood.
