Playmania is extremely boring. This is the basis of the show. Mel or Shandi ask extremely easy questions that a 2 year old can respond to at an extremely slow pace. This show lasts 2 hours and they probably only play a dozen games during this period. People may like this show because the animators are fantastic, but their heat is completely destroyed by the fact that they are so annoying. <br /> <br /> During the show, they mention that it takes more players per million. time. The top 5 polls they do probably take about 20 minutes of the show. This show is probably one of the worst TV games ever made. One of the reasons they probably do not have callers is that the show is so cheap with the money. The most money I have ever seen was $ 210. I would not be surprised if this "game show" is canceled by the end of 2006.
