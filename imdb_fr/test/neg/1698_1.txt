The most irritating thing about "Dies d'Agost" is not just that NOTHING happens in this film, but that director Marc Recha has the nerve to pretend that this film is a kind of tribute to the journalist leftist Catalan Ramon Barnils. Unless the name of Barnils is mentioned a few times as a "tribute", this claim is a real fraud. You will know practically nothing about Barnils in this film, nor about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), nor about the particular role of Catalonia in this war. You will not know either about the collective punishments inflicted on the heroic Catalan people for years by the victorious and vindictive franc. <br /> <br /> The images of the Catalan countryside are very beautiful, of course, but "Dies d 'Agost" does not have a sufficiently large and varied collection of such scenes to be qualified as a travel diary. The large number of still images shown - poorly illuminated images of the forest floor, for example - is the clearest indication of the scarcity of ideas here. The aimless drift of brothers Marc and David during their camping trip does not produce a convincing cinema. On the contrary, the strongest impression is that of a film made by and for spaced middle-aged hippies. Do not waste your time. Read rather a good book on the Spanish Civil War. (I recommend Felix Morrow's scathing and anti-Stalinist "revolution and counter-revolution in Spain", which contains a striking account of the 1937 uprising in Barcelona.) <br /> Barry Freed
