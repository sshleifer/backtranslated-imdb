This show drives me crazy. It goes against everything a family should be, even if it's supposed to be a comedy. The series is supposed to follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) as they raise their three teenage children: Hilary, Larry and Mike. A good local for a comedy, yes, but that does not mean that it will be a good show. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've ever heard more raw conversation from parents with children and vice versa. The only conversation that seems to be in the series is the control of children by parents and sex. I know that sex is usually something that teenagers often talk about, but it is mentioned in almost every episode, without any point. The only episode I watched involved parents giving a car to Hilary, their daughter. Not once, do you think they are bound in any way by the way they talk to each other and whose parents talk about how Hilary looks like "their slave". "<br /> <br /> The show fails the most in comedy I have not laughed at this show once in the many times I tried to watch it, and I'm a person who gave great ratings to Animal House and Dumb and Dumber Michael Rapaport is a very good actor and the reason he chose to spoil his career by doing this bastard show is beyond me. <br /> </ br> > Parents, make sure that your children never look at it Teenagers, you will surely laugh at it, just for the blatant sexual references, but nothing escapes and you feel rather empty thereafter. > <br /> 1 1/2/5 stars.
