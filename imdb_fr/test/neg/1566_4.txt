GEORGE AND MILDRED was a spin-off of the mid-1970s sit-com. Although I have not seen the show since it was released, I remember it was pretty fun with most of the comedies from the eponymous couple. who would live alongside the posh family of Fourmile, a sort of LOVE THY NEIGHBOR without the cynical racist gags. <br /> <br /> After seeing this "big screen version of the series", I wonder what is a widescreen version of? Certainly not a popular mid-seventies sit com of the same name. For some reason, the movie removes all the interactions between characters on television by taking George and Mildred out of the street where they live and by becoming involved in a plot involving serious gangsters who want something that George inadvertently picked up. and that leads to a grimace of situations and lines such as: <br /> <br /> "He gave it to you" <br /> <br /> "No, this is the first time man resists my charms "<br /> <br />" I meant the envelope "<br /> <br /> It feels like the writer Dick Sharples (who has never written an episode for the original sit-com) has never seen an episode of the source and has had the series confused with the CARRY ON movie series. In many ways, it looks like the same mistakes as the last movie LOST IN SPACE in that it has nothing in common with the series that spawned it.
