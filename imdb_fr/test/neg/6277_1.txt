I wish I could give it a zero. Of course, I'll admit that I mistakenly mistaken that mistake, thinking it was Spielberg's version. A clever marketing ploy releasing it at that time and prominently in the video store. However, I was willing to try it anyway - I would not like to have it. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? I have read some of the other reviews here and I must say that I do not agree with anyone who thinks that one of the roles was good - sorry even stinky C. Thomas Howell. None of the performances were good. Not one. <br /> <br /> Even if the acting was correct, the dialogue is terrible! "Ginormus" and "dick skinners" do not really cut it. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was terribly adapted and had to be modified by a 5 year old child. The main character constantly comes up against convenient situations - or at least seems so because of the way the film was mounted together. For example, he tries to go to a place called New Hope to find his brother. During a brief break, someone gives him random instructions for New Hope. What is that? When he arrives in New Hope, he stumbles upon his dying brother. Then there is the part where he has been away from his destination for days and stumbles upon the car in which his wife and son were traveling. He was heading in a different direction from where they were. was? He has a black backpack that appears and disappears randomly in the film. There are parts of the film where the characters wake up in the morning and two seconds later it's night - or worse, at dusk the next day. Nor can I forget the main character and preacher falling through the floor of a house for no reason - we only find out later that a stranger has landed on the house. Which reminds me of the moment when they walk and suddenly find themselves standing under an alien they have not noticed. What the hell, aliens are like two big stories with huge bodies and several legs - how could they miss it? There is a moment when an alien kills a citizen at random, supposedly spitting a kind of nonsense - but you never see things flying, they just appear on the faces of guys. The special effects in general are terrible. The whole movie is like a bad "train wreck". When we finally get to the end, after this guy has tried to go to DC to find his family, they appear. No research, no questions, nothing. Oh, that's it, I'm so happy - the end. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if my review is a little kidding, but this movie was so terrible that I had trouble organizing my contempt. Save time and do not look at this heap of stench stench presented sneakily. It may be the worst movie I have ever seen. I would rather have had a root canal - it would have been less painful.
