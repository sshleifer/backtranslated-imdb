The only thing richer in holes than the premises of this movie is his script. Flatliners is the perfect showcase for Joel Schumacher's glorious, flamboyant and cheeky lack of talent. The plot is totally illogical but extremely factitious and everything is directed in the rules of the art in the most clichéd and overheated way. I love the way the medical school's autopsy room is a cavernous vaulted vaulted marble mausoleum of red with huge Rembrandt paintings hanging on the walls. I like the way Keifer Sutherland drives an army jeep on canvas back. In Joel Schumacher's films, no one lives in a non-eccentric way. It is still an alternative universe where everyone is young and painfully hip, but hip obsessively and strictly, according to the hip idea of ​​a billionaire middle-aged man, out of touch. Holy shit! The part where Baldwin's brother No. 16 dies and comes back to life and is haunted by all the women with whom he slept and who sings "I'll call you" and "I just need space" is the thing the more fun of everything. universe!!!! In what world do we live in which Joel Schumacher can continue to have people throwing money at him? "Flatliners" made me want to review all of the man's work only for the kind of high quality yuk it contains.
