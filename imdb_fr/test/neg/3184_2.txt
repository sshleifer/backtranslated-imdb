"He's supposed to have good reviews," says the g / f. If so, I can not find them. She will sleep and I support. Michael Douglas in good old boy - now there is a new one. Matt Dillon all messed up. John Goodman loses his temper. Paul Reiser in BDSM leather. Oh, it's a real riot. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you will probably lose interest. Liv Tyler plays the femme fatale and critics complain that they do not have the register. But it is indifferent: this film does not concern the development of the character. In fact, I would go so far as to say that there is no character at all. What you are supposed to appreciate here is the plot. <br /> <br /> Nobody is "bad" in this film. Some people wonder why all these "stars" - even Reba is here for God's sake - fit into such a gigantic project. Chances are they thought it would be fun. Maybe they had fun. Who knows? Hey - maybe they were well paid too. <br /> <br /> But you have to pay money one way or another to see this turkey. And it's probably not a good idea.
