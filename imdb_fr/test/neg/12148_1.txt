The horrible production does not qualify as a "film". It was obviously filmed on a videotape, and very badly! There is a constant sound for the audio (which looks like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that sometimes you can not understand what the characters are saying. A badly doubled music will suddenly appear in a scene, and the complete editing of this thing speaks of a ZERO! <br /> <br /> The plot is artificial and ridiculous. A gay man from the late 1920s trying to hide his lover alive from the parents who visit him? PLEASE! And the mother's reaction when she finds a picture of her son kissing her boyfriend is far beyond the melodramatic and becomes perfectly stupid. Talk about a stereotypical vision of gay life! The acting is worse than a porn movie and the staging is very mediocre! <br /> <br /> As far as "production" is concerned, there is none! <br /> <br /> This title is simply a lame attempt recorded in video to be called a "movie". There is no soul to give the slightest eulogy. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time stupid, so avoid it at all costs! BAD ACTION! BAD WRITING! BAD DIRECTING, and the title of "producer" is a vanity, because this basket probably cost them the price of the videotape they shot on. <br /> <br /> This junk has no say on a dvd because it is misleading to the cunsomer. I can not emphasize how horrible this shit "SUGARPLUM" is! <br /> <br />
