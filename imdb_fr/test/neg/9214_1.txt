The film tells you to be aware and conscientious. It also destroys everything and everything, the Bible claims to be true. For people like me, the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous. This has been called "blasphemy" and this is the case if you are a believer. It is sad to hear that many people see it as a good continuation of the Bible. However, the film shows you many things and topics that can be interpreted as a filmic version of "Revelation". Some of us think that such things should not be abused. One of the good things about the movie is that it strongly encourages ethical awareness and encourages you to consider your actions twice. The director just seems to forget that some people act in this way already just based on the fact that they believe and love as prescribed in the Bible ... Why try to change this, unless you are yourself the Devil?
