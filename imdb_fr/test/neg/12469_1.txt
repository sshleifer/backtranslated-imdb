Basic Structure of a Story: Beginning, Middle, Ending <br /> <br /> Sometimes this structure is played with and we get Memento or Irreversible and the story is read on the back. Sometimes it's just not linear, at Pulp Fiction. Anyway, they all have a beginning, a middle and an end. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I have ever seen that has no end. <br /> <br /> Start: the best girl friend is expelled. <br /> <br /> In the middle: a girl has to fend for herself without her best friend. <br /> <br /> End: nonexistent. <br /> <br /> That would not have been an end. saved this movie, but at least it would have been complete. <br /> <br /> It is an exercise of apathy; we get a mix of characters, and they all turn out to be failures. Boring, vain, tasteless and pale imitations of people. <br /> <br /> And here's the action in this movie: NOTHING DOES. Nothing happens at all. Mischa Barton tries to speak with a leaden English accent, Dominique Swain moans a lot and Brad Renfro gets a blowjob from an old man. End of the movie. <br /> <br /> At the time of the credits, I had the horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel: moments, these precious minutes of our lives, have just been lost. <br /> <br /> Brad Renfro is the only passable point (and this is a very emphatic ONLY). He is doing well. Lacey Chabert I like it, but no luck here. Because of the good work in the other films, I will forgive Mischa Barton for this parody, but I hope all members of the cast have been slapped for their involvement. <br /> <br /> Please, I beg you. To avoid. Do not be mistaken thinking "I will decide myself". My sister told me never to see this and I ignored her, wanting to make my own idea. It was a bad decision. <br /> <br /> I never hated a movie. There are many that I do not like, but I have never hated a movie. Until I see that.
