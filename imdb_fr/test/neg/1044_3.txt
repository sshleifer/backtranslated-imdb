I first saw this film before something I had rented some time ago ... and it looked decent. I saw some good things from the Full Moon video and I thought it was worth it ... Unfortunately, it was not a good thing. <br /> <br /> The story is about a possessed bed. A couple moves into a new apartment, discovers the bed and strange things begin to happen. Strange things as the woman discovers perverted sex. And the man discovers the perverted sex. And the woman draws pictures of perverted sex. And the man is photographing the perverted sex. And they both start dreaming that dead people have naughty sex. You might think that a movie with so many bad sex would be good, right? <br /> <br /> Well ... no. The problem is that this movie is supposed to be scary, or at least be a thriller and it does not give. There is little tension, no suspense and no fear. Apart from some troubling dreams and visions, there is really nothing for this couple to worry about. The whole film is essentially composed of them and women who have these visions and play in bed. Of course, you get a monster fight in the end ... and a bloodbath ... but nothing spectacular ... There is only murder and a good fear, and that's it. <br /> <br /> And the kinky sex? Do not raise your hopes (or anything else). Their idea of ​​perverted sex is a woman on top, fully clothed, trying to strangle her mate with a tie. Not exactly my idea of ​​a good time.
