Feeling Minnesota is without a doubt the worst (** big movie with prominent stars) that I have ever seen. Bar none. This film totally fails on all levels. It's poorly photographed and edited. There are actors without inspiration, of the kind where the actors seem to be bored. Just collect paychecks maybe? And worst of all, the sludgy script seems to have been written under the influence of an unpleasant substance found only in the sewers. I can not even understand how a screenwriter / director could have found someone to finance this project, let alone to attract one of the stars he made. I really wish I could recover the time I lost looking at this trash. If possible, I would have given this film a score of zero. Better yet, a negative number.
