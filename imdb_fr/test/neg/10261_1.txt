Everything in this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And were all the blood and blood that was in "Demons" which is a good movie and it was not scary at all. My brother said that this movie was bad but I had to give it a chance because the first movie was very good. When the movie is over, I understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only advantage of this movie was the music of "The Smiths" and "The Cult", but it is a movie and the soundtrack of the music is not the most important thing. And I saw that it came out four suites after this movie, I have not seen any but they can be as horrible as this one, I do not intend to see them but maybe I will see them a little.
