I saw this film 3 times. Mainly because I thought while looking, "did I miss something here?" Is there a reason why this movie was made? Was he trying to say something and I missed it? After three views, I failed to find an answer. <br /> <br /> I think the worst thing I can say about a movie is that it bores me and I have not finished it. I'll admit there's plenty of eye candy, quick editing and cool music to keep my attention, but is that all that a movie should be? <br /> <br /> I'm not against extreme violence, it's almost non-stop, but it seems like there should be some kind of inspiration. Something that is highlighted by this. The word free comes to mind, but it is worse than that. In the first part of the film, we are all informed of the motivations of the characters. And yes the 3 principles are very good in their roles. But the roles are completely unbelievable. Thus, in the first part, we get to know the characters and, in the second part, most of them die and fill their sadistic joy to kill other people. This seems to be the entire movie. And the first part has nothing to do with the second. <br /> <br /> For example. How could a smart guy like Zed agree to join a group of junkies and amateurs to do a job like this? It does not mean anything. He is presented as intelligent, yet he continues his suicide mission. The fact that he survives is totally incompatible with the rest of the hyper-real violence and chaos. So, what are we looking at here in Hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super real and super violent bloodbath? I remember having the same reaction to two other films this director was involved with: True Romance and Reservior Dogs. <br /> <br />
