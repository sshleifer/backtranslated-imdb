Two popular actors are paired in the show, like De Niro and Murphy, who play the role of policeman and actor. Although they share the most screen time together, they do not achieve the expected performances such as Analyze This, Meet the Parents, Dr. Doolittle and Nutty Professor. The film begins in an interesting way, but becomes a thin and ordinary comedy, which is quite disappointing. It seems like De Niro, in particular, does not like to be in Showtime. It's a shame because he really shows his feelings, that's what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea had been used intelligently, it could have been a more interesting work and could be followed by a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I do not think there would be at least a sequel to that with the filming of De Niro and Murpy again. ** out of *****
