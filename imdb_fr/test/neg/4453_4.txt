It's weird, this movie; you have the impression that the managers of this evening spent more time in the local bars than on the set. In fact, it's a surprise not to see the name of Harry Alan Towers in the credits; this certainly has the flavor of one of its tax shelter productions, but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for all those involved to enjoy an extended stay in Provence. Despite the fact that the film is supposed to take place throughout the region, Les Baux and its surroundings represent almost everything. <br /> <br /> David Birney is a spectacularly colorless hero, as Michael Lonsdale says. at some point "you are a traveling cliche". What Lonsdale is doing is to guess. For some reason, the most interesting character, interpreted by Rampling, is set aside, whereas, whatever the book, she should have been the central figure because she clearly has the ability to make the film (which would have was dull anyway, but the less we would have had more nice things to watch). <br /> <br /> In short, a useless case that is worth watching to see how much action film can be less action.
