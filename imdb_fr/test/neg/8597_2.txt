The other day, I showed my boyfriend a great movie, Stand By Me, a movie I showed to a lot of people and they loved it, but for some strange reason, he did not not liked. He lends me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me that he showed it to a lot of people and they loved it. Instead, I hated this movie. I do not think I have ever hated a movie from time to time, but the fact that this movie gets a score of 6.6 exceeds me. I could not follow the five million stories here: Billy Baldwin becoming a firefighter, random sibling rivalry, random love story or stories, the arsonist, the investigator, the fire who has the personality of his own. I just have a problem: this movie can not follow all these stories, they are not balanced enough to make the film interesting. I would have preferred this film to talk about a firefighter or an investigator and whether he became one or what he does exactly and why. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a group of Chicago Firefighters, two brothers. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, the older brother, is obsessed with the shots he fights. Brian, the younger brother, had left the school of firefighting several years before, before embarking on several other careers before returning to become a firefighter. He is despised by his older brother who expects him to fail in his new firefighter career. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is an investigator responsible for his job. It is called because a number of fires have somewhat similar links. Mr. Martin Swayzak is a municipal councilor of the city council. He is obviously hoping to be elected mayor, but he had to make several cuts to the fire department. Many of the firefighters at the base believe that the cuts he has made put the lives of firefighters in danger. However, Swayzak initially portrayed the fire department as inflated and ineffective after firefighters were repeatedly killed in flames. <br /> <br /> I just could not get into this movie, I do not know how it could, it was incredibly unrealistic and portrays the firefighters all wrong. I loved how each action shot in the book corresponded to this action movie. I also just felt that there was a great talent lost on such mediocre roles, Donald Sutherland, a great actor, but a role so strange that could have been played by a lesser-known man who had the talent to come to the time. I know that Ron was aiming for great quality, but I think that naming big actors in small roles was a mistake for this movie. I even had to joke while watching this movie, commenting that the doctor in the background was probably Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic and the film was so far away that I did not like it and, honestly, I would not recommend it to people, I will stick to the recommendations of my relationship from this point. <br /> 2/10
