I loved the first third of this movie and thought it would be one of Truffaut's best movies. I loved the plot in which a correspondent marries a man from the other side of the world - invisible. Especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and is responsible for the death of the real correspondent to take his place! She then cleaned up the husband's huge bank account and disappeared! I was really hooked and wanted to see more, ... <br /> <br /> And then, the film collapsed and became stupid! Although she comes from New Caladonia (a Pacific island) and Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), when he goes on a trip to the south of France, he falls almost immediately. Hmm, .... the odds are 187,000 to 1 but he finds it. Then, instead of killing her or handing her over to the police, he forgives her, even when she recognizes what she did. Alright - it's hard to believe, but okay ... but then he helps her hide it from a private investigator by killing him !!!! Nobody is so stupid! Yes, the character of Catherine Deneuve is very beautiful, but go ahead, it's silly. Moreover, if he wanted it only as a sexual object, why would he do it for a woman often icy, completely selfish and perverse? <br /> <br /> This film, because of its very ridiculous plot, does not deserve such notes! Unless you're a hardcore fan of Truffaut, try another movie, even one from Truffaut, but NOT this one.
