Where do we start with an offer like this? I almost said film but it would go too far. The only thing infernal in this movie is that it's definitely a marriage done in hell, between nil and nonsense, baloney and balderdash. These films must include a physiological health warning so as not to damage the mind to the point of letting believe that all the good filmmakers have left the planet and that their resources have been turned over to the fools who made this classic as his sister's "League of Extraordinary Twaddle" weapons. These are neither science fiction nor facts, nor entertaining nor stimulating, nor humorous, but they are in a twilight zone devoid of props that incite people to give up their precious time, sit in a dark room and generally more enlightened, more alive. or happy at the end of it. If we could award "Turkey" points for films like this, it would be a turnip, because we would go through the turkey, ham, potatoes, cabbages, sauce and all other embellishments before reaching the bottom.
