This film is only recommended to insomniacs: it will relieve them by letting them fall asleep. Five-year-olds could also enjoy it. But for anyone (including fans of the genre), what a nuisance! The "old" plot is reminiscent of "Return Of The Dragon", and this film is just as inept, but Nero is not Bruce Lee, so "Enter the Ninja" is an even worse movie. So far, this is the second movie (the "comedy" offensive "" Bachelor Party "was the first) movie to which I gave 1/10.
