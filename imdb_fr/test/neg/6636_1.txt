It is without doubt the most poorly thought film in history. The gags of Carrot Top's invention are some of the most terrible attempts in recorded history. I do not know his other job, but if he's half as good, I'll cry. I give this film 1 star on 30 billion and God have pity on the soul of those who are responsible.
