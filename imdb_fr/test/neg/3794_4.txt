I went to see this 3 nights ago here in Cork, Ireland. It was the world premiere, in the tiny cinema of the Triskel Arts Center, as part of the Cork Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I found "Strange Fruit" very good movie. It's a bit difficult at the edges, but for a low-budget movie, you have to expect it! In general, the cast of actors (especially that of the lead director, Kent Faulcon) is wonderful, the cinematography and staging excellent, as well as the extremely entertaining and stimulating scenario, with beautiful settings and a witty dialogue . <br /> <br /> The end was a little sudden, no conclusion was given to the characters and events once the finale ended ... but maybe that's what the filmmakers wanted? It certainly made the movie more disturbing. I liked the fact that the main character never agreed with his mother on the screen: you wonder whether he will or not, because in real life, these things are sometimes never settled . It was a good choice, to leave it irresolute rather than enveloping it sentimentally! <br /> <br /> Tender and suspenseful, "Strange Fruit" is an extremely ambitious debut and I hope that writer / director Kyle Schickner will unleash the next thing. His talent and that of his colleagues are worth the detour. <br /> <br /> I hope that "Strange Fruit" will be released soon, but that more people deserve to see this movie, an above-average thriller with insightful distortions about homophobia and racism in the Great South American. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: 7/10
