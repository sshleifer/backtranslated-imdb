The Ten Steps is in principle a pretty good base for a scary short film, but the execution is simply appalling. The dialogue is appalling and acting is one of the kind we see regularly in Irish shorts. Really really embarrassing. The girl must go down the 10 steps of the cellar to change the fuse jumped. She calls her father who invites his boss to dinner. The mother, a "actress" with very questionable acting skills, answers the phone and says loudly not to ring because her father "tries to impress his boss". The actress playing the boss's wife very successfully imitates the poor play of the mother when she tells them that their house is haunted. The rest of the film is the father who brings his daughter to phone the phone. The Ten Steps uses the basic techniques used in camera movements, lighting and music that can be expected in a less than average horror movie. Poor.
