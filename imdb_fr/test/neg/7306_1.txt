It's (stupidly) with a certain taste that I sat down to watch what a friend had promised would be the worst / best cinematic experience of my life, the mighty "Roller Blade 7". 2 years and I am still in therapy. Oh yes, my dear friends, IT'S REALLY BAD. They obviously had about 40 minutes of film in the box then decided to use the film repeatedly and repeatedly for a numbing effect of the brain. My only fear of the kind of post-apocalyptic world presented in this turkey is whether, in a way, a print of this abomination would survive. Really the living would envy the dead.
