I could not spoil that piece of shit if I wanted to. After watching Dark Harvest 1, I thought, "This film was supposed to be the worst film ever made," and then I watched Dark Harvest 2, which made it look better. Then I watched Dark Harvest 3 or tried too. The only thing I have to say is "when will it finish?" Very bad acting and really bad effects, the only good thing about this movie was the filming boob. Do not waste your time on this piece of shit ... And now, I have to write 3 more lines for this to be submitted. I was going to sing a song but I can not think of it for the moment. But the film finally ended (although it had an end that could mean that they will make another one)
