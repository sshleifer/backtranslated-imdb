This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max movie. After seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the excellence of this film, I felt a little disappointed to have seen it. He started as a kind of kid in the Wilderness movie and was merged with the Mad Max franchise (bad idea). The cast was not exactly the best, I mean come on Tina Turner? One of the main problems of this film is that there are no good bad guys. No Wez, no Humungus, not even a decent Toecutter! Nothing really happens, if you plan to see this sub-par action movie (can it even be called that?), Be sure to see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max, or better still both. Another problem with this film is that there are too many people, even the battle sequence of the Thunderdome is boring, Max does not kill anyone! The music is bad, the characters are bad (not in a good way) and after watching this movie, it left a very bad taste in my mouth.
