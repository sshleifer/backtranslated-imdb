It was badly shot. Looks like an urgent job, the last minute casting is obvious. The writing is very weak. Good for the stage, not the movie. I feel bad for Andrew McCarthy. He is a very good actor who did not get good roles recently. This role was not for him. Maybe glad it's picked up. This film must remain on the festival circuit.
