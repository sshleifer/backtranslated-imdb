What a desappointment! Forget this abyssal movie and instead take the TV series. What were they doing in making the American president relatively sane? ALL politicians should have been brazen jesters (Peter Cook is good as British Prime Minister). It lacks the biting satire of the original, instead of slapstick "smaller common denominator". 1 of 10 if I am generous! Unfortunately this is another example of a remake that totally misses the interest of the original, the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people.
