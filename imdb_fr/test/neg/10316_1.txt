I broke my own rule by buying this film in Walmart's $ 5.8 trash bin. Basically, if a movie has a big star and you've never heard of it before, it's usually for a reason. Well, in the case of this movie, the reason is because he sucked! They put the photo and the name of Sandra Bullock on the cover of the DVD as bait, which allowed this little fish to get lost. I thought I would give the disc to a charity or library, but I do not think so. I would like to submit anyone to the world to this film. The worst lines: "What do you mean friends of the army?" "What do you mean by your father?"
