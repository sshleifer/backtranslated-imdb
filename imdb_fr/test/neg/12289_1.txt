If you and your friends find as much humor and fun in the roles of comedians, jokes, props and set of shoots as me and my friends, you must rent one. Seeing how funny it is, you should assume that it's not funny, of poor quality, great hilarious content. This is the story of some children who defy all the laws of physics and reality and fly through time through a modern widescreen TV to a world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends. Not to mention a hilarious and serious scene where T-Rex becomes a father figure for one of the children. Yeah ... <br /> <br /> This should be in the comedy section, but you'll find it in children's movies if you find it. So call your friends, sit back, relax, get ready to laugh and enjoy. You are going to cite ridiculous ridicules in this movie for weeks. "What's going on with all the heckling ?!"
