Now I have seen two films by director Chen Kaige, a very good one (Farewell my concubine) and this bad, The Assassin. Both films describe crucial events in Chinese history, 20th century FMC, and the first unification of the entire Chinese nation in the 3rd century BC. FMC was successful with memorable characters, beautiful cinematography, compelling backgrounds, good acting and an interesting story. The Assassin fails at almost every level (OK, the sets are great, the cinematography is good and the few battle scenes are exciting). But ... the pathos. Call me cynical, but that's too much. If you feel that saving Private Ryan is too pathetic, know that it will make you sick. The dialogue is lifeless, many lines seem to be political, subtle or amusing statements, are not they? The film is dominated by its own pump. I'm really surprised that the Assassin is getting such high votes here on imdb. 4/10
