For starters, it's a scam of the Japanese Battle Royal movie, except for the one thing that made BR unique, bullets. At best, it's a weak satire and, to the extent that it tries to comment on the phenomenon of television, everyone knows how this genre can be distorted and stupid, so why this film was it turned?
