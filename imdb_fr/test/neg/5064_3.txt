I must admit that I chose this film just for the casting and that even though Sutherland, Scacchi and Prochnow were - as usual - excellent performers, the rest of the film was really disappointing. It's as if it was composed by a team of teenagers with low-level scripts, meaning deep-rooted scripts, awful photos and montages, and a hilarious score! I can not believe I was able to watch this seemingly long movie to the end ... which is sad, it could have been a great political thriller given the interesting plot. All the potential was there to make it a success; that is to say that two main ingredients are present: a good story of national conspiracies and an excellent distribution (although many other actors have about the quality of a soap opera). But maybe I'm missing something; until then it's still not worth more than 3 in my opinion.
