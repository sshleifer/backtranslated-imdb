I understood before watching this film that it would be a gore film low budget. But even with these low standards, this film does not cut it. <br /> <br /> The problem is not so much that filmmakers have a small budget or pleasant performers, authors, directors, sound, music and editors. I thought all of this would be bad. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this film is that it did not even do a good job in guts. Most of the "actions" take place on the screen and we only see the side effects, which look very wrong even under the standards of low budget gore movies. <br /> <br /> There is really no excuse for blood being so badly done. At about the same time, Peter Jackson made the "bad taste" in the same budget and was able to show more courage and self-control than the film shows. <br /> <br /> A failure on just about every level, I can not recommend this movie to anyone. Avoid it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
