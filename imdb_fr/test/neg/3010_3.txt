A professional production with quality actors who simply do not touch the heart or the bones fun, no matter the efforts. The quality of the distribution, the quality of the decor and the excellent cinematography make Fargo or High Plains Drifter's hope, but unfortunately, the soup contains neither seasoning nor meat. A 3 (out of 10) for the effort.
