I bought this rental back for $ 1.99 in Hollywood and overpaid. I did not expect much, but I thought it would be a way to fall asleep at least. I quickly noticed the very weak scenario, the blatant overactivity of everyone (no one speaks like that except in cartoons), and the seemingly "make-as-it-ahead" direction. I know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed and I am convinced that it did not help their career. As for this 35-year-old film buff, he now offers a quick answer to the question of the worst movie you've ever seen. <br /> <br />
