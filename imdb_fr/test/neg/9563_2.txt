It goes without saying that a minimum allocation must be made when adapting a true story to the big screen. But if you record a fairy tale that has almost nothing to do with what really happened - why do you call it Bugsy and make the audience believe that this story is half true? The trilogy of the godfather deals with many characters and real events. Once Upon A Time In America does it too, but they do not claim to tell true stories. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> In the film, Benny has this grand vision of the player's Eldorado; in real life, Lansky had to convince him to go to Nevada. Benny considered the idea of ​​a counterpart as an idiot of Monte Carlo, and he would have preferred to continue his playboy life in Latin America. It was not until much later that Benny was enthusiastic about the idea. But of course he is the hero of the movie. It was therefore natural that his idea be his. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Benny wants to use Count DiFrasso to get closer to Mussolini in order to murder him because he was Hitler's partner and Hitler killed Jews in gas chambers, after all. Of course, we're supposed to like Benny, so the writers invented that nonsense. In real life, at the time, nobody knew the gas chambers, let alone Benny, completely indifferent to politics. In fact, he used the Countess's links and went to Mussolini, but not to kill him, but to sell him explosives. He even met Goebbels and Goering during his stay in Italy. <br /> <br /> The whole plot of Greenberg was nonsense. Greenberg did not turn into a pigeon stool, he did not seek refuge with Benny, Benny did not kill him (that's what Albert Tannenbaum had done) ... at least they had had the right name. <br /> <br /> I guess it was supposed to be very romantic to bring Virginia back to Benny, offering her the money she stole. The film even goes so far as to tell us via text panels that it sadly returned the money to Lansky after Benny's assassination. Let me say that revisionism is no more shameless than that. <br /> <br /> This list is by no means exhaustive - there is a problem with Benny's family who does not live in Los Angeles, the way Benny deals with Dragna and Adonis, the Costello performance ( an unpleasant type of business), Lansky (an adorable teddy bear), Benny himself (an aging wind bag that would not have reached the age of 12 if he had been regularly "bugsy" in situations like that of the film and moreover, which has neither the beauty nor the charisma of Benny Siegel) and many others. Apart from some concrete facts, nothing is accurate in this film. <br /> <br /> * END OF SPOILERS HERE * <br /> <br /> In short, it is the mafia film that manages to be even more ridiculous bad than Harlem, NY. But honor where honor is due: it's a feat in itself.
