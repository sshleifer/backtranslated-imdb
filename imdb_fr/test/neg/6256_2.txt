Originally harped as a sequel to the series "The Slumber Party Massacre", this film falls flat with its new title. First of all, if you want to include the word "massacre" in the title of your movie, you'd better deliver. This one certainly does not do it. There is no murder, no murder on the screen and no chain saw, as the art of boxing would have it. Instead, we get a very thin and excessive conspiracy on a group of cheerleaders who find themselves stuck in an abandoned shack before going to a football match, then cut one by one. Again, this movie could have been OK if the gore quotient had been slightly increased. Why do directors, especially those who shoot live, are afraid to show ALL gore, it's beyond me. Now, I'm not a big fan of excessive gore, but go ... why would anyone want to rent a movie called "Cheerleader Massacre ??" In addition to this problem, the film suffers from a good shooting market on a home video camera. It sounds cheap, it sounds cheap, and the actors are not that good. He tries to make us lose control of the murderer, but even that fails. The end ends up being a ridiculous mess. Dear friends, if you come across this film, go away and go in search of the "Massacre of the night of sleep". 2 out of 10
