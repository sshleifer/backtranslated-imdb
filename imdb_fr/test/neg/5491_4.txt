This is partly the bad luck for "Illuminata" to appear after "Shakespeare in Love" because it deals with practically the same themes of life as art, art as life and the magic of theater and the same Foibles archetypes of Folk Theater, but much more heavily. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that come alive, as a piece develops and reinterprets in the life of a writer, but there is a lot of ego Orson Welles-ish in this produced by / directed by / actor played by John Torturro as a vehicle for his wife Katharine Borowitz (with an adorable cameo from their son). <br /> <br /> Every actor gets their moment literally in the spotlight, but there are so many "masks" or plays that look like nineteenth century board games. Bill Irwin interviews. Susan Sarandon becomes a diva. Christopher Walken becomes a mean guy - a gay critic. Women must undress unnecessarily because it is an artistic film. <br /> <br /> The art and the staging are wonderful, although very dark. This should be rewarded as the best use of a Jersey City theater as a movie set. (originally written on 21/08/99)
