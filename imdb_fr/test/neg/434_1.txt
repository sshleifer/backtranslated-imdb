One of the two movies I actually thought about asking for money to stay up late. Most movies have at least one thing for which it's worth staying, even if it's just to laugh at the seriousness of the situation. I never found it for this movie. Nothing was good, from the worst-case scenario. The worst movie I have ever seen.
