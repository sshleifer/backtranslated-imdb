I had to write a review for this movie after seeing it last night and reading some of the comments from people trying to categorize the discontent of this movie in wfmitchell's message)). I do not fit any of these rankings. The other classification that must be on the list is 5) people did not like this movie because it was not good. I found the movie booring and forced. My wife chose her because she is a big fan of Kidman and she also loves Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Law, it took a lot of time and a huge suspension of beliefs for me believe her southern accent. I can not help but wonder if they have deliberately made his character less talkative so as not to have to hear that same tortured accent. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it took a long time for it to become interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), then falls flat in its end. What was interesting was that I did not know that this film was directed by Minghella. About 40 minutes after the movie started, I asked my wife, "It's not going to be another English Patient, is it?" It was absolutely <br /> <br /> Regarding the battle scenes. I'm trying to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene, but I think the most descriptive word that accurately describes it is simply "stupid". It was forced, it was amazing, it was stupid and it was stupid. (After the battle, I looked at my wife and asked her "was she just stupid?", And she vigorously tilted her head). <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie was Zellweger's performance. The role was a little over and looked like any decent comedy relief role, but it worked. From his speech model, his walk, his manners and esp. his little jeers (my favorite: "If you want to be three feet high in the ass of a bull, you just have to listen to the loves talk to each other"), she was able to create a character that looks like a cartoon and who did his job. extremely well. <br /> <br /> I just did not like this film and I wonder about the kind of people who say they like it (or the English Patient, in this case). I think you could put them in a category: 1) Soap opera fans
