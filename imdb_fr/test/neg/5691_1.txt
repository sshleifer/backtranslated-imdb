In a world where humans can live forever, you spend the entire movie wanting to die. First of all, if you insist on watching this movie do two things first put it on the mute, do not worry, you miss a plot, damn it, they do not even speak during the first 70 minutes of a 87 min movie, after you have muted You must now press the front button until the main chick dies do not worry, even if you pay attention, you will not know why or how she died . Once you get to the "good game", take it muted. Oh, how will you know the good side, wait for a lift scene with two idiots in space suit with weapons from the Second World War. These weapons will not seem much until you realize that the first protagonist had a laser gun and a bandolier of CO2 cartridges. The only remnants of a plot are between a glowing ball and a half-hot girl who appears to have been attacked by Wolverine. After listening to the "plot", you will want them to come back to not talking. Of the four people present in this film, none of them can act at a distance, not even a little bit, you will have more chance to attend the theater in a kindergarten theater. <br /> <br /> To comment on the special effects special, let me just say "Wow", no, really, you'll spend the whole movie saying to yourself: "Where did the budget of 1.8 million dollars from this movie! " Seriously, this will leave you with the magnitude of ineptitude. The best "sets" are basically Windows wallpaper backgrounds. Ships fly mostly with keys. Expect, there are barges that look a bit like whales. I have never heard so many invented words in my life. They have wrist buttons (big pedometers) that can put them in "fight mode" and super race mode (makes them super blurred). This will seriously deplete their energy reserves, but they will find bits of chewables to regain strength. The explosions were less impressive than the 4th of July, I only had sparks. <br /> <br /> The plot, if I am not mistaken, looks like this "mother" is a spaceship captain and goes out into the desert for a while riding a rocket dies. Then his daughter, 6000 years in the future (no, I do not exaggerate), recalls the memories of his mother through a kind of capsule. Anyway, they chat for another 10 minutes, then the cause is a big bang. Yes, the same "Big Bang" that launched our solar system. It's explained how it goes back in time or something like that, no matter what happened, I guess. Generating Credits Seriously, the entire script was mercifully on a single sheet of paper, unless it described in detail one of the scenes of atrocious combat. <br /> <br /> After watching the credits, I laughed more than the whole movie, the movie Jobs created as supervisor of the restoration "galactius sarcophagus", then the special thanks to George Lucas were simply the best. <br /> <br /> I really did not expect so much for a movie for which I paid 99 cents, but seriously. the body owes it to me. The comment most often heard after the movie "I want my life". You have to admire some but put time and effort in this movie but seriously, why?
