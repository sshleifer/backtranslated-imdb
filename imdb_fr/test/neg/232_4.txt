I can not emphasize it too much, do NOT make this movie for kids. <br /> <br /> In the same vein, you'd better save adults too. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe I'm a little overstimulated. This is not the worst movie for kids ... no, let me rephrase that. This is not the worst film made by adults dissolved for adults dissolved and marketed in one way or another with children (it would be "Jack", that I wanted to read / that I wanted to revisit like a fish ). <br /> <br /> Adults will not learn anything astonishing (well, if need be, just before the end credits of an educational credit devoted to an interesting cosmic phenomenon). In general, we do not do as adults what we wanted to do as children, because reality tends to hinder. Well, uh, I could have told you that (it's the same for four years of college in an art school, but I'm wasting my time). <br /> <br /> I have no idea what children might get out of this movie. . Most likely, it will only annoy them (we observe the moment when Russ was traumatized at the age of eight). There is a better movie, "Kiki's Delivery Service", which basically contains the same message, but treats it nicely instead of punching it in the head. And adults will love too! <br /> <br /> By the way, there's a moment in the movie directed with MST3K-ers fans in mind, if they think about the other Bruce Willis movie with a sad little boy in it .
