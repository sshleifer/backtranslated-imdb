An American family settles in the countryside in Spain to live in an isolated house. Regina (Anna Paquin), Mark's teenage daughter (Iain Glen), ill and mentally ill, and nurse Maria (Lena Olin) note that strange things are happening at home and with her younger brother Paul (Stephan Enquist), but his mother does not believe in her. Reggie decides to investigate with his boyfriend Carlos (Fele Martínez) about the origins of the house and discovers that forty years ago, the place was the scene of the death of six children. Reggie decides to ask his grandfather Albert (Giancarlo Giannini) for help to protect his brother from the house and his father. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD in the hope of seeing a good horror movie about a haunted house, mainly because of Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Fele Martinez (from "Thesis" and " Abre los Ojos ") and Giancarlo Giannini. Moreover, I really like Spanish cinema. Despite this, I found a terrible scenario, a terrible direction and a deplorable actor set of excellent actors and actresses. The intention of the story is good, reminiscent of "The Shinning" at times, but unfortunately it is poorly developed, never specifying, for example, the reasons why the American family moved to Spain or the horrible relationships that unite them. of the family, mainly the situation between Maria and Reggie. The direction is confused, trying poorly to use darkness and shadows to give scary effects to the story. I love Anna Paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this movie. Lena Olin is a caricature of the great actress she is; and Stephan Enquist is too weak for such an important role. Only Fele Martínez has a good performance in her supporting character. I liked the open end of the story. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "To Sétima Vítima" ("The seventh victim")
