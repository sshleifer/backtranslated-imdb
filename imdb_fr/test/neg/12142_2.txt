"The Final Comedown" wants to "say something" about racism and violence in underprivileged neighborhoods; unfortunately, the message is invalidated by the insane script, the amateur production and the polemics to the heavy. How much heavy hand you ask? To give you one example, a black doctor comes out of hiding, unarmed, hands up, ready to go to the police: one of the cops (all white) says: "Do not shoot him "It's a doctor," answered another cop, "So, he's still a *****," and shoots him in cold blood. The cops are described as ignorant and racist killers, although in the end there are as many dead among them as among the blacks who organized the riot. And all this event was in a way to "sensitize" whites to the degrading treatment of blacks, when in fact, such a thing can only engender more hatred and violence on both sides. Pamela Jones, as a girlfriend of Williams, briefly illuminates the screen of his smile and his body, especially in a scene of soft sex, and raises the ranking of this film from 1 to 2 out of 10.
