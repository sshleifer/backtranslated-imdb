First of all, I'm a big fan of Robert Blake and I've always been. <br /> <br /> This film arrived at Movieplex last night, the 13/10, and the title interested me and of course, the star. But after looking at it, I was more confused than before the beginning ... There are good scenes, and I thought they would lead somewhere, but that was not the case, it was turned out to be an "anti-cop" "anti-boyfriend" "anti-hippie", more or less "anti-all" movie, with an extremely confusing plot that did not succeed either. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake is awesome as a leader, as well as awesome Someone could be with this bad movie, I'm still a big fan of Mr. Blake and I love the fact that he plays even in a shit like this ... But this drug caused guts of the 70s, and well ... better stay away from it ... And this end, what piss.
