What can I say about this movie, it's really one of the worst gays-themed movies ever released in the UK. I can only imagine that Diana Quick and Georgina Hale needed this money. The story is so disastrous that you quickly lose interest. It is supposed to be based on real events. Well, all I can say to that is that it's an insult to real life characters. The DVD is out right now in the UK. It is available in split-screen format, which should further aggravate the full-screen version that I am looking at. Gay cinema can be much better than that, and we deserve more.
