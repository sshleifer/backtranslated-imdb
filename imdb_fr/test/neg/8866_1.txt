I never understood this type of parody movies. You get a serious / semi-serious movie that everyone knows and takes you seriously through immature jokes about the world. We have seen it many times and it has never been really funny. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you do not understand, in my opinion. This seems to be one of the darkest and least popular genres of the genre, though, honestly, I do not see anything much worse than Spy Hard or Hot Shots. This film, as the title makes clear, focuses on the puerile fun of Pulp Fiction. This is the main reason why I decided to watch it, because I found this film too indulgent for the sick mind of Tarantino and powerfully overestimated. I had hoped for one or two good jokes by making fun of the type of excessively violent and unnecessary film that Pulp Fiction represented in all its aspects, in my humble opinion (anything but humble). I was deeply disappointed. The plot is somehow a scam of the film Tarantino, with some scenes imitating other films, often of better quality, in the same childish way and without humor. The cadence is mediocre and you will often sit there to be able to guess the outcome of each scene, to predict each joke, to think of a better joke instead, bored by your mind. The acting is bad. The characters are clich√©s and stereotypes, and are purposefully thin in order to make fun of the characters on which they are based ... the problem is that it does not work. This makes the movie a lot harder to get through. The humor is juvenile and lame. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that they managed to find actors who looked like the ones they were supposed to look like. The film is a terrible waste of the real actors involved. Perhaps slightly entertaining for fans of typical parody movies of the same genre. I recommend it only to people who have really hated Pulp Fiction or fans of Zucker's parody movies. Everyone: avoid. 1/10
