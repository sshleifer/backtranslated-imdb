I am speechless. Matty Simmons managed to do something that I thought impossible. He made "The Harlem Globetrotters of Gilligan's Island" look like "Citizen Kane". Painful can not even begin to describe this piece of ... I do not know. Note that the premise seemed funny, but now that I've seen it, it's funny to think that letting go of an anvil on your scrotum is fun. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to describe this premise, as the title says it all, if only to say that I do not think there was literally a fun thing in this movie, not one, not even the monkey bite. How can one of the funniest characters in the "Vacation" franchise, the sordid white trash Eddie (Randy Quaid), be made so horribly insane? I have never felt so much sympathy for an actor of my life. I also pity the other actors involved in this "comical" atrocity, Miriam Flynn (Catherine, Eddie's long suffering, but in the sun), Dana Barron (the first Audrey Griswold), Fred Willard and the magnificent Sung Hi Lee (Perhaps the only reason to watch the movie, if only the sound was off), except for this old Commie, Ed Asner (Uncle Nick), he had planned. Alas, the public does not have. I'm just saying "thank God" that Chevy Chase, who has been in a doldrums for years, has avoided this splash of diarrhea, it's the smartest career choice he's ever made. <br /> <br /> I do not know if You are religious like me, but I know that I will pray the Lord tonight to add 2 hours (if not 2 years) to my life to make up for the time that I have passed in front of the television. never come back otherwise. <br /> <br /> Burn hot water: ZERO baby on 10 stars (If you take a few strokes of the bong AND drink water, maybe 1 / 10th of a star out of 10)
