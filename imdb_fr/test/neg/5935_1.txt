A few months ago I read the Left Behind series for the first time and took a note to check it because I have an interest in how religion is used to control people in our world of more and more hateful, so imagine my surprise and joy when I found a copy of Left Behind: World at War in my local library, nested innocently among the big-budget action movies. <br /> <br /> Now, as a film, he is extremely poor. The acting game is straight out of a primary school production and the "special effects" would have seemed dated from the early 90's. As a third part of a series, the story would be incomprehensible to anyone who had never seen or read about other Left Behind movies, and even to my knowledge, it was still laughable. <br /> <br /> Before religious, I do not think that someone who was not already filled with the spirit of the Lord finds something in the film to convince them to change their habits. How do you fear the Antichrist while he has a Russian accent in comedy and that the worst of his powers is a pitiful synthetic picture? <br /> <br /> However, my main problem with this movie is the blatant attempt to trick people into thinking it's a big-budget action movie. While picking up the box and reading the text, I immediately noticed something strange ... nowhere on the packaging was the true nature of this film. For someone who does not know, it would seem that Left Behind: World at War is no different than the last Tom Clancey. On the copy I rented, nothing says either that it is the third issue of a series. <br /> <br /> Given the basic principle of the series is that the Antichrist has deceived the whole world, I find it extremely hypocritical that the filmmakers have tried to deceive me TWICE before I even can not counter it! If your beliefs are so firm, then why not be honest? <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that it was not a "Christian" film with the built-in fan base that goes with it, I seriously doubt that it would ever have happened. If Cloud Ten hoped to see my mistakes and give me to God, I'm afraid to say that I would have died of boredom and / or made fun of laughing before I had the chance.
