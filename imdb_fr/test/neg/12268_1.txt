This film belongs to the editing room. On the one hand, the opening sequence does not highlight the topic element related to the "gang". If it was not supposed to do it, then at least they understood that part. Secondly ... with all the look left then right ??? they do it even in a synchronous style. Nowhere did I see a member of a rival crew head to a bar, look for someone from the outside, as if it were all that and a bag of fries at a barbie and walk away without even be confronted, without having anything to ask. . I wasted money on the rental price and I'm glad I did not buy the DVD itself. <br /> <br /> If this was done by college students (T.A.F.E), they at least gave the old Australian essay. More luck next time.
