For the Mongolian speakers, the film lacked emotion and emphasis. Used too many non-indigenous speakers, especially the Jamukha. Too many diversions of the current history. Terrible terrible subtitle !!! I wonder where and who did this subtitle. It was both English and Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitle was in Thai if the English subtitle was too bad! Describes that of the life of the greatest leader very uninteresting. There are better films made by Mongolian directors with a very low budget from the 1980s. Honestly, I wonder if Academy Award film critics are indulgent or what? Only good thing, some correct CGI in some fight scenes are only moderately ... not excessive CGI
