Given the addiction, Down to the Bone can not help but be a rather depressing movie. But depressing does not have to mean bad. Unfortunately, in this case, the situation is rather bad. The film has good things, including Vera Farmiga's quality performance in the central role of Irene, a working mother struggling with cocaine addiction. But there is not enough good here to compensate for the harm. The failures of the film are mainly due to the story, which fails to captivate and never really seems to start. Irene goes to rehab and returns home with a helpless husband who has no idea how to support her. Irene is approaching another recovering addict, a nurse at her rehabilitation center. Complications ensue. But history never really gives life to sparks. It does not seem like the movie goes anywhere. You can say that this is a realistic and realistic look at the daily difficulties of an addict. Maybe, but in this case, the movie is not interesting. The whole thing has a very "blah" feeling. Minimalist cinematography does not help things, adding a layer of dullness to the incredibly dull procedure. And none of the other performances compare to Farmiga. Hugh Dillon agrees as Irene's nurse friend, but no one else in the distribution adds anything valuable to the proceedings. Overall, this film is a dark, depressing and rather boring journey.
