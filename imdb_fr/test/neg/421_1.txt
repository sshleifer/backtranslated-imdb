It's hard to imagine how Dan Brown's captivating novel, "Angels and Demons," could escape as badly as this version of the movie. Here are ten reasons why the movie was a failure. Because of the spoilers, please do not read if you have not already seen the movie. <br /> <br /> (1) In the film, there was no romance between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Even worse, there was not even chemistry between the two main players. <br /> <br /> (2) The breathtaking places in Rome, as described in the novel, were not visually realized in the film. I am aware that director Ron Howard had trouble filming on the spot. But there are photographic representations of Rome of superior quality on The History Channel than in this film where the Eternal City was presented in eternal archive footage. The great works of art described in the novel were only briefly described in the film. Bernini's magnificent sculpture representing "the ecstasy of St. Teresa" was only momentarily seen, and the western relief of Ponente on the Vatican Square was not visible at all. <br /> <br /> (3) The filmmaker's most insipid choice was in the representation of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved John Paul II. In the novel, the pope is clearly a fiction without resemblance to any real pope. <br /> <br /> (4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters in the novel, Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN, was cut out of the screenplay. <br /> <br /> (5) There were many cases where the lines of dialogue were inaudible due to unnecessary background noise. <br /> <br /> (6) There were times when the faces of the characters were not visible because of the shadows and lighting of the chiaroscuro movie. This technique worked in the films "The Godfather", but Ron Howard is not Gordon Willis. <br /> <br /> (7) The College of Cardinals was a motley group, one of the electors speaking in a southern voice. This guy would have been more comfortable on a ranch in Texas than in the Sistine Chapel. <br /> <br /> (8) The crucial relationship between the Camerlengo and the deceased Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was at the center of the theme of science versus religion and the relevance of the Illuminati for conspiracy against the church. <br /> <br /> (9) In the novel, the character of Hassassin was an unforgettable villain. In the film, the role of this assassin was a nasty cardboard cutter. <br /> <br /> (10) Overall, the filmmakers did not trust the success of the novel. <br /> <br /> In the novel, Langdon makes an impossible fall from heaven to another. the Tiber. In Ron Howard's film, the film itself landed in the Tiber River.
