"Revenge of the Zombies" is a zombie effort quite weak and difficult to pass. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling in the Bayou, Larry Adams (Robert Lowery) and Scott Warrington (Mauritz Hugo) are informed that a friend has died. While meeting Dr. Von Altermann, John Carradine, he repeats the idea that they died mysteriously. During their stay, they realize that the help consists of zombies, dead revived people who obey the orders of their master. As the bodies pile up, he reveals that he has made these creatures for use in various experiments and that he is all trying to stop it before it's too late. <br /> <br /> The good news: It has very little place. The opening is easy, it's better because it has several good grades. From where it begins, with the scary figures walking in the dark until the revelations, this one works wonders for both its mystery and its great imagery. The biggest is a scene where the creature emerges from a coffin in a long slow and scary plan. These are all done before the opening credits and are fun to watch. The scenes in the middle where the creature wakes up inside the coffin are rather scary and are really beautiful. The last big plus point is the really fun ending. With a kind of end that reminds many of Universal's attempts, it fits perfectly in this style. From the frightening resuscitation to the real action involved near the swamp, this one is fun and really works with others to give really positive results. <br /> <br /> The bad news: it has only a few flaws. but they are major. The first is the major boredom of the film due to inactivity. Almost nothing happens here, mainly because of the tendency to do everything with the word rather than anything else. There are only intermittent scenes relegated to zombies, yet nothing here devotes action to the film. This one just does not have any action, and that's what hurts the movie. This rarely generates scenes that keep the interest, and sometimes it feels much longer than it really is. The last flaw in the movie is his pathetic apology for the zombies. Those who are used to more modern dishes will find it difficult to dispel the fear of these creatures and actually only serve several scenes. This does not treat zombies as threats, which makes them even less scary. The short time spent in front of a screen, a non-threatening nature and a little modern behavior on the part of these zombies really destroy this one. That's what really hurts the film. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: with bad zombies and almost nothing to watch, this one is a curious effort. Regulars of modern zombies will find little interest in it and will come out as before, while only classic horror lovers are invited to try their luck. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating-PG: Mild Violence
