I can only guess that this movie was a bad experience. Years ago, it would have been moving images accompanied by music. Later, it would have been added to the sound. Finally, it would have been Technicolor, Cinemascope or Imax. This film must be a misguided attempt to introduce a new element into the speaking image. During all emotional scenes, the character stops in the middle of a dialogue and his inner thoughts are told as he looks away or uses the camera. This interruption is painful at least. Imagine these leading actors trying to look busy while the story continues. Painful. I have no idea who invented this gadget, but it's the only time I've seen it used - and for good reason. In each scene, the actors were forced to roll their eyes, wring their hands or let themselves go to such a point that I actually wondered if it was really a comedy. <br /> <br /> The story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over several generations. Norma Shearer, disappointed by love, seeks a reason to live. She has a friend, played by Ralph Morgan, who loves her, but she takes it for granted. She is attracted to a doctor, played by Clark Gable, but he is absorbed by himself and is not interested in her. She is content with a weak who desperately needs her. She marries him only to find that there is madness in her family and that she can never have children with him. Then comes the doctor who selfishly puts a bun in his oven, to discover later that he loves it after all. The child builds confidence in her husband that becomes a success, but she realizes that it's really Clark she loves after all. Still confused? Forget the rest, watch some episodes of "As the World Turns" and everything will become clear. <br /> <br /> If you have to watch this movie, wait for the final scene. The gyrations of the actors shame Harold LLoyd. This is not to be missed.
