Doggerel ridiculous and nauseating with a terrible game; unnecessarily, superficially and condescendingly, all the most banal clich√©s about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and quarantine. The lead actor grimaces nervously in the film, striving to portray the appropriate level of self-congratulatory self-congratulation that the character and the worthless scenario call. I'm sure the book was bad, but it could not be so bad! The camera is permanently equipped with a yellow "Tuscan" lens filter vomited (perhaps the Tuscan sun was not enough Tuscan?), They forgot to remove when the scene moves to Rome and ( what imagination) of the Amalfi Coast. You have never seen the white marble of the Vittorio Emmanuelle monument in Rome as yellow ... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies of all time and deserves a visit.
