A Chinese gang attacks and eliminates another gang at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is killed in the process. Strangely, and for no discernible reason, the gang is soliciting a volunteer to blame the massacre and he goes away until the police decide to stop investigating. Now, I do not know how ONE SINGLE MAN is responsible for the fifty dead. It was ridiculous to dismiss him. But that's the plot. Later, when this man returned home, betrayals and shenanigans took place - resulting in almost an hour and fifteen minutes of killing without stopping. <br /> <br /> A plot, then you should probably skip this movie, as its action is virtually continuous and virtually no development of the plot or character - even compared to other martial arts movies. I would estimate that 80 to 90% of the film is a fight scene - endless fighting scenes and reasonably well done with knives. Again and again and again, fight scenes! If you want a movie with a countdown in numbers perhaps reaching hundreds while people are being cut, kicking and cutting, then this movie is for you. The problem was that at the end of the film, there was literally no one left to kill and the movie really lost my interest !! In depth, this is not the case, but if you want to see excitement and action ONLY, then this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie takes place in contemporary times and no one dreams of turning the hero before the end. And, when they end up doing the logical thing, it's too late and the effort is really, really bad! Logical errors like this and the woman's suicide (why ???) make it a type of movie "extinguish your brain".
