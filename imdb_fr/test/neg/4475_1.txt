It was one of the worst films I can remember. I'm sure I've seen worse, though, if it does not hurt to slam it. <br /> <br /> Humor is not funny, there are stupid stereotypical jokes that, again, are not. I was a captive audience on a plane and watched that movie. It was a total loss of time. I enjoyed Martin in previous movies, but not this one. Same thing for Queen Latifah, she was excellent in Chicago and in Set it Off, she was good too, but that role was horrible. <br /> <br /> I think the failure is due to the bad writing of the script. I firmly believe that you can not save an idyllic scenario with honest actors, this film is an example. Nevertheless, everyone involved should have been wise enough not to participate in this film. I'm just surprised that something so serious can be approved, created, aired and promoted.
