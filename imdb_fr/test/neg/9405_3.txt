I just watched 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much that I went to see her at the opening weekend, which I never do. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it go crazy. I really think the problem with the movie was staging and Matthew McConaughey. First of all, I'm not an enemy of MM, I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in these films without having to see him with his shirt 3-4 times. Yes, we all understand that he is a handsome guy with a beautiful body, but I think most people knew it 10 years ago when he appeared on A Time to Kill. Showing it with his shirt by pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3 to 4 times in the film is totally useless. I think once would have been enough. It would not surprise me that they throw these useless scenes into friends and wives who would be willing to accompany them with their loved ones, no woman wants to see a movie about the sports game, unless ...... Enough on this subject, let's get into his role. I think his game was very forced and he did not seem very comfortable. I know that his character was supposed to be this charming southerner, but his lines were old and old. It was almost as if he was making references to Days and Confused a few times! In short, I did not like his character when I was supposed to do it. The accent, his shirt removed, the picky pickup lines, weak sales. His character was simply a tool, like Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but it's not a surprise. Piven is fun to watch as Arie .... oooops I mean Jerry. I think this movie was very commercial and badly organized. It's insulting that they can take a good story and add crappy ingredients to make it a box office hit. 1. A cool story that pleases the boy 2. Hollywood hunky actor for women (make sure he has many scenes with a shirt lifting weights) 3. Al Pacino with 4 stunning speech scenes and 25 super liners 3. Each character 4. Jeremy Piven will play the same character as in Entourage and Old School 4. Jette Armand Assante to seal the case 5. Plot, good writing, character development, and intelligent casting are useless <br /> <br /> It will be good enough for most people, but not me! Anyone who does not agree with me, asks the following question. This film would be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM <br /> <br /> I will probably be part of the minority thinking that this film is zero. I realized this when the woman next to me started to cry during the ridiculous end scene, where Pacino was giving a false tear to kissing Russo. The financial success of this film will ensure one thing. The film that becomes public gets what the film wants, crapola big budget.
