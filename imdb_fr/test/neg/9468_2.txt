Some clarifying comments are in order. Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed to a brief introduction to the video version of DOCTOR GORE (aka THE BODY SHOP), in which he spoke about his collaborative efforts with DOCTOR GORE's "Pat" Patterson, director and star. Patterson concocted the "gore effects" for THE GRUESOME TWOSOME and some other Lewis films in the late 1960s. Lewis notes that while 2,000 MANIACS was a "five-gallon" movie (referring to the amount of blood on scene needed), Lewis-Patterson's productions were "fifteen-gallon" images. Lewis does not describe DOCTOR GORE as a "fifteen-gallon" movie - he only talks about the films he made together. Lewis told (elsewhere) that his introduction to DOCTOR GORE had been improvised even before he saw Patterson's movie! So take it with a grain of salt. <br /> <br /> This can be an "unfinished" film, but like some unfinished novels, it has an "end". It just lacks some connective tissue. <br /> <br /> Patterson has a well-defined presence on the stage and a dry sense of humor, helping to make this simplistic show a little more watchable than it should be. There is an extremely sparse plot - even BLOOD FEAST is more complex - and an extremely repetitive musical score by William Girdler. A little nudity and a lot of skin. The whole central part of the film involves the construction of a "perfect woman"; it's concentrated gore for bloodthirsty and laughable. <br /> <br /> Patterson's director is over his head, but he strives to tell his story creatively, if it's possible to use Frankenstein's clich√©s creatively. But the best reason to see this movie (on Something Weird's DVD, if possible) is that it contains a perfect Nashville wailer, "A heart dies by the minute" Bill Hicks. Is not this the truth!
