The word "boring" is too often used to indicate how much a low-budget horror movie may or may not be. I have seen a lot of B movies. A lot of B movies are horrible and terribly incompetent. Some with a production value of a few hundred dollars. Does inefficiency, unhealthy play, the worst continuity and annoying budgets make an unassailable film? Some would definitely like yes. Most of them are probably big fans of The Matrix. Well, I hate big budget movies, so I say no. Bad can sometimes be funny (Blood Freak), sometimes even mind-blowing (Troll 2), but Boring will always be unassailable ... Hey, kind of like Bloodthirsty Butchers, which reminds me, I write a review for this pile of garbage. .. Uh, yeah, anyway. This is one of the many alternatives to the sleeping pills of British director Andy Milligan. This one is based on Sweeney Todd ... Great. Milligan takes a boring story and still manages to "butcher" it. Hey, it's pretty funny, I said drunk ... sorry, I keep being distracted. It's not really easy. On reflection, I will make things easy. No gore, no fright, no entertainment, just annoying and annoying people who have incoherent conversations. it's bloodthirsty butchers. Oh yes, and something about a barber killing people, and something about meat pies. I do not know, it's not important. <br /> <br /> For something a little more rewarding, Andy Milligan, there's always the only other I've seen, The rats come, The werewolves are here. Yes, you heard me. But how can we forget this Milligan man all together and find something sweet like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes To Camp? Whatever you decide, know that Bloodthirsty Butchers is nil, maybe even more than any other version of this already dull tale. And that, the fans of movie B, really says something. 2/10
