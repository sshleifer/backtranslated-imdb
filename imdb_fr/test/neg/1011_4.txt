"Death Wish 3" is the equivalent of a shooting gallery. All characters (with the exception of Paul Kersey of Bronson, of course) only exist to be killed, either as "provocation" (the good ones) or in "retaliation" (the bad guys). The director is just pouring on senseless violence (people are even burned alive and exploded), turning it into an urban version of "Commando" (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely cares to protect himself from enemy gunfire ). The fans of this short film (and, apparently, there are many) will benefit, others ... beware. (* 1/2)
