For all her wonderful images, for all her good intentions, it turns out to be a new disgusting propaganda, too glorious and too glorious, that makes personal promotion. <br /> <br /> The message is simple: "All Japanese The fights on the Kokoda track were sadistic and malicious sticks that loved to empty all the last Australian soldiers by cutting their throats before beheading them." No only Kokoda discovers the only defect of "Gallipoli" (the fact that the enemy is faceless, nameless and seemingly inhuman), but manages to prove the opposite of Weir's masterpiece. Instead of giving us a perfect movie with a flaw, we have a horrible mess with a redeeming feature. <br /> <br /> Let's start with this: we are, without any comfortable adaptation to the characters, introduced to them apparently very casual, people in two dimensions with whom we have never ... sympathized. We are so far away that even though we could relate so easily to the characters, they find a way to keep us at a distance. It's a disgusting feature because it moves us away from the plot, helps the horrible workout to leave us a lasting impression and makes it much easier to see the contrast between an openly sentimental ending and a lazy body film. <br /> <br /> In other words, it takes us on a painful journey (not just for us, but apparently for them) and, as it should, it ends us, we are thrown into another Skirmish roll that ends faster than it started. So, for people STILL still uninformed: when it should finish, it starts again, finally when we expect more. S ***! It's a confusing and heartbreaking rhythm! <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the ultimatum: it is intended to inform us about the events of the Kokoda track. It does not come close. Not only does he detail a very small, insignificant part of the campaign (adding a little "camaraderie" to make it relevant), but he manages to do the only thing such an important film should be, Honestly, my eyes have been glued to my watch all the time. The spectators around me, all proudly Australian, were arguing about the quality of the movie, moaning, groaning and moaning with disappointment when each of the painful 90 minutes passed (for a short time), it looked like Apocalypse Now: the difference being Apocalypse Now was a good movie and deserved the three hours it was left) and to the point that suicide could definitely become an alternative if watching this movie was mandatory. <br /> <br /> Even if, considering the number of advertisements of the television on this bin, I would say that it is obligatory, in the subliminal sense of the term. <br /> <br /> Look if you like beautiful pictures. Anyway, you'd better watch The Constant Gardener or Gallipoli, because they have a superior cinematography and ACTUAL tracks. <br /> <br /> Overall: *
