Hi, this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The day I watched this movie, I had a high fever. But I still watched the movie with a lot of patience. And after watching the movie, I felt like repenting. Because I lost 3 hours for this stupid film. I could have rested rather than watching this movie. And I was really surprised to see how actors like Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab, etc. have played in this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand if filmmakers do not find a good story to make a movie, so why do they stay as directors? Why can not they stay home and spend their time at home? <br /> <br /> I ask all directors to tell them that it would be good if they ask for hearings, whether by mail or by media, newspapers, radios, etc. - to send them a beautiful story if they do not do it. find a good story to make a movie. I ask all directors again not to make such films.
