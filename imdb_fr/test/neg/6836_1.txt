It's hard to miss this story. GREAT book / GOOD Version of the film by Fred Zinneman, but this movie is AWFUL! First the casting was terrible. Richard Gere should have played the Jackal himself because Edward Fox was a similar type of numbers and they did not need to play with the original script by adding so much worthless (expensive) duvet. This film reminded me of so many Bruce Willis movies, which you see as a huge expense with NOTHING cinematic to show for that. (This is his "conspiracy theory") It takes reality to make such a bad movie from such an original scenario. ALL PEOPLE Michael Caton Jones should be banned from making movies for 10 years; Such is the insult that this film is to real filmmakers. If Hollywood were going to trial for having no idea what he was doing, this movie would be Exhibit A. Shame on you all!
