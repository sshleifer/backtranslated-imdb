Flipping through the TV and seeing that The Secret Life of was on; gave George Duran the shot of being the host. I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that no one could be so energetic, but George was very boring. He really did not seem to want to host. his voice-over was monotonous, did not mingle with guests. He looked like he was interviewing guests for Unwrapped, and he was right in the loop. I do not know if George will "better" organize this show, I doubt it because he has already hosted his own show. The show seemed to pack more information, but only because we saw less of the host. The formula of this show was very delicate and I fear that it is definitely disturbed.
