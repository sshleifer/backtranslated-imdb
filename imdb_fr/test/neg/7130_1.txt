This "remake" is a complete shame: so mediocre, cheap and prosaic, it deserves no more than a few nasty sentences. <br /> <br /> It is also a fraud, with a laughable script served by such and amateur "acting", you are always aware that there is a decor, a camera, a fake, no direction , no suspended reality to allow you to dive into the story. <br /> <br /> The stifling and claustrophobic tension of small spaces and the pieces of the Japanese masterpieces of origin (Ju-On 1 & 2) are almost lost here in decorations and overflowing spaces. <br /> <br /> But even worse, the moral enormity and the unbearable suffering that both have given a ruthless logic to the original mother and child victims have become vindictive and vindictive ghosts, they are completely ruined by a Absolute absurdity and boogie-man style hollow alarms. <br /> <br /> If the American public refuses to read the subtitles and you rise above the lowest common denominator, preferring to swallow this kind of crap ully deserves this pathetic curse: the film itself.
