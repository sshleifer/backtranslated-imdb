Contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> British director J. Lee Thompson has produced some great films, including "Ice Cold in Alex" and "Cape Fear", but "Country Dance" is one of his most curious proposals. The story takes place in the upper classes of rural Scotland and details the strange triangular relationship between Sir Charles Ferguson, an eccentric aristocratic landowner, his sister Hilary, and his ex-husband, Douglas, Douglas, who hopes for a reconciliation with her. We learn that during his career as an army officer, Charles was considered to have a "weak moral fiber". This seems to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition; Throughout the film, he displays a gloomy disillusionment with the world and his main sources of emotional support seem to be Hilary and his bottle of whiskey. The film ends with his imprisonment in an insane asylum of the upper class. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole was, when he was at his best as in "Lawrence of Arabia", one of the main actors in Britain, but the quality of his work was very uneven, and "Country Dance" was not one of his best films. He reacts frantically, turning Charles into a caricature of the useless aristocrat consanguineous, as if he were auditioning for a role in Monty Python's skit 'The Executioner of the Upper Class of the Year'. Susannah York as Hilary and Michael Craig as Douglas are rather better, but there is no truly exceptional actor performance in the film. There is also very little coherent intrigue apart from the story of Charles' inexorable slide. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film, however, is neither the actor nor the plot, but rather that of the film. Theme that does not dare to say its name. There are half-hearted allusions to an incestuous relationship between Charles and Hilary, or at least to an incestuous attraction to her on his part, and to the fact that his aversion to Douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy. Unfortunately, even in the early sixties and early seventies (the date of the film is either 1969 or 1970), there was a limit to what the British Board of Film Censors was willing to accept, and a movie with explicitly incestuous theme was definitely forbidden. (The American title of the film was 'Brotherly Love', but it was not used in Britain, was it too suggestive to taste BBFC?) These allusions are never developed and we never see what motivates Charles or what caused his moral collapse, resulting in a hollow film with a hole in its center. 4/10
