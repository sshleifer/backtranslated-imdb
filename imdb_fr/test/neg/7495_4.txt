Of course, it's hard to be gay, especially in the south. We understood. Again and again. <br /> <br /> What is remarkable is that the filmmakers have almost entirely focused on the most "extreme" characters of these gay bars in the small town; the drag-queens, the barracks of a bar closed for a long time and a guy brutally murdered for homosexuality, had yet nothing to do with one of the bars on which this film focuses. <br /> <br /> There were excerpts from interviews of other people, which viewers might be better able to understand. But they were passed over in silence, almost ignored, perhaps in a glimpse in the background. <br /> <br /> It would have been more interesting, at least for me, to hear the experiences of more common homosexual men and women. who have been enriched or not by the experience of a small town gay bar and / or by the absence of this community.
