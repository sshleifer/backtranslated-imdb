I would not give too much of the movie to tell you that there are many, many scenes of Lucas (the young protagonist) walking and looking at things! Yes. And you'll be happy to know that the first third of the movie is irrelevant, and that it is virtually ignored for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> This film is populated by foolish people who do dark things. and the most boring of them is the young Lucas who goes blind and needs surgery. You see, he has illusions, terrible illusions! He thinks a killer is attacking blind women! He walks around a lot and acts like an unbearable idiot! <br /> <br /> Patience does not pay with this movie. In the end, the plot and events are just as confusing and lethargic, and it's very hard to care one way or another about the meaning of nightmarish images. Nothing is said, the film is moving with turtle and left me the same effects of hangover. <br /> <br /> Judging by "Afraid of the Dark", the British do not make stupid thrillers like the Americans do; they are boring.
