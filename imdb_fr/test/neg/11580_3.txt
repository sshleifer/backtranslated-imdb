A team of amateur journalists and tree enthusiasts is seizing a secret government project, Project Carnivore, on an isolated island in the South Pacific. Scientists produce giant maize, but the genes spread to other species, creating unusually large Komodo dragons and a cobra (a bullet-proof swim underwater). With the help of the scientist's daughter, can they escape the island and tell the world? Even if I had not seen this movie on the Sci-Fi channel (which I unfortunately did), it would scream "Sci-Fi Channel" with its low production value, its weak game and some of the worst special effects Of the history. The effects here are comparable to those of another movie, "Raptor Island", although they are not so bad. I imagine there must be at least a handful of people who have worked on both films, but I have not bothered to confirm it and probably will not. It will be a sad day when I see one of their films again. <br /> <br /> Which does not mean that it is not pleasant. I watched it at two in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and I can not speak for him, but I thought it was a very good use of time. As bad as the problem is, it's a funny picture if you like to make fun of movies and the scientist's daughter is attractive enough to wear the movie (I think the actress's name is Michelle Borth). Michael Par√© also appears as a ship's captain and his mediocre choice of roles actually makes his work on "Furnace" ("Furnace") respectable (though this film is intolerably bad). <br /> <br /> I can not be too difficult on this film just because it was more or less exactly what I thought. Bad effects? Small budget? Unnamed actors? I had no hope. Yet that does not mean it's great either. There is nothing to be proud of as an au pair. It will weaken slowly in the distant memory department. For the fan who likes this movie (and calls it "KvC"), keep your copy, because you'll have plenty of time to get another one.
