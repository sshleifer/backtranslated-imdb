it was quickly destroyed by the mediocre quality of the actors, the cinematography, many useless scenes and a terrible villain. Let's see that Joe Estevez is mean (as usual) but it is not the only casting problem, the writer Vivian Schilling is not a great actress, in fact, she fears. His scenario is not so bad, it's just badly directed. In fact, if the staging had been better and if better actors had been chosen, it could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> But alas, with all these problems, "Soultaker" fails to be uniform. passable as a horror movie, the more the rhythm is horrible too. <br /> <br /> The MST team had fun with this one but it was certainly not one of their best efforts. 5 for that, nothing for the original.
