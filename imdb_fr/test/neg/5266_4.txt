This movie is really quite strange. It is clear that some * events * portrayed identify the main protagonist as being the Dublin criminal known as "The General", but almost everything else is simply wrong. We are not talking about a distortion of ancient history ... but a complete distortion of irrefutable and documented facts. The question is indeed why? The garda are the last days, Keystone Cops, his gang as non-threatening, and the man himself as well, Kevin Spacey. Almost pure fiction, why bother trying to give a semblance of realism? That said, it's a mediocre exercise, no matter how you want to watch it. Not worth a second of anyone's time.
