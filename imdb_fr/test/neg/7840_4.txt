"Maximum Risk" is a step aside for Van Damme and a little more action film without B movie than we expected movies featuring the Belgian macho martial artist. The film has gaping holes, gaffes galore, a messy plot and a beautiful Henstridge who spends most of his time seeming to wait for a signal. "Maximum Risk" does not stand out in any way and probably will not have much appeal beyond the usual male audience. (C-)
