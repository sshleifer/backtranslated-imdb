Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories about the fantasy and imagination of the adult world. In one of them is a kind of opera story where a rejected architect tries to manipulate a group of people to make him happy - only his attempt fails him, it's the only target, the woman what he looks for after. In the same unfinished castle he built, a group of teachers seeks love in a more modern history, a woman ineffably believes in the role of romance and the cynical anthropoligist tries to teach her a lesson by putting her contact with the biggest idiot the group. Meanwhile, a group of children fantasize about the adventure of a prince of George Melies who saves a girl in distress creatures of the swamps and then kills the evil king, thus establishing the kingdom of love. The two main themes? Life is a fairy tale, and life is not a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> What sounds better than the movie really is. Resnais is the type of director where the concept is often good or bad, but exposure is what matters; Here, the concept is great but the film is frankly painful to watch. Discordant songs, sparkling characters without an ounce of dimension, disgusting pastel backgrounds - instead of giving your inner child an ice cream cone, Resnais drowns it in a bucket of cake icing. Add to that French philosophy and you'll get a weird witches' beer, a beer that's not afraid of trouble, but stays bad in the stomach until you want to regurgitate it. <br /> <br /> Resnais is a Director-taking risk, and even in its worst you can see that it is trying something that might not work with complete action clarity. In I Want to Go Home, he manages to overcome annoying characters and dubious decorations by showing real changes and keeping a moment of calm to catch his breath. Here, he plunges directly into a fantasy that does not really reflect the fantasy, but only the reference of the wallpaper of the room of his baby. The biggest problem is that he managed to make a film more flamboyant than an 80s pop and more kitsch than the musicals of Golden Era Hollywood. The fantasies go beyond childhood and naivety, but the film (with nudity and desecration) is definitely aimed at adults, a target he has definitely missed. <br /> <br /> However, he remains true to his theme and never makes replicas. If so, this film is impressive, simply because it is not excused. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
