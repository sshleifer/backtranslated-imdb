Okay, they tell you it's real. They do not list any screenwriter or director, but a single viewing of this film will prove to everyone that it's not what you're hoping for. Talking rarely sounds like a real natural speech ... but especially not like a script. (possibly freely written). For me, it sounded a lot more like they were still trying to ad-lib. (which they have almost always done badly). As a result, they knew they were making a "film", not just to collect true natural images. So, I'm sure these people knew what was going on, they knew they had some places to look for things that had been put in place ... and they were just told ad-lib to avoid all this . ************* Major Spoilers ************************* ******* ************************ <br /> <br /> Okay, it's so bad. Every object, point or thing that might be strange or used as a fear, is magically found by chance by these people. Let me enumerate the ridiculously obvious facts that happened and I remember: 1) Less than 2 minutes after entering the house, they turn on a switch. The sparks and the chandelier fall almost on it. a guy. <br /> <br /> 2) They accidentally discover an old medicine bag containing a bloody butcher's knife while exploring the cellar. <br /> <br /> 3) They hear a sound cabinet, they slowly open the door - BAM - a cat is in there and jumps right in front of the camera shouting. <br /> <br /> 4) They notice then that there is a hole in the wall So let's put our hand in ... wow, they took out a doll from a baby wrapped in masking tape. <br /> <br /> 5) Let's go to the attic, uh-oh, it's "heavy". here .... BOOM - a chair is flying across the room. <br /> <br /> 6) Take time to eat. Oh no ! The girl who was afraid of insects had a chef's hat in her sandwich! LOL! .... ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 7) Let's get out of the Ouija board ... oops one of the legs of the board fell on the side of the board. It could not be because people were pushing it, was not it? (They discover that a ghost is called Charles) <br /> <br /> 8) Wait! What was that noise in the chimney ... CLINK - oh my shackles fell "I think she kept * the people here". <br /> <br /> 9) Now, a little girl is going to brave looking in the fireplace. ... oh, what is she seeing something ... and asking people who do not look at the fireplace what it is. SWISH - It falls on him. (perfect photo) It moves just in time. It was more of a chain. <br /> <br /> 10) Now we have to separate and each person "clean" our designated rooms - would not it be something if things went one by one for these people now ... ok: < CHICKEN # 1: Wow, suddenly her room is shaking ... but no one is doing it. <br /> <br /> DUDE # 1: In fact, he says to himself "Charles, are you Charles ... it can not be you because you're just the fruit of my imagination, not Charles ". Well, guess what, he's knocked over and dragged to the ground. Another lucky shot of camera. <br /> <br /> CHICKEN # 2: Hear things..Try to communicate ... and stay there scratching or something like that. <br /> <br /> DUDE # 2: He was in the attic, passed his arm through a hole in the ground and grabbed a shine .... I do not remember what else. <br /> <br /> 11) The guy # 2 runs, gets the chick # 2 .. they hear chick and guy # 1 shout ... they find them chained to a wall and tied to a table . (*) They leave. Cut to black. The final text tells us that they escaped safely, were treated for minor cuts. Since then, they have had nightmares and insomnia. We also learn that the next day, a call to 911 was called by a certain Charles. <br /> <br /> ************ ***************** ************* ************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ****************************** ********** <br /> <br /> Of okay, when I heard that this film was being made, I could not wait any longer. I thought it was going to be real. TRUE, real. - and more professional, with people of more professional type. I like the idea of ​​this kind of thing, I'd like to see real haunting images. Before the release of this movie, I saw some reviews online. They both said how wrong it was and how stupid people were ... time passed, I forgot the movie ... then I realized it was never released in theaters. So I discovered that it went straight to the video, that I praised it ... that every brutal criticism was completely true. It's a shame, I really wanted it to be good. <br /> <br /> Thought randomly: the house did not seem to have televisions, radios ... kitchen appliances that I remember ... which would make me think no we lived a long time. Especially the house is really known to be haunted ... I'm sure nobody lives there. But he looks so clean and tidy ... and what was a cat doing there? The property has no neighbors nearby .... <br /> <br /> In all, you will only want to rent this if you and your friends want to sit there and make fun of it ... or if you heard about it a long time ago and that intrigued you. (you will be disappointed if you wait for a good movie ... or a real movie) <br /> <br /> Random Thinking: I think the producer says "The" footage you see is real ". Well, technically, these are real pictures, are not they? Real pictures of fake hauntings? Maybe it was his loop hole. <br /> <br /> I give this film a star - strictly on the fact that they have told the story of Madame LaLaurie. A true story of New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The best performance was given by the guy who teaches the participants the early ghost hunting equipment. He was obviously really real ... or a good actor. <br /> <br />
