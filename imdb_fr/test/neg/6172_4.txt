I decided to watch this movie to fall asleep. It kept me awake so it was interesting; However, it was pretty bland. <br /> <br /> The acting game was good. I think none of the actors did a bad job. Mickey Rourke is as credible as an outstanding hit-man. The dialogue in this film does not offer many opportunities for these actors to show their full potential, but they still shine. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere was great. The music was good and the colors corresponded to the atmosphere that the director wanted to paint for the viewers. Even the weather has improved the mood of the film. Everything was well done. <br /> <br /> The failures of this film are in the development of its history. The mafia scenario against Blackbird does not attract enough attention. The story of Carmen and Wayne's divorce is not explained. The FBI seems to work very fast here. Is there no paperwork for all these processes? Is it really so easy to unearth your brother's body from his grave, to burn the corpse and have it identified as yourself? There are too many loops in the script so I can give this movie a score above 4 out of 10. I would not recommend this movie to people unless they are really bored and smoke very good grass. Even if WoW is in maintenance, look for something better to do than watch this movie.
