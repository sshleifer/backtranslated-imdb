This film, filmed and grainy, is cheap and tells the story of two heirs of an Italian country manor who go to the house to stay, then get killed by ghosts of people killed in this house . <br /> <br /> I was not impressed by that. It was not really that scary, especially what should be a cheap Italian movie. A girl, her two cousins ​​and a cousin's girlfriend are heading to this huge house for some reason (I could not understand why) and were staying there, cleaning and inspecting the place. The characters come in and out of the movie, and it's pretty boring at times, and the majority of the dead are pretty rushed. The girlfriend is hit by a car as she fled the house after dreaming of her death. The scene is pretty good, but things slow down again, until the confusion ends, when the cousins ​​are killed together in a strange way, and this weird guy (I did not know who he was during the film, or maybe I did not remember it) attacks this girl, the attacker, until that other girl kills him. I hate giving the end, but hey. The cousin decides to stay at home and watch her, and shows scenes of her life there years later. The end. You do not really miss anything, and anyway, you probably will not find it anywhere, so you're lucky.
