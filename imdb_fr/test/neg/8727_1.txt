This miniseries / movie was so terrible sometimes that I almost broke down and turned it off. I am a big fan of the novel, but this film suffers from a multitude of problems. The costumes are mediocre and many of the most emotionally charged scenes are jaded. Deviations from the novel are poorly chosen, important nuances are missed or rewritten. <br /> <br />
