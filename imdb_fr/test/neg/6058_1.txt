I do not know how expensive the creation of this film was, but the effects were terrible. Half of the film was shot on stage in front of a movie canvas (for sure the blue box would not look so artificial). When they traveled on a boat, the backdrop was shifted by imitating wave movement but the characters did not move. CGI Effects: Terrible (I'm not sure but the effects were created with Paint and made it a GIF sequence - the next time the creators should hire a team of CGI creative designers). It seems that the creator of CGI would have drawn on the image band with shaking hands. Horrible, that's for sure. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I thought it was created in 1983. One of my friends told me the correct date: 2005. My jaw dropped, I was so under the shock that I thought he was joking. People, I recommend you skip this movie, the story is also twisted, you will not enjoy it.
