Dracula 3000 is the epitome of painful cheese cinema. From the beginning, I assumed I was for something pretty nasty. With a cast of Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio and Tiny Lister, what would you expect? Well, let's just say that the expectations have been crushed ... <br /> <br /> If I start really, I feel that this review will last a long time, so we will keep it simple. The vampire is not even called Dracula. The space team transports coffins from the Carpathians sector of the Transylvanian system. In his big stage, Coolio talks about the most horrible things in the history of cinema. In the year 3000, everyone wears bad clothes according to current standards, he has nothing more advanced than a modern wheelchair and it decorates with neon lights that seem stolen from a rink on wheels. all that ... the end. Sweet merciful God. He does not deserve to be ruined. You have to believe it to believe it. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie at "1" and I wish I could give it a zero ... but I feel obliged to make you watch it. What madness is it?
