In terms of budget, 2.5 million Canadian dollars do not have much to do with animatronic animation, the puppet in this film, the only reason for this nine-week shoot. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and had hoped to see it at the time of its release, but rather on DVD recently. My main problem is that it's not funny at all, it's better than Tenacious D who does not have any funny bones in his body. But it was a really disappointing film. <br /> <br /> Trevor Matthews is a very physically strong performer, but his actor play is worthless! Rachel Skarsten gives what is probably one of the most irritating and fun performances I have ever seen. The only true star in this field is David Scott, whose works for monsters are fabulous! His work on special effects is the main reason why it is worth watching this movie. He loved Cyclops and Troll, and Professor Monster was straight out of the Henson Library. <br /> <br /> If you look at this, it will not be a bigger waste of time, but if you are looking to see this for a great horror comedy Romp ... do not worry.
