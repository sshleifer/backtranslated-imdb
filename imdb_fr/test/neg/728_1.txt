I got tired of several attempts to sit down and watch this show "Gilmore Girls". It puzzled me because I just could not figure out the problem. Was it a young woman with a baby who was young in life and never growing up? Was it the girl being more responsible than the mother? Was it a rich, rebellious girl and her non-rebellious daughter? What is this show? Finally, I did not care. The casting makes me want to scream. The writing is neither "intelligent" nor "intelligent", it is syrupeuse and tedious. <br /> <br /> So why did I look? Because I've heard SO good things about it and I'm not one of those who express an opinion as long as I have not looked at it Knee-jerk reactions are generally wrong, so I looked at several time. The first time I watched this, I saw the mother running as if she was 12 years old and the girl behaving as if she were 40 years old. Maybe that's what did not attract me. I have never liked any of the "Freaky Friday" movies - not to say it's like that, but there are some similarities. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have a friend who watches this show every week. So I asked him, "What is this show about?" A very bright young woman, who used to say that she could never give me a clear answer. So I asked other people who were crazy about it - they did not know either. <br /> <br /> Gilmore Girls turns out to be a TV show that looks like an "art house movie". Many of us will not get it, but those who go there desperately try to find meaning where there is none, just be "plugged in". Yes, I find that Lauren Graham's Lorelai is annoying - moaning, whimpering, nasally WHINE. An entire hour of that. Sensational. And the rest of the distribution is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The city is hokey, the men are fools, the grandparents are boring and, unfortunately, I can not find anything that redeems any of these characters or who cares about everything they do. It's like watching paint dry on the wall.
