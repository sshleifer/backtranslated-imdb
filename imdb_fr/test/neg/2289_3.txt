Some would prefer to comment on the value of Bond movies in the relationship between learning frequency and most of the jargon that tends to limit Bond to a lean 007 following has been exploited beyond all reasonable claim, but there are several plausibilities the Sean Connery's credibility in this doubling role that had seen its counterpart partly adapt to a previous performance of Jessica Tandy in Driving Miss Daisy. Although Connery was less visible in the latter, her qualities as a woman researcher may not have struck the thirsty spectators, contrary to what he did in this last interpretation which, for the most involved, addressed the theme 007 with a nice resentment, although the general flavor had been changed. Ideal for those who are interested in others while pretending to be who you are not!
