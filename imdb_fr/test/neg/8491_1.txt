Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss published his true inner self and became Edge City's hero by finding and wearing the northern god of evil, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and achieved a very popular status for its originality and pure entertainment. Everyone knew how to spell the party. PARTY. Why? Because I have to! Today, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new film "Son of the Mask". Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you doing this? And he answers "Because I have to go!" Unfortunately, this answer does not cover all of this because after seeing The Son of the Mask, I always left saying, "Good God, why?" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film must understand that the answer given to why you are making this film should not be as simple as the response to the debate about whether to party. <br /> <br /> The Son of the Mask begins with Otis, the dog, who discovers the infamous mask and reports it to its owner, Tim Avery, an obvious homage to Tex Avery, the legendary creator of Loony Toons. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a struggling animator who is forced to work as a tour guide for the turtles for the animation company for which he aspires to draw one day. On the night of the company's Halloween party, Tim puts on the mask and turns into a playful and crazy character we all expect. After the party, Tim goes home, still masks and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later, chaos ensues, because the baby born of the mask has a remarkable caricatural power. Otis the dog, jealous of the baby's attention, puts on the mask and participates in a game of Tom and Jerry type to get out the baby. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is looking for his mask, on the order of his father, Odin. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must admit that I respect the fact that this film pays such a tribute. classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with his Wile E. Coyote type gear and his infamous dancing frog plot. However, this reverence can not save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The principle of the film becomes more and more ridiculous. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this film, stupidity is on the verge of embarrassment. The characters are not fun to watch and, worse, they are not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so many CGIs have been used. One of the greatest assets of the original is that, although, of course, computer animation was used, it was very much dependent on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of being fair. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was a real cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just does not have that kind of ability, which is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely change. The baby and the dog were mostly completely animated, which became more and more awkward throughout the movie. Loki's parallel story in search of the mask has become more and more amazing. <br /> <br /> The mask's son is sad and sad. I suggest you go rent or buy the original mask and thank the Nordic gods, or whoever, for bringing it to us. And consider seeing the rest of my sacrifice as I continue to ask the famous question "WHY?" The mask's son gets a star, though this star is divided between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, which will always be in my book, the mask.
