A staggering horror movie of five 20-year-olds (3 guys, 2 girls) going to this place in the middle of nowhere. What they do not know is that Dr. Chopper and his assistants attack and kill anyone who ventures into their woods. They use their body parts for experiments ... or something like that. In addition, five students and two lesbians are thrown to be killed and show some cleavage. <br /> <br /> Pretty desperate. The story is confusing and boring; the gore is ridiculously false; Dr. Chopper and his assistants exaggerate TERRIBLY; There is a dreadful black "humor" here and people stay standing while their friends are attacked or stand there and let people kill them. <br /> <br /> It was rather insulting. There are some advantages. A rotation of one hour was pretty good and the five young actors are really good! Chase Hoyt is great like Reese; Butch Hansen is fine as Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy is as good as Tamara and Robert Adamson has his moments like Nicholas. Best of all is Chesley Crisp like Jessica - she was excellent! Some of the dramatic scenes between these five were well interpreted and interesting. Unfortunately, the dialogue was not really there for them. I give them a 4 for their performances - but nothing else here is worth mentioning. Hopefully these actors will have roles worthy of them.
