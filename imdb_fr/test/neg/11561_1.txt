Robot Holocaust is the most clumsy and pathetic attempt to make a post-apocalyptic film I've seen. And I thought the Italians were the masters of the wretched Mad Max aspirants. Some of these movies like Escape 2000 are really brilliant in comparison to this piece of poo. The plot is absurd ?? even with a narrator setting up each scene. And the boy hangs out. Scene after scene, nothing interesting happens. Special effects (and I use the word "special" loosely) consist of sock puppets. Yes, it's true ?? puppet socks! The acting is catastrophic. Angelika Jager is in the running for the worst performance I have ever seen. Of course, she is French or German or whatever? but the man is wicked. I can not think of one positive thing to say about the movie. So, I'm going to stop here because ten sentences on this junk food are worth too much. <br /> <br /> However, and fortunately for me, I saw the MST3K version of Robot Holocaust. Some of the things that made the film so bad helped make this MST3K episode a winner. For one season, the riffs arrive fast and furious and reach their goal each time. On my rating scale MST3K, I give this episode a 4/5 ?? look it up.
