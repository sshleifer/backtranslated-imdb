This film was not funny. We laugh at various sports films and clich√©s but nothing is so funny. Most of the movies that they parody are not even part of the movie and are in fact only theirs to be able to be there. No The main actor was well chosen but it's really the only good thing about this movie. Also, the various cameos on it were pretty cool to watch, but I do not know why they would waste their time being in that trash. Thank goodness, I only spent $ 4, because it is not worth spending money. Watch ONLY if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to lose an hour and 30 minutes.
