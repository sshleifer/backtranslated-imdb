I watched the 219-minute version and I must say that, dollar for dollar, it's probably one of the worst movies of all time. Now, I'm not saying it's THE worst movie of all time - but if you look at a cost ratio versus what an average person would like, it's a very, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that the most important factor that makes this movie a bad movie is the writer / director, Michael Cimino. It is rare that so much blame is attributed to one person. If he had not been so complacent, an equally bad movie could have been done in about 90 minutes, saving millions of dollars! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a completely useless prologue supposed to take place at Harvard. The scene is huge but completely without context. You do not know exactly what's going on and you do not know why the students (especially John Hurt) behave so fiercely. I find it very difficult to imagine such a beginning in 1870 - and it looks a lot more like 1970. It's half an hour when you do not know what's going on, who are the characters or their motives. <br /> <br /> The next scene will take place 20 years later. Inexplicably, the two Harvard graduates (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming. So, they went to the best school in America and now one of them is just a lawyer in the middle of nowhere and the other is ... well, what is John Hurt in the movie?!?! He appears right here and there and seems to be a fool (the prologue) or a pathetic and useless drunkard who hangs out with murderers - even if he is apparently against them !? His whole character made no sense. They never explained why he was British and he lived in the middle of nowhere (impossible to hide his accent), why he had bothered to come with the army engaged if he was so opposed to their plan perverse, or why he was risking his life for a cause he did not believe at all. As for Kristofferson, his excellent acting and his better-defined character made his character more credible, although he was transferred to Wyoming AND he was risking his life for a prostitute made no sense. <br /> <br /> This raises the worst aspect of the sky gate. Although the scenes are too long and need to be trimmed, the worst thing about the movie is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a great actor who has nothing to do with the movie), Jeff Bridges and many other big names are here, but you do not know why. In fact, besides Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (like a whore with a gold heart - that's quite a cliché) and maybe Christopher Walken, EVERYONE is completely one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine a movie CELA long without knowing or understanding the characters. <br /> <br /> Much of the film also seems anachronistic. Who could have imagined the construction of a giant ice rink in the middle of nowhere in 1890? I'm sure it would have been very, very difficult to get the basic supplies in this part of the West - yet trains filled with roller skates and lumber are expected to arrive instead of FOOD. Maybe if they had not spent billions of dollars building and going to the roller-skating rink, the farmers could afford to buy food and avoid this war for looted cattle! And what happens with the guy in roller skates with the violin? What does this have to do with a land war? <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem you have is that this is a film in which very, very little happens until the great battle that ensues . There are many scenes of dirt and nothing flat. So much nil as when the battle would happen, many spectators would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it is inevitable that nothing can save the film. <br /> <br /> As for the final battle, it was done pretty well but had problems. First, this minor skirmish on the Prairies lasted longer than the D-Day invasion !! Second, although the details of the events of the so-called "Johnson County War" are a bit distant, we know that the characters embodied by Huppert and Kristofferson were never there because they had both been hung BEFORE the battle. Third, I can not believe that Cimino actually killed animals throughout the movie - especially during the final battle. Although I'm far from a heart bleeding on animal rights, its need to use animal casings and kill some of the horses is a low point in film history. Watching and knowing that some horses are dead to realize Cimino's "vision" for the film is very sad. <br /> <br /> Finally, after the great battle, we have an epilogue. Although fortunately short, it also seemed totally useless and vague. We see Kristofferson on a luxury yacht, so we can assume that he is finally putting some of his Harvard studies into practice. We also see a woman who seems to be the one Kris examined a few times during the prologue. More importantly, nothing is said and you have no idea of ​​the end result. I read myself and found that the film was often wrong to understand the facts. <br /> <br /> Overall, saying that the film is long and that it needs a lot more editing is like saying that the Second World War is a "minor tiff". Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but if you take into account the production costs, I really think it's perhaps one of the worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> Finally, when a movie has this explicit nudity, I warn parents. However, as no child could attend this movie (even with a promise of sex), the warning is not necessary.
