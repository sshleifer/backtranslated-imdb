I'm not a fan of the original book, but I was expecting a better adaptation than Natalie Portman's film, which I found awful. This version is even worse. <br /> <br /> First, there is very little book by Ms. Gregory in this script. All of George Boleyn's subplot of sexuality is completely eliminated, and in this version George is simply a drift between his duty to the Boleyn family and his duty to the King. I thought the title of the book referred to Mary as the least known of the Boleyn sisters, but here it is used to refer to Anne. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scenario asks the characters to address periodically if confessed. Apparently, this is meant to give a little history and explain their motives, but it's an amateurish performance. <br /> <br /> In addition to the bad scenario, the direction is incredibly bad. There are too many shots with an indirect camera that is not at best stable and at worst fragile. Several speeches are delivered on a provisional basis, as during a first rehearsal. The production values ​​for Henry's flamboyant court are minimal. The costumes vary: some are copies of historical portraits and others are from the fiery imagination of some costumers. And the king, source of all power and all favors, is often shown ALONE. No crazy courtiers, no servants in the background - where are all the people ?? I'm used to Hollywood to turn history into fantasy, but I was expecting better from a BBC production. Even based on an imperfect book, this production is ADB.
