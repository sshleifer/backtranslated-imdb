Yes, I bought camp blood and it wasted about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money on that shit, I mean I was not expecting an amazing movie, judging by the cover, I was not expecting anything, but less crazy in the first 3 seconds (I'm not complaining crazy ..) I complain about what hell has to do with anything is? this film should have been kept on camera at home at home as a joke .... they suck..why was the blood more brown and shit like that real blood? ... cheap I tell you that everyone was not in their color was just tinged with yellow. Another thing that made me laugh at this sad excuse for a movie was the fact that they were trying to pretend that the clown was a woman all the time, although it's clearly a man with short hair, black breast and flat chest. ... did anyone else notice that the only special effect of this movie was a slowing down of the jump ... it was also mediocre, oh, and the dissolving effect you can find on many computer programs of base such as ... powerpoint .... this movie shots
