I read all the other reviews that made this movie an excellent movie. I have not seen anything of the excellence that has been declared. I thought it was long and boring. I tried twice to watch it. The first time I fell asleep and the second time, six minutes after the end, I gave up. I guess it was mainly my fault that I had waited with a lot of attention, but I do not think it would have completely ruined the film for me. The movie was just bland. There was nothing that was spectacular or unique. The plot was not half bad, the action sequences were non-existent, the forced dialogue and the film went on forever. I would not recommend seeing this movie.
