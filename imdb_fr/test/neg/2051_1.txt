Bled begins as the young artist Sai (Sarah Ferooqui) meets a mysterious but charming man named Renfield (Jonathan Oldham) and they end up in his studio where he gives her the bark of a tree used as a hallucinogenic drug. when melted. Sai quickly becomes hooked as she is drawn into another fantasy reality involving vampiric creatures. Royce, Sai's photographer friend (Chris Ivan Cevic), worries about her as she walks away from reality when she becomes addicted to drugs, can Royce kick him or go Does she end up ruining her life & why did the mysterious Renfield get her addicted And does the fantasy elaborated as travels have any meaning? <br /> <br /> Co-produced and directed by Christopher Hutson, this vampire art film is anemic and lasts about 95 minutes and is awkward from all the bad reviews. The script was written by the very interesting Sxv'leithan Essex (how the heck do you pronounce it anyway?) Who is also credited as a production designer and his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that happens to Bled, I guess the filmmakers have come up with the idea of ​​making a horror movie based on very serious fantasies with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs, drug addiction and date rape drugs. Most of the film is devoted to the drug problem with the initial introduction of Sai to drugs. She was awesome the first time and how desperately addicted she is, which ultimately destroys her, as well as her life and that of her friends. She has never been told where to continue taking this medicine, as Renfield gives her only a few during their first meeting, but hey, we do not care! The first twenty minutes of Bled are really boring and boring, the next hour will be little better before a mess of the last ten minutes that involves a vampire monster and Renfield making a reappearance. The moral elements are condescending, the fantastic elements seem to be an afterthought and the horror does not exist. There is also the awful dialogue, each sentence tries to be deep, deep and hidden and just tries to make so much sense that it becomes tedious to be listened to. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is Execution is terrible and there is absolutely no violence or violence to carry and everything takes place in an apartment that does not seem to have light. The fantastic scenery looks a little better, but it is inconspicuous and underused. There's no fright here, no atmosphere and to make matters worse, the makers decided to use very pale, faint colors that I hate and find annoying. What's wrong with a beautiful colorful picture? This seems to me to be a fad with current filmmakers who seem to think that it automatically makes a movie cool or an atmosphere that it does not, but most often it just makes your movie look dull and dull, as shown Bled. <br /> <br /> This was probably a small budget and was shot in Los Angeles and it has reasonable production values, but everything is so dull. The acting did not impress me, I made fun of anyone, which is never a good sign. <br /> <br /> Bled is a terrible movie about vampires that makes horror both psychological and physical. parallels to real life dug addiction & what it can do with little or no effect because the whole thing is so dull. There may be an audience for a film like this, but given the other comments, it's not that big.
