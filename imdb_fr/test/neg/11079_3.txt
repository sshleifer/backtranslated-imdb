A group of speleologists with a sad story takes an author on a "hairy" adventure through an unknown cave in Kazakhstan. At the time of remakes and sequels and movie companies trying to take advantage of any winning combination of cinematic components, The Cavern has only a relatively different appearance from the previous eight cellar films made in recent years . an X-File. I like to give the benefit of the doubt to every movie, but there was too much trouble for me here. The work of the camera can give you a headache because they constantly seem to confuse the direction of the walk. Not being a speleologist, it does not matter if the shooting was realistic or not. There is too much superfluous PANNICK of supposedly experienced speleologists. You say aloud one of two things: oh, shut up and focus on your salvation, or I hope you all die by the end. It must have been very tiring for these honest actors to make this film. A moderate amount of gore and nothing special in the dialogue or characters. Although you know that you know what is happening at the end, the last five minutes explain all the details. But I would have had a better opinion of the film if they had left at the last minute in the editing room. It just was not necessary. I suggest that you press eject immediately after confirming your suspicions and that you spare yourself the configuration of the suite. I have long thought that the film industry should share a modified cash system for the restaurant industry. You pay for the material needed to make the film before you enter, but any benefit to the film comes from the advice you give when you leave the cinema. I can not blame what I do not like about this film on its small budget.
