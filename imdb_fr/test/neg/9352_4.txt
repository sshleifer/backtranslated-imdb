Awesome Star Wars with a slightly more comical hue. Robert Urich embodies the main role of a group of pirates on the ice, who steal ice because water is the most precious substance in the universe to this day (the way all the poor stay alive is a mystery). He meets Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, about 25 years old and a total cutie), a princess looking for her missing father. Anjelica Huston, in a hilarious sci-fi cast, and a chubby Ron Perlman (who, in my opinion, was seven feet tall compared to his other roles!) Were also in the cast. And John Carradine, who seems to be a few days away from death and comedian Hollywood Squares (relative term), Bruce Vilanch. If you've always wanted to see Bruce Vilanch beheaded, here's your movie. But, again, even that is not worth seeing, because it does not lock it at all (I think it could have been a robot, but I nodded several times).
