My friends and I have just seen a preview of this new Australian movie. Everyone in the cinema agreed, what was the point of this film? There was no good story to follow, the characters were undeveloped and the plot seemed unmotivated. I find it odd that this film, which has probably cost millions, was funded and realized. There is no use in the world of theater, it adds nothing to the palette of Australian cinema. It was really a waste of time to create this funny work without emotion and more time should be spent writing scripts and creating good stories, without creating a mess like this. Hugo Weaving and Rose Byrne were fine, but were embarrassed by a bad script. Pia Miranda's character was useless and abstract from the plot, and her lines were at best average. A real waste of talent. The backup was exceptional: the cinematography of ACS by Geoffrey Simpson, which, like most Australian films, was superb. <br /> <br /> Come on guys, think about it next time please. <br /> <br /> 4/10
