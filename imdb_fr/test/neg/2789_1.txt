According to the budget information provided on this website, Dark Harvest had an estimated budget of $ 130,000. Where this money has been spent, I am not quite sure. Let me see ... the costumes ... no ... the location and the scenery ... hmmm, do not think ... special f / x ... NOT ... theater class ... Oh no. Dark Harvest tells the epic story of a young man who inherits a family farm in the hills of West Virginia. His girlfriend persuades him to bring his friends over to check the place. Once there, our intrepid hero learns that his great-grandfather used a unique method to grow his crops and now it's time to take revenge. Killer scarecrow for revenge !!! Ewww scary. Well no, not really. We all know that great movies have been made with very little money, but it's not one of them. This film contains just about some of the worst actors and dialogues I've ever seen. Terrible shots with terrible birth. All in all, do not be fooled by the decent half-way coverage and avoid at all costs. I would like to give the filmmakers at least a D- to try, but I'm afraid they did not even do a good job with that. Rank: F
