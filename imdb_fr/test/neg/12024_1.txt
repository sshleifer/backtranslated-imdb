What about "Dead End Road" ... <br /> <br /> Let's just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so ashamed. The acting, the writing, the effects and everything in this movie were just awful. It does not even do justice! This movie was the biggest garbage I ever had to go through. That's also why I stopped it about 20 minutes before the end because personally, I did not care what happened to the characters. I saw badly but it was really the worst. I became a fan of Poe and it was just bad. Just bad. <br /> <br /> What annoys me more is that you can not give a negative rating to movies.
