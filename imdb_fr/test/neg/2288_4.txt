Sad in all respects, this poor excuse for relaunching Connery's career was neither that nor the success Warners wanted. Extending 20 minutes and full of embarrassing moments for everyone, this film and "Robocop 2" are proof that Irvin Kershner had no real control over "The Empire Strikes Back". Connery had not been successful since leaving Bond in 1971, but that did not come at all. "Octopussy" was released several months before this film and easily exceeds it. Imagine that a Roger Moore Bond is not only better than a simultaneous release of Connery, but that it becomes too big (and compared to "Never ...", "Octopussy" is comparable to "2001." > <br /> worst Bond theme song, even worse than "The Man with the Golden Gun", unnecessary scenes that hang around unnecessarily (the worst example being this ridiculous video game sequence - MY GOD - WHO CARES ?!) , and the most atrocious collection of No Talent as far as the legendary "Bond Girls." Does anyone seriously think that Kim Basinger is attractive in this movie? There were girls in my high school who could not never have such a beautiful date in this film, Barbara Carrera - just stupid - but the way Kershner ordered her to prance all the time did not help her. impressive "Onatop", which was about the best asset of "GoldenEye," But that does not mean to say then that you struggle painfully through this film. <br /> <br /> Casting Leit As a black agent, it was a great idea, but the interaction between friends that Connery and himself are supposed to have is terribly bad. Two actors have never appeared so intimately linked - testify to the scene where, to escape the local authorities, they undress and pretend to exercise - I can not imagine another scene in a film that has tried so much to laugh in vain.
