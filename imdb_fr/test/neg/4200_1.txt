It looks a lot like a guy with a home camera who came out with guys he met at Subway and did the worst thing he could think of. <br /> <br /> "Hey guys, give me some ideas, start with a cornfield and work upside down." "Well, you have to have actors just out of high school, and broken corn stalks with shreds of clothes tied and breasts. " Thank you, dude, I'm sure you and Windows Movie Maker will be side by side in your next highly anticipated project.
