This film is a big stereotype. The cast of actors (except Philbin & Harrison) is awful and the horrible scenario only makes things worse. I agree with another criticism that the "local" characters look ridiculous, as are the "Caucasian" characters. 3 out of 10 stars for 1) Philbin 2) Harrison 3) Surf scenes. (1/2 * on ****) Look at "Aloha Summer" (**) and / or "Beyond Paradise" (***) for Hawaii, especially BP which seemed entertaining and brilliant.
