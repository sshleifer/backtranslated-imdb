I miss the words for this terrible waste of two hours of anyone's life. The story is artificial to the point of being completely incredulous. <br /> <br /> The game of actors is leaded and it is ridiculously terrible. Vinnie Jones - so wonderful in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, is incredibly awful and amazing as a journalist, Mike Sullivan. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I never remember seeing a worse movie. We must only look for the terrible failures of continuity. After Jones receives a huge beating, he leaves without a scratch. His girlfriend drinks him a drink and he chases her out of the pub bone. It's pretty dreadful, made even worse by the talented actors that appear there.
