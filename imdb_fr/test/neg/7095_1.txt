This film tears up all gangster and gangster movies ever made. MP Da Last Don has a reference to each film. The acting game was by far the worst I've ever seen. Who the hell is John Mario anyway? His game was by far the worst I have ever seen. It makes the bad actors look good. As for Master P, it sells faster than an N * sync concert. I really wish I could have been there to tell the whole production company: WHAT WAS YOU THINKING WHEN YOU SET THE SCRIPT? "Obviously, these people are so obsessed with the image of the gangster that they decided to make a movie and actually live their gangster life.One thing I know is that no one wanted to distribute this film, so it seems (and how predictable) that the guys from NO LIMIT had to start: NO LIMIT FILMS, I've said enough! This movie is terrible and does not deserve to be called a movie !
