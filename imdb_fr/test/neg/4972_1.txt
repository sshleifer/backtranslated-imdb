I love Jurassic Park movies, they are three of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> And I hate this game. If there was a game I would not like to own for Super Nintendo, it was this one. <br /> <br /> How can a game based on a classic movie be too terrible? And to make matters worse, I was scared of this game when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> It was silly, but I was still a child when this game was first launched. <br /> <br /> The game in this game is just strange. One minute is an action game, then a shooter. What's wrong in the world to decide when creating a video game? <br /> <br /> The sound of the game is just terrible to listen to. <br /> <br /> The music is too sick to listen. <br /> <br /> Game controllers do not work most of the time. <br /> <br /> Jurassic Park is a waste of time and money that will not work. to be a classic. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs
