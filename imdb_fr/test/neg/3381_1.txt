This "space extract" was a bit silly. I guess it was supposed to be an unexpected end, but in my humble opinion it was just a huge disappointment. Joseph Campanella and the rest of the land actors do an excellent job in this one; their performances are not done justice with such a stupid end. I do not know how that end could have been the subject of any review by the producers. The other comment here is not correct, the language in the cheek vignettes was only introduced during the second season, this thing was supposed to be taken seriously! The producers and screenwriters could have been a bit more creative by finishing doing justice to the rest of the episode.
