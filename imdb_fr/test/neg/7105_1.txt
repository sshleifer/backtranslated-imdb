Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of comics (but if comics have the same "quality" as the movie, it's hard to believe it exists), but it must be one of the worst films ever made. Intrigue inexistent, game laughable, stupid dialogue ... This film is so bad that it hurts. A lot. The fact that some people have actually given this one 10/10 is an insult to any good movie or at least mediocre (or at least bad). If you hate yourself, then watch Tank Girl! On another thought, if you hate yourself that much, maybe you should just kill yourself ... My note: -34/10
