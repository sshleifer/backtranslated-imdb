Most of the films are zero with high production values, this one is zero without high production values. What sets it apart from the big pool of horrible movies. As bad as this film was, I must give all the respect I owe to Kathryn Aselton who, I think if given the appropriate script, could probably achieve a very good performance. She plays Emily, Josh's girlfriend, who is often called "guy" or "man" in a slightly ironic way. <br /> <br /> But here it is, Emily is an almost credible character. which means that Rhett will soon have to be added to the cast, to counter this almost credible character with a guy even more ridiculous than Josh. When we meet Rhett for the first time, we learn that he is "deep" because he records on video a lizard proving that he sees the world "only!" Rhett then shows the band to Emily and, in one of the few incredible moments she lives, she is impressed by this amateur lizard band. /> From the beginning of the scene, we warn you that the filming of the camera will be rotten, we open Josh while he tried to seduce the viewers by playing GOOFY! Oh, how much does this main protagonist not intend to play GOOFY! haha. This film could almost be a case study of what bad movies might be (and how very bad movies can take place in the festival circuit, I mean by comparing most of the circuit crap, this movie probably seemed pretty impressive). <I think SXSW has given this film some minor rewards (oh south to southwest, why do you encourage them, it's cruel). But here's where I put a compliment to this movie, it's the best of the mumblecore movement. Remember that all other mumblecore movies are stunned and usually include grotesque nudity and incomprehensibly bad role play, but it's still good to be the best of something. as if maybe they had taken a few steps forward, the preview made it at least tolerable, even though the Puffy Chair preview could not really hide the fact that it was going to be nil. Anyway, Rhett is not described by a professional actor, much like Josh is probably not an actor but rather the director (or the brother of the director, there are contradictory messages). I think Rhett was a buddy and they said: why do not you play this guy named Rhett in the movie, the fact that Rhett is the name of the actor and the character probably means that the actor and the character are the same , unless I'm wrong, what I am not. <br /> <br /> If Rhett was shaving the raccoon off his face, you would probably say he was attractive. Anyway, Rhett, Emily and Josh team up to bring the Puffy chair to Rhett and Josh's father. Some things happen along the way, more bad acting, bad support actors, miserable camera work, an attempt at meaning. This film would not have been bad if he had not sought shamelessly to show off. <br /> <br /> All is amateur, if you can watch this movie without paying, as if it was on TV or TV. to rent at the library, then examine it, just to see if you like this super-cheap film-making style. I like what dupes do: make a movie without a concept, but I would like them to make a movie that someone would like to see.
