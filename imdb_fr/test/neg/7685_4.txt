Ivan The Terrible is more a filmed play than a "big-screen opus". Citizen Kane - a work that is similar in many respects - is quite the opposite (in the way we expect it to be) in the sense that it has a lot of shooting locations for example. <br /> <br /> Interim, we hear the motivations of the character and his thought for the public; if that succeeds in making you understand the character, what does it matter how it was done? And given the small amount of actions, how else to express events that influence history, and therefore the machinations and decisions of characters other than "exaggerated movements"? <br /> <br /> There is also a historical level. why the actor style should not surprise. The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and the USSR forced filmmakers on the spot to make films as they knew it. Prevented from accessing more modern works illustrating the evolution and techniques of cinema, they used only what they knew. <br /> <br /> Government control by the Nazis in Germany destroyed the great German film industry of the 1920s, due to: their total control over this film industry. And the propaganda films can only "entertain" the German troops; hence the need for popular German dumb films from the 1920s, for example. So many techniques of the movie Ivan The Terrible would have been derived from such captured German films provided to the film crew (as mentioned in other comments). <br /> <br /> There was no confusion anywhere else and although personally it was found Overexcited, this is by no means a bad cinematic experience - and certainly NOT one of the worst movies of all the temperature. The acting is good and some of the cinematography is excellent (even according to current standards, below). Certainly not a popcorn movie; we can not leave their brains out of the door of this one. Dated perhaps and very symbolic - it is worth watching on the big screen only if we are unable to watch the movies with the light extinguished at home, because many cinematographic elements will be lost in the experience mainly of these films in black and white. It all depends on the expectations you are traveling with ... <br /> <br /> WARNING - SPOILERS: Do not read the following comments in case they affect your personal vision of the film (s). <br /> <br /> ... and if you do not mind, obvious communist propaganda (as opposed to capitalist propaganda). For Ivan, this is the way Stalin saw himself - his influence on the direction of the film is obvious - and anyone with a historical awareness of the world outside the American perspective will certainly understand that. Ivan may have been an earlier incarnation of Stalin, or maybe not; It is more a diatribe on Stalin and its motivations, decisions, loneliness, promotions of lackeys, etc. - using the character of Ivan - than any other historical narrative of Ivan. Note also the obvious use of particular colors in the following: the red (for the USSR) in the banquet scene. And maybe blue (for the United States) on some shots when the usurper wears the crown? <br /> <br /> But it presents many excellent visuals, such as the deep use of shadows or the outward plan of the population that comes begging for the return of Ivan to Moscow.
