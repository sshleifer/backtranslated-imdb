I love Lucy, but this movie is so terribly bad that I started to embarrass everyone concerned in the first ten minutes. . . and it got worse from there. Lucille Ball's "song" is downright painful and attempts to make her look younger thanks to the use of soft focus pushed me to wear my reading glasses. These are bombs like this that give a bad reputation to bombs.
