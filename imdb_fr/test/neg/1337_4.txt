The update of Clare Booth Luce's play and the 1939 film is a major disappointment. The cast of women is excellent, most individual scenes work but nothing fits. There is no link from one scene to another, almost as if the film had been made in several parts and then assembled in a vacuum. It is less shocking to tell the story of a woman who treats her husband's infidelity and how her friends help and hinder her. It's a shock less shocking at a time when divorce is so common, but at the same time, it's still timely. They would like to have all the pieces connected together because, as things stand, you do not feel really driven by the plot. Wait for the cable.
