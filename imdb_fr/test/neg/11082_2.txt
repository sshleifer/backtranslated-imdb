The Cavern: 2 of 10: Blair Witch meets The Cave and gives me a headache. <br /> <br /> I have something to ask from all film schools. Could you please teach future directors to hold a camera stably? Headache, shaking the camera like Aunt Betty with 12 drinks also causes headaches. <br /> <br /> The film is primarily a visual medium that filmmakers may want to point to the general direction of the action. The film also needs light to work. Maybe we should use a light source to see the action on the screen. I know it's a cellar movie, but there's absolutely nothing worrying about watching the dark for a minute at a time. <br /> <br /> Indeed, showing the film upside down does not mean there is confusion, but it's confusing. the assembly booth. <br /> <br /> One last note to the director, I'm sure there was a good reason to make a CGI campfire horribly wrong. Honestly, I can not think of one man. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the scriptwriter. Try to make at least one friendly character. I would prefer two or more people, but only one person worthy of what I can look for or who could help me could help. Plus, if you have flashbacks, make them relevant in the story. <br /> <br /> If you have a surprise ending, it is probably best that this does not contradict all that precedes you. And try adding sophisticated speleology terms to a cellar movie. You might have wanted to start with caving. <br /> <br /> The Cavern is a very bad film, badly shot with a confused, improbable and anticlimactic end.
