I have now suffered through Parts, The Clonus Horror. <br /> <br /> Having the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horror. <br /> <br /> cloning center belonging to "man" They then grow clones for organ harvesting from clones for the original humans in need of grafts. A clone escapes, the government gets angry and kills everyone involved, but the story continues anyway. <br /> <br /> It's really shameful to see how a potential film is destroyed by fans like Fiveson. The only thing he really did manage to do was to integrate the concept of human rights and its philosophical aspect, how is a human human and would it be acceptable to grow clones for organic harvesting? Unfortunately, mediocre actors were chosen and the plot left the city until the end, where a pathetic attempt is made to summarize it. <br /> <br /> But !! What disturbed me most is the introduction of new characters irrelevant to the plot. Despite this, Fiveson feels the need to kill them in a serious explosion that only Sir Coleman Francis himself would be proud of. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting. How did Fiveson think that pulling plastic sheets and running water over them would create a credible river beyond me, but I suppose that if you compared Coleman Francis's gray-and-pasty oat frame to movie would win. Maybe Coleman has changed what bad movies are for me. 3/10
