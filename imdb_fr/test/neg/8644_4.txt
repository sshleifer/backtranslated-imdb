William Petersen (this type C.S.I) has a small uncredited role but it is the best part of the film. His character has a hard and hard ass, and it's a funny surprise to see him in this adventure. He has a range that allows him to play just about anything. After 5 minutes, it's cool to nothing at all. This lets you hope that his character will reappear in the movie, but after 20 minutes you lose hope. The movie itself is pretty poor. Worth a watch on TMN or pickup at the library but not much more. It's too much like L. Confidential, except that where the movie starts to get complicated, it's so loose that it's spinning everywhere but where it should be. 2 out of 5 stars
