This movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses Gabriels' horn to open the sky and shoot the good angels and put them in jail on Alkatraz. The devil sings and dances a few songs about the joys of being bad and, at one point, eats a live rat. <br /> <br /> We had this film for free with a pizza. In for money.
