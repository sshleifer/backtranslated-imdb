I did not expect much when I went to see this, but my god what a disappointment. The original was quite amusing in its genre, but it's so bad that I felt deceived when I left the theater. There is no conspiracy, it is not funny, it is not pleasant to look at, it is quite embarrassing. After an hour, I hoped that my patience would be rewarded, but now I regret not having left the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore it, see it when it comes to the small screen. Or see it on the budget DVD, whatever you do do not waste money on it. Do not say I did not warn you.
