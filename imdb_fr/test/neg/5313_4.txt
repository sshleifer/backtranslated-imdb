John Travolta resumes his role as Chile Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who is now turning to the music sector. Using his "negotiating skills", he tries to run an independent label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and tries to get a hit record from his young singer (Christina Milian). <br /> <br /> Before seeing this sequel, I had heard it was a terrible movie. However, Be Cool remains a nice comedy even if it is not as powerful as the original. The film focuses this time on the music industry rather than the film industry. The music industry is very poorly described in the film and uses a lot of lame stereotypes. I can not say whether it was the intention or not, since Get Shorty did a good job of parodying the film industry. The same thing can not be said for the future and the attempts just come as lazy. <br /> <br /> An impressive cast is what saves the sinking film. The best performance is given by The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different kind of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a fun performance although he started to be annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta is coming back as Chile and he is doing a good job. His performance is rather boring. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she is not very good singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance although he is not in the film very long. There are also a lot of cameos, including Steven Tyler and James Wood. <br /> <br /> F. Gary Gray runs and does a bad job. He just does not handle the movie very well and the movie is a little messy. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after a while. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are many slow points. The film needed to be badly edited and this was clearly not the case. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to go beyond the direction and the low scenario and deliver fun scenes. Sometimes the film was too much effort, while at other times it was pretty funny. Compared to the original, the suite is not up to par. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth being rented and that's it. Rating 6/10
