Slight scam of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): the first half is deadly dull, even dull - but the last stages improve considerably with the scenes featuring the raging monster. In the featurette that accompanies it (a rather dry affair only 9 minutes compared to the one created for the other titles of the set "Monsters & Madmen" of Criterion), the director Day - who confesses not to be a fan of the science -fiction genre - tries to justify the shortcomings of the film by claiming that it worked with a zero budget (where all the scenes of the space were composed of archive footage!) ... and I would have tended to be more lenient with the I had not watched recently the movie CALTIKI, THE MONSTER IMMORTAL (1959) - a similar adventure (and similar to nudity) but much more elegant Italy! <br /> <br /> Bill Edwards as an arrogant but unlucky astronaut - obsessed with the realization of the incumbent's exercise - is frankly boring at first, but he eventually manages to arouse public sympathy when his physical traits are distorted and the character acquires a taste for blood! Marshall Thompson, as Commander and Elder Brother, is O.K. as a thinner guy Glenn Ford; he had already played in FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958), another (and more successful) sci-fi film produced by Richard Gordon, which, by the way, is also available on DVD via Criterion. Italian starlet Marla Landi, struggling with the English language, creates an insufficient female role; even his contribution to the featurette proves to be of little lasting value! <br /> <br /> The audio commentary is another pleasing title of Tom Weaver / Richard Gordon, which highlights the fact that FIRST MAN INTO SPACE had to duplicate CORRIDORS OF BLOOD (1958). up - but it was finally released as a standalone version, in order to exploit the current value of the race to the current space; It is also mentioned that the dialogue on monsters was doubled by Bonar Colleano (tragically died in a car accident before the release of the film!). Weaver even remembers some anecdotes from the days when he was involved in the production of the DVD featurette made by former cult filmmaker Norman J. Warren: Landi, who was then a titular lady, was always ready to help to carry the necessary equipment to film the interview down several stairs! Edwards was supposed to have helped, but once in London he was reluctant to cooperate with Weaver. He finally learned that the actor had recently been diagnosed with cancer and died in 2002!
