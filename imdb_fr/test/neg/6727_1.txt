First: I like S Segal! But in this movie, he hit the bottom and started digging! <br /> <br /> THE GROUND What plot? Intrigue very strange and improbable. <br /> <br /> THE ACTION is below the standards of Segals! <br /> <br /> THE GOOD PARTIES Mr. Segal is a pro. And show it.

The only realistic part is where ... (see the spoiler part). <br /> <br /> PART SPOILER (stop reading here if you plan to see the movie!) - - - Gas leak? Sensational. Disable a "Black-box" recorder in a hotel room? I work in the industry, laughable! The villain 'goes away', it's true in life!
