This movie starts really strong. We know that Roberts is an Atlanta specialist sent to Australia to solve Coke's marketing problems. We also know that he is an eccentric genius. Roberts' fine interpretation convinces us pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the plot is so fragile that any successful development of the character has been canceled by gaps, inconsistencies and completely boring movie sequences. <br /> <br /> Generally, I am a sucker for bold and distant intrigues. The examples I like are, among others, "Dark Star", "O.C. & Stiggs" and "Popeye". Coupled with the fact that I must admit that this film was well played, it surprises me even that I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> The total breaking of this film occurs in the middle of the film. All the comedy is instantly lost and the film turns black. Then the film moves on. The movie's attempt to revive comedy is not a success. More surprises await the viewer and they are even darker. <br /> <br /> Associating drama with comedy can certainly be a formula for success. However, with this film, the result is about as successful as the "new coke".
