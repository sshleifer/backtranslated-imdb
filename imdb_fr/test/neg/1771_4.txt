It is a species that already hatches in a beautiful model (Mathilda May). A shattering baby with a desire to kiss and kill! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a powerful launch, and is infected with a vein virus in the middle at the end. <br /> <br /> The weakest spot is the presentation of the plot / story base. As you should have compared it, Natasha Henstridge's species have the same plot, but add a very interesting parallel plot and do not mention good deeds or a powerful clymatic ending. <br /> <br /> That explains why Patrick Stewart joined the corporate fleet. in Star Trek Next Generation; he wanted to find more models in a glass cage, floating inside Halley-Comet. <br /> <br /> A must for science fiction fans.
