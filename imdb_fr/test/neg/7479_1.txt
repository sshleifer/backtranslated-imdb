He seems to be a control freak. I heard him comment "lose control of the show" and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had a rule: "no snakes". He needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame. The only reason I look at it is because it has great guests and good bands. <br /> <br /> I watched Craig Ferguson's show for a while, but his show was even worse. He loves bull ** to save time. I do not think either man has a lot of future in night talk shows. <br /> <br /> The daily is also used to boring tongue to lick his lips. He must do it at least 10 times per show. I like the group Joe Firstman. Carson Daily needs to clear up before it's too late.
