I do not understand why people rent this movie. I did not like it at all. I watch it with several people. None of them cared either. First of all. It is simply obvious that another low budget studio is trying to capitalize on a big name story. The shoot looks like a live TV interview. Makeup is bad. When watching the movie with the extras of the DVD. You will find that the people who participated in it are very enthusiastic. There is no talent. There are facts that appear in the book. The facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and sketches added to it. I read several books and watched several shows on this story. What I have always understood from all the documents on this subject is that it was a serious horror story. I really wish someone could really make a good movie about this one. It has always fascinated me. The bad game really ruined the story. The situation of the little boys really hammered it even more. When you watch this movie. The boy and his problem are what you and your friends will remember and laugh about. It made no sense why his brothers were laughing at what had happened to him. It was as if the witch was supposed to be so threatening, but it was nice to throw her the little brother. It's a huge story with him and his little problem. I still can not forget the little girl saying "Mom said that tobacco would make your teeth rot". Frank Fox's statement and his facial expression are so bad. The scene in the yard where he takes food is pretty stupid. The sound of some parts seems to come from the psycho movie. In addition, the girl hovering over the bed and her little "bladder control problem" come from The Exorcist. This film lacks the talent of creativity. We filmed the movie for a few minutes and immediately knew it was disappointing. I also noticed that their flaws were in the quality of the film. Some parts looked like a person could film with a home video camera. I noticed that many people in the credits had several jobs. It's probably how this film was put together. Someone said that I like this story. I'm going to get all my friends and make a movie with a video camera and a computer. It does not matter if we do not know how to act. As long as we film and say it's good. We reunited the family and prepared food. Then sat and watched this failed attempt to make a movie.
