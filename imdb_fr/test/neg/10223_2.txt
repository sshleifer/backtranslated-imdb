Walt was particularly fond of quality. So, how is it that Disney producers publish a movie craze so terribly mounted and acted (even for the family price!)? THE GREEN GREEN had a good concept. And, since this is Disney, you know how the movie will unfold obviously. But GREAT GREEN is horrible. The jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, presents another dreadful performance in his resume. <br /> <br /> In the small town of Elma, children who have too much time to lose are given the opportunity to play football. The children do not know anything though. And, graceful for us, we see Steve Guttenburg trying to flirt with the teacher from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Accelerating work with the camera does not work. THE GREEN GREEN accelerates the pace of the characters to advance the film. Children are not idiots. They will understand if you give them a hint without showing all that garbage. Guttenburg, for once in his life, should have refused an offer to join this film. Pretty Olivia d'Abo should have called this one too. GREAT GREEN can be called "the big bomb".
