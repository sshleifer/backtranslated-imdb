If you live in the suburbs, are relatively wealthy financially and do not have much contact with city life in England, this is the comedy that suits you. It's not something that would suit a mass audience, but if you're like these characters, they'll show you're going to love it in pieces. Overall, this is a comedy to which the BBC snobs will sit to laugh and for their pleasure and only a few privileged. Compared to BBC comedies such as Only Fools and Horses, Fawlty Towers, Black Adder and other classics, this series tends to move away from the usual BBC product and adapt to a rather folkloric culture.
