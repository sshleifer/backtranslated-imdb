Once, I had a conversation with my parents who told me that British moviegoers in the 1940s and 1950s would check to see the country of origin of a film before going to see it. Regardless of the nature of the plot or its contents, if it was an American film, people would like to see it and if it was the British people, they would not want to see it. This may sound like a ridiculous generalization, but after seeing THE COASTONISHED HEART, I can understand why, at that time, people preferred American cinema to the local variety. In the 1940s <br /> <br /> British fairness was devoid of working class members and it shows in this movie. Everyone speaks with an English accent, that of da da daa, which makes the British royal family look like a scum of the working class, which alienates a large part of the potential British public who would probably prefer to look at Jimmy Cagney in WHITE HEAT because people would have, If it was not related to then certainly certainly sympathetic with a violent gangster in kinematic terms more than a high-class English narrowing in 1949. It's the distraction, the reason why people go to the movies. Even the names of the characters seem weird - Leonora! How many Britons were named Leonora in 1949? And the protagonists drink cocktails. And they use words like "austere". You have the feeling that it was not marketed to a majority British audience of 1949. But why would it do so if the majority of British moviegoers queued in cinemas to watch much more entertaining American imports? <br /> <br /> Looking at THE ATSONISHED HEART in 2005, I was amazed at how dated everything was. In fact, it's so dated that I thought it might be a parody of THE HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW. What did not surprise me was that these types of films nearly sank the UK film industry, an industry that did not pick up until US money invested in commercials like ZULU , ALFIE and James Bond movies.
