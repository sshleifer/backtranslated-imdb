Yet another TV show becomes a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays with Maxwell Smart, a sombrelance agent, in such a bad movie that it's the worst movie you've ever seen become the second worst film you've ever seen. The seventh hypothesis, if you can call it, has a megalomaniac trying to conquer the world. It's so funny, it's absolutely pathetic. As for the one thing that Anne Hathaway does as Agent 99, it looks good - she seems unable to do anything else. Bill Murray has the good sense to limit his screen time to about 90 seconds and a few faces of the television series appear in very small roles. The film is supposed to be both thriller and action movie. This is neither. Even though I was really not a fan of the TV series, at least it was light years away from this piece. All this is just dragging in the mud and depreciate the good memories we had. Thank God, Don Adams is not here to see him. Continue like this in Hollywood! Keep doing crappy movies like this and keep sending them to the multiplexes once a week. No wonder the film industry is collapsing. This film is so rotten, it's not even good to laugh. If this film was a newspaper, it could be used to cover the bottom of a birdcage. There is absolutely no reason to see this movie. A root canal is nicer than that. Note - zero minus five stars. Unless you are a masochist, stay away. Better yet, do what the title says - be smart and save your nine dollars. You will be able to buy about 2 gallons of gasoline with it. Put it in your car and be grateful not to have wasted it in a multiplex to see this bomb!
