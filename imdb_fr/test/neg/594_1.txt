Do not waste your money or time. Terrible film. Bad game, plot in every way. Really, really bad actor. Dude, this movie is just bad. I turned it off at 7 minutes. The scenario is bad, the staging is bad, it seems to me that a group of high school students met to make a theater project. Yes, it's so bad. The acting is not convincing at all, notice that I saw only 7 minutes. How this film was burned on DVD, it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> It should have been left in the storage room. I saw the cover and I found it rather cool, I will not do it the next time: _)
