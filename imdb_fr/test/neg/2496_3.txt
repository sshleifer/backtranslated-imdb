The United States built the atomic bomb to show their superior military might and end World War II. The film Fat Man and Little Boy describes the efforts of American physicists to invent the technology needed to create the bomb, as well as the tension between scientists and the military over the potential uses of the bomb, and even the acceptability of its creation. Scientists thought that the bomb should be created as a deterrent, a mechanism that would end the war by wasting as few lives as possible. Fist, they saw themselves in a race against German scientists who were trying to build nuclear weapons themselves. After the defeat of the Germans, many scientists hoped to stop work on the bomb project, knowing that the Japanese did not have the technology to build a nuclear weapon and therefore did not pose a threat of loss of life. Those who favored the continuation of the Manhattan project hoped that the bomb would be used for demonstration purposes, inviting the Japanese head of state to see its deployment on a tiny island deserted. They felt that this massive demonstration of force would be enough to win the war - no murder would be necessary. The US military, under the leadership of General Leslie Groves, still hoped to use the bomb as a real weapon to use against the enemy, first against the Germans, then against the Japanese. Due to the persistence of Japanese soldiers in small Japanese islands, the United States decided to land the bomb on populated cities in order to end the war, first in Hiroshima, then in Nagasaki. The deployment of this mass of force also informed the rest of the world that the United States was the dominant military power, a message especially to Russia, whose growing military strength and economic weight in Eurasia threatened our pre-eminent world position. . Fat Man and Little Boy was a film that had good intentions in mind, but misunderstood by the choice of actors, scenario and cinematography. One of the main points of the film was the struggle between the military vision of science to kill and the scientific vision of science for knowledge. Persistent disagreements between General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer are the cornerstone of this conflict. Mr. Newman does his job in the role of the general, shredded, enormously angry and radiating from his dependence on the success of the project. Dwight Schultz, on the other hand, never really resists the demands of the general, always looking rather weak, deflated and phlegmatic in his audience. John Cusack presents an incredibly unfriendly character in a role as flat as I have ever seen - it looks like he just reads his lines. Laura Dern seems to be suffering from the same illness. The scenario, which is almost ridiculous in its way of explaining scientific concepts in a scientific way, does not help the characters. It offers the most unrealistic stock relationship between Mr. Cusack and Ms. Dern, we can not even afford the cheapest. Thrill to watch the army drop nuclear bombs on Japan, and rely heavily on a technique that hurts at any moment, even to explain a character with deepest deep thoughts, or for narration of something that can not be shown on the film backing, but is used here to read absolutely banal snippets of Cusack's diary. The director of photography offers us several snapshots of the ominous shadow of the two bombs, which might be striking if they did not look like cardboard cutouts rather than bombs, the fake atomic fire really looks fake, and why use it when the stock footage in hand is really beautiful and realistic - and the invading brown tone does not seem to be appropriate from a thematic point of view. Other than that, it's not a bad movie.
