Lisa Grant (Adrienne Barbeau) is a real estate agent who risks being killed by a disturbed maniac who kills people of his profession who, in his opinion, push up real estate prices at a price too high. Depending on the motivations, this is delayed. Lisa's boyfriend happens to be a talk show host that the killer continues to call on air. At first, I was convinced that it was supposed to be a comedy or a satire, but since the endless minutes were buzzing again and again, I realized that was not the case and that the movie was quite incompetent in every way. . I'm just surprised that something so horrible was not done by Jeff Lieberman (yes, send me a hate mail again, Jeff hack you). Anyway, poor movie, poor Barbeau, you can locate EXACTLY his film career. fell into flames and everything started here. <br /> <br /> My note: F <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: The Movie Channel
