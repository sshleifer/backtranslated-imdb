I did not hate this one. I just could not adapt to the story. it did not really take me. Michael Mann is a very good director, but I disagree with his methods in this regard. I am also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. Some projects in which he has been made are quite disappointing, but his acting is brilliant. My favorite films from Daniel Day Lewis are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I loved about it: the musical score that gave the movie a lot of atmosphere. That's about all I liked. this film also has a high vote that is a bit random. I can see that not many people will like this, but not enough to get an overall score of 7.8. <br /> <br /> I would like to miss this movie if I have been you but there are a lot of high votes for that so I guess you should watch and make your own opinion about what you think. I did not really like it ............. 4/10 ............. j.d Seaton
