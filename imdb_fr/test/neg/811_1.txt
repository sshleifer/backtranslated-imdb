Installed in 1945, Skenbart follows a failing Swedish book publisher who decides to take a non-stop train to Berlin. Unfortunately for everyone around him, it is a walking disaster that causes chaos wherever he goes. The train also contains a man and his mistress murdering his wife (who is also on the train), a soldier on the way home, two gay gentlemen, an angry train driver, two nuns, a group of refugees and even more people. <br /> <br /> Designed as a mix of black-ish thriller (which he does very well - at least initially), and comedy, the film fails with both. It's not going as the film changes tone with each new scene. And as the train gets closer to its final destination, the film becomes more and more weird and ends on a truly surreal note. <br /> <br /> The good pieces are wasted in a myriad of intrigues and useless characters. Skenbart is full of famous Swedish actors, whatever their size. We have the impression that the filmmakers called everyone they worked with and gave them a role in the film. Too bad the performance is as bad as the scenario (act your lines - do not read them!). <br /> <br /> The comedy is more or less tedious, the same jokes being repeated. The pace is incredibly slow at times (quite often, in fact), with a particular slowness on the stage for about ten minutes without good reason. The screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace a decent dialogue. The film may be beautiful, in black and white, but it is wasted in making films as incompetent in all other departments. [1/10]
