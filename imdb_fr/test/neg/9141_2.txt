It's such a complete failure that it makes me angry. <br /> <br /> All the subtlety and structure of Reggio's early films have disappeared, leaving only a heap of digitally stained images whose sole purpose seems to be Whining About the bad things that humans do. How do Star Trek wormhole graphics, slo-mo colorized seascapes, multiple icons of fake computer icons, and sports competition plans that, incidentally, show that no one has ever been able to defeat Leni Riefenstahl moving film bodies, mounted with a video coloring overlay that a producer of "Dr. Who" of the 1980s would have rejected as "too nerdy", he added to a polemic against "civilized violence"? There is no intellectual, emotional or visceral connection between these images assembled and mutated by Reggio and far too many digital effects artists, and the edifying narrative that I suppose he wanted to produce. With all the "dramaturgical consultants" involved, no one seems to have made the most of his own sense of saying something important and considered that they could all not be able to say anything new. <br /> <br /> Only people who watch too much television can make such a film and believe that it is meaningful; this is the Stan Brakhage kindergarten and, ultimately, ruthless in its flawless evidence. The only obvious irony and tension here (unlike "Koyaanisqatsi" where the implacable beauty and strangeness of ordinary images altered by time forced you to consider their meaning) was when the DVD I was watching was stuck and jumped. It's MTV for Noam Chomsky's crowd, based on reflex rather than thinking and meaningless. Two stars for the music, in the best pomo-Cesar Franck style of Glass and featuring a passionate cello of Yo-Yo Ma. (I hope for him that he did not have to record his parts during reading the movie, there are some things you should not have to do, even for a salary.)
