I had high hopes for this movie, even though I had not read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together - it should already be good. But the film does not keep its promise. I was expecting more depth for the characters and there was none. I have no problem with the fact that it only took them one weekend to fall in love. It can happen. But we never really know the characters. I would have liked more focus on them. The movie reminded me of places in Bridges of Madison County, and this movie was much better. I really felt for the characters in this movie, and there was a chemistry (a lot more passion) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep than there was between Gere and Lane. Each of them are very good actors in their own right. Just not the good movie for them together.
