The story briefly mentions the priest, Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), a businessman and devoid of all faith, who takes a closer look at the case of another priest suspected of murder. The priest denies being guilty, but he can not speak for reasons of confidentiality. Enter Daniel Clemens who starts playing cop ... <br /> <br /> If the plot is not ridiculous, everything else. Let's start with the visual side, cinematography is dull, it looks more like a television series than a movie. The camera angles are boring, in fact, there is not a single memorable camera angle throughout the movie. There are no interesting close-ups revealing details. And the scenes are changing, well, there is not much to say about them, they are not smooth at all, there seems to be no connection between the scenes, but the plot . Okay, they used a transition with the music between two scenes, but there are no interesting visual transitions in the whole movie, the times dissolve, there was no visual connection between the scenes. <br /> <br /> The Boring visual part could be forgiven if the film offered anything else. Unfortunately, the film only offers forced wooden games and clumsy dialogues, without punch. In addition to this, the film suffers from audio problems, the sound volume is lowered several times in the film, as if the microphones were too far away. <br /> <br /> I did not foresee the solution of the film. It may be because the film never gave me the opportunity or because of the presentation, which was so boring that I never even tried to understand. <br /> <br /> Gather two plus two B-movies where 'B' means boring.
