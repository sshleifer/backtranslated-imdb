I like to think that I saw everything. SS DOOMTROOPER. The one on a family of saber-toothed tigers. The one on a family of pteranodons. Goat eater. DEMON CHILD (rubber doll for non-animated children, with horns glued to the head, several SASQUATCH movies, no voucher, a couple of giant spider / insect movies, an infinite HELLRAISER suite, an endless suite of LEPRAUCHAN. An infinite sequel to JASON, a thorny spruce 'EM, which actually speaks of a parade of urban streets recorded on someone's $ 199 camcorder, and so on, I watched a part of a STV the other night about people stuck in a desert island on a kickboxing to death with a group of badly animated totems.I even attended DREAMCATCHER, as recently as last night - well, I should say that I I saw parts of it after seeing it in all its glory years ago, but nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of young people trapped on an island during a storm, forced to fight with extraterrestrials who arrive in a m t√©orite. The meteorite appears to be from a cartoon Superman 1940s Aliens are too. and writing is just as bad. I turned it off halfway. Good luck.
