It's the most pitiful excuse for a comedy show I've ever seen. I'm confused that this guy had his own show. It feels total and absolute despair on the part of Central Comedy, who is trying to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable Dave Chapelle. It's a trick of the golden bag of Ned's comedy: A punchline is not it funny? Need to give an extra boost to hilarity? F *** ING YELL IT AT THE HEART OF YOUR LUNGS. Simple, no? And as an added bonus ... complete half of your jokes with ... THEN YOU ARE RE-TAH-DED !! or DUH-DU-DUUUUHHHH! Oh man. So funny. Beaner ... hilarious. Back to anchorage .... does laughter ever stop? <br /> <br /> To illustrate my point in a more cerebral way, I will give an example. Mencia jokes that he is "delayed" to rebuild New Orleans because it is so close to the water. Genius. The dividing line between a great comedian and a hack has never been so clearly defined. While a good comedian would find humor hidden in the tragedy, finding subtle ways to turn a joke into something we can all laugh at and console, Ned goes for the obvious. Move the city. Awesome. Wait, is it funny? Ned does not have the intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things. The hurricane did not flood the city, ned. The dike project was underfunded and badly needed federal dollars ... and here! They broke. I guess it's God's way of telling us that we should not be here. After all, he has a seat at the congress. What an imbecile. <br /> <br /> Chapel was a master to turn a tired racial comedy on his head. He made no effort and in every way we laughed with him. While mencia talks about the fact that Blacks can not swim * yawn, * Chapel pushed her 300 meters away with the black and blind white supremist. You do not have to be scathing to be pissed off. You must be original. <br /> <br /> Mencia and his legions of fans are like that gay guy who laughs too loud jokes jokes, thinking that it masks somehow his own insecurities. Except of course, with Ned, he laughs too much at the "delays". Du-duuuuh.
