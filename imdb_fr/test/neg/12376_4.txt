I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I remember that the most frightening scene was that of the big bird eater of men who were helplessly hanging parachutes. The horror. The horror. <br /> <br /> When I was young and going to these nonsense films on Saturday afternoons, I was always tired of the formula of these monstrous movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful girl of a teacher and a happy resolution when the monster died at the end. I did not care about the romantic angle at the age of 12 and predictable intrigues. I like them now for unintentional humor. <br /> <br /> But about a year later, I saw Psycho when he came out and I loved that star, Janet Leigh, fell early in the movie. . I sat down and took note at that time. Since the writers compose the story, make it as frightening as possible and not a worn out formula. There are no rules.
