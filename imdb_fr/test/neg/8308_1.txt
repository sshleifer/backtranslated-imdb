I watched DEATH MACHINES as part of "BCI Eclipse Drive-in cult classics" (with Crown International Pictures versions) on DVD. As I go through multiple DVD games, I begin to enjoy many of the films from Crown International - especially the scary, erotic psychological thrillers! <br /> <br /> DEATH MACHINES is not one of them. <br /> <br /> After watching movies like MALIBU BEACH, THE CREEPING TERROR and THE PINK ANGELS, it's hard to say it's the worst movie. never done; but he does not have much to do. <br /> <br /> No plot; really no story to tell. <br /> <br /> The acting is not obvious ?? Only the actor responsible for the very played Tony (with the thick and italian false accent) tried to "penetrate into the character". <br /> <br /> The score is annoying and pedantic. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this film is why ... why did the filmmakers have to make this movie? <br /> <br /> Did they think the story of: 1) three ninjas, 2) two crime bosses in competition, 3) a bartender / karate student character; and 4) her pitiful nurse in love was so convincing that the world would not be complete without this movie? <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time and money for you, me, the producers, the writers, the actors and the director.
