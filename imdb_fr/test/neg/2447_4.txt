Standard "Epidemic in a remote area, the film is supported by an expert on vacation in the region". There are only a few deviations from the norm. The first is that the children involved are quite reasonable from the start. They are usually monsters who repeatedly erase works until they redeem themselves at the end. Another is that the local healer / sorcerer, who is normally a hindrance early in life, is never completely neglected or redeemed in the end. Perhaps, since this seems to have been done for the faith-based PAX channel, they did not want to sound too critical of the faithful. Finally, there were no evil local politicians or big DIYers in the entertainment industry trying to hide everything. The absence of these stereotypes was refreshing - if we are to thank the PAX channel, I should perhaps taste a little more of their offers. Apart from that, however, it was pretty standard. You have seen everything before.
