Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist visiting England, picks up a hiker one night. Two years later, after discovering the man's address book in his car, he sends him back to the man's manly house only to find that the man was hanged for murder. No one in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch-hiker could not have committed the murder (of his own mother-in-law) because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime. <br /> Sutherland is the man's alibi, but he arrived too late. Guilty, he tracks down the real murderer. <br /> <br /> The mysteries of Agatha Christie usually involve a number of diverse people, all motivated by crime or suspected, all suspicious, and an enigma that depends on the construction of a strict timeline. There is often, not always, a sidekick with whom the interviewer can speak. <br /> <br /> Because of the crushing nature of the situation, care must be taken to explain each element of the mystery to the reader or viewer. The redundancy is in perfect agreement. We must keep the characters and the time lines straight. Christie's films are rare in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is really useful. (Jacqueline de Bellefort? Oh, yes, it's Mia Farrow.) But this version of "Ordeal by Innocence" is a Golan-Globus production, with everything that implies in terms of production values, a carefully prepared scenario and a skill behind the camera. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes, during which Sutherland discovers that an innocent man was hanged, are fine. After that, everything is thrown on the viewer in the form of incoherent notes, often in the form of flashbacks or confusing voiceovers that do not tell us anything. The script has a quality of slapdash, as if thrown together by two hacks during the night. Few faces are familiar and it does not help. Everyone drops remarks about everyone and the names become a hopeless clutter. The score consists of four instruments playing irritating atonal jazz riffs. Nudity is planned to wake the bulldozers in the audience. If Lady Agatha were alive, she would be part of the viewers to awaken. <br /> <br /> Dullsville.
