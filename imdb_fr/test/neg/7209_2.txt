SPOILERS: The original Road House is one of those films that I know to be clich√© and unoriginal, yet it's so well done that I'm embarrassed to admit that I really love it. It turns out that many of my friends, whose film opinions I respect, think the same way. So when they try to make a sequel and it's as if it were written by high school students who were given the right to do a sequel, it's just bad; really, really bad. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Johnathon Schaech is on the list of authors and I can only hope that his membership in WGA will be revoked. The writing was just bad and all the writers of this film should retire for total lack of originality and one of the worst dialogues of this millennium. Schaech already appears as the king of the DVD sequel (8mm 2, Poison Ivy 2) and now, after seeing this and 8mm 2, I think that his actress ability is nonexistent. He was awful, just awful. <br /> <br /> And it's not the terrible fight scenes that make this movie terrible, but take it from me, they're bad. Each fight scene is a slow punch (while still emitting the "wiff" sound in the air) which is then blocked by the opponent, who sends a punch that sends the first player to the ground. This is repeated throughout the movie, worse than a bad show from the 1970s cops. Or the fact that many people involved in the fights seem to have a mouth full of cherry kool-aid for some reason. And we are supposed to believe that Will Patton is a fighting machine. his fight scenes look so incredibly wrong that I was honestly embarrassed to watch. <br /> <br /> It's the total lack of logic in this ridiculous film that makes it terrible. For example: the character of Johnathon Schaech is in town for a day and already tells a girl that he hardly knows he does not know which side it is: "I'm with the feds, but do not tell nobody." The wicked, who fights the good girl in a fight scene with acrobatics that rival any superhero, is nevertheless easily held in check by Will Patton, the "old man", in another scene by simply holding both hands while he utters a word line ("stab me once, shame on you, stab me twice, it will not happen" phew, it's bad) and then give him a head shot . Jake Busey's villain pulls on the federal government while trapped in drug trafficking. Yet no DEA agent or anyone just comes in and picks it up. In fact, he simply let it go because "it's the sheriff's territory". Busey wants the bar because it is "very well located" for drug trafficking, but his own house seems to be just as good, apparently, offering all the benefits that the bar is supposed to have. The character of Johnathon Schaech is supposed to be the son of the character of Patrick Swayze in the original, but the surname of the character of Swayze is Dalton and that of Schaech is not (nor the supposed brother of the character of Swayze) . And Johnathon Schaech seems to be about 50 years old in this film. I looked, he's 17 years younger than Swayze, but he looks horrible. <br /> <br /> But my absolutely stupid favorite scene in this movie was the most racist scene that ends in the movies: the villain is knocked down the window of the second floor and stooping, I say "do not me do not say that his impaling is impressed ... "and my worst fears have come true. <br /> <br /> could go on for half an hour on the things I hated about this movie. Suffice to say that we will put an end to these ridiculous sequences of DVD movies, at least those with Johnathon Schaech.
