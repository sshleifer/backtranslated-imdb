I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and could not really understand those who did not like it. But I can not defend this nonsense. The spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> The first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis: <br /> <br /> So if Starbuck thinks she knows where the Earth is, why do not send it to a raptor? Would the Admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? Would the college elect its new member, the unelected Adama Junior? He has about three weeks of political experience to his credit and is the son of a man they mistrust. Would Adama send Gaeta ET Halo with Starbuck, which would save him senior officers? Would Adama want to have a man have sex with Cylon prisoners responsible for the fleet? <br /> <br /> I do not buy anything of it. <br /> <br /> Second, while I accept, been miracles and references to God until the end of season 3, everything is now totally exaggerated. I started watching BG because I thought it was science fiction, not a biblical epic. I expected the characters to continue to behave in a reasonably intelligent manner and wished for a satisfying explanation of some of the strangest developments in the series. <br /> <br /> Baltar was the best character in the series, but now he seems to be completely crazy. Not illogical given what he experienced, but very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem to be just puppets dancing at the request of an unknown third party (an entity worthy of God). It's not a good drama, it's boring and a cop of writing. <br /> <br /> OK, what are the positives? Nice battle at the beginning of 4.1. Some good dramatic scenes (well played) seen in isolation. A good final scene, a beautiful curved curve of development. <br /> <br /> But it's not Sci Fi, it's become Fantasy. I can not imagine how the authors can recover this one.
