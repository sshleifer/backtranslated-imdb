The Evil speaks of a big house where an evil spirit is stupidly released to torture everything inside. What a wash of a movie! There is not one scary scene. Not one! Richard Crenna overhangs a nil role. There are animated ghosts, electric saw disfigurement and ghost rape. After nothing special happens for almost the entire movie The Evil is personified in ... Victor Buono. Awesome! Where did the filmmakers get the idea that Buono was scary? He seems to be on the ass for a guest with a pay check to pay his alcohol bill. At this point, it's too late to turn it off, because the damn thing is over. I wanted to throw the videocassette out the window. Please avoid this junk! Let's hope that he will never see the light of a DVD and that it will melt in the darkness.
