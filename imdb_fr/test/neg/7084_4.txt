This film has a lot of action and little heart. Let's forget for a minute that we are wrong in almost every aspect of the Russian revolution. After all, we only have less than an hour to tell our story. In fact, the tsar abdicated after the First World War was a disaster for the country and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists came to power nine months later, mainly because they had promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now, back to our story. <br /> <br /> We have here the "rumor" of the revolution in the Russian newspapers in what seems to be still a country in activity until the violence breaks out suddenly and disrupts the life of the noble Baron Nikita ' Nikki 'Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). He fled his house with his old maidservant Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll), and they begin to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution, the baron had become accustomed to playing for the girl, not out of passion, but out of boredom, like a diversion. The revolution does not change that and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. This certainly does not make the audience like this guy seeing him play with her in this way. Tanyusha follows the baroness because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries have taken over her house, and she has not known any other life than to expect with all her heart Nikki. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly gets tired of the life of a penniless worker. It was then that he met his former lover, the Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who had a plan to take them to Paris where the Tsarists rallied after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan does not include it. <br /> <br /> This film manages to completely ruin the considerable acting skills of young walkie-talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with the little we give her, but it's not a lot. Lilyan Tashman is the star here, although she has only a small role as a Russian vamp Vera. Lilyan has so often been given supportive roles, just as she is here, but her serene voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in which she appears. Guy Kibbee is even humorous as an American tourist curious about the Russian royalty forcibly expelled from his country.
