I'm thinking of some things for this movie: First, it's really a very bad movie. It's really "Superbad". The film looked very promising in the trailers but had fallen flat ... The initial idea was perhaps good, but between a bad scenario and a bad interpretation, the film became boring and empty. My advice is not to waste 2 hours of your precious time. You were warned. This is the first movie that I rated 1 star on IMDb.com ... Second, none of the characters is nice. You do not really care what happened to them ... Thirdly, the bad guy is very easy to identify. The grandson kills his father, sodomizes the son of the friend, puts the pregnant maid, stifles his grandfather ... As JT says: "If you love evil without retribution, this is your film" . Nothing else to say...
