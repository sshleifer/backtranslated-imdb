A nice line of actors and a conspiracy apparently nice - although not original - promised me a good evening in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors were up to it (Juliette Lewis still hugs, William Hurt solid but in the background, Shelley Duvall still convincing) but the story was too skinny to keep me engaged in the story and the turn to the final was too obvious . and too late there was only one character who was nice to her, so guess what ?! Then, the last after-twist ?? I do not know what to think of that. The boyfriend and the neighbor? Do you contract with the devil, or just to have her move in? What! The film had a good idea behind, but the idea was not elaborated in detail. It could have been good, but it was not. Columbo would say too many loose ends to tie.
