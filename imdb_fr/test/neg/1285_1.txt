What a waste of precious time! My 5 year old daughter brought her from my mother's house and we watched her as a family. None of us liked. This miserable little film, full of blatant incoherence, evocative Christian themes and horrible film quality, does not deserve to be watched, even with a challenge. It looked a bit like a bad attempt to shoot high school theater movies. How sad to see talented actors (Chris Atkins, Gary Busey and the company) making their way through this banal and tasteless intrigue. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. The film could have gone directly to the pound. Avoid this movie - your time is better spent watching dry paint.
