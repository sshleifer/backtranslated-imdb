This film breathes the planning of the production line. It seems that filmmakers have watched recent hit movies and threw spaghetti on screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Baby! Plane! - ROLL 'EM! - The film deals with the age of the Stewart / Allyson performers; however, I'm sure we're still supposed to think they're much younger. <br /> <br /> There are messages in the "Strategic Air Command" that I found oddly shocking and offensive, but I will stick to one that is really miserable. Element: The happy married couple is challenged when Mr. Stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife. In the most dramatic scene of the film, she calls him. It ends completely unresolved - Allyson cries on her bed and Stewart joins her. NO discussion; he just says he's right and leaves his devastated wife. As far as he knows, she could cut her wrists. <br /> <br /> Later, Allyson apologizes for questioning her husband's decision. <br /> <br /> Amazing! <br /> <br /> Stand with Stewart-Allyson in "The Stratton Story" (1949). <br /> <br /> ** Strategic Air Command (25/03/55) Anthony Mann ~ James Stewart, June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy
