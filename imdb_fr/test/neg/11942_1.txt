I remember that years ago, Michael Douglas wanted his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, to participate in a romantic film because he felt that his wife had all the goods. No doubt she does, but NOT in this movie. A colossal waste of time, no history, no character development, no chemistry, nada. It was not the vehicle we were all hoping this movie would be, boring and a huge disappointment. Did not even watch the whole movie, torture. Catherine Zeta-Jones was obviously trained to work in a kitchen, to move, to present a dish, but it was not the food web, nothing learned here and once her counterpart appeared, supposedly a romantic interest, where was the chemistry. The poor beast on the second floor of his building was trying to connect all the stratagems and no character development there. The loss of her sister was misinterpreted because she knew there was closeness. The sister's daughter had just fallen here and there with something that was supposed to attract you, NOT. Just a waste of movie time. The promoters have certainly done their job to put this film without brilliance on all networks that tempt you with all kinds of teasers. Sorry to say, do not spend a dime.
