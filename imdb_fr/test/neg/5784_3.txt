Navy Seals is an ignorant, racist and complacent film that unconsciously uses the Middle East conflict as a backdrop for an action film concocted for a comfortably sheltered Midwestern audience. The conflict, as well as the people involved, simply serve as cannon fodder to glorify the photogenic young Americans who proudly kill the Arabs for the sake of "freedom". But what's worse is that the action scenes of the movie are badly held and not exciting, which prevents the Navy Seals from functioning even as a senseless shoot-up. <br /> <br /> The character of Charlie Sheen (Hawkins) is disgusting, obnoxious, ignorant, reckless and above all racist. He describes the Middle East as a "t-hole" and its inhabitants as "rag heads". Throughout the film, the characters of the Navy Seals are glorified by the use of Lebanese natives as cannon fodder. They blindly slaughter these people with an attitude without consequences. There is even the tasteless murder of a young Lebanese boy who is shot by Hawkins; Hawkins makes fun of his tongue before shooting him while making another humorous story. In addition to being tasteless, this should be unacceptable. The extreme (though predictable) pro-American stance of the film is also revolting. This is seen when the American-Lebanese journalist informed Hawkins that terrorists can not speak because they are religious fanatics. Hawkins replies, "Yes, and we are the Navy Seals!" The implication is obviously that fanatics do not make sense alongside American military power. Moreover, even after insulting the journalist's racial legacy and treating her as a sexual object, the script asks her not to be able to resist this disgusting thug and she always ends up sleeping with him because he is an American Navy Seal. This marginalizes the journalist's character by making her subject to Hawkins' pro-American "superior" attitude, despite her insulting behavior towards her. Beyond ethics, this plot also has little credibility as a theater. <br /> <br /> The scenario is also amateurish. Most of the scenes are simply related to each other, without any thought for the mood, plot or development of the character. The "music video" scene on the golf course, for example, is just a mediocre treat for the eyes. And the two scenes where Charlie Sheen plays the reckless hero are also useless. In one, he jumps from the deck of a moving car just to show his companion how difficult it is, and in the other, he pursues a tow truck on a motorcycle and drives it out of it. No scenes have follow-up anti-climaxes, both are highly unlikely and none have any influence on the plot as a whole. They are just candy designed as a way to showcase Hawkins' heroic American heroic exploits and hardly replace the character's development. Most other plot development scenes are also poorly filmed and poorly scripted. In fact, this affliction affects the entire movie. In addition to the African-American Navy Seal and his wife, as well as characters from Michael Biehn and Charlie Sheen, all the other members of the team seem unknown to the public. Thus, when climatic scenes unfold, it seems to nobody to seek the death of anyone to deplore. <br /> <br /> In such a movie, action sequences can potentially save production. But here they do not do it. These are misguided, poorly lit and showcase poorly executed stunts. In fact, their direction is so mediocre that they are almost incoherent for the viewer, which makes not only the scenes difficult to follow, but also a total lack of fear and suspense. Poor lighting only adds to their helplessness. The explosions seem false, the bullet wounds are unconvincing and one of the most daring stunts, which consists of crushing a Mercedes on a tank, looks like a waterfall staged against a background and poorly edited. <br /> <br /> The end of Navy Seals places the coins firmly on the eyes of this production. First of all there is the obligatory slow-motion scene, which is to flee the big explosion that should have killed me, Sheen carrying Biehn on his back. It was obviously the default scene intended to be the star of the trailers of the film. Then there is the end itself when the rest of the Seal team, wounded and floating in the ocean, is rescued by a submarine. In fact, this submarine had already been home for a long time, but of course it miraculously returned at the time. Despite the Seals' violent and stressful ordeal and the fact that many of their colleagues have just been killed, and a number of them are still bleeding hard, they all manage to laugh out loud. heart while blessing America aloud. Predictable? You can just imagine that end by looking at the opening credits. <br /> <br /> This film indulgently uses the conflict in the Middle East as a vehicle of the all-American tendencies of the young photogenic heads of the film. Arabs are treated with condescension and disdain, and their slaughter in the film is used as a pivot to glorify the use of American military power against an "inferior" minority group in an environment without consequences. The events of 2001 have shown that such excessive and overconfident trivialization of the conflicts of these minority groups is certainly not an inconsequential consequence. The Middle East can no longer be considered a s-hole full of rag heads that are falling (to quote Charlie Sheen here); it is now a place where participation can have serious consequences. Today, we are reminded that the consequences of such arrogance may be quite close to home. Therefore, Navy Seals looks totally stupid nowadays; but it's being nice. It is an extremely ignorant film, whose production values ​​and professionalism are also suspect. Navy Seals is, ideologically and artistically, a total insult to the intelligence of its audience.
