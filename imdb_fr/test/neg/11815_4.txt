Pam Grier is the big sister of the 1970s, appearing in many recent blaxploitation films discovered and appreciated by a new generation. I can safely say that BLACK MAMA, MOM WHITE is perhaps Pam Grier's worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Grier is Lee and Margaret Markov is Karen; they were two prisoners who escaped from prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked the paddy wagon. This film, chained to each other, becomes THE CHALLENGE of women but has three distinct intrigues: a big criminal (Filipino star Vic Diaz) wants the death of Lee, a cowboy bounty hunter (the excellent Sid Haig) seeks out two girls; and Karen's revolutionary friends are looking for her. The film ends up becoming so complicated and so uninvolved by the two women that the title should have been called MEN CHASING WOMEN. Grier, a star of the action, has no chance to participate in many action scenes. Markov is excellent as Karen and Grier are doing well as Lee, but both are finally forgotten in the many secondary intrigues. The bounty hunter is forced, in an interesting scene, to force a policeman and his chief to drop their pants to shoot the one with the smallest penis (judged by his prostitute), but he is easily forgotten in everything chaos. <br /> <br /> BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA debuts as a film of women in prison with lesbian babysitters and a shower scene, and then goes completely to a hunting movie. If director Eddie Romero (famous for his Filipino horror filmmakers) had just kept to the theme of the current film, it would have gone well. Instead, BMWM quickly becomes real and the surprise end makes the audience wonder why he watched a 90-minute movie so that ends like this! Another problem: where should the film be placed? If some accents are Hispanic and the cities have Spanish names (Los Robles, etc.), all indigenous people are obviously Asian! Hmmm ... Recommended only for fans of Grier, who will still be disappointed.
