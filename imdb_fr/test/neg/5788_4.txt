Someone pointed out that Charlie Sheen's character should be brought before a court martial for doing everything he wanted. You may be right, but that's how the SEALs are. I served for several months with a SEAL team in Norfolk, Virginia. In fact, I should say they used our ship to deploy in Europe for a few months. I was the postman on board and every day these guys were trying to get their mail. As only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day, we issued a pass to one person. Every day, a different SEAL appeared, pretending to be someone else. Well, after the third time, I told them no until I knew who they were. They went NUTS !!! I thought they were going to break my cage, gag me, then steal the mail. Fortunately, I had not only the president on my side (The Navy), but also the federal government (US Mail). This is the only time I saw SEALs stop having what they wanted. They were entitled to unlimited leave on the ground, where we had to be back on board at some point. They killed and tortured a woman in France and the two SEALs had only one week's detention on board, while a sailor was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a French wine store and he was tried at court martial. Is it surprising that the SEAL retention rate exceeds 85%? As a SEAL, you are god. So, this movie does a pretty definite job of describing how a SEAL works and thinks ... Unfortunately, it's so amazing for normal people that it comes as a fake.
