The premise of this movie is ugghhhh. The guy is married and yet everyone on this site seems to think, "Yeah, it's funny, cute and it's a good movie." What is going on?!?! What's funny about the fact that immature girls are forging with a married man with a new baby? What's so cute about him cheating on his wife? What was wrong with finding boys with whom to have sex before starting university? No, that's not enough, the guy has to be married, out of bounds, out of the market, that's the one we have to have. Dumb-Ass Girls! Then one of the girls decides that she "likes" the guy. No, she "loves" what he feels. Two of the girls have fun with that, they find it funny, no one seems to have a moral problem with what they do. It's shameless, but yes, everything is fine for everyone on this site. The black-haired girl even has the audacity to bring her father from the boys' house, under the cunning of the baby sitting. It's a morally disgusting film and where is his wife? Poor woman working and paying bills while he smashes the babysitter.
