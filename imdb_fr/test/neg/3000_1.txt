It's the most boring, pretentious and stupid movie I've seen in a long time. I saw him at the Beverly Hills Academy and there were quite a few people in the lobby who had left the screening and were looking for refuge there. All solemnly shook their heads and seemed to attend a funeral. What a waste of time and money. Worse still are the critics who gave good reviews to this pretentious airship. What's with them? Are they just afraid of not being considered "hip"? Were they bought? This movie is incredibly bad. Do not make an appointment with her, hoping to have a thorough discussion at the Cheesecake factory afterwards. If you had the idea to go see this movie, it would shake you and keep it all your life.
