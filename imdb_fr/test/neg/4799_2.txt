The bipolarity of this film is exasperating. For a moment, he makes fun of Latin Americans, American tourists and banana republics in general, the other he wants to touch, with burned villages and orphans. Even the serious revolutionary hero becomes the parody of a revolutionary at a given moment. But the comedy parts are not even fun, because they are so obviously stolen in Star Wars. Yes, Star Wars, the "hero" is basically a thug with a heart of gold. Add to this stereotyped sound effects, Latin-Americans who speak English, and a villain who disappears from history. And what is the point? It is essentially propaganda of the revolution without resolution or planning (because there is no way that these people can lead a country). The US government is a bad guy, but who will make money producing that? Not a poor farmer, that's for sure.
