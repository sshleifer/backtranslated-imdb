I do not recommend watching this movie. It is a film in which a film is shot, without any attraction between actress and actor. The sex scene at the end of the film, which must explain the reluctance of the actress (played in the film) to cooperate with the actor (played in the film), is a brutal repetition of the same scene in the Breillat. Fat Girl movie. Everything was played with more delicacy, if you could attach a delicacy to a sexual act like that. A typical French expression for what is happening in Sex is that the comedy is Oh la la! In Brefat, the film Brief Crossing also talks about sensitivity. In Sex is comedy, I do not see real sensitivity and a clear plot for the film is not being worked out, so there is a rather vague story with the disillusion of the end.
