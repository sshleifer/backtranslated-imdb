So it's here that the director of the Columbia Short Topics Unit started his position as director, huh? Yeah, it's none other than Mr. Jules White who is credited (or is it rather "exposed") the director of this entry in the DOGVILLE series of MGM. Co-credited as co-director, one of Zion Myers; whose name is unknown to us so far. Mr. Meyers was, without a doubt, the type who controlled the four-legged thespians and was responsible for training and "play". In short, he must have been the dog trainer on the board. <br /> <br /> THE TITLE of this short film is undoubtedly a game of the MGM feature of the same year, THE BIG HOUSE; who played Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and a stellar cast in support. We must plead ignorance regarding this title; not to have seen it up to this point. (Sorry, Schultz!) But there are a lot of dog gags that relate to what we read about the movie *; not to mention some particular gags to a character. For example, we observed a canine offender who was st-st-st-st-st-stuttered and rightly deduced that actor bow-wow imitated the actor, Roscoe Ates. We then checked with the distribution of THE BIG HOUSE and hop, his name is there! (Brilliant deduction, a solution for Holmes & Watson!) <br /> <br /> THE PRACTICE OF teleporting popular movies was already a proven practice in the field of comedy short film. This is a project that did not seem to raise any objections from the producers and the rights holders of the big films; but rather quite the opposite received piles of tassive approval. After all, it is said that imitation is the most sincere of flattery; moreover, any producer would even like parodies apparently irreverent. ** AS FOR THE, we found it interesting in a perverse way. To see so many "best friends of man" to be so artificially animated in one and the same long anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring for us, who composed the public. I mean just how many mutts were made to bark, unnecessarily, to realize the illusion of "talking"? <br /> <br /> WHEN IT COMES to pets or "animal companions" as the politically correct crowd prefers, we are quite eclectic; to promote not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parakeets. We do not enjoy seeing an animal exploited in a game format that is as entertaining and as surprising. <br /> <br /> As incredible as it may seem, the step that Mr. Jules White has made from MGM's Shorts to run Columbia's 2 Reeler's production does not seem to have been a mere surge in finance; but always in the artistic content. We never thought we were producer-directors for such personalities as the 3 Stooges, Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert, as well as those who had certainly seen better days, such as Charley Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; would be a cinematic advance. <br /> <br /> In case we have not yet made our point; we are officially photographing this one. So, visualize it at your own risk. We warned you! <br /> <br /> NOTE * We have read excellent reviews of THE BIG HOUSE and the posting of Laurel & Hardy, PARDON US (Hal Roach / MGM, 1931) in MR. LAUREL & MR. HARDY by John McCabe (1962) and THE FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY by William K. Everson (1967). The most enthusiastic approval was given to both books. <br /> <br /> NOTE ** The image of the prison has become a genre in its own right; all with a debt to THE BIG HOUSE. In PARDON US, Laurel & Hardy, Hal Roach and his director committed a first class parody, the first of many; for a prison, comedy has become an obligatory theme for so many funny screen men to come.
