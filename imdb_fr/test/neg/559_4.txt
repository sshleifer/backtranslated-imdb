I thought this movie was going to be a shame for the show. After all, Part 3 is not the measure of Part 2, and it does not have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humor was not as witty in this part as in Part 3, but it was quite amusing to make the movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> The role of the girl was pretty good. She is a lost teenager who needs advice. I find the plot a bit hard to believe. That the aunt simply agrees to leave her house and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi, a man she has just met. Of course, he was his brother's friend. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the monastery. According to some of my other reviews, you would have thought that I would not have liked the dancing monks, but I found it amusing. It showed that they knew how to have fun. But if it were ancient Chinese monks dancing to pop music, that was another matter. <br /> <br /> The smarter aspect of the movie was probably where the girl thought it was stupid that the monks would not want to kill a bug. Miyagi told him that street gangs that kill each other are stupid, that the countries that are trying to destroy each other are stupid, but that it is respectful of all life, that's not stupid. Miyagi also expressed such wisdom in the other films. <br /> <br /> I give this film a score of 4 out of 10. Of course, there are some things that I liked. It was not as funny as the third part, and no character could ever live up to Sato in the second part. This film has no value to watch again. I can not imagine seeing him again, but it's worth it to see him once.
