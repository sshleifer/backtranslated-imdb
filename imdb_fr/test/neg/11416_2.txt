"Stop while you're in front" is a phrase they never learn. Typical Hollywood scenario: If the first movie did not shock, the second did not, expect the third to be the worst thing on the screen this year. Worse still are the prequels, whose events have already been explained in detail. If you have not seen the first two movies, you will not like this one. It's like starting to watch The Lord of the Rings or Star Wars with the latest movie in the trilogy. So, "alone", this movie is not. <br /> <br /> Remember the first film about Lucians revenge? Do you remember the second about the long-lost wild brother? Well, if you saw these two moments of 5 minutes and you stick them together, you would have ?? a prequel 5 min. But the creators thought that these 5 minutes were essential historical events or simply wanted to give work to some actors, actors and team members and maybe make money. "I have silver loot, I make movies to make a living and I'm bored, what am I going to do, I know, I'm going to make a movie." So anyway, you get this prequel of 5 min and you stretch it for 90 min ?? it's this movie. And you know what will happen to the main characters "immortal", so there is little suspense. By the way, all the drama of the movie is in those 5 min. The only thing that made my eyebrow rise was the death of Mom in the begging of the movie. Sick. The rest was Braveheart remix. If you want a comedy, first see Braveheart, then this movie. <br /> <br /> Now, am I going to make a little complaint ?? the film put me in the mood. Who invented the concept of "vampire versus werewolf" in the first place? He is older than me and has aged just as fast. And why do vampires look like Goths in heat while werewolves look like psycho bears? Hiding the bad movies behind the cleavage fails. Is not it time for us to have healthy and healthy werewolves with a straight stance? How can their immovable werewolves even reproduce if they tear everyone apart? And why, with all their powers, vampires did not rule the world? Blaa, blaa, blaa ?? Such a waste.
