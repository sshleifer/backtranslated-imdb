The use of the term "comedy" in relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy and, even worse, to the pain inflicted on the audience of this production. Almost nothing was funny. <br /> <br /> This documentary follows a small group of "comics" standing on the road, traveling from town to town to perform in small clubs. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that their conversations and their performances on stage and on stage are indistinguishable, but unfortunately, equally insignificant. <br /> <br /> It is possible to understand the illusions of grandeur that feature the "comics" featured, but it is more difficult to capture the laughter heard by their audiences. It may be the worst film I have seen in 50 years that I live in movies.
