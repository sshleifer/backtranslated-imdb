I've watched this movie every now and then since it started playing about an hour ago, and I have to say it's an hour of my life that I lost and I will not come back, The acting is a shit and the scenarios have to be seriously examined and the one who wrote them must be slapped, maybe the TV will explode and put me out of my misery ..... The only good thing about from this film is that, for boys and girls, there is candy in the eyes, although Most of what I wish, with regard to the film, would disappear as in Shin, Dante? who thinks that a guy wearing tight-fitting leather pants and a half-leather jacket is scary, he looks more feminine than most women in this film, Dante's voice is pathetic, nobody do not find it threatening or scary .... Please, television, please jump !!!!!!!!!!
