Personally, the book was a very well written, astonishing and exciting piece that was not brought to justice for the film. Watching the movie at 12:01 in the morning to see that important parts of the book had been omitted frustrated me, as it affected the "different" outcome of the film. There was something to be desired about this film, but on the whole it lacked intrigue. <br /> <br /> For someone who did NOT read the book, I could see how this film would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense. However, to an avid reader who has read it seven times, I have not seen the close bond between the two: the film and the novel. <br /> <br /> Missing main characters (such as Maximilian Kohler) and the abrupt turn in the plot with the survival of the last Cardinal's preference, the plot of the film was slightly scattered, thus leading to a different interpretation of the conclusion of the story. Hassassin has also been described as an ordinary white man, compared to that of the novel where he was described as a Muslim; His motivations in the book are mainly based on his connections with the Illuminati. However, in the film, his motives are based on money and look more like work than a personal connection to the task at hand.
