I was hoping it would be of the caliber of Das Boot and that I would echo the cruel realism created by the famous German director Leni RiefenStahl in her documentaries. Unfortunately, I was monumentally disappointed. The scenario is implausible and challenges credulity. An airman from the RAF is shot down and ends up in a hospital in Dresden. Anna, a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is about to get engaged to a doctor she works with, falls in love with the airman and they make love. The next evening, during a sumptuous engagement party, the aviator disguises himself as a German officer and dances with Anna. Although well directed and played, it is for me a soap opera of the lowest degree.
