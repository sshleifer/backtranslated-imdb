Writers Steve Tesich's second-year effort (following BREAKING AWAY, a wild outbid) is a combination of clich√©s, coincidences and dark melodrama. Maybe he has lived part of it? if so, I am sorry to say that he was inexplicably unable to dramatize it convincingly. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, Arthur Penn did not help him much here. This talented director has done a remarkable job in the past. (BONNIE AND CLYDE, LITTLE MAN), but fails to inject an energy or a likelihood into Tesich's story. <br /> <br /> Actors struggle as they can, but their motivation and dialogue are weak. The sympathies should be reserved especially for Craig Wasson, whose sluggish performance foreshadows the imminent weakening of his leading career, as well as Jodi Thelen, an embarrassed and unattached woman, misunderstood as the "femme fatale" extremely improbable film. > Everything seems longer than it is and all the points raised are heavy and obvious. See earlier Arthur Penn on the subject of the 60s, the droll and the elegiac ALICE'S RESTAURANT; it's all that this one is not.
