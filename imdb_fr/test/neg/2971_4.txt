The ridiculous comedy throws an uncomfortable character, Ray Milland, into the role of British officer in World War II Europe, escaping the German borders and joining a hungry gypsy woman, played by Marlene Dietrich. Slowly paced, oversized and miscast: the leads are way too old for this type of juvenile feed, although Marlene shines in her solo moments. It took three writers to adapt Yolanda Foldes' book to the screen, but this material was already dated in 1947 - it smacks of something that Ernst Lubitsch could have produced in 1939. The screenplay is moldy, and the stars have chemistry together. ** from ****
