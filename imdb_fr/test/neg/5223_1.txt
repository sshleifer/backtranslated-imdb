I recently came up with the idea of ​​making a short film of a man who is hit by a car and wakes up thinking that he is Chuck Norris himself. This meant that I needed to do some extensive research on Chuck and find out as much as possible about the man. I later discover that he is not in fact a man, but an angel sent from heaven. With a face like that, who could doubt it? I've watched more Chuck Norris films in the last four months than anyone else should. I'm proud to say that Bells of Innocence is close enough to the top of the worst list ever. I spent most of the film wondering if I could send my copy back to the local Wal-Mart without the receipt, on which I had bitten so as not to swallow my own language. The main reason I chose to buy this movie is that it was not just Chuck but his son Mike. I was anxious to see if Mike was a chip from the old block of paper bags that can not do that. I came to the conclusion a long time ago; Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in film history for a simple reason. The only character he plays is himself, Chuck Norris. No matter the movie, no matter the situation, it's still Chuck Norris. The only thing he's holding on to his son is that he's consistent. Mike does not seem to understand how human emotions work. In the scene where he talks about his dead daughter to the little girl, he seems extremely happy! It may be because he pushed his daughter into traffic jams, as shown by one of the strangest flashbacks of all time. His actions confused me throughout the film, making it very difficult for me to focus on the little plot that was there. The other two main actors were as painful to watch as Norris's son. The guy, who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid joke about the peacock, was simply one of the most boring characters in the history of direct video. The only thing I remember is an episode of Walker Texas Ranger, in which he plays an equally annoying character. Maybe Chuck owes something to this guy. The other type, which is the only name I can think of because it was so forgettable, was your average Christian fanatic. I do not have anything against the Christians, in fact I am one, but this guy was too much for me. To complete the story, you have a multitude of city dwellers who like to call "friend" people, and some bad guys who do not seem to be able to decide which of them is responsible. Not to mention the scary kids who remind me of the dollar store version of all the other groups of scary kids in the movies. Overall, the film is probably one of the biggest failures of all time, at more than one level that Chuck Norris can give people. Although I'm one of the worst actors of all time, I still do not get tired of Chuck. Maybe he was really sent from heaven ...
