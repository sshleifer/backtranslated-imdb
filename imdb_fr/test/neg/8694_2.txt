It's hard to compete with classic greatness, but once you make that choice and the decision is at stake, you need to find the best and brightest resources to keep your product top of the line. If your intention is to aim for the second or third (or fourth) best choice, why even try? This is why I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced and disseminated. I would ask the producers, "What were you thinking about, have you tried to create a projected deficit?" If maybe the producers thought, "We want to look at this Bible story from another point of view ..." Then I would say "OK, I watched the show, now what's the point of view?" The premise of this "theory of possible point of view" escapes me. I can usually watch shows and (rightly or wrongly) at least get an idea of ​​what the creators have tried to accomplish. Not so, here. I recognize names like "Robert Halmi" (the producer) and I can associate his work with a catchy product; Tin Man, Earthsea, Flash Gordon, Jason and the Argonauts. Low budget entertainment based on myth, history and comics. A perfect genre for Sci-Fi Channel. So I have to ask Robert Halmi ... "What was the purpose of this Ten Commandments, what did you think?" ???????? FJS
