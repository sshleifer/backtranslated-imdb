I recently became a big fan of Patton Oswalt. I think he's the most delicious and original comedian of all time. He is refreshing and fearless in his routines, covering a range of topics from Bush to the dismal feats of 1970s producer Robert Evans. I am a longtime admirer of Maria Bamford and her schizophrenic / innocent, wide-eyed routine. Whenever she effortlessly tilts her naturally sharp voice in a torn and guttural voice, I can not help but laugh. I liked Brian Posehn long before he knew he was participating in "Just Shoot Me," and there's something so naturally funny about his aging nerd character. These three talented and unique actors are titled "The Comedians of Comedy", a documentary of Netflix on their American tour. They really deserve to be stars and this tour has given them the recognition they deserve so much. I thought no, I knew I would like this movie ... <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. Instead of the three comics each receiving their own sequences, "The Comedians of Comedy" is bogged down by sinuous and boring documentary scenes that contain neither humor, nor insight, nor real interest. I think there's a total of 30 minutes of intermittent standing routines in a 109-minute movie. What a scam! Come on, is someone really interested in seeing our stars having fun in their RV? Where's the humor of seeing Posehn in an arcade and a comic book store? Does anyone find random dinner scenes particularly entertaining? If this movie was not able to show our comics strutting, at least explain what life on the road looks like. It's not even about it. Worse still, comics never really seem to have fun. Oswalt admits how bored he is during a radio interview, Posehn shyly admits how much he fears going around his home and Bamford nervously improvises every time the camera is pointed at her, and her humor it is only sporadic. /> <br /> Sheesh, these guys deserve to be able to show the world their unconventional and incredibly crafty humor that represents a refreshing change of pace compared to the brainless entertainment of classic comics like Dane Cook. Instead, we have to go through their mundane, everyday routines on the road, in a low-quality movie whose quality could easily be surpassed by any student film. If you can locate any Oswalt, Posehn or Bamford show on DVD, do it. Their talent should be a joy to behold, not a chore like the one here.
