Ugh. Stephen Baldwin. I have never noticed until I get the DVD home and see his name in the credits. Double Ugh. What's worse, IT'S THE NAME of this carefree shoot'em up, wandering, low-budget wannabe. I mean, where did they find the guy to write that refusal? Drive a caterpillar into the LA City dump, hoping to get into the video game? The entire plot is a ridiculous situation piled up on ridiculous places. Baldwin is as convincing as a poster artist for American Gothic, without pitchfork. All his acting repertoire seems to need the pot and then he seems to find it. <br /> <br /> So that's what you have to do: bad script, bad actor anonymous actors, low-budget executive and hero as convincing as a scout looking for a client cookie as a hero action . It's too late for me to get my money back on the DVD, but you can save yourself - unless you're one of those who like to watch dogs laughing ... frankly, this one is too boring to be funny .
