Well, let's be fair. Following a cult classic like Road House is not an easy task. Now, subtract Swayze from the equation and you get a monumental task. So, with Patrick, not on board, who had the idea to proceed anyway to make this junk? I'm going to blame the director who did not even provide 5 minutes of decent movies throughout the film. In fact, I was shocked that they had Will Patton (Armaggedon) get on board. Johnathon Schaech did a decent job with the main role, but the writing was atrocious. Refusing her partner's (Crystal Mantecon) brown bomb during the first five minutes of the movie made me want to eject her here. But I stayed in the movie hoping to get a glimpse of that cheery, super-comedic humor that worked so well with Double Duece. No chance. The cover of the DVD is hilarious, they show these two stacked blondes who make a 10-second appearance in the film. Costar Ellen Hollman also achieves a decent performance. But again, effort is useless in waste and shame like this. Has Jake Busey been featured in a decent film? Could not they shoot at least some actors in the first film for some kind of nostalgia treatment? Even one of the old bouncers or two, or Jeff Healey for a performance would have been nice. Take this movie out of your queue immediately. -LostFlix
