Let me first say that I REALLY really enjoyed this movie. For the most part, actors and actresses watched their roles and did a good job in their roles, but the film lacked real intrigue. It seemed so packed into a semblance of "wacky" that no interesting story was ever told. In addition, the work of the camera was often sloppy, attempting camera work torn off and failing miserably. Most of the time, photos that looked like cool ended up being confusing. Maybe something was lost during the translation, but some of the characters were just ... stupid. The handsome crazy boy who sniffs people like a dog? Uhhhhhhh. OKAY. Overall, a stinking fat 1/10. Not worth your time.
