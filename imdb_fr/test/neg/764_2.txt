My God, the things that were happening to the entertainment in this country ... <br /> <br /> It is * not * the "Tom and Jerry" that you could enjoy on Saturday morning, with a cat unfortunate and an intelligent mouse. This is a much older animated series, featuring a pair of Mutt-and-Jeff clones that embark on various scratches and culminate in one of the typical dancing skeleton gags of a long animation. <BR/> <br /> This particularly vile outlet, apparently originally designed as a vehicle for a pair of true black comedians of the time, makes the pair crash into the ocean while traveling to Africa, requiring a black facial makeup, exaggerated "Negro" dialect and "Feet, do not depreciate me now" situations. <br /> <br /> This only shows that in 70 years between emancipation and this film, the American vision of Africans had not made much progress. Again, at least one of them apparently had a pilot license.
