How did so many talented or at least charismatic actors find themselves in this bastard? This film is not very good but the worst things are probably the scenario and the staging. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this is the heart of director Damian Niemans, because he has both written and directed (and also played). . He is himself a magician of cards and seems to have named characters in tribute to other famous magicians. As far as I know, this was his first feature film. It is probably difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes it so poor? but I would say that the story and the character are not credible (the scenario) and that the staging does not give him any momentum (the director). More ?? the poker scenes are bad at the worst Hollywood style (super hands, Hollywood rules)! The supposed twists in the movie are totally predictable or totally unbelievable. They end up making a knot in a story that, at best, can be described as "some decent scenes"!
