Without doubt one of the worst films ever made. Slow and without structure, tension or history, the film rubs shoulders with the basic principle of "putting on a show". Conflicts are resolved within two to three seconds of launching, and the dialogue is random and accidental. Everything is set up in random order and often, "Stepping Out" looks more like a reel of deleted scenes than a real movie. The film seems to exist only as a showcase for Liza's lively and totally random musical numbers. Shelly Winters can be seen in "Tentacles", a much higher octo-epic, and the TRUE Liza can be found in the Showtime version of "Queer Duck: The Movie".
