I hated that the first movie was really boring and we only see Octopus at the end. <br /> <br /> The plot Bodies are found in the port of New York. The police have no clues or suspects until Nick and his colleague realize that the murderer is a giant octopus. Everyone, especially the police captain, refuses to believe Nick's story and the harbor will soon be filled with boats for the July 4th celebrations ... <br /> <br /> In this movie, we can see more of the giant Octopus and Special Effects for this movie are really good for his time. <br /> <br /> The acting is this movie not bad but not great too but well and look capable. <br /> <br /> These are really cheese scenes to the movie, but if you can go beyond, you should enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5/10
