I happened to see a promotion of this movie on the Spike channel last night. She was grouped with another Swazy movie that he shot and thought that Swazy was part of this sequel ... boy, I was wrong .... I see the screenwriter also played, and I think the budget was a little tight. I'm surprised to see Will Patton in the movie. He has a lot more credit to his name from playing in a movie "c" like this one. Bussey Junior was trying so hard to represent the image of his father (one of the best actors of villains) - which failed miserably. The only qualities that redeemed in the movie were the girls, "beautiful" and with a lot of T & A just not worth the time or your hard-earned dollar to rent it
