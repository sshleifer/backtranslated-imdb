This one is as cheesy as they come ?? the concept of a massive and indestructible alien bird is already too big for words, but wait until you get a charge from the awkward creature as it appears on the screen! I tell you that I laughed so much through this thing that I missed part of the presentation dialogue ??? again, the latter is often so heavy in scientific jargon and the laws of physics and others (for which I have never been good, despite my love of sci-fi movies) that there was not really important! The bird ?? first portrayed as a mere fuzzy form whizzing through the heavens but eventually shown in all its dopey glory ?? is so sublime idiotic that a Looney Tunes cartoon would not have anything to envy (watch the series of intermittent photographs that start with the creature in the distance and end with a very close shot of his face)! <br /> <br /> Director Sears has done much better with his other UFO film, the very good EARTH VS. FLYING SAUCERS (1956) ?? with special effects provided by a master, Ray Harryhausen (speaking of that, I just gave my copy of it in anticipation of the recent Columbia DVD SE acquisition); moreover, it seems to me that some of the images illustrating the unleashing of the bird in New York here have been extracted from the destruction of Washington observed in this previous classic science fiction! Again, the leads are played by regulars of the genre ?? namely Jeff Morrow (of THIS ISLAND EARTH [1955]) and Mara Corday (of TARANTULA (1955)); as with the above flying saucers, these titles are very popular and appreciated by fans ?? therefore, they are far superior to this lamentable addition to the alien animal / monster cycle that prevailed at the time of science fiction (and beyond) Larry Cohen's ironic update in Q: THE WINGED SERPENT [1982] ). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, THE GIANT CLAW can not even reach a decent climax ?? which is so rushed to be "a deluge", to quote a pilot of the film himself whose assault with rockets on the bird turns out to be totally ineffective (that is, before Morrow realizes that he is protected by an invisible barrier and he has found a way to enter it). In the end, apart from the insoluble technical aspects (and frankly tedious), we feel a feeling of "so bad, it's good" by looking at it: after all, it only lasts 74 minutes ?? and, in any case, the bird is so amazing that it smiles every time it comes!
