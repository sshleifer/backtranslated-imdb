I would like to write a short summary of the plot of this film, but ... there is simply no! If you just take a look at the keywords of the plot for this title, you know almost all the content of the film: sex, breasts, exploitation, frontal female nudity and prison for women! 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more. "Escape of the Island Women" (an alternative title that is not even mentioned here) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial classic of incarcerated women, but it totally lacks brutality. WIP movies are designed to mix graphic sexual images with shocking violence, but the violence here has just been replaced by more sex. The director Erwin Dietrich certainly can not compete with specialists in the field, such as Jess Franco or Joe D'Amato, and he should have kept to ordinary movies. The only aspects that look a little like cult cinema are the resemblance of the tyrant president with Fidel Castro and the gang rape of a girl (minor?) By soldiers. The girls are lovely, however, and the location of Ibiza is very enchanting.
