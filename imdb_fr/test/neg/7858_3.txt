Henry (Don Ameche) presents himself at the entrance to hell and tells the story of his life to His Excellency (Laird Cregar). The story focuses on her relationships with women throughout her life, and in particular her relationship with Martha (Gene Tierney). At the end of the film, we returned to Henry and His Excellency for a very predictable end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is nothing more to say about the film because nothing happens. It's a sentimental story of a man's life and it's very boring. I watched it with my girlfriend and my father and we all thought it was bad, despite the Lubitsch touch. I yawned more than 15 times. Hugo (Charles Coburn) is good every time he is on screen as a grandfather and there have been some fun dialogue moments. The color offered a good show, but that was not enough to prevent this clearer from entering the stack of rejects. In the same mold as "His world is wonderful" and "You can not take it with you", so he was nominated for an Oscar, which is not surprising. A story about ordinary people, none of which is interesting and has no interesting storyline. It's boring, sentimental and the biggest moisture problem of an end I can remember ...
