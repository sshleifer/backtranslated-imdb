this movie is the worst ever !!! sorry but it was a total loss of good hours. quasi-psychology and b-actors make a baaaad horror movie. you can say that if you are in bad movies, you will love this one. and the "hot chick" was not that hot. There is absolutely no climax in the film, and the worst is the song that ends. something homemade with these words "his condition is horrible, the world is messy ... when the heads fall and the girls do not stay dressed ... the cops do not know anything, eating donuts in their car". "Jesus, sorry guys, but the milks went wrong with this one.
