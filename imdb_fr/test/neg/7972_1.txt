Kristy Swanson plays a hit star who is supposed to have knocked out a TV reporter for a group of bad guys, but as soon as she sees this poor boy playing at home with his kids, she decides to throw the entire project in the place and the Life of the journalist is spared The life of the hitwoman is to be taken, because the people who wanted this journalist to be killed want to see her dead for not having carried out her mission. This is the basis of a film called Supreme Sanction. <br /> <br /> Supreme Waste The character of Swanson is seen beating, hitting and killing men much bigger than his own. And she still has an edge over the group of murders that, for whatever reason, can not, for whatever reason, eliminate this super hitwoman. If a woman manages to defeat all these men and beat them, it makes the movie so cheerful. It's too predictable once you think that Swanson's character will win, making the movie boring and inept. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson is a decent actress who, in her youth, was always sexy and eyes. The supreme sanction is not one of his best efforts, however.
