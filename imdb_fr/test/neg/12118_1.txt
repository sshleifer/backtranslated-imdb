Friday Night With Jonathan Ross officials must rub their hands. They know that the BBC lacks imagination for talk shows, so when they have Jonathan Ross at their disposal, they are determined to sit down and let half a spirit control this slot in prime time. <br /> <br /> Ross spends most of his time watching the show caring for his ego and smiling at how much the BBC pays him. The series is a complete copy of many online discussions in the United States - Leno, Letterman, Brian Conan O, the list goes on - but he and his team have clearly seen what works on the masses can also be done for the masses dumb in the United Kingdom. . <br /> <br /> The unfortunate situation - he has no competition? Parkinson took for granted that he never really had much to do other than cure a celebrity ego. Can not we have someone more funny and more stylish on British Screens instead of Jonathan Ross? Once Ross has sufficiently developed his ego, he will move to the very boring concept of celebrities frozen in the green room - trying to get along. If an A-Lister is present (which is so often the case these days - because there is no other chat show), he will spend the next hour flirting with them or trying to be their best friend in the universe. Sqeamish when he had Ringo Starr on it - a man who does not care about licking ass - Ross sincerely begged for his cell phone number (the usual policy of this show being that Jonathan Ross receives the number of everyone to be seen in good company, when not working). Of course, Ringo said it was - and just said no, I do not like you - a serious thing. <br /> <br /> Ross must be excluded from all rewards and TV shows - the crowd will recover.
