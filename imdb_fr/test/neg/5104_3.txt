Although I have seen and enjoyed films like this one, which were silent films about the Russian Revolution, such as POTEMKIN and TEN DAYS WHICH CHANGE THE WORLD, I did not particularly appreciate this one. This was mainly due to the annoying and "artistic" way the director chose to shoot the film. Although POTEMKIN excelled in his editing style, this film used similar techniques with much less finesse - in some places, the editing seemed very jerky and amateurish. Also, and it was really annoying, the use of zombies at the beginning and end of the movie was really exaggerated. What I mean by "zombies" is that, to illustrate how much the Ukrainian peasants were depressed and oppressed, the people stand like models in many scenes. And, they remain like that, immobile, for a VERY long period, while the "perverse" capitalists and the exploiters of the masses parade. Leave me alone! This film is a marvelous example of style versus substance - and is just a movie for those who like or can forget the heavy direction. <br /> <br /> By the way, the DVD of this movie is improved, a little, if you leave the audio commentary on. This makes the movie easier to follow and gives some interesting information.
