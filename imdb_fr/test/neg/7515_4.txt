Having neither read the original book nor seen the previous film, and knowing nothing of the scenario of these or the current film, I arrived at this film with an open mind. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to know where to start commenting on the movie, because everything seems so confusing. It looks like there is a point, a message or something in the movie, but what's left is completely obscure. The effects were fantastic and very well judged. The idea was very well put in place and the motivation to travel in time was clearly defined. <br /> <br /> The whole trip back in time seems to have only the vaguest connection with the quest that was defined at the beginning. There are some good ideas, but it seems that they are isolated events that do not flow and give the impression that the film is disjointed and lost. At some point, one wonders if the main story of the film is the fate of the moon. <br /> <br /> When Hartdegen arrives in the year 802 701, the film becomes very frustrating because he seems unable to discover anything important. about the Eloi, and although it seems obvious that there is something to discover, its content remains elusive. This is a rather strange change from previous examples of time travel and one wonders why all of this was suddenly abandoned for what appears to be a completely new story. So much is happening for which there should be an explanation, but there is no discovery. I really wanted to really know what the film was doing, what was there to discover, but to no avail. After reading a summary of what's going on in the book at this point, it seems like there was a very tentative attempt to make it into the movie, but it was so simplified and "simplified" that the meaning and context are completely lost. <br /> <br /> Just as we hope to finally discover where all this leads, the film suddenly changes direction and becomes an unthinking action movie, without real action. It is as if, at this stage, the director had simply given up giving meaning to the film. At present, countless important events occur without any explanation. Hartdegen does not take this opportunity to return to the past twice for no reason, and suddenly loses interest in time travel without reason. The end of the film is abrupt while Hartdegen decides to stay with the Eloi. <br /> <br /> In summary, after a good start, the film is very disappointing. Hartdegen spends too much time before arriving with the Eloi. However, the worst thing about the movie is what I think is the most important: setting up the situation with Eloi. The whole point is completely missed, and that undermines the rest of the film. After that, the film focuses too much on the effects and the action and all the attempts to return to the meaning and the heart of the film seem forced and displaced. With so much going on without explanation, the movie just seems to get lost and lose its direction. However, the final in which Hartdegen decides not to worry about traveling back in time is the most inexplicable of all. <br /> <br /> In the end, the whole film seemed to be a collection of unrelated incidents. The meaning and context were lost, although the gaping hole where it should have been was very obvious. What was so frustrating about all this, though, was that there was clearly a lot of potential here: it was by no means a bad movie, it just could have been so much better. The beginning was very promising, the time travel looked fantastic and would have worked if there had been no tangency, and Hartdegen's experience with the Eloi could have worked so easily if some additional questions had were asked, and if there was not such a temptation to "calm down" and simplify. I would just like to have a time machine to travel back in time and to discourage mistakes that have been made.
