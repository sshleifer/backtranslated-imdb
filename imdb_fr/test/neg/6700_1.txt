Badland is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Most of the time, everything is fine and I can continue my life, but I feel the need to warn others in this case. As a veteran of the war in Iraq, I think it is necessary to say that the story, the plot, the acting and the description of what the soldiers suffered on their way home were hogwash. It was as if the director / screenwriter / whoever was clinging to a cliche about the return of the soldiers and ran with it, ran with it and ran with it. It is true. I do not think I guess there was any research in this movie. The "Marine" uniform seemed to have barely come out of a surplus store and had not been used since the first Iraq war. I will not go on forever, it's a horrible movie. If the stories of soldiers returning to the country interest you, there are much better alternatives. I recommend going to your local library.
