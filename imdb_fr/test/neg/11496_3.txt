I recently rented this promising mini-series, I did not even know they had adapted it for television. I was really impatient because the Icon book is one of the best spy thrillers I have ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot is vaguely similar to that of the book, the characters are completely wrong and there is a dreadful acting. Too bad really. Icon's story is perfect for the big screen, but I think television budgets just are not enough to allow a decent adaptation of this spectacular book. <br /> <br /> Forsyth deserves a lot better than that. Avoid and stick to the book, which is a must read.
