Beautiful images, propaganda and story in toy. The ingredients of this film are good, interesting but with a lot of shadows. Political shadows. Jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical America. He is the silhouette of a vision of life and society, an extraordinary thinker, teacher of much of North America. In the movie is only Superman. The delicate outline of ideas is crushed. The subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten. And Jefferson is a basic instrument to create a good picture of the American reality. The end, triumphant and false, romance and heroic, is the suicide by gun of a story that can be great with more wisdom. And the war against "Avatar" is another gray task. For the one who has not heard anything about Jefferson, the movie is a good start. For others - disillusionment. It's like the precious silk of a tailor. But the tailor is fascinating about silk and the clothes are just ordinary clothes. So, a sad experience. Slices of beauty and boring lakes, patriotic lesson and a crush of expectations. A film that must impress. And the ashes of a story that could be beautiful.
