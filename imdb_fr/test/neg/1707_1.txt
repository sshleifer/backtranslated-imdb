There was a time when Michael Jackson was revered as the king of pop. Then came a moment when he attracted so much negative publicity that lemonade attracted the wasps. Finally, this is the moment when we feel really sorry for this man. <br /> <br /> This "film" is another reason. I promised a mad Michael Jackson fan to watch him with her. You know the type of fan - someone who says to himself - to love everything the object of affection has ever done. Watching this film, which she had already seen twice, I realized how much this fandom was going. Probably far enough to rank this movie above a 1/10, as some people miraculously did. <br /> <br /> The film tries to be a parody of many other movies and series, including those of Cast Away, Lost and Jurassic Park. . Unfortunately, it fails miserably at all levels. The acting does not save the story absolutely horrible, the filming has the quality of a videotape too often played, the special effects have been better executed in Be Kind Rewind (for those who do not do it now: with aluminum foil) .. All this would be funny if the film managed to be funny. Unfortunately, it is not the case. It hurts to look at this. <br /> <br /> And then, there is the appearance of Michael Jackson in this trash. He appears on a projection screen to convey an important message and manages to appear as mobile as Jabba the dumb and serious as a 4 year old. Just when I thought "who is the awful person who attracted this poor man to participate in this film and ridicule himself again", I (finally) reached the end credits and discovered that the film had been partially shot at Jackson Neverland Ranch. In other words: he. Love. It's really disturbing. Do not even look at it for the "haha, a movie in the IMDb Bottom 100" effect. Or be warned.
