for people who have absolutely no idea what a comedy is. This includes not only the people who liked this movie, but also those who did it. What could they have thought of? Madonna playing Judy Holliday? Please, she can not even play MADONNA (if there is actually a Madonna). I hope Griffin Dunne has been well paid. He deserved every penny he earned, because if it does not kill his career, nothing will. I'm sure the few people who actually paid to see this movie left it as if their pockets had been chosen. Madonna has apparently gone beyond the point of feeling embarrassed by her almost total lack of talent as an actress, but you can not help but feel embarrassed for her. It has no connection with the rest of the cast. she seems to have appeared on the board and said, "OK, I'm here, I'm going to embarrass myself by doing the worst of things, Judy Holliday, feeling that whoever has ever been seen, now, remains out of my way "and then proceeded to do exactly that. I know that Madonna's phrase "rotten film" is redundant, but she is certainly going in that direction. It is painful to see a totally inept and talentless "actress" be ridiculed, but it does not seem to bother her, because she does it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only funny thing about this "comedy" is that she actually managed to find people who gave her the money to do it. Now it's funny.
