Bela Lugosi is a real enigma. In the early 1930s, he was at the top of the world after his appearance at Dracula. Yet again and again, he made bad decisions about his career. Maybe he had a bad agent, maybe his alcohol and drug use was part of it or maybe he was crazy. Anyway, it has ruined its reputation by appearing in virtually every movie - ranging from great horror movies (such as THE RAVEN) to big-budget movies (like NINOTCHKA) to Z-level movies for the cheapest and mediocre studios. Interestingly, although he agreed to make this dreadful film, he actually rejected the role that was then attributed to Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN! As far as this film is concerned, it is a propaganda film horribly produced by the Second World War, which presents a stupid plot and a miserable montage. Lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs - it's not a bad thing at all. But in the end, we discover that he himself is a Nazi plastic surgeon and that all the American-looking men he killed were actually Japanese !!!! The funniest part of this is during a flashback. You see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before he turns them into American-type men. When the camera scans them, the men are clearly Asian. But, on all the other plans not close together, they all have a VERY western appearance - many with bald heads !! They did not look like Japanese men at all. I suspect that the plot must have been rewritten and this could explain the obvious mistake. Or, it could simply be poor production and editing values. In fact, at the beginning of the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the cars (around 1942) are old Ford Model T Fords - obviously from archival footage !!! The result is that the film is bad but also very boring. Unlike PLAN 9 FROM THE OUTSIDE, it's hard to laugh at the inefficiency - just let yourself fall asleep.
