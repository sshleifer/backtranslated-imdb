This version of David Copperfield is appalling from start to finish. I knew that we were going to spend a night lost when Attenborough, an embarrassed idiot, and Olivier camped like two bad guys. Everything was downhill after that. Aunt Betsy was adequate but had no eccentric flair for which she was known. The worst of the worst was the producer's choice for Uriah. It was the music hall version of this character, previously and admirably played by Roland Young. And what was all this anxiety absorbed by David of himself? Dickens had to turn in his grave to see his favorite child turn into a wipe crying in his beer. <br /> <br /> It was a time Hollywood knew more than old England.
