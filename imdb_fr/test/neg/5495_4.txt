I went to this film that really wanted to enjoy it - it was leading a film festival earlier in the year and boasted of a cast of stars. But (and you can say there was a "but" to come), it's a failure of the movie. The exceptional character acting by Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by the editing and antics of the main actors. Turturro's performances are mediocre and most of the comedy is overplayed. Recurrent puppet shows are useless and some scenes are completely out of place. <br /> <br /> That said, the film contains wonderful moments. A truly touching moment of scene, several seductions and some comical colors train. Unfortunately, they are eclipsed by the diffuse and inconsistent scenario and by some bad actors.
