I did not think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time. I really like CKY and Viva La Bam. I think a lot of these things were really stupid and had no plot to become a movie. I strongly recommend not to pay a lot of money for this movie but anyone who loves viva bam, CKY or Jack Ass should see it. I liked a lot of parts of the movie and then some parts should have been cut out. I think Jonny Knoxville should have been in the movie because he's a much better actor than most people in Haggard and probably could have made it a bit more fun. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and it would have been necessary for bam to skate more.
