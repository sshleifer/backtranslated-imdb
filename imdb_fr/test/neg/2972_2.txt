Hollywood has made a lot of strange movies over the years, but no other stranger than this one. WHY this movie was shot, I'll never know, or how Paramount might have thought it would sell tickets in 1947. That's the weirdest mix I've seen in a long time, a movie that really does not know not if he tries to be a serious war drama or a Viennese operetta comedy. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a British spy trying to get a toxic gas formula from Germany a few days before the start of the Second World War. Ray Milland, a good actor, plays the role of an escapee from Monty Python, a very exaggerated dialogue in the English preparatory program. In Germany, he meets a gypsy, Marlene Dietrich, who helps her to travel to the shelter, of course, like another gypsy. She plays her role in the style of the typical gypsy caricature of Viennese operetta, like the other "gypsies" of the film. But there are also Nazis, who are not funny at all. And then Milland realizes he's starting to think like a gypsy and that's not treated as a joke. Sometimes the music is for a light comedy, sometimes for a drama. Whenever the Nazis present themselves, the score of the film plays Wagner, which is funny in itself. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a comedy where he could have taken seriously the fate of gypsies and made a serious act of showing how the Nazis treated them. Both are referring to in this film, but neither are pursued. What we have left is a really strange mix of genres that had to embarrass everyone (except the director) involved. <br /> <br /> Weird.
