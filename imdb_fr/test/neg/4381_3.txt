"Hero and the Terror" is a pretty dull thriller - at the: no real substance, predictable plot, and ... boring. For a thriller, I found this film slow to reach its pitiful climax, as it just seemed to drag out until the birth of Chuck's wife's baby ... and then, he drags to the end - which I hardly remember. Already, even though I only saw the movie 10 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 - for the first 10 to 20 minutes.
