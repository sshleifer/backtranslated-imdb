It was broadcast on a premium channel, so I did not know it was made for television. Still, I like some movies of my life (Lifestyle here in the UK), but it was horrible. The family was so cheesy, "I love you mom" "I love you even more darling" Then, after being robbed for the second time, 10 minutes later, they started again, "I love you mom" big smiles cheesy, etc. She phones her husband and tells him not to bother going home. They were only robbed by a guy who wanted them dead, a madman who lives next door, who needs help? She has her teenage daughter and a cat (not for long) to take care of her. <br /> <br /> However, as a comedy, I would give him a good 7. I could even show it to my friends then I have them around. Could be very fun after a bottle of vodka or 10!
