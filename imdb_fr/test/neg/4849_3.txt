It is this type of film that makes you doubt your past admiration for a particular director before you stop and remember that there are very few people whose corpus contains only a few clunkers. <br /> <br /> Playing in Lelouch's films is of utmost importance because it puts the viewer in such intimacy with the characters. Actors must bring true screen magic to live up to the intensity. Otherwise it's just hollow. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, none of the actors of this film had this magic of the screen. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas were far behind. Irons is a talented actor, but he was wrong for this role. An adorable thief did not suit his forces. His charm has also struck a false note for me here. Iron's personality is tinged with decadence to fit into a Lelouch love story. <br /> <br /> Although I hesitate to miss any opportunity to hear an English accent, I also think that an American actor would have worked better in this area. role. So many songs that Kaas sings are so closely tied to the songwriter's Americanity that it seemed rather jarring to see Jeremy Irons play love afterwards - even if, logically, it did not matter. He still screwed up the flow of the film. At least for me. <br /> <br /> Of course, he would have had to be the good American. I think George Clooney would have been great in this part. And he would have brought the magic of the screen to the shovel. Brad Pitt could also have done a great job presenting his particular combination of charm and sensations. <br /> <br /> I was also very disappointed by Patricia Kaas. Reading about it, I learned that she had a career as a singer and a lot of very successful fans, so that I know, but I found her presence on the screen as a singer very boring. In reality, she was a much better actress in her speech scenes than in the scenes where she had to perform and sell a song. Nothing that she sang moved me. She was nice but sweet. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, a person like Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and only has voice-coach in French, could have managed this part a million times better . Not to mention all the great French talents that could have been exploited. It was heartbreaking to see Patricia Kaas occupy an important place on the screen while there were so many French charismatic actresses who could have been chosen instead. <br /> <br /> Music was so important in this film that it could not really work without the music. And as Kaas has done so badly in this respect, the film never really got a chance. <br /> <br /> Lelouch sealed the fate of this film when she shot Patricia Kaas. JMO.
