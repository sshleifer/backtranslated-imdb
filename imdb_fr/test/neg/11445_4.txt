A young woman, Jodie Foster, attends a murder committed by the mafia, reports the murder to the local police and becomes herself a privileged target for the elements of the crowd. A professional killer, Dennis Hopper, hired by the mafia, follows her to prepare for the coup, but he ends up falling in love with her. Then, as a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome that defines a case where a kidnapped hostage begins to love and cooperate with the kidnapper, Jodie Foster also falls for her kidnapper, makes love and prepares for a getaway. <br /> <br /> Denis Hopper, the actor, tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of Dennis Hopper, the director. The result is disappointing and fails to follow the artistic level of a great performer like Dennis Hopper. There is no real thrill and the scenario is sometimes na√Øve and predictable. The film is partly saved by the performance of Jodie Foster, who is not at his best, but who always shines with his talent, his beauty and his gift. The historical interest is the brief appearance of Vincent Price and, in a small issue, Charlie Sawn, known for his great role in "Wall Street". <br /> <br /> If you decide to spend the 116 minutes watching the movie, it's not a total loss; This film offers easy entertainment, but we expected much more from the director of "Easy Rider" and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in "The Accused".
