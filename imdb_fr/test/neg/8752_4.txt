I love that movie. Even though I rated it "4", it's because the actor, the plot and the budget were all in the "B" universe even before the release of this movie. But it is okay! It's an entertaining movie that has a lot to offer! <br /> <br /> I remember what Leonard Maltin said about "Plan 9 of Outer Space": a film so bad that it's great! In the absence of the extraterrestrial UFO plot, The Thing the Could not Die is based on the supernatural (divination, buried head in search of one's body, hypnosis, etc.) to tell its story. The acting is scalded, the camera works in second class and the settings are limited, but damn! what movie! This film is available on the underground market. If you find a copy, buy it!
