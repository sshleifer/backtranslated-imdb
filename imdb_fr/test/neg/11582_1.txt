probably the worst creature feature of all time, boa vs. python was a million times better than this one and it was not great either, bad acting, bad effects and guess what the DVD is one of those with 3 hours of previews before the main menu. Probably the least scary film of all time, no blood or violence, people are stupid and continue to use guns when they have no effect on these animals, the only cool thing is the radioactive leeches that were rather cool, the name of the island is just a ripping out of the annoying Jurassic park boring and not worth seeing, but I guess the stupidity of the characters is pretty funny, so it would make a good comic film but certainly not a thriller
