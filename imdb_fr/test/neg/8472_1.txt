I spent almost ninety minutes in this dreadful movie waiting for revelations about dance, spirit, inspiration or something and I gave up! What did the filmmakers do to do this? She is an elderly woman of limited talent, obsessed with herself and nothing else. To tell a story without saying anything, we have information about other people who are in his condition, his help for burros and, of course, his ten cats! Do not see this movie. And having nothing to do with those who liked it, they have no idea. There are fascinating people in this world with wonderful stories to tell and ideas to share - but Marta Becket is not one of them. The people I saw in this movie say they forgave me, but they will never stop making fun of it.
