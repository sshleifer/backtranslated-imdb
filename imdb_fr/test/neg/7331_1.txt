Very simply, these are all the subscribed episodes and NOT the original unedited / unedited episodes of NBC. This is NOT the first full season, all eps are edited to comply with 21:00 for syndication, which means that the jokes are cut off, an extra commercial fade is included, all Harvey Korman's intros are not not there ... very badly done! Shame on a series I was waiting for .... booooooooooooooooooo If you're a real fan of Mama, do not buy it and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments on why we are unhappy. on this work of butchering to a classic sitcom!
