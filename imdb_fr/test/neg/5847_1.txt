Half and Woody are married, but they are poor. They meet Robert Redford, and he is REALLY rich. He loves Demi and, since he plays the game, he makes the couple an "indecent proposal:" a million dollars for a night with the little woman. <br /> <br /> At this point you do not have to watch a movie anymore because you can put the details together in your sleep. Of course, Demi will accept the offer. If it does not, there is no first half of the film. Of course, this will affect the marriage of Demi and Woody. Otherwise, there is no second half of the film. And of course, everything will happen well before the end of the credits. Otherwise, there is no happy ending for the box office. <br /> <br /> The best thing to say about INDECENT PROPOSAL is that Demi Moore looks great in a black dress. For the rest ... The scenario is incompetent, amateur management, negligible performance. I think Redford, Moore and Harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned. Do them - and more importantly yourself - a favor. Unless someone offers you a million ... Miss It! <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
