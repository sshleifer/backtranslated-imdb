The Willies start late one night as brothers Josh (Joshua Miller) and Kyle (Jason Horst) camp out with their cousin Michael (Sean Astin). They decide to spend time telling scary stories ... <br /> <br /> Michael is the first to tell a story called 'Bad Apples' in which a young boy by the name of Danny Hollister (Ian Fried) is victim of bullying at school. However, the sinister guard, Mr. Jenkins (James Karen), decides to help him. . <br /> <br /> Next, Kyle tells a strange story called "Flyboy" in which an overweight tyrant, fascinated by a disturbing fascination for dead flies, gets what he deserves in a twisted and horrible way. .. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian Peck The Willies did not do much for me and I doubt that it will do much for you either. The scenario is strange with regard to episodic anthologies. Instead of the usual three or four stories, it contains only two main stories and some bizarre mini-scenes of the type "urban myth" at first. This is the person who orders food at a fast food restaurant who found a dead rat in his hen, a man who dies of a heart attack during a car ride and a person who tries to dry his poodle in the microwave only to explode. I do not know what these scenes are for, but they do not add anything to the movie, and the two main stories are both weak. For starters, they are too long, which is a huge mistake in this type of movies. The stories of the anthologies are usually brief, precise and quick, with a beautiful ending in the end usually involving people getting what they deserve. However, in The Willies, the stories last about forty minutes each, which is longer than the average television episode. I must admit that I found both stories very boring, they have very little interest for them and seem to target children. The first story is best viewed as a whole, but it does not end to my knowledge, while the second has a fine end "just desserts", but its construction is weak and stretched without good reason. . I really like horror horror movies, so The Willies is a disappointment, but the director has let it down. <br /> <br /> The director Peck obviously worked with a small budget and as a whole, it was rather difficult to stay away. , there are many errors of continuity and it is badly done. There is no atmosphere, there is no fear, there is no gore, the special effects are mediocre and it involves unnecessary strokes of a dirty toilet several times. Overall, it's a pretty unattractive movie. <br /> <br /> Technically, the Willies is rather rough, the effects are far from special and the image is extremely dull and grainy. The acting is mediocre, nobody will win any prize, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The Willies is a mediocre film, it's not scary, it's not fun, it's not fun and it only contains two very long stories. Certainly not recommended.
