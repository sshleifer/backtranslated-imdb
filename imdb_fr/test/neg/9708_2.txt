Well, Wright may have painted a realistic picture of life around 1800 - as he so often and anally does because of the date on which it was written rather than published - but it's NOT Austen's and should not pretend to be an adaptation. <br /> Mrs. Bennett looks like a rural housekeeper. She is a pampered woman - they have maids (remember the scene of the book with the maid, etc.)? But Wright describes her with rough, reddened skin all over her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs wandering through! If he wants to be bucolic, he should try Tess. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett - the scenario is too cuddly and modern and ignores its weakness. The scene where he stops playing Mary is supposed to make you cringe - not pass in seconds. If it does not, do not include it. <br /> <br /> MacFadyen is very weak in the role and seems to be making some kind of pride by playing numbers. The first proposal, he looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming his pride of making a proposal below his post. Most of his lines, he might as well be reading a shopping list. <br /> <br /> Lydia is awful. Completely on the top with screams and excessive jumps. Indeed, Knightley plays more with Elizabeth than the foolish character that Lydia does in the book, sometimes. <br /> <br /> And Elizabeth. Half the time, Knightley clearly imitated Ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see which copy it is. And in his role, you see Wright's major mistake - there is NO PREJUDICE. <br /> <br /> From the first meeting with Darcy, she clearly fears him. When he comments to Bingley on the attractiveness of the women in the room, she looks initially hurt - not shocked and offended. The latter should put in place the prejudiced side of things. And when she and "caroline" go around the room, she falls like a mocker, obviously all around him. And by virtually eliminating Wickham, Elizabeth will not be invested enough to put in place the damaging aspects that flow from it. <br /> <br /> And apparently, it's Caroline and not Miss Bingley. And Mr. Bingley is happily walking in Jane's room. And and - Wright can boast of the quality of his time with whatever he wants. But some panoramic shots of rural life (which show his preference for Hardy) do not allow him to apologize for blatant gaffes everywhere. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker - who clearly wants to get prizes - should have been mastered He oscillated between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film - and Tess's latest plans / lighting proposal? The need to see Darcy wander in panic with a neglected shirt was just stupid. But the most important - when passing between these 2 very different landscapes, they forget the most important - Austen. (She would have laughed at Elizabeth's shrapnel = sad, so = the rain flowing in a quaint folly, Darcy's wet garbage). <br /> <br /> I found it impossible to watch the movie without using the book as context. I was ready to give him some leeway because he had to tell his story in a short time. But to completely forget half of the core of the book in prejudices and to let Darcy appear continually more constipated than proud, made him almost unassailable. I could only see this as a mess with generally mediocre performances (when Knightley did not ring Ehle, she was spinning or skipping or both and only calmed down twice to indicate she had some promise - but she was swaying for conveying emotion is not a substitute for a mediocre scenario and poor leadership - although for some it is simply an unfavorable scenario. <br /> <br /> Only Tom Holland would escape censorship. While he attenuated the comic aspects of Collins, he took a very interesting approach. Whether it's here or at Oscar Wilde, Dench does the job she can do in her sleep - but it was supposed to be Lady Catherine De Bourgh NOT Lady Bracknell. She was just a little too sane. <br /> <br /> The shortened length could have been managed by a competent scriptwriter, surely? They are not characters who fill story holes and help audiences around the world. Elizabeth could not have found the figure of Â£ 10,000. And although they wanted to save time with her learning about Darcy's involvement in the Wickham wedding, the aftershocks did not fit with Lydia. It was the worst case of incongruous exposure of the play. <br /> <br /> It's really terrible. Anyone commenting that it works well in the context of the book is someone I honestly do not believe I have read or understood the characterizations of the book. Wright seems to think that his characters are in the 1990s and not the 1709 of their behavior. I'm not sure he read the book - he certainly does not understand it. He does not understand Austen's sharp wit or light touch - he's certainly shot a dull film. <br /> <br /> What is perhaps worse is the sad pathetic need of enlightened lovers to need 'I love you, I love you everywhere so they can sigh and 'go. The fact that it has no place in Austen's work is apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Whoever comments on it as a film alone? Well, more difficult for me, except that I would point out the poor acting, the weak Darcy and the gurning jumping on an insane irritation of the whole. If you adapt, you can change a lot, but if it loses the spirit and the essential motivations, do not insult the book by taking its title.
