Mickey Rourke (who was once a famous movie star) plays Martin Fallon, an IRA terrorist who blows up a school bus full of children so disgusted by his actions that he decides to leave the IRA and share in the race in London <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening of the film is rather disturbing as the life of little children ends in a fireball. Events like this happened in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, in the 1990s in Northern Ireland, which gives a dreadful realism. However, as soon as Fallon decides to renounce violence (What? He's a terrorist and he never blows innocent bystanders?), Realism disappears and ridiculous clichés and twists take place. Martin is employed by the London underworld (does not he own his own killers?) To commit a blow while wearing a "uniform" of the IRA (never knew that provos wore the uniform) in A cemetery in broad daylight A man from the IRA uses a bomb placed under a car?) Where he is spotted by a priest who recognizes him while he was in the SAS. Hands in the air who thinks I'm lying? I am not and we are halfway to running and there are still many more shots to come <br /> <br /> That sounds very ridiculous and it is, but what are you waiting for a novel by Jack Higgins? Everything is cliché, artificial and stereotyped and the elements that are not are just weird. Critics slaughtered this film when it was released. In particular, they said he could have some potential if Bob Hoskins played gangster Jack Meehan and Alan Bates as soldier SAS became a priest and, for once, critics would have been right. They should also note that the film would have been less serious if Fallon had been played by someone who could make an Irish accent. Rourke may be a great and macho guy (Oh look at another movie with an uberhunk IRA) but the accents are not his strong point, any more than the character game. To give you an idea of ​​the disappointment found by PIRYER FOR THE DYING, the director ended up denying it, which is always a bad sign because of the "bombing of Enniskillen". In November 1987, the Provisional IRA detonated a bomb in the center of Enniskillen, where a Remembrance Day parade commemorating the dead of the Great Britain War was held. Eleven (11) people were killed and dozens more injured. It was not an accident and nobody left the IRA because of it
