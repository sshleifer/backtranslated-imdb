Well, if you put aside the fact that this film presents an abyssal acting game; and, if you put aside the fact that the story is confused and gets lost in about five different directions without ever deciding on the direction to take; and, if you put aside the fact that I have not found any scene in this film that is interesting enough; Well, if you put all this aside, it's still a REALLY terrible movie! <br /> <br /> I guess this is supposed to be a love story about a rich guy / a poor girl. I never really understood for a moment how this love affair between Kelley (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) had ever started. The inexplicable romance is aggravated by a total lack of chemistry between Klein and Sobieski. The screenplay (by Michael Seitzman) is dull to the point of being staggering. How did Seitzman manage to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle; that he thought someone would pay to see this is incredible. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this is a REALLY, REALLY terrible movie? <br /> <br /> ZERO, but the IMDb does not provide ZERO voices. So I give him one by holding my nose.
