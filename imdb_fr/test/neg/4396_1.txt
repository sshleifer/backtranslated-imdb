This must be one of the biggest failures of all time ... the scenario was nice and could have ended much better. The actors should have played better and maybe I would have given this film a slightly better score. Hollywood may have to redo this film with some better actors and a better director. Sorry for the disappointment, but the movie is bad. <br /> <br /> If I had to watch it again, it would be like torture. I do not want to ruin everyone's opinion with mine so ... my advice is to watch the movie first ... see it if you like it and after the vote (do not vote before look!) And besides ... look at it! Do not just take a look ... look at it until the end :))))))))) !!
