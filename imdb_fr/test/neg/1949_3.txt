It's a classic B-movie that you prefer not to waste your time watching. It started well and I thought it would become a good thriller, but I was wrong. Throughout the film, it is felt that soon, something interesting will happen and that everything will suddenly become a thriller under tension, but that does not happen. He runs slowly and peacefully until the end, with nothing interesting. The end was unexpected and original, but that's it. Vote: 2.5 out of 10. Oh, one more thing. Why is this film rated R anyway ???
