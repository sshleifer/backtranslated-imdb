How is it that in the 50s and 60s, the Italians made better films, and that in the 70s and 80s, they only made movies of zombies and cannibals? Probably because art films did not yield anything. The Cannibal Movie, unlike the Zombie movie, created by the Americans and "exploited" by the Italians, is a purely Italian creation, conceived as a showcase of global exploitation and to earn as much money as possible (no artistic integrity). way here). Eaten Alive arrived during the beautiful days of Cannibal Movie. The director, Umberto Lenzi, had not even achieved his goal; Cannibal Ferox, his classic genre, was still in a year. <br /> <br /> In a scenario similar to that of Cannibal's (read: snatch), Ruggero Deodato's classic Cannibal classic, a woman (Janet Agren) receives the word from the police received a 8mm film of his sister. She has disappeared in Africa and it is suspected that the tribal ritual described in the film may have something to do with it. Mel Ferrer, as a teacher of Somethingoranother, tells him that a man named Jonas (Ivan Rassimov) has created a worship service similar to Jonestown in New Guinea, and that is where his sister is. The woman hires a guide (Robert Kerman) to lead her into the jungle in search of the sect and her sister. And, you would not know, the jungle is full of cannibals. <br /> <br /> A sentence should summarize: if you've seen Cannibal Movie, you've seen them all, especially because these movies are flying shamelessly (Lenzi copied Cannibal Holocaust to make this movie, and rearranged this for Cannibal Ferox, Deodato copied parts for Hit and Run). And because they all share the same material, they all have the same traits: abominable photography, boring landscapes, terrible dubbing, overexploitation, and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. The fans will have a ball because everyone is a veteran. Rassimov and Kerman organize a landscape restoration contest. Agren exists only to be naked, violated or endangered. A lot of gore for all sickos. The cannibals, who actually seem to be native cannibals, eat under a veil disguised as human flesh. And, in the great tradition of Cannibal Movies, any live animal shown on the screen is usually killed soon after. Overall, it's really not a good experience, but I'm sure there are psychopaths who find these excrements fun. I know I did.
