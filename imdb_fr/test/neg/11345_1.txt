Dude ... I loved Buffy and Angel as much as the next sci-fi monster ... but that's too much. The worst actress of all time !! Not even David "Hot Pants" Boreanaz is able to save this shit. No wonder I never look Fox ?? it's blowing !! We totally gave a chance, and it continued to be bad. We watched four or five painful and agonizing episodes. I want to kill executives on the SO BAD network! Why spend money on this drivel?!?! I do not understand and I do not support it and you should NEVER waste your time watching this show ... unless you like it when your eyes bleed from their stockings! <br /> <br /> Shit. Shit. Shit.
