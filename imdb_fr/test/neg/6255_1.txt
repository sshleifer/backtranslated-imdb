This movie was just bad. I can forgive low budget movies for being on a budget, but it was not funny, it was not clever, it did not have any quality that buys, unless you really like to watch the movies. fake tits. I do not know how that genre is classified, maybe an erotic horror, but if so, well, it's not sexy or scary. Linking it to the Slumber Party Massacre movies was useless; I had never seen the previous films myself and, with the exception of one scene that was trying to link one to the other, I had no way of knowing who the psycho-escaped killer was from ' Cheerleader 'or why they were embarrassed to include it, especially because (and I do not think I reveal anything here) it was really obvious that the cheerleader killer in this movie was not him. As for the real killer? All I can say is lame. Really Nil When you find out why the killer recruits his team of cheerleaders (and the team coach, as well as two stoners who were in the bus trip they drive, and the bus driver just for the pleasure, apparently), you sit there and go-- WTF? Worst excuse for murderous madness. The "actors" (two suppose why I added the quotes) generally looked like rejections of low-budget pornography, which they most likely were. These poor people, trying to break into a "legitimate" film. One of my friends said this about the actor who plays Buzzy, the bus driver: "He looks like the guy who, you know, is really in, and his face is all red." We had a good larf at that. Half of the other actors had all the skill and subtlety of the actors of the production of "Annie" in sixth grade that I just saw. The other half seemed to be bored to death (especially in the deleted scene, this one redheaded ...), and ten minutes after the beginning of the film, I was too. <br /> <br /> Note: the DVD contains a deleted scene, which would have placed the R-rated movie at NC-17 if it had been left in it. It was completely free and as adult entertainment has no quality. The only reason to worry about it is to laugh, a lot, of malice.
