Obviously influenced by the success of Pal's "Destination Moon" and Lippert's "Rocketship X-M", this one does not work. Limited special effects, a thick story result in a production that even semi-decent actors can not save. Just no credibility here. Nobody seems surprised to meet Martians, a little like earthlings, etc. Pass it!
