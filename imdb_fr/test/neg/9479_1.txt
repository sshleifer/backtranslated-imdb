This film is really bad. It's funny to see what a bad story it is, where two American pea-brained twins who do not know anything from outside their school can come to another continent and do unimaginable things. It's so stupid and so weird. How can they simply find two French, flirt and kiss them at the end, without knowing anything about them? It would have been more realistic to have the guys take them away and rape them, which could easily have happened in such a situation. As for the place where they forced the French president to drink "bad water", it was just nil. I do not think he would have been too happy in real life. Everything worked too easily for the girls and they could have had real trouble several times in the film, if that represented real life. <br /> <br /> My rating: 0/10
