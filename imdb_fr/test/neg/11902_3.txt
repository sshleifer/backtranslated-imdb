This is a bad movie because its central message is very confusing and the plot seems to be the result of the merger of several disparate scripts. As a result, this often makes no sense and it is certainly not a film that Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud to do. However, the film is worth watching if you are a fan of "pre-code" movies as it presents an incredibly suspicious storyline that says that pretty girls MUST go out - even if they are not married and even if their partner !! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker assisting the troops traveling to Europe for the First World War. In doing so, she meets a scalawag (Bruce Cabot) who finally convinces her to sleep with him. She gets pregnant and then passes to the next woman unsuspecting. However, Miss Dunne does NOT want to get it back, because she realizes it's not worth it, but her baby dies later at birth. Although all of these highly controversial elements of the plot are used, they are always referred to - almost as if they wanted the adults in the audience to know it, but hoped that if they formulated it or filmed it properly, the children of the public would be: no idea (after all, movies were not rated and kids could watch any movie at that time). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the entire plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends at about 1/4 of the film's course. and is never mentioned again or mentioned. It was as if they had filmed part of a movie and abandoned it, turning it into another movie. In this second phase of the film, Miss Dunne begins working unexpectedly in a women's prison (although we never see her doing anything really there). What we see are countless horrific scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate. And, as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer. <br /> <br /> But, conversely, another type of film emerges. and the prison reform sector misses the ground Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married but desperately wants it. Throughout the film, Dunne is portrayed as a very good girl - even though she has had unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more or less trapped there). But now, the bachelor Irene, a reformer and a good, tireless lady, begins to sleep with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are separated and only married by name, but she never thinks to check if this is true, and with her assurance, her clothes are flying away and they are in the baby industry! BUT, while she is pregnant with her loving child, he is accused of being a crooked judge. He assures him that he is innocent, but he is found guilty and it looks like he is a scoundrel - using privileged information from people who came to his bench to amass a fortune. Then, in the final moments of the film, Miss Dunne tries in vain to make him free and agrees to wait with the child until the release of Huston. The film ends then. <br /> <br /> So we basically have three separate movies AND a weird idea from the early '30s of what a nice girl is. I realized that she should be a resolute worker who would instantly become an idiot in her personal relationships! It really negates all the positive aspects of Dunne's character and it's very hard to imagine anyone who would like the movie. A strong advocate for women's rights could easily take offense at her helplessness and need, and religious people might consider her totally amoral or at least morally suspicious! With a decent rewrite, it could have been a good film or at least interesting as an obscene and salacious film, but he could not decide WHAT he wanted to be and it was just another dull film of Pre-Code.
