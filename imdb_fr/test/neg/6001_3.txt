I normally like Jackie Chan's movies, but this one was terrible. There are only 2 or 3 fight scenes that are all about the normal level. The bad thing about this movie is that it focuses a lot on car racing. The car chase is not so bad (although not as exciting as the fights) but the car race at the end is exceptionally boring. Basically, you need everything that a Jackie Chan movie is a Jackie Chan movie and leave everything except Jackie Chan. Even the traditional outings at the end lack their usual humor. <br /> <br /> I guess to a certain extent, that was compounded by the fact that I saw one of those horrible dubbed versions. I usually try to see the subtitled version ... I wish I could understand Chinese. <br /> <br /> I saw only one Jackie movie worse than this one and one of his first forays into Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> To avoid unless you are really curious or if you like motorsports.
