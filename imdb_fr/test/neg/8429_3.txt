"Disappointing" is the best word I can think of for this movie, especially considering the rave reviews it gets from some other users. <br /> <br /> One thing that really spoils the movie is that it shows partiality meaning the word). It not only presents a very selective description of the games (focusing on the American athletics team), but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties encountered by the American team. <br /> <br /> What is even more disturbing is that all omissions and errors (?) seem to glorify American sportsmanship, to the exclusion of other athletes (with few exceptions) . For example, the viewer is led to believe that the United States won most of the medals at the Games, while they won only one out of four gold and six out of six. Similarly, many athletes are described as caricatures of their respective compatriots (so we have an arrogant British and a French who sucks wine). This attitude does little to serve the Olympic ideals that the film is supposed to celebrate. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think this film might appeal to the part of the American public who is looking for a quick boost of national self-esteem. Those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are welcome to look elsewhere.
