This film is an aborted, deadly attempt to put together several bad movies and make some kind of extra-bad movie. He fails even that, because there is far too much "plot", and not enough enough clumsy puppets and ridiculous gore. Seriously, the puppets are cute and the guys in costume make me very good. The performances are at best in category C and lame, with special accessories for the guy from Spec-Ops who spoke some sort of weird dialect of the East Coast / Venusian that was almost impossible to decipher. It's not that you really care about what he says, because only the curse words are distinct. On the cinematographic level, it's not offensive, much as one would expect from a simple video subscription directly rented (just like the scenario). The fact that New Concorde used footage from "Carnosaur" movies is shocking and confusing. For shame, New Concorde. For shame. "Carnosaur" is one of my favorite terrible movies, and they have somehow screwed up and made it almost unassailable. See the "Carnosaur" movies if you want to see a tiny dinosaur chaos. <br /> <br /> I give him a star because I love films so much that he steals, and also because the scale does not have zero.
