This is another film I missed on Italian television when I was little: we must highlight his quintet of aging stars, most of whom had never made a horror film of their lives (Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Houseman and Patricia Neal), this is the long-hidden crime of men who came back to haunt them. It takes the form of a ghostly bell ringer for the girl they all loved (Alice Krige) but they were forced to get rid of an unfortunate incident when she humiliated their ego! Fairbanks, who was responsible for the act, has twin sons (Craig Wasson) and Krige is holding his revenge on them. Soon one of these, Fairbanks himself and even Douglas and Houseman, all ended up dead. As a result, Wasson and Astaire decided to confront the ghost at the scene of the crime and face two sinister wanderers who obey Krige! I waited impatiently to see these veterans breathless (Douglas died before the film was presented, although he had already played another role at that time, while he proves that the song Swan is not very favorable to Astaire), but GHOST STORY also passes many mood changes - while maintaining a slow pace throughout the negotiation and emerging too long in the market - to be anything but a failed curiosity. Having sex swarms (including Wasson's frontal nudity!) And abominable makeup effects would further confuse the waters and spoil the old-fashioned elegance inherent in Jack Cardiff's (another long-time actor) cinema.
