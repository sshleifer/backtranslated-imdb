Frankie Muniz plays Jason, a high school student. His biggest problem is that his life is built on small or big lies that cause him problems most of the time. However, he can not escape his teacher and he completes his creative writing assignment just before the deadline. While he is quick to hand over his homework to the teacher, he crashes into a car. As he explains the situation to a grumpy man (Giamatti) in the car, he takes her to his school. But the problem is that Jason leaves his homework in the car, the other way to say it is that Marty Wolf (Giamatti) steals it. <br /> <br /> After a few months, Jason goes to the movies and sees a trailer that surprised him. Because the story of the film is based on his homework. He tells his parents, but of course they do not believe him. Especially his father uses words that insult him. Jason decides to go to Los Angeles and finds Wolf telling his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf refuses, Jason takes action and ruins his life. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Big Fat Liar. Well, as a children's movie, it can be light, but there are mistakes that could even ask if it is possible. For example, having such a small amount of money and going to Los Angeles with a friend to solve the problem, having access to the highly protected home and office of this movie producer, setting up a telecommunication system at night . Does this seem credible? It's not. Well, it's a children's movie, but kids are not that credulous. <br /> <br /> Big Fat Liar offers a little fun to its target audience. Unfortunately, I'm not a big liar to say it's a good movie. ** out of *****
