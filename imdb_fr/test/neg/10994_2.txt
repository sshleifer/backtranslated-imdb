It seems to be common in the 90s to play with clichés. Some manage to do it with a lot of talent. Hervé Hadmar does not do it. On paper, the film seemed interesting: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, black humor and a very offbeat style. The director Hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is embarrassing because nobody reacts in the theater. The film is incredibly slow and the actors seem to wonder what they are doing in this ridiculous masquerade. What could have been an elegant and funny stupid comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom.
