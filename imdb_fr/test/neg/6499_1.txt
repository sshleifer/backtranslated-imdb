Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the new Highlander is a little effeminate twerp named Quentin MacLeod, who is mentored by a new Ramirez while his little sister continues his quest to thwart an evil immortal lord. To do this, Quentin must absorb all the knowledge of the other immortals before this suzerain, Korton. <br /> <br /> In short, this is pure shit, much like the Highlander suites. Quentin is a pretty stupid character, he moans and moans constantly in a style "woe to me, for I am a reluctant hero", and he never understands that he is immortal and that he can not be killed. the least not easily. Ramirez would have done better to abandon it and thwart Korton himself.
