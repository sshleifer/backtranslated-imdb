the man was so hard to look at! it was not funny at all, not well done and it had no interest or plot to that. the game was horrible. it was not well done at all. it looked like a bunch of kids my age just circling and making a useless movie. it's by far the worst broken lizard movie. If you are a broken lizard movie like me, you will be disappointed and bored until you die. please skip this useless movie on ugly guys looking for chicks. you will not regret my advice. By the way, do not say you did not find this review useful just because you disagree with that. it's stupid, like this movie. The only acceptable scene was that of the main player who played rugby and was beaten. I liked this reason because I found his character damn boring.
