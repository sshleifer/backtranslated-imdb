This film may have some work to do because it was shot in 1979. That said, it's really terrible. <br /> <br /> It does not matter the laughable retro-projection or the terrible camera- followed by objects supposedly "in flight", it is the stunts that the Concorde pulls that will make you blink, incredulously, in front of you. absurdity. Barrels, loops and "evasive" violent maneuvers made me wonder why the world's Air Force was not flying only Concordes as the main fighters. <br /> <br /> important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheese party: <br /> <br /> 1. The Concorde is at least as agile as a Phantom jet fighter. /. You can fire a Mach 2 submachine gun just by opening the cockpit window and spreading your arm. <br /> <br /> 3. If the flare gun can not discharge, do not drop it, as it may go out. <br /> <br /> 4. The Concorde can avoid up to two Sidewinder missiles that have been fired at once. <br /> <br /> 5. A flare will each time divert a missile in search of heat. <br /> <br /> 6. Shutting down your reactors is a surefire way to scare away missiles thermo-seek if 5 (above) breaks down. <br /> <br /> 7. During a forced landing in the Concorde, it is apparently impossible to dump your fuel in advance. <br /> <br /> 8. The Concorde pilots are all veterans trained in combat. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, this film is not very realistic. The effects are primitive compared to current standards and, combined with the foolish acrobatics performed by the Concorde, make it a film worthy of little contempt. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Not recommended at all!
