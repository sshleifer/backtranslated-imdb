The previous review is pretty much on target, which Altman was not with this movie. I had not seen it since it was released, but I rarely spent two hours in a theater feeling as miserable and disappointed as this movie. If a pretentious community theater is trying out a science fiction version of a Ingmar Bergman film, it could be that way. I can not bring myself to give anything. Altman made a "1", but it's probably the nadir of a career that has had remarkable ups and downs. I would be out, but as a paid movie critic, I could not. (Think about it the next time you envy film critics.)
