it's a TV movie, and yet the rating on the box indicates that it's rated. Nothing in the film can claim an R rating apart. However, the movie is very slow and useless.I mean The idea was good, but nothing was done with the script. It just has not been developed. It's pretty scary, and the acting is actually pretty good, better than the movie deserves. I do not see myself seeing him again so soon, if there have been other films about the same concept that are better realized than this one. I have not seen too many Wes Craven movies, so I can not really compare it to no other movie. As for this movie itself though, I think it is poorly designed and executed. For me, I can not give Chiller a score above 3/10.
