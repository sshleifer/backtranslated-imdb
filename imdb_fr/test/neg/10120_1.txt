This movie is really that bad, and I'm normally a fool for bad movies, but it was too much. Seeing this is like OD'ing on pure SUCK. Now you can think that you have seen the bottom of the cannon. You may have gone through all the titles of Full Moon and Troma, all the movies of Edward D. Wood Jr, Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and the DVD movies of real men of action. You may have even seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a large number of films covered by MST3K, but in their original form. But you do not know how to make a really horrible movie until you've seen Darkhunters. And if you have not done it, you should not. Do not bother yourself. Not only is this film incredibly poorly written, directed, filmed, edited, played and splashed into raw and inexpensive sequels. First of all, it's a pretentious mess. But it's not good, Greenaway or the Lynch, pretentious or hilarious, in the style of Ittenbach or the beginning of the Water. This is the kind of pretense that occurs when someone incredibly stupid thinks they've come up with something incredibly smart. A bit like Mr. Night Shaymalan (sp?), Only this man looks like a fucking messiah when compared to this sinking (and this comes from a hateful Shaymalan hate). It's also boring. Not heavy, boring guy, which is good, if the movie gives you patience. Darkhunters does not do anything. It's boring in a "Oh my God, my God, if I see another cat shot tuned to an odious sound, I'll get killed (King kill me!") - sort of. <br /> <br /> In fact, anyone who claims to love this film is a daring liar and anyone who claims that this film is complex or deep knows what their mother looks like in bed.
