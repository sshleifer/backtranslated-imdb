The lives of Megan (Jackie Kresler) and Dylan (Shane Elliott) change in the Nevada desert between Reno and Las Vegas. They stop to eat in a greasy little spoon where they reluctantly discover the famous Area 51 of the owner of the caf√© (Jonathan Breck). After finding the road in their forty-year-old Lincoln, the radio gets a bit crazy by broadcasting Hitler's speech at the 1836 Olympic Games, and then a 1958 Elvis Presley newscast aimed at the military. . The car slowly breaks down and the two men fear for their lives as mysterious inexplicable things happen in the solitary desert poisoned by radiation; remnants of nuclear tests. Megan meets a lost girl (Channing Nichols) and a wounded soldier from the Second World War. The nightmarish journey does not stop there. Kresler is impressive to a certain extent and screenwriter / director James Lay makes good use of Patsy Cline's tunes. Overall, science fiction rather interesting.
