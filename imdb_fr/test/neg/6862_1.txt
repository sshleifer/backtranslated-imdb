I remember seeing this movie when I was about 10, a friend of mine had it. At the time, it was just a movie, I was about 10 years old and I considered it another action movie. <br /> <br /> When I look back like a complete movie buff, it's a terribly bad movie. I'm sure anyone who produced this film had a short career in Hollywood. Although the main actor seems to have shot a few movies according to IMDb, although I have never seen and I do not remember him too much. <br /> <br /> Anyway, just to say that this movie is really bad, in any way possible. I would like to see him again though: oD
