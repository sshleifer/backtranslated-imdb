The title of this documentary is very misleading. At no point during the documentary do they show how the introduction of Nile perch fish into Lake Victoria has been the source of the problems facing the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. The film tries to put Tanzania's problems on an environmental cause, but the truth is that the problems come from an outside parasitic force. The documentary is very slow, without narrative. Instead, it relies on small fragments of text between unbound segments to display information that does not add or expand the object. There are only two attempts to examine the environmental effects of Nile perch. One of them is a small segment of about 10 seconds in which they question the factory managers where the fish is being processed and briefly explains how 50 years ago the Nile perch was introduced into the lake and consumed other species of fish. The filmmaker makes no attempt to delve deeper into the issue. The second attempt takes place when, in this documentary, they film the screening of another documentary that deals with the environmental impact of the Nile perch on the environment. No real attempt is made to explain the magnitude of the problem. <br /> <br /> The subject of this documentary has nothing to do with perch, but rather with the problems facing most African countries. The film tries to link the introduction of perch with AIDS, poverty and pollution in Tanzania, but never creates a direct link. As any intelligent person is familiar with the problems of Africa, these are not unique to Tanzania, but concern most of Africa and have nothing to do with fish. It would have been nice if the filmmakers had shown how the economy or local life was before the fish was introduced and how it had a negative impact on the introduction of the fish, but that is not the case. In fact, many interviewees said that fish have created jobs and created opportunities for many. Yes, things are bad in the city of Mwanza, but they are worse in other parts of the country and the continent. <br /> <br /> A weak attempt by documentarists to associate fish with famine problems in Tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. First of all, Tanzania is a very big country and Lake Victoria is only a small part of the country. Interviewees said they could actually go to Mwanza, the lakeside fishing town, to find a job and feed their families because the situation was so bad in other parts of the country. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very weak, has no story and does not try to link anything it displays to the Nile Perch. It plays on people's emotions by displaying images of the devastation of poverty, famine and AIDS, without trying to show you how it is unique in the Lake Victoria region of Tanzania or directly related to perch fish. The fact is that most of the problems have more to do with war, globalization and Christianity than with the environmental effects of perch fish itself.
