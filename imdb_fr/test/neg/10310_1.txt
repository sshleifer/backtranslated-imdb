Oh man! Oh man! On the worn VHS cover, a photo of Sandra Bullock and her name are written at the top. I think the only reason they had the chance to sell the movie in the 90s was because of Sandra Bullock's name. Bullock fans must not disappoint. Sandra is the only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only one you can call playing. Rest of the movie ?? It's fun to watch the first fifteen minutes because it's bad, but after that, it'll get worse. Much worse. The staging is awful. Play is terrible. The script is awful. The dialogue is awful. The action is terrible. The music is very good actually. Typical score for action movies of the eighties. This film is so bad that it gets close to everything Andy Sidaris has ever produced. It's so bad that there's no proper word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie. But still, there was Sandra Bullock. And super cool (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> I think they can now release the movie on DVD. That could be cool! And they should write on the cover: WINNER SANDRA BULLOCK IN HANGMEN, AWARD WINNER ACADEMY <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
