There are so many holes in the plot that you wonder if they knew they had an audience for it and they just threw it together. I do not know much about George Zucco, but I saw him in two films. Obviously, he was introduced as the loving father, the mad scientist, the vampire guy. He looks so ordinary. I'm surprised he found himself in the genre. This is the typical, "I will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army." By transferring wolf's blood (or is it a coyote) into his hands, he turns him into a werewolf. Glen Strange, who was one of Karloff's successors as a Frankenstein monster, plays the kind and adorable hired man who is victimized because he trusts the mad doctor. At first, the scientist is able to control when Petro (his name) can be transformed. But, like the invisible man, he suddenly begins to transform himself and becomes a handicap. There is a little love story about the girl and a high-pitched journalist (Golly Miss Brooks). She wants to leave, but her father, the doctor, will not allow it. He is also motivated by a group of his peers who laughed at his research before and he will now be satisfied. The way he plots to embarrass or kill them is pretty far-fetched and depends a lot on Petro and the sitting guys waiting to be attacked. It's not a very good movie. The highlight is the atmosphere of the woods as people and monsters hide around the Spanish moss. Once again, city dwellers are a bunch of morons, who seem to have escaped from a bad western. One thing that has stayed with me is that a little girl is the first victim and this seems unusual for a movie of that time. There is also an old lady who smokes a pipe and knows the werewolves but no one is listening.
