Critics like this movie. I personally found it insane and tasteless. It's the one millionth time I fall into the trap "Critics love it" and I went out wishing someone throwing boiling water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie . There are many scenes that are completely useless. A warning to animal lovers: do not see this film if you do not want to see sheep killed and assaulted. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Asian movie, see Afrika. If you want to see a movie about escaped convicts, check out Gene Wilder / Richard Pryor's classic Stir Crazy. Avoid 9 souls like the plague.
