I'm a big fan of horror film and I bought this movie because of all the hype he got on the forums. Well, let me tell you that I do not know who was doing all this hype, but let me talk about a few things. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is "not" MANY things. It's not scary, suspensive, bloody, or sick (except for one season, maybe) not beautifully marked .... EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> The principle of the film is that a couple flees to a small island in Greece, because they did a little mischief in London. We do not even know what they did, but presumably they killed someone. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler alert ** <br /> <br /> The male character kills some people of his perversion of "cleaning the island of perverts" oddly enough. Murders are cheap, characters are cheaper and the effects are nil. <br /> <br /> There is a party when he rapes a goat because his wife will not give it to him in the morning, but even that is careless for how he is shot. <br /> <br /> end of spoilers <br /> <br /> The end of the film is pretty much the only thing that is not totally predictable. I particularly enjoyed when the "shepherd" fart on the husband. Anyway, if you can rent this and have 2 hours to spare, go for it. It's no better than a cheese sandwich melted on moldy bread. <br /> <br /> 3/10
