When I read Kahin Pyaar's reviews Na Ho Jaaye, I thought, "Huh?" It was so confusing. To be sure, I went to see the movie and what do you know? It's a remake of "The Wedding Singer". Several scenes have been modified to fit the essence of Indianness, but the rest is directly inspired by the 1998 Hollywood hit. Bollywood is no stranger to remakes, but this one is so poor that it hurts to watch it. I moaned as I watched this and realized that I was not the only one to do it! A guy came out of the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop playing comic roles. He's screaming and complaining too much. Why can not he just go easy? It does not do justice to the role played originally by Adam Sandler. He does not have the sense of Sandler's cartoon. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but she is not Drew Barrymore either. The scene where she stands in front of a mirror and trains to say her new last name ("Hello, I'm Mrs. Pugalia") does not match the Barrymore version ("Hello, I'm Mrs. Julia Gulia"). I felt embarrassed to watch this scene, even though I had loved the original. The music is not too bad. This is probably the only saving grace of this otherwise awful movie! Avoid that at all costs!
