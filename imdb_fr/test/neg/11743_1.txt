A horrible film, poorly designed and raw. The acting of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version that you have to see it to believe it. There was no reason to make this picture, which only highlights how Hitchcock was accomplished and brilliant and inimitable. In addition, there is a creeping and ubiquitous insensitivity in the film that is not present in the first film. Hitchcock's psychopath was scary and shocking, but you could really feel interest for everyone, even poor Norman Bates. There were moments of pathos, irony and fairy humor that the remake did not have. One of the strengths of Hitchcock's film is its incredible and intuitive depth as well as its sense of nuance, when to cut and when to show something, the opportunity to use a close or long shot , to make a player friendly and when to make it scary, and so on. The remake has none of these qualities and does not even try to acquire them. It's a stupid exercise that I'm amazed to have even let go.
