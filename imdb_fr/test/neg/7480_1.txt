Before Last Call w / Carson Daly, my local NBC affiliate aired a much more interesting lineup after Late Night w / Conan, such as the city's second television, reruns of 3rd Rock From the Sun and Carline in the City . These days, nothing is worth watching, because all I see is Carson Daly and his dread show. He is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be famous because he is neither a good speaker nor a comedian. <br /> <br /> During his show on June 21, he tried to use an Internet network. even called the "Rickroll" in his show. He failed hard. This event confirms that Carson Daly is awful.
