The production company of this film is called "Nott Entertainment", and it's a surprisingly appropriate name. It's very entertaining from start to finish, which is a shame because a mix of zombie and western could have been interesting. Whenever a low-budget zombie movie will be released, it will tend to be "for fans, by fans". In fact, I consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but there are many more that look like this and I will reevaluate my opinion! The film seems to be a scam of the Australian zombie movie 'Undead', rather than having the lead role in a cowboy hat; everyone wears one; but it does not make much sense because the film is apparently in modern times. The sequence of credits at the beginning of the film makes us believe that we will be in an atmospheric film, but when the film starts correctly; it soon becomes clear what we are doing. Of course, there is quite a bit of gore and it's actually pretty good, although the good things I say about the movie are pretty much over there. There is a turn at the halfway point that could have been interesting if the rest of the movie was. Overall, this is just another zombie movie in a world where there are too many zombie movies. I do not recommend it.
