How does David Lynch do it? Unlike legions of guys wearing dark-rimmed glasses and pretentious movie critics who praise his name, I just do not see how that guy continues to get paid for making such guts. How can Lynch carelessly concoct the remnants of a failed television pilot into a crazy, badly handled mess that critics love and actually include in the best lists of the year? If you're looking for a good movie, rent "Bound" instead. If you are looking for a good movie "puzzle", try "Memento". But beware of this over-excited stinker unless your idea of ​​a fun night makes you lose two and a half hours of your life and $ 3.50 of your hard-earned money.
