Ravi Chopra wrote this film 40 years ago, wanted to launch Dilip Kumar in the lead <br /> <br /> The film was finally rewritten and realized in 2003 and the subject looks so dated and too superficial sometimes <br /> <br /> As the reason why Amitabh-Hema separates is too superficial, even if the presentation of the youth is unfortunate, like Gulshan in AVTAAR <br /> <br /> The message is good, but things are presented in a clich√©d way. The character of Salman is the worst, he looks straight out of a storybook, the culminating speech of Bachchan is good and the final not to forgive the sons is good. <br /> <br /> Ravi Chopra does a good job Music is good, The songs sung by Bachchan stand out <br /> <br /> Amitabh excels as always, he played an older father, but he play here a victim and portrays him well. Her last speech is awesome Hema is good in her role Aman Verma stands out Samir Soni is fine, Naseer and other sons and women are decent although Divya Dutta stands out ke, Mahima is fine Paresh and Lillete are adorable
