It is unfortunate that Schwarzenegger was the best in this production, especially considering that it was not yet in its genre and that it was still as hard as cardboard at the time. delivery of his dialogue. <br /> <br /> is not as bad as some critics say, but it's not good either. It's fun, and really plays like a poor peasant cousin of the Conan lineage, making it a conflictual, uneven, mediocre job. And speaking of poor, the quality is terrible, because of the time when it was shot, but that's not the only reason. <br /> <br /> The story here is inferior, even to the Conan line, but moreover, it gets lost in the "Red Sonja must be dominated by Schwarzenegger's great stratagem" and completely forgets its purpose, s he already has one. <br /> <br /> It's an entertaining entertainment, but on a low budget -Please "B" kind of way. <br /> <br /> He notes a 4.2 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
