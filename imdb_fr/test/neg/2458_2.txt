After watching this movie, I left with a guilty conscience. The film itself has a rather intriguing plot and premise, but unfortunately, it's a movie you can not watch without being bombarded with pornography. If you plan to look at this and you have a moral problem with the degradation of the marital act to the delight of the spectators, you make a big mistake. This is not the type of movie with the token sex scene that you can ignore on your DVD player. At the beginning of the film, Baldwin's character is a video recording his sexual exploits without his partner's knowledge. This and other similar tapes continue to appear throughout the film at unpredictable times. It seems that the film is trying to make a statement about the dignity of women. Ironically, they made many women prostitutes. I only gave him a 2 instead of a 1 because if they had better managed the promiscuity of Baldwin, it would have been an interesting film.
