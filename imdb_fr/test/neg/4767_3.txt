Although it's not one of Miss Davies's worst movies, it's a shame. And it is unfortunate that, in a revisionist way, the recent IMDb raters deliberately over-inflated the scores of some of his films to compensate for the fact that she had been despised in the past - at least, it seems -he. For years, the conventional wisdom was that Davies was a terrible actress and had the roles she had only because her son-in-law, William Randolph Hearst, had made his way to Hollywood. This is certainly the image created in CITIZEN KANE by Orson Welles. It is true that Hearst used his considerable fortune and weight to build Davies' career. With all this money, it's no surprise that she has made some great films and that people do not care anymore because of all the extra attention she has had. Sleeping with the man who finances your movies will not fail to make you notice. However, despite this advantage, she has also made a decent number of bad movies and I think we really need to balance her movie scores. After all, no rational person could believe that as of today (1/5/08), PEG O 'MY HEART and two other Davies films recently shown in Turner Classic Movies (THE FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE) deserved exceptionally high scores - ranking them higher than movies such as HIGH NOON, BEN HUR, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE, and QUIET ON THE WEST FRONT! In fact, MARIANNE would now be the fifth best movie of all time according to IMDb with a score of 8.8 !!! Considering that most people do not even know who Marion Davies was and that most of his films were financial disasters, this is a serious problem !! However, she was a much better actress than CITIZEN KANE had suggested and had first pierced in the movies before starting to sleep with Hearst. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes PEG O 'MY HEART from these two other films is that MARIANNE and THE FLORODORA GIRL were nice little movies - while PEG O' MY HEART is in some ways all just terrible. A big part of the reason was Marion's terrible merging mistake. While her French accent in MARIANNE was cute, in PEG, her Irish accent sounded bizarre - not particularly Irish. Plus, I may be wrong, but his continued use of the word "you" gives him the impression of doing Shakespeare, not a movie taking place in 1933 in Ireland! In addition, there was a bizarre insistence that Marion become the multi-talented and consummate star - so she had not only encouraged him to play, but to dance and sing. The song actually corresponds to the scripts of some of his films, but here it seemed out of place and seriously harmed the film. It just seemed like you could almost hear Hearst shout, "She's a great actress, watch her sing and dance." Unfortunately, Marion looked uncomfortable and misplaced in many of these scenes. But for me, the biggest problem was the idea that Marion, 36, plays such a young role. It was obvious that the character she had played at the beginning of the film was supposed to be similar to the one that Mary Pickford had played in her teens and twenties, with her pigtails and her brave attitude. Miss Pickford COULD assume these roles even though she too was no longer a girl. But here, Marion had gained some weight and had at least 30. No offense, she looked good for her age, but she did NOT look like a teenager! <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, with the millions that Hearts spent on Marion's career, he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money on was a good storyline. the measure of his talents. Believe me, I've rated some of her movies very high (I particularly love SHOW PEOPLE), but here she could not help but miss - this movie was a turkey.
