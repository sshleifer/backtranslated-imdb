Stop me if you play badly before, some cheerleaders, their coach and some guys are stuck in a cabin in the woods when an invisible killer kills them one by one. Shame on me, after totally exclaiming Jim Wynorski after the horrible "Busty Cops" (it was a long time coming because his last really good movie was "Hard to Die" of the 1990s), I still had my hopes a supposed sequel to "Slumber Party Massacre". Unfortunately, even my poor expectations have not been met. This release is not as fun as the previous three films of the franchise (and yes, I include SPM 2, it should tell you something). Plus, how can you have a slasher movie with this little gore ??? I mean, come on now !! <br /> <br /> My note: D <br /> <br /> Candy eyes: Ricky Ray becomes topless; April Flowers and Charity Rahmer show breasts and buns in a shower scene (April, she will be naked again later in the film), and Tamie Sheffield undresses and discovers hotcakes
