Junior and his father begin a new life in a new city. It's the same life because Junior did not change at all. He's still the same rotten kid as before, but he's grown taller. This time he has a friend named Trixie and she is only slightly worse. Junior does not like his father in his dating and spoils every opportunity he has. Then grandpa settles and the dog arrives. I thought they would have made a good movie but they did not even become friends until the end. It's a movie for the most immature. It contains diapers, farts, dogs, and toilet humor. Only someone under the age of twelve would find this super hilarious. I hope that when I have a son, he is exactly like Junior.
