If this film made sense, I never discovered it. A very depressing film that would be about the final evacuation of the inhabitants of a dam on the Northfork River in Montana. The problem is that there is no real Northfork River in Montana. There are several forks to the north, but they are branches of other rivers that divide into forks to the north and south. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of the film is a coffin floating on the surface of the lake, but the scene is never linked in the story and the viewer is led to speculate on its meaning. But there remains much to speculation of the viewer in the film. Another example is when a team of workers from the Resident Evacuation Dam arrive at the dam headquarters, another group of people leave. An almost inaudible remark is made about these people, which makes no sense and there is no follow-up in the film to explain it. <br /> <br /> The film is cut into several stories and the film keeps rocking back and forth between stories that is pretty disconcerting. And the stories are strange. In one of them, the occupants of a property refuse to be evacuated because they live in a house built like Noah's ark. <br /> <br /> Another insane story centers on a sick orphan who is dying. share his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an orphanage with a priest at the same time. If anyone can understand what the ghost story tells about the author must have explained it to them. <br /> <br /> The landscape was dark and the sun never shines. There are snowy mountains in the distance. I guess the goal was to set the mood. The period of time is set by the fact that the evacuators were all driving Ford sedans of the 1946-1948 era, although the events were supposed to have occurred in 1955. The acting was mediocre. When I saw the movie for this movie, it was said that Darryl Hannah was in the picture. If she was, I did not recognize her but I guess she was the ghost woman.
