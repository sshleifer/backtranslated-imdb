This is by far the worst movie I have seen this year in Bollywood. I may not lie, my wife liked this movie a lot. It was not Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal that made this movie amazing, but Amisha Patel. She plays the role of a blind woman who has problems when she falls almost from a mountain where (fortunately for her) the hero Arjun Rampal comes to save her (in the middle of nowhere). It surprises me to see how blind a girl is aware of the danger when she is about to fall from a mountain because she can not see her environment. From this scene, I started watching the film very closely and in every scene there was a flaw in Amisha Patel's acting. The way she plays a blind girl is very bad. She only does not look into the eyes of the person she is talking to. When I saw this film, I more respected Rani Mukherjee during his performance in the movie Black. Amisha will never reach this level as an actress. <br /> <br /> Anyway, she falls in love with Arjun Rampal. This is the story of clich√©. Suddenly Arjun is killed by a man who is madly in love with Amisha. Amisha is in despair but Bobby enters the movie. He also falls in love with the blind girl. From my point of view, Bobby Deol is a great actor, but he can not pull the film to a higher level where Amisha Patel buries it deep in the earth. I must say that Bobby deserves better roles in better films than he has gotten so far. Bobby grew up playing the first film that his handsome daddy gave him. He was so bad in the role of Barsaat, but when we see him acting now, we have shivers and we believe every word he says. Only a film with great potential like a film of Yash Copra must meet. <br /> <br /> Okay, when Amisha also falls in love with Bobby, someone enters her life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who believes this shit? I do not. Why did not they give his role to one of the ugly guys in the film's family (Shushant Singh or Aryeman Ramsay) and give Bobby a role in one of the blockbusters with Amitabh Bachchan? I'm sorry if my comment sounds like a cry for an actor like Bobby to give him a big role, but he deserves so much better than a movie with Amisha (big-screen face) Patel. This movie was so horrible that I regret having bought it.
