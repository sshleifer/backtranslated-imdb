I saw this movie for the first time in the middle / late 80s, when I was a child. We could not even go all the way. The dialogue, the acting, all that was happening there was beyond the lame. <br /> <br /> Here are some examples ... imagine them really dramatically speaking, much too hectic: "Oreegon?" Why would anyone want to go to Oreegon? <br /> <br /> > "Survivors? Nobody ever talked to us about survivors!" <br /> <br /> This film was really bad, my sister and I rented again for her 16-year-old party, just so our friends could sit down and laugh at how awful it was. I do not think we could finish it either!
