The gang is back for more! Ron Howard and Cindy Williams are now married! His brother is protesting against the draft and Charles Martin Smith is doing everything he can to get Vietnam back home. <br /> <br /> The problems of the 60's are brought to light here, but everything is starting with the 1963 New Year, then three minutes later, we are New Year 1964 and then three minutes later It's New Year's Day 1965, then three minutes later we're back to 1963. Martin Smith talks about his friend's death in a drag race a year ago. A few scenes later, this friend wins his next round in a drag race and, to top it off, the drug scene and the flower children enter the picture (or images, in some cases, up to three different images of the camera are displayed on the screen at the same time). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, you have to WATCH this movie, but I would advise you to stick to the original and leave it there. Wolfman Jack is heard at the beginning of the film before almost every song is broadcast in the background, but where did he go? Maybe he could not follow that movie either and stop! 2 out of 10 stars!
