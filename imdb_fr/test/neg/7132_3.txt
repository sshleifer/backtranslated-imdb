Let me start by saying that I loved the original Grudge. It was one of the scariest and scariest experiences I've ever had in a busy movie theater. I am not joking. Being a self-proclaimed japanophile also allowed me to make the film more enjoyable to me (if the scenery had been changed to an American suburb, I would have ended up hating the movie). <br /> <br /> That said. This movie is a complete mess! I will not say that it sucks, because A) the film has some good points, B) "it sucks" is the most lamentable in the history of the lame depression. So, what does the film have to go? Well, for beginners, it has a pretty cool look: thanks to the filters and the use of dark and faded colors, Takashi Shimizu recreates almost the relaxed and anxious atmosphere of the original. Some scenes are really shocking and unpredictable. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just bad. Period. <br /> <br /> The story is omnipresent, says the Tarantino style unnecessarily, that is to say that the scenes are not in chronological order. This technique is useless in the case of this film and it simply makes things more confusing. Frankly, a simple conspiracy would have worked better. The original also lacked intrigue, but it made sense and the film largely compensated for its thin plot with a lot of scares and a really tense atmosphere. Grudge 2 has none of these elements and is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the acting talent in a television show that gives the Grudge film cast the appearance of Emily Watson and Katherine Hepburn. In simple terms, the movie does not work. It's too slow, too boring, and not scary enough to make up for the confusing plot (which adds nothing new to the story, and even Grudge fans will not be happy). <br /> <br /> Oh, what's up with the old man who's playing cuckoo on the bus? Is it supposed to be a comic relief? Artistic statement? Or what?
