Pat O'Brien describes Knute Rockne, the American football coach Notre-Dame. There is no doubt that this film will please many people interested in certain aspects of Knute Rockne's "American Football Notre Dame" - probably the most interesting for fans of football and / or Notre Dame football. You will see good extracts of documentary films. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is difficult to recommend it as a FILM. It's not much more than a historical document. You'll know that the end is close when Gale Page will be cold-eyed - and do not blink, otherwise Ronald Reagan will not fail to do so, "Camille"! <br /> <br /> *** Knute Rockne - All-American (1940), Lloyd Bacon ~ Pat O'Brien, Gale Page, Ronald Reagan
