"Scarecrow Gone Wild: It's the death of the party!" Do I need to say more? Scarecrow wild wild received four out of ten stars for a simple reason: apart from the drama, intrigue, cheap special effects and the anti-climax whistle, it was cinematic gold! I think this film could have been really good, if the scarecrow had turned out to be the baseball coach (described by the very brilliant Ken Shamrock). But then again, they should have cut those AWESOME awesome "Return of the Jedi". <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, my friends and I were convinced that it had actually been written by one of our friends, a stereotypical teenager. This film has women with bare breasts, cheery blood and a dialogue that could not have come out of a paper bag or, in this case, a cornfield. <br /> <br /> If I could ask something to the filmmaker, that would be it; "How much did you have to pay the teenager who wrote this for you?"
