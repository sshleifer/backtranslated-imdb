WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, I was expecting it to be a vampire movie, which will be great considering how Rodriguez and Tarantino all have two contributed to the making of the film. I started about 15 minutes and my hopes for this movie were already in vain, which shocked me. First of all, the story she told was not at all attractive, it was just boring and unconvincing to the point where I just wanted to turn it off. I was getting more and more frustrated with this movie, but I guess I was hoping it would get better ... then, when he finally showed the vampires it was BLEW MY MIND, VERY bad. I thought, "Okay, this movie started with a horrible story about these two criminals, and then VERY slowly turned into a vampire movie that I thought was from beginning to end, in the last 30 minutes?" To add to that, they try to make the main characters super cool and awesome and mean at the end when they just are not; A rabbit would have been more intimidating than these characters! This movie is a horrible piece of shit !!! From dusk to dawn disgraced me and left me with a terrible taste in my mouth, discouraging thoughts in my head and left my body unable to move from the horrible shock I had lost to losing 108 minutes of my life in a horrible movie . I do not understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, all the good and honorable actors they are, could take part in this useless dirt. From my side, From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Do not see it, you will do yourself a great favor ...
