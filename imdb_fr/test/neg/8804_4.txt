(spoiler) It could be the worst movie you see, you could love it like I did it I really like it. It's one of those odds movies. <br /> <br /> There is a man who has seen a day in life. Black rats are sometimes sorry (which, in my opinion, was a good idea). <br /> <br /> The killer rats befriend a man, a tall man coming to feel undesirable. ground both bodies covered with large black rats not much blood. <br /> <br /> but think big black rats all over the body) but start killing few people but rats will get bored until rats kill friends and friends, > <br /> There was a scene sitting on the toilet as the rats entered the pipes leading to the toilet and the rat was riding his own and coming out of his mouth (which means the rats I have to make me laugh for weeks <br /> <br /> why I liked this film, yes it's different from the rest, I love ONE when a little creature faces humanity. <br /> <br /> If you saw one of those movie slugs, slither, them, spiders, snakes, tremors, cujo, crocodile, shark, octopus. <br /> <br /> If you loved them and check the Hood rats, <br /> <br It's better then Terrons Toons than anything I can say!
