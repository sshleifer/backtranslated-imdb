Bronson took the money and ran with this movie; he must have house payments like me! This low budget film, shot in Mexico, reminds me of some of those biting Italians from abroad. I heard that I did not know if it was true, but the companies are shooting these movies in foreign countries for tax purposes. I believe it because otherwise, why would they make this film, it was certainly not to earn money. We had a lot of these chips made in Canada because the government gave tax breaks to create a film industry. I wonder if that has been successful in other countries, such as Canada. Anyway, back to the subject this movie is badly done in every aspect, I think they caught Charles Bronson in order to sell this stench; this corpse at the end seems very false. 3/10
