When LA CHAISE PUFFY wavers, beware of its soft, colorful padding. <br /> <br /> The film starts pretty well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a boyfriend-girlfriend who is having a difficult relationship. An argument occurs one night and, in order to catch up, Josh asks Emily to go to her father's house on a car trip, where Josh plans to deliver a LazyBoy purple reclining chair for her birthday. his father. Emily agrees and on the way they pick up Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), Josh's nimble brother, an Amish-looking man more in touch with the lives of other peoples than his own. <br /> <br /> The roadtrip quickly turns into more quarrels between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (at first, it's very dirty and collapses until Josh "Convinces" the original owner to renovate it). Rhett quickly finds that the cause of all of Emily's and Josh's problems is LazyBoy and puts it on fire one night ... <br /> <br /> And this is the last time we hear about the chair, although there are many minutes remaining in the movie. <br /> <br /> The big problem is that the title of the film is The Puffy Chair, while it is not the presidency that takes center stage. It's the doomed relationship of Josh and Emily and how the road-trip seals their feelings for each other. Once the chair is destroyed, it is no longer mentioned, even if they arrive at the home of Josh's parents on the birthday of his father without a gift. Josh never mentions the chair, any more than his father. There is no connection between that and the lives of these people. So, why call The Puffy Chair and why is there no connection to it at the end? Bad scenario. <br /> <br /> The other boring thing is that Mark Duplass's brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director but also the cameraman (and not very good). Almost every scene zooms quickly on characters that become grainy and fuzzy before the camera's autofocus catches up and straighten. At first, it took on a picturesque and artistic appearance, but quickly became unbearable. <br /> <br /> The game in the film is accessible and entertaining. All actors / actresses did a good job. But the mediocre quality of the production, the overheated end and the lack of coherence of the title caused too many problems to this film.
