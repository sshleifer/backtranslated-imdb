I'm sorry, but these enthusiastic critics on this prestigious film about "Respiro" are strange to say the least. The craziness is picturesque, I ask and did not find an answer. Of course, the film is beautifully filmed. In part, it's almost a documentary. But then, the fact is that when it comes to the Grazia woman, she shows all the signs of a serious illness and I wondered throughout the movie what she had. His behavior is absolutely disturbing and the (shocked) citizens of the village are very right in wanting to send him to an appropriate institution to see what can be done to remedy his condition. She needs treatment, urgently! Behavior like hers is hell for everyone around her, her husband, poor children (especially) and fellow citizens. Let's not be falsely romantic about it! I hated this tolerant portrait of a mentally ill person. WHY, for God's sake, should not the husband want to heal her or at least try to do it? Why the horror of going to Milan (a big city, of course, but many possibilities of people able to cure it)? Narrowness? Irresponsibility? In any case, I was inspired on this site to rent the film on DVD and after seeing it, I had to post it so that others could make an opinion. Frankly, I understand why the film did not become an additional indication of the Cannes selection ...
