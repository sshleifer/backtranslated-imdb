This film was made before. It is essentially a combo without originality of "Napoleon Dynamite" and "Sordid Lives". There are funny pieces, but otherwise it's a clich√©. This is a good first film attempt and the director (who also played the lead role and wrote the feature film) shows a lot of promise. But the writing was a little hectic and the story was not very original. I swear I had heard some of the lines in other movies. However, the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way. It's also refreshing to see that homosexual-themed movies are not bogged down in politically correct speeches and exhausted stories of anguish. The main character seemed pretty well suited to a gay teenager from rural Texas, so no saccharine, a drama coming out of us!
