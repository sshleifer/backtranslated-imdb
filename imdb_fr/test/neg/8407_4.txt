Uh ... Okay, it's very mediocre if you compare it to the first film, Rosemary's Baby, critically acclaimed. In fact, it's a pretty poor movie in general. Yes, there are some qualities that redeem, but I will come back to it later. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been a long time since the last movie did not happen ... in fact, that's about it. eight years I think. Rosemary always tries to escape with her child and influence him in a positive way, rather than letting him succumb to the evil future that the coven (or the "tribe", as it's called here), the has laid out. When she runs away with him and an empty bus comes looking for her, leaving her child with a whore, the bitch lifts him to the majority, where Satan tries to possess him because he seems to reject his devilish heritage at every age . <br /> <br /> Obviously, things do not go as planned, and then there is the end to which I would have been seriously ashamed if I had not seen it coming since I heard that there was a sequel to "Rosemary's Baby"! Okay, around the age of 11, I witnessed the masterpiece Rosemary's Baby and read the rest of the book. Thinking that this film was an adaptation of that, I traced this film and I got it ... was I right to do it? Well, in a way, yes ... I'm a real fan of this "franchise" and I can say that I've seen the rest, and I have an idea of ​​what will happen after the events of the first film (speaking of both this film AND "The son of Rosemary", the continuation of the book of Ira Levin, not yet adapted to the film). <br /> <br /> Ruth Gordon, who played Minnie in the first film, is shown a few times in this film, but why-oh-why is the coven so different? The knife that Romarin had left in the first film is shown coming out of the ground, but Minnie pulled it out! The coven is now called the tribe (as I said earlier). They are now walking in hooded capes chanting "Hi Satan ... Hi Adrian ... Hi Satan ... Hi Adrian ..." and so on. The Gothic building now looks like a two-story house on a lawn in the middle of nowhere, it looks like a small suburban house or something like that! And the child himself has a rather normal appearance, with eyes that do not turn around when he gets angry and kills someone or something in this vain goal. <br /> <br /> As for the actors' game, it's pretty poor. on all sides, with the exception of Stephen McHattie, who plays a very adult Adrian. Pattie Duke Astin, who replaces Mia Farrow as Rosemary, must have one of the worst WORST performances ever recorded on film! It's so bad that it's almost not even funny ... when she shouts "OH MY GOD!" and cries for like the fifteenth time in the movie, you're like "Ok, it's not funny anymore", and then by the time she left and the movie only lasted twenty minutes, you're like THANK THE Lord, I do not have to hear him say "Oh my God" any longer! Sheesh! In the end, this movie has very, very, very very few qualities to redeem, enough to have at least four stars. But if you consider it as a serious sequel to the first film, it is practically non-existent.
