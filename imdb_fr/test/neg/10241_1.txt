If ever a film could be considered a missed opportunity, this film is called Galaxina. What could not be wrong by basing a sci-fi movie around a sexy and feminine android? Could not such a movie ever be a waste of time? Unfortunately, this film is almost useless. It must be said that this production has a number of flaws, but two fundamental problems completely destroy the company as a whole. First of all, it's a funny comedy, or at least a film whose potentially amusing aspects are incredibly entertaining. Second, the main character is terribly underused. Maybe it's because Dorothy Stratten was not really an actress, but if it was, it was a terrible decision, because she's still easily the best thing about the movie. I do not think she really needs to be a great actress to succeed as a sexy android to be perfectly honest. Anyway, we still have a lot of comic relief, which is often made up of desperate gags of the biggest science fiction hits of the day, such as Alien, Star Wars and 2001. Writes and not funny at all and he does not even really have a plot to get things done. The story basically concerns a police spaceship that is sent for a stone. That's all! Steven Spielberg once said that a high-level film was a film whose plot could be described in one sentence. What he did not define is what you call a movie that can be described in less than one sentence - perhaps useless? <br /> <br /> It seemed like an infallible winner, but I failed miserably. This seems to have been an attempt to parody Star Wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. All he does in reality is to leave you cold and irritated to find that it was not close to what he should have been. This is not a Barbarella for the 80s. <br /> <br /> Shortly after the film's end, Dorothy Stratten was murdered in a terribly violent and horrible way. And for this reason, Galaxina drew a considerable share of its cult interest. I find it just too bad that Dorothy does not have a better movie to immortalize.
