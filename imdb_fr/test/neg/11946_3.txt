There's really only one reason to watch this barely-sufficient and totally predictable film about chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life changed when she inherited her orphaned niece, Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after the death of his sister in a car accident. And this is because Aaron Eckhart (Nick), with his supple haircut and attractive attitude, is good enough to slap himself between two slices of organic Pannini and eat with a dip of balsamic and balsamic vinaigrette sun-dried tomatoes . He reminds me of Sean Bean. The thought that he could take off his shirt was really the only thing that kept me awake until the end. He took off his apron with pity several times, but to my great disappointment, I never went further. <br /> <br /> I can not be too critical because I watched it on the pay-TV at home. me the price of two movie tickets at least, and I was raised to be grateful for the little pity. But really, it's Rom Com at its most formulaic. Zeta Jones gives a very flat and monotonous performance, she seemed totally devoid of passion (maybe because of the time she apparently spent in the restaurant's cold room ... Thirty comments can not be fun) and her face barely changed expression throughout the film. Abigail Breslin was pretty good as a niece. She's so seductive a girl that it's impossible to criticize her, and anyway I loved her in Little Miss Sunshine. Patricia Clarkson always has a good value and I can not really blame her performance as a restaurateur, because she seemed very underused, since she is a good actress and she has little work to do here. But all this is so clich√©, much of the dialogue is trivial and the result is obvious. It is the cinematographic equivalent of painting by numbers. Zeta Jones and Eckhart generate little heat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nick loves Italian food (no doubt his burning passion) and cooks with Puccini. Her appearance in Kate's kitchen at 22 Bleecker (restaurant name) upsets her feathers, but her odd ability to bond with her niece by cooking a pizza and building a Bedouin tent in the living room brings her around Kate and, in spite of some clashes, Thus, she ends up giving her his precious good. No, not his honor. But his recipe for saffron sauce. <br /> <br /> I am very unfair here, is not it? I mean Rom Com is Rom Com, and we all know what we let in when we join. But must it always be so dull?
