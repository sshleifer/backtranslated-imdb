Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, had a keen sense of description that made this book amazing. As I read this book, each scene was completely drawn in my head and I knew what each character looked like. This book had a lot of pieces and when I finished reading it, it seemed like the puzzle had been completed. After I finished reading Heat of Darkness, I watched the movie, which was a mistake. The film cut out so many substantial parts. For example, in the novel, Marlow waited a long time for the rivets to pick him up to repair his boat. It was a great source of futility. In the film, this part was simply left out. The movie added more useless and meaningless pieces. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz broke the monkey's neck and killed him. What was the purpose of this scene, except that the audience feels sorry for the monkey? It's as if the screenwriter had not even read the entire book and just put the parts he had read in the movie. If I had not read the novel before watching the movie, I would have been completely confused. The book was amazing and it really is a classic American literature, but the film could have been nominated for the worst Razzie award.
