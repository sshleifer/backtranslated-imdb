There are other critics here expressing similar points of view, but I always feel obliged to add my comments. The film is generally well done from a technical point of view, in addition to being perhaps too long. The acting is generally very good, although Kevin Spacey does not have much space to explain the motivation of his character (apparently ambition rather than racism), and Sandra Bullock seems to have the sole function of giving prickly, which she manages very well, too. /> <br /> At a fundamental level, the heart of the film is well placed to oppose racism, and I have the impression that it has tried to be a sort of definitive treatment of racism, perhaps to be why so many famous people the names have agreed to be there. However, it seems that the writers bit much more than they could chew (I did not read the book, so I do not know how much it is due to Grisham). As many others have said, the biggest problem is that it advocates justice for justice. Apart from the fact that I do not agree with this position, I do not think that such a point of view can really help the anti-racist cause - it is more likely that it will be used to acquit white defendants who killed black victims. At the end, the prosecutor invites the jury (and the public) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but follow him and imagine that the accused is a white man who murdered black rapists ... in the end , the message seems to be that you can kill someone as long as you hate him enough. It is also convenient that the killed man has been presented as totally evil and that his guilt is beyond doubt, eliminating any moral ambiguity that may be in a real case. <br /> <br /> Samuel L Jackson gives an excellent performance, but unfortunately it also undermines the plot - he presents himself as a person with considerable integrity, but it is hard to believe he would be willing to to hide behind a plea of ​​insanity (and in fact, it does not, when pushed). We are supposed to be supposed to think that it is because he faces the death penalty, but in fact, at one point, he offered a plea for manslaughter, although if you blink, you risk miss. Why not take it, knowing that he must know that his chances of acquittal are slim? Or, if he wants to speak in court, why plead dementia? <br /> <br /> There are also less serious defects. The medical experts, on whose testimony the case is supposed to rest, are jokes - both are discredited for highly implausible reasons, and none of them offers a true psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever they are told to say, and do not believe it. The fact that the injured policeman is supporting Jackson is moderately plausible, but still a little convenient (and if he's dead?) I can not believe the KKK would be walking in the street in broad daylight. Other apparently serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) take place without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them. And the scene where the dog comes back in force is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> My last reaction is to feel rather dirty - as if I have to be racist because I do not agree with the resolution. It may be that the film aims to explore different points of view and let the audience decide, but if they seem to, it seems to have forgotten it by the time they reach the end. The film made me think about my opinions, read what others thought about it and added my own opinion. So, at a certain level, he may have succeeded - but I'm afraid he was able to reinforce the very un-liberal views of some people, which I hope. Final Thinking - try watching Law and Order, it covers topics like this with a lot more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!
