This is the type of cable used in the late evening with Andrew Stevens or Shannon Tweed. Although unlike most Tweed and Stevens powered T & A vehicles, this is deadly dull! <br /> <br /> Coupons run on the hunt. The real reason to watch this non-thriller is to see Shannon Doherty's breasts. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar! However, most of his hot sex scenes seem to be smoke and mirrors. <br /> <br /> Note that all shots where his head and chest appear at the same time are flashes of stealthy glances. The frames where the camera lingers on her naked body, her face is almost nonexistent or she is behind a shower door dripping wet. <br /> <br /> Everyone who smokes the eyes know what it means - Double body! <br /> <br /> But I must admit that the finale where Doherty is bound, blindfolded and threatened with a knife, offered a certain fetishistic thrill. <br /> <br /> If you find a VHS copy anywhere, Buy it! As all the people involved are probably too embarrassed to never let this go out on DVD!
