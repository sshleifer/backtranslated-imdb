Synopsis: Simon leads a small team of special agents specializing in the search and return of missing persons, against all odds. Their last mission concerns the granddaughter of one of their friends. She seems to have been caught in the web of a particularly brutal criminal and all those who went looking for her disappeared. But now, librarians are aware. <br /> <br /> Comments: It's a pure B action, from side to side. The key phrase for this is the unlimited offer. There is an unlimited stock of ammo, they do not have to reload once. There is an unlimited number of villains, so the heroes have something to shoot. There is an unlimited amount of breasts, many naked, in a vain attempt (and always doomed to fail) to divert attention from the conspiracy holes. And there is an unlimited supply of bad actors (it's almost as if Erika Eleniak's performance was shining in there, so what?), And actors who do not seem to care more about salary (and why should they are when no one else seems to?). <br /> <br /> And as in most action movies, there is an unlimited number of bad fights. But these seem almost to be of a ridiculously bad kind. I think I saw more realistic fighting when I played cowboy when I was a child. <br /> <br /> But again, I did not really expect much either, how can I go from an action movie called The Librarians? And that really answers what we could expect. 90 minutes of action more or less bad with some scenes to connect the points between them. But I'm not sure I can say it's entertaining, I did not really care. <br /> <br /> 3/10
