Nothing is more appealing than the idea of ​​a beautiful love story featuring Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. Fresh and refined English beauty and warm-blooded American male - what's more charming? Well, it's not that movie. Immediately, they spoil while appointing Kristin Scott Thomas as a member of the US Congress. It's like making Hugh Grant the role of Babe Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is just the kind of woman who can not imagine shaking hands with old greasy junkies in filthy slums, hurrying into a stinky crowd or kissing babies. She would have been much better chosen as an English-born widow of an aristocratic senator, of the kind who belongs to the hunting club and who goes to the flower shows, but does not know at all how the other half lives. <br /> <br /> Then there is Harrison Ford as an ordinary policeman. Granted, he's strong enough for the role. But it is a little difficult to swallow the idea that he will love this beautiful beauty of high society. Why could not he have been, for example, a hard but rich, blue-rooted reformist politician who would inherit the seat of the late Kristin's husband in the Senate? At first, they are both very nice, but for duty, Kristin is cordial with him. In return, he begins to show her the raw side of life - things that her husband has protected her from. Her political awakening coincides with the chaotic passion of a new lover, more blue collar, who appreciates her much more than her aristocratic husband. This is a love story! Instead, you get an empty, meaningless thriller, where the action hangs and nothing happens. Well, there's a "drive by" style scene in a ghetto where Harrison is almost killed, but it's so abrupt and unexplained that it's really more of a welcome comic relief. <br /> <br /> The sky is still gray in this film, and our beautiful and refined Kristin always looks a little scared. When she is supposed to dream of passion, she seems to dream of a woolen blanket and a cup of tea! Most of the time, she also looks a little sleepy, as if she preferred to nap in bed rather than kiss Harrison Ford. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say that you can not blame her.
