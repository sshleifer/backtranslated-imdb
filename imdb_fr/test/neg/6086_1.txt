By far, this must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I watch virtually every night movie (whether in showtime, hbo, cinemax, etc.). "Three" AKA "Survivor Island" keeps you as suspenseful as watching the paint dry before letting you down even more sadly. If you want to feel as if you've just lost what seems to be an eternity on the worst film ever created, then watch this movie. I had to shout at least 900 times because of idiotic twists. If I had 4 hands, I would give this movie 4 inches down. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think the only people who would like this film are those who have a terrible morality.
