Not as bad as some say ... This is an unofficial Bond movie and a remake of "Thunderball", written by Kevin McClory (co-producer of "Thunderball"). Well, the distribution is very very interesting, Maria Brandauer is a big bad Bond, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera look like the "original" Bond girls, plus Rowan Atkinson and a very big Edward Fox, who looks really refreshing in the film. "M" role. In fact, the whole film is refreshing and gives new impulses. Sean Connery is once again confident and charming, except that he looks a bit too old. But hey, he is the original link and it was great to see him again in this role. The places are also typical - Bahamas, France, etc. The only thing that's really missing is the score, the song "Never say never again" is O.K., but the theme is simply missing. All in one, a great attempt to make a difference with Roger Moore's comical and silly movies like "Moonraker". "Thunderball" was a great movie and really did not need a remake.
