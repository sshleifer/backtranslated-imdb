Seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release, I do not understand very well. Why was it so successful in 1986? His amateurism flows from every scene. The jokes are lame and predictable. The sex scenes are abusive and abusive (that does not mean that Miss Rudnik does not have beautiful breasts!). The song is "schrecklich". The only truly amusing scene is that of the big movie where gangsters die in breakdance, a trait that dates back to the early eighties. It is really quite amazing to me how much I am unable to grasp what sparked the excitement of the enthusiastic audience in 1986 (and apparently still today, reading the comments of my IMDBers colleagues).
