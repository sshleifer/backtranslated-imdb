The third film based on Charles Belden's play "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" (1933) is about the X-tasy generation. Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, two screenwriters, spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher movies - a promising start. Their state guarantees an authentic point of view. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was no exaggeration for the world's favorite heiress. She reads "In Style", cares for boys, talks with a cell, and fears an ill-conceived pregnancy. His usual routine has been irreparably changed. Hilton reached the peak of her - not so hot - performance at the "1 Night in Paris" parody (2004). While the pimp is in motion, she "looks for lip balm" on the lap of her boyfriend (Robert Ri'chard). Finally, "the actress" expires the use of the word "N" on the sex tape. The director Jaume Collet-Serra modifies his point of view opposite to the theme of the past. At the time, each had opposing characteristics, while a pair of good or bad can come out of the womb today. However, the latter does not exclude the first. The delivery is the chance of the draw. Viewers can hardly consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) as a contemporary Quasimodo. Certainly, recluses share some similarities such as art, disfigurement, submission and murder. Yet a small variable between the two makes all the difference. Vincent is even uglier inside than out. The Collet-Serra "House of Wax" pays tribute to the actor Vincent Price since the first remake made in 1953. The film obviously leaves Van Gogh's bichots to the imagination of the public. Still, the choice of splitting the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrating twist at the end. Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod's demon is in second place, but the most horrifying story in the horror film is owned by Lon Chaney in "The Phantom of the Opera" (1925). Regarding the new competitor, the consequences of separation surgery minimize the effect. A surgeon must know that Siamese twins operating heal physically and psychologically. Their father must call a couple of colleagues - Dr. Phil consult and Dr. McNamara pinch / fold. Despite what the trailers said, "Wax" is not forever. In fact, you can get rid of it by burning it.
