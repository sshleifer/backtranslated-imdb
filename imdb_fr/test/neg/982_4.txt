To redo "Lost Horizon" as a musical, it needed a musical composition like Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. That said, my favorite thing about Lost Horizon is his score. It's just that the score does not match the piece. The cast is mostly composed of non-musical talents (Ullman, Finch and Hussey have all been dubbed and still do not sound very good). <br /> <br /> Frankly, the novel, on which this, and previous non-musical film versions were based, is at best mediocre. Although the possibilities of a really good and cinematic musical version exist, they are not realized here. The film manages to be a good vehicle, rainy day, to pass the time. Otherwise, you'd better buy the CD from his soundtrack. Recommended only as a curiosity, because of the bad reputation of the film. I saw a lot better; but I saw MUCH worse.
