One of my colleagues recommended this one, suggesting it was one of the scariest films she has ever seen. I checked with my girlfriend and we gave up after about 50 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I had a long conversation with my colleague (we are still friends!). <Br /> <br /> This film is as original as Steven Seagal's latest film. This brings absolutely nothing original to the table. The spooky parts have been performed thousands of times before. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw, however, is the painful slowness of this movie. The periods between the alarms are completely ruined by a meaningless dialogue and a lot of .. nothing .. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 Molotov cocktails
