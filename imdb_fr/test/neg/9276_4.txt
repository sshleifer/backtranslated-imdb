The last entry of the trilogy On The Buses sees the usual wasters going about their business in Wales. I'm sure the franchise could have gone on, but Harold Pinter complained that the scenarios gave him a bad look in comparison and that there was nothing left to do. <br /> <br /> We actually need less than two minutes before our first nugget of sexism: a woman running for the bus realizes that her breasts are falling off her dress for no reason. Still, that makes Stan (Reg Varney) laugh at least - but then what's wrong? He and Jack (Bob Grant) spend the entire movie laughing hilariously without provocation or provocation. It feels like they'd get wet while watching the paint dry. <br /> <br /> As before, the only fun element is the hilarious Stephen Lewis fun of Blakey. However, he is alone with a cheesy and dated scenario that is wasting even top-notch talent like Wilfrid Brambell and Henry McGee. Yet it seems that if only Lewis understands how to time this fragile material, he manages to laugh, even at the weakest lines. Describing how his daughter fell into a river, Stan's mother complains, "I hope it's not polluted." "Well it will be now," Blakey jokes. <br /> <br /> The plot - if there is one - shows that Stan covets a girl, but is continually thwarted by his domineering mother. You will surely agree that it is a recipe for bursting laughter from the edge. Whether on a storm boat or in a pool, the feats of Stan and Mavis always produce the same result ... an abject boredom. Maria, an Italian stereotype, and a co-worker are later conquests. Even Stan's mother is entitled to a one-night stand, reminding him carefully of "putting the drawers in tin". <br /> <br /> When one of the comic "highlights" is Arthur Mullard who hears Olive trying to locate a light switch in the dark ("I can not find it") and thinking that she is talking about sex, then you will understand why this work reaches the highest levels of literary sophistication. In fact, I do not understand why this is not in the Top 100 BFI movies. <br /> <br /> Other nerve tickling schemes involve Olive (Anna Karen) breaking her glasses. I do not know what is most surprising, the lame predictability of the configuration, or the underdeveloped gain. Short-sighted Olive follows a man in a kilt in the man, thinking he is a woman in a skirt. The next shot saw her exit by Blakey and be redirected to the ladies. And that's all. Then she finds herself in another man's bed and his wife orders him to go out. And ... no, that's all there is to say on this stage. <br /> <br /> The latest broadcast of Holiday on the Buses on British television has been interrupted. It is actually a blessed relief.
