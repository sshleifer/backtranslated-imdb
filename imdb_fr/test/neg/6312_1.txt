This movie has some of the worst actors I have ever seen. Dennis Quaid's performance was of high school caliber. Although it is difficult to portray an offbeat character like Jerry Lee Lewis, this can be done. Just ask Jamie Foxx (although Ray Charles had more depth in his personality and musical sense than Lewis had ever dreamed of owning). The representation of the Phillips brothers belongs to The Dukes of Hazzard, and Alec Baldwin in Jimmy Swaggart is a bit like Donald Duck in Shakespeare. When Robert Duvall played a campaign preacher, I bought it. Baldwin never made me believe one word. Wynona Ryder's share was the best and she was mediocre. (And can anyone understand how she was 13 years old when Lewis met her and another 13 years later than a year later?) Research on the Internet reveals that the essential facts presented by the film were true, from less messy than most Hollywood organic photos. This film did poorly at the box office, and it should have.
