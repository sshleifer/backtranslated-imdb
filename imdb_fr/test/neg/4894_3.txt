"The Sad Coffee Ballade" worked hard for his image, but when it came to cracking for the moment, he stayed in his own dust. <br /> <br /> We can not imagine such a strong statement, but if Vanessa Redgrave's Amelia was to fight John Wayne or even Clint Eastwood, my hard-earned dollars should go to Redgrave. Her portrait of Amelia was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to a multi-million dollar contracted character. Redgrave told Amelia that inspired drawl that was a mix of her own voice and a hard-won Southern woman. For the average viewer, this could be perceived as annoying, but as the film progressed, it became it ?? Miss Amelia transforming this beauty of the scene into a roughneck. These are the performance of Redgrave, as well as its interaction with other characters, which allowed this film to stay up ?? but not the biggest. The others who followed his performance were necessary, but not stellar. As we move past the cloudy image of all the scenographers hired for the post-Southern Depression work, the minor characters felt like posters. The image was necessary to stage, but the characters of the city had no other goal. Take, for example, Rod Steiger's vision of an old preacher with a wild voice. His scenes alone will incite the viewer to question the validity of this city off the beaten path. The two main players who surrounded Amelia clashed with a crazy charm to get the best moment of flight, but because of the lack of direction ?? it just seemed faded. The most absurd of the two (although both occupy a prominent place among questionable critics) is Cork Hubbard, who embodies Amelia's "cousin", who presents herself at random one night. His character is never completely defined, he lacks real motive and his loyalty remains uncertain. He plays no essential role in this film apart from forcing us, the viewers, to question his mental health and his honesty. Can you create a character simply by pulling out your tongue, patting your ears and hitting your chest and head? Finally, there is the other end of the absurd ?? Keith Carradine. Callow's close-ups on this tormented man build a character, but our lack of understanding between him and Amelia tarnishes his goal. They were the characters, as clichés of the south as they were ?? some stood out and tried to create an absurd period piece, and I can not deny that they failed. <br /> <br /> Where "Ballad of the Sad Café" failed to overcome mediocrity, it was in cinematography and storytelling. This movie was about Amelia and her need for other souls in her life. The level of public comfort with the arrival of his midget cousin was entertaining ?? he could not help wondering if he was honest or if he was simply a man of confidence who would try to get him a warm heart. The character of Cork Hubbard is never quite understood, but we accept him with brief shots of him and Amelia doing small things together. This is her idea, which passes from a recluse businesswoman to a coffee owner in good faith. The problem is that the director Callow never really brings us to this dramatic level between Cork and Redgrave ?? Is the man crazy or does he represent the whole Amelia family? I needed something from Callow that brought these two from the relationship between David Lynch and Esquire. Then our pool becomes even deeper with the addition of Carradine as Amelia's "love interest". Using the flashback technique in a flashback, we see both married, but never consume their love ?? whose anger Amelia against their love dragging her into the world of madness. Why was Amelia so angry? Why was there no connection between Carradine and Redgrave? Why was it even in the movie? With the lack of concentration on the connection of these characters, the possible scenes between the two had no sense ?? Cork chooses and is completely disconcerted. Although Callow has created some beautiful choreographed scenes, the inability to transfer his characters from point A to point B. I lost focus, interest and my interest in characters dropped when I did not not understand the ultimate question ?? "Why"? <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Sad Café Ballad" started with a bang, but ended with a very small firecracker crack. My emotional feeling of this movie oscillated from top to bottom and finally stayed lower, mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motivations of the characters. Redgrave did a phenomenal job as Amelia, and while the other characters (besides random Steiger) were doing their best, I just did not understand who they were. Their motives were so confused that when the emotional end finally took place, I was apathetic. The director Callow seemed to have failed to import connection scenes allowing us to understand the dynamic relationship between all our major players. Callow created beautiful scenes where the faces seemed to overlap, which allowed us to focus on Amelia ?? or Carradine, but nothing has been explained or developed. The film was played with anger, discovery, happiness, flashback, anger, anger, anger, fading away. Without comparative connectors, this turned a distinguished period film into actors playing roles in front of the camera. It was a shame because "Sad Café" promised not to keep its promises. <br /> <br /> Category: ** ½ on *****
