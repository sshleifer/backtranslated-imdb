Last night, I was watching the Guide TV Guide and watching a movie starring Heather Grahm, which I enjoyed in movies like Boogie Nights and Austin Powers. So I decided to watch it. Everything started well, but we could say that the story was lacking and that in the middle, it has deteriorated. I do not remember this movie being in theaters, and I'm sure if that was the case, not long ago. The acting was obsolete and unconvincing, the dialogue was silly and predictable, and the story confusing and stupid. It's certainly one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I like movies like these that have been compared to the Fight Club, but this one does not come close! Heather Grahm has done a lot better since. I gave it a 2 out of 10 but it's because I clicked on the wrong number that I wanted to give it a 1.
