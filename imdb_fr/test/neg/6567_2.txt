While Star Trek the Motion Picture was rather boring, Star Trek The Final Frontier is downright bad. In this terrible sequel, the crew are on shore leave when they receive a distress signal from the Federation indicating that the ambassadors representing the Earth, Romulus and Kronos (the Klingons' homeworld) were kidnapped by a Vulcan, a renegade, decided to reach the spaceship venturing into the great barrier. There, he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad scriptures, he persuaded many senior Enterprise officers to betray Kirk and seize the ship. They reach the inside of the Great Barrier and find a planet where they meet a god-like extraterrestrial. This one is so bad that it's hard to know where to start. At the bottom is a good idea that is never really developed. The plot leads nowhere to the place where no man has gone before. It's almost as if the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes do not have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn, the philosophy is boring and the humor obsolete. Now, I'm going to focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the chair of the director, the ego grows. The focus is primarily on him, Spock and McCoy, but does not give enough to others. Moreover, while Shatner is generally guilty of having acted excessively in previous movies and television spots, he is simply bad in this one. Now Kirk is rash, a joker and an idiot. One of the worst scenes involves the three chefs singing the song "Row Row Row Your Boat" during a round near a campfire. In any case, it's the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given him three out of ten instead of five.
