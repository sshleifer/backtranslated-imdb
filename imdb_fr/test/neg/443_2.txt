I may be too generous when I give this film two and a half stars out of five, but there was an occasional moment. However, as a movie "An American Werewolf", this one is a missed chance! There is no real connection between the plot and the original superior, but the story in some ways resembles 'London'. <br /> <br /> * Warning Spoiler possible * American children go to foreign countries, we fall in love with a beautiful girl. Another child is slaughtered by a werewolf the same evening he gets stung. Despite the warnings of his non-living friend, in the light of the full moon, he pushes fur, fangs and claws! <br /> <br /> But there are some differences in history, on the one hand; the girl is one of the werewolves. Second; there are three American children. And third; there is a weird cult - @ $$, werewolves, who wants to conquer the world! As crazy as it sounds, this one was NOT a joke! * Spoiler Ends * <br /> <br /> The movies suffer from many things, first of all, the game of weak actors slows it immensely! The performance of Tom Everret Scott is at best amatuerish, and he and Julie Delpy, who plays his love interest, do not seem to have a chemistry together at all. Second; A weak script that seems to be everywhere. Many elements of suspense and black comedy, which made the original superb, are missing in this one. And whoever said that eating the heart of the werewolf who would bite you would make you human? The last time I heard that it was not part of the werewolf tradition at all! Third; terrible special effects; Werewolf effects are made with a computer animation, which works for dinosaurs, ghosts and spaceships. But it sounds bumpy, fake and unnatural when used for furry creatures like werewolves. <br /> <br /> However, some elements have saved this one from the total "turkeydom", but Andy (Scott) has a coffee with Serafine (Delpy), he drops a bunch of condoms on the table and tries to make them look like chewing gum by chewing and blowing a bubble! Also; the soundtrack, a cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs carry the word "moon" in its title, as in the original movie, the soundtrack is awesome. And another funny scene where a decomposing corpse, played by Julie Bowen, tries to whistle and her eyes come off, made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> But overall, this film seems to lack wit and suspense. from the original. And the end too artificial does not help much either. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Two and a half stars out of five (Average.)
