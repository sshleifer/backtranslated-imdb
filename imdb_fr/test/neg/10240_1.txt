How can anyone give something bigger than a '1'? <br /> <br /> I thought that "Manos, the hands of fate" would be forever the worst film of all time to hurt my optic nerve. Indeed, I thought nothing could be worse. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. "Galaxina" is this rare film where EVERY ONE ELEMENT is painful, atrocious, blindly bad. How many times have you watched a movie and commented, "Who dropped that thing?" From lighting to soundtrack, effects, scenario, action and cinematography. . . Well, ALL, this movie is absolutely unbearable. It's so bad that I did not even know for a while whether it was the worst comedy or the worst drama I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, even to be laughable. I would rather eat a plate of broken glass than sit on it again.
