Overall, the movie "Heart of Darkness" was pitiful compared to the book. Anyone who has already read the book and has a sufficient understanding of it will be able to see the innumerable obvious flaws. There is an immeasurable difference between the two. It seems to me that the director was lost in a lost battle I could not imagine that someone would take on the monstrous task of recreating "Heart of Darkness". The immense detail and the magic of the story would be impossible to interpret in a fair way. Conrad's story is so layered and deep that it would seem pointless to attempt a visual interpretation. <br /> <br /> First, it is impossible to capture the details of the story. The colossal fine points created by Joseph Conrad can not legitimately be recreated through the film. Marlow's feelings and emotions can not be interpreted in the same way in the film. If you then undertook the enormous task of attacking Conrad's work, know that Conrad wrote only half of the story. The extra half is a series of connections established by the reader. As a reader, you must be able to deduce and relate Joseph Conrad's ideas. As a result, several crucial details are missing from the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, although the film was of sufficient length, the film seemed short. It seemed that Conrad was able to gather much more detail in 75 pages than the film could contain in one and a half hours. The speed of the film prevented the viewer from knowing the characters. Marlow was a lot stranger. The point of view of the book puts you in the shoes of Marlow. However, in the movie, you almost look at Marlow from a distance. I started to think that the director was trying to use the same method that Conrad used to "read between the lines". However, the connections were weak. I know that if I had not read the book, I could not begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters. <br /> <br /> Finally, Kurtz also seemed to be interpreted. incorrectly. His role was short and details were not all included. It was impossible to understand the real Kurtz in the time he had shown him. An important detail in the book was that Kurtz had become a god for Africans. I did not think that this significant detail was defined. In addition, in the book, Kurtz represented a soulless being. He had been dead inside for a long time. I think the director has understood this detail. However, instead of recreating it, he just asked Kurtz to mope and mumble. In addition, it seemed that the director had tried to make Kurtz mysterious. However, he seemed completely unidentified. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film reminded me of a teenager crammed to complete a science project. day. It seemed to have been manufactured effortlessly and in almost no time. The characters were alienated, crucial details were left out and, overall, the central plot was lost in translation.
