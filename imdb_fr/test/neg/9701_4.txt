Let me start by saying that I love the book and that I like the mini-series A & E. I was hoping to like this film and I was quite willing to give it a moderate artistic license to interpret and abbreviate the real story. However, this film does not look like the original book. If only "the names had been changed to protect the innocent", I would have probably liked the film simply as an entertaining or even inaccurate period piece. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the name "Mr. Darcy" has been added. on a character who is moved and weak, giving the name "Elizabeth Bennett" to a reckless, snippy hoyden, often to tears in his eyes who does not care about the rules of society, and making "Mr. Bingley" a dimwit to Googly eyes absolutely destroyed the idea that the director has ever read Jane Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> There are some really stellar moments in this movie - maybe a total of 10 minutes is really excellent. Charlotte's explanation of why she accepted Collins' proposal begins wonderfully. She is 27 years old (she is almost as old as desperate girls), she becomes a burden to her family and she is not romantic. She only wants "a comfortable home". However, the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she moans, "Do not judge me, Elizabeth, do not dare to judge me!" and goes away in tears. Later, you will see Charlotte prostrate herself before Lady Catherine de Bourgh, which was not her character as described in the book. <br /> <br /> Another good time is when Darcy catches Elizabeth at home as she walks around with her aunt and uncle. It's done well in the A & E series, but the version of the film with Keira Knightley made it clear to the audience how Elizabeth must have been humiliated that moment. Very nice. <br /> <br /> The end also illustrates a level of affection between Elizabeth and Darcy that does not appear so clearly in the miniseries. In fact, I enjoyed this scene just because I like to see a happy ending, rather than just knowing it has happened. <br /> <br /> All in all, however, this film eliminated the subtlety that was an integral part of Austen's pride and prejudices. The characters speak in a shocking combination of Austen's dialogue, phrases and modern expressions. The information that was only mentioned or suggested in the original work is blatantly stated in this version. Yes, time was a concern. It's only a short film, Yada Yada. But turning a beautiful, complex book into a superficial love story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some said they liked the moment Darcy sees Elizabeth for the first time, because it's obviously a love at first sight. Love at first sight? Huh? One of the best aspects of this book is that Elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty and Darcy ends up loving her for her wit and vivacity ... he literally "loved her for his spirit". <br /> <br /> This version also had a moment (at Darcy's first proposal) when the two screamed in anger, while leaning more and more ... and more and more. .. and almost kissing ... but suddenly parting. Ugh! What a sad picture. They are angry and disgusted with each other, but they are so attracted that it does not matter if they (at the time) do not even like each other? Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> The descriptions were so far from those described in the book that it was really like a different story. Mr. Bennet was enduring, Elizabeth generally behaved as stupidly as her younger sisters. Charlotte was moved, somewhat unintelligent, and was desperately searching for a home of her - unlike the intelligent, slightly intriguing, thought-provoking woman who is portrayed in the novel. The relationship between Jane and Elizabeth is simply topical, instead of the deep love and admiration they are supposed to have for each other. <br /> <br /> All this, I could have accepted as a simple interpretation of the novel, but I refused to accept all this in addition to the many historical inaccuracies. Miss Bingley was barely dressed (her dress looked like the other tight underwear). Elizabeth walked to Netherfield with her hair down and allowed flying everywhere. The family was idle about one morning, even though the mornings were supposed to be reserved to call on acquaintances (or your home). Elizabeth walked outside barefoot in her nightgown. And in a really dreadful scene, Bingley entered Jane's room and conversed with her (and looked like an idiot) when she was sick. <br /> <br /> Most people think these are minor points, but I just wanted to be A.) a historically accurate movie, B.) a faithful representation of the characters in the novel. <br /> <br /> The director / writer / anyone who has sacrificed precision, subtlety and a good story for a real love affair at first sight. I can concede that those who have not read the book or are unfamiliar with the social conventions of the day could very easily like this film, and there is nothing wrong with that. I simply could not overcome my desire to see a movie that involved more than two pretty faces.
