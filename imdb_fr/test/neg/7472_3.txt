This is what happens when you try to adapt a play. Look at the end of the photo, totally theatrical. <br /> <br /> The final speech without steam tries to make us think that the whole (and profound) theme of this affair was manhood. Who cares about this point? It was manipulation. And so the audience feels after the end of this film. <br /> <br /> Young directors: A play is told with words more than actions. A film is the reverse most of the time. <br /> <br /> And I'm not talking about the gay theme, too much exploited for no reason (because there is no explanation on this subject considering the so-called "philosophical" or presumptuous) at the level where this film should have to be called Grand Gay
