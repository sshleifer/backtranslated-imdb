It's not a dreadful movie ... But there are scenes of monsters where you will roll on the floor laughing - it's not a good thing for an action / thriller movie. The acting game is usually pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US Senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent figure of military / police / sheriff / agent / marshal. The special effects are good, "special" - for example, the external train scenes are very clearly a miniature train. <br /> <br /> Goofy: A meteor hits a stationary car in the opening scene. The car catches fire but does not move an inch. After the impact, the meteor is housed in the top of the car's hood. Impossible under the low angle where the meteor entered. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ... <br /> A good part of the events of the film is predictable, from the crash of the helicopter ("Stop, stop!"), to the fact that annoying people get it at the end, up to the classic blown bridge surmounting a gorge of over 300 meters waiting for the train, following set up at the end. <br /> <br /> The scenes showing the attacking aliens are hilarious. These are cute and vicious puppets that move at a blazing speed - do you remember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In a scene, four people filming clip after clip can not touch a single creature because they move at the speed of lightning. Later in the film, Todd Bridges installs a mini flamethrower that he uses to send a number of creatures up close. Many times, Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily grab creatures with bare hands.
