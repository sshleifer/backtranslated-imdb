In Sweet Water, ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) builds a resort resort in the middle of the desert under the protest of the Katonahs. When three workers find Indian relics and bones in a ditch of the site, they accidentally release the giant skeleton, a creature known as the Bone Eater, and their bones are devoured by the monster. MÃ©tis Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k. Running Wolf is in charge of investigating the disappearance of the workers, under pressure from Krantz to arrest the protesters. But the Bone Eater attacks and kills other locals, while Storm Cloud leader (Michael Horse) searches for an ancient Tomahawk that can destroy the evil creature. <br /> <br /> "Bone Eater" is a lame and silly movie, of the most ridiculous scenario I have ever seen. The characters and the situation are not well developed and things happen without any other consequences. The conclusion is probably the worst part of this film, with the typical North American white, Bruce Boxleitner, dressed as an Indian (in history, his grandfather was Indian), cutting his wrist (why? And where is the blood later?) and clumsily throwing the ax into the bone eater's chest, destroying the monster and my last hope for any improvement in the story. My last question: if the bone eater eats bones, what happens to the flesh and clothes of his victims? My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Devorador de Ossos" ("The bone eater")
