The film version of 'Rising Damp' was released two years after the end of the TV series. Like many fans, I went to the cinema when it opened. I left bitterly disappointed. Eric Chappell could not have spent a lot of time writing the screenplay; most of them are questioning old episodes. At the time of the release of the film, the series "Rising Damp" was still repeated regularly on I.T.V. we asked the public to pay to see something they had already seen. At least the movies "On The Buses" boasted original scripts. <br /> <br /> Second, Richard Beckinsale having died the previous year, they eliminated the character of "Alan" as a mark of respect replacing an art student "John", played by Christopher Strauli of the celebrity 'Only When I Laugh 'It was just not the same thing. <br /> <br /> As another poster pointed out, the Rigsby Board looked nothing like the one in the series, being bigger and bigger own. <br /> <br /> Director Joe McGrath is one of the directors who worked on the original film "Casino Royale", a film imbued with surreal humor. "Rising Damp" also has its share of footage fantastic "Walter Mitty" style, such as the parody "Saturday Night Fever." Personally, I found them horribly wrong in their place, a case of "over-pilling the pudding". <br /> <br /> which is a plus, Leonard Rossiter is as beautiful as the shabby "Rigsby", just like F Rances De La Tour, "Ruth" and Don Warrington as' Philip. It's just too bad that the film does not live up to their talents. <br /> <br /> When Rossiter died in 1984, he was shown by I.T.V. as a tribute, with his final scene - showing Rigsby prostrate at the foot of the stairs - removed in the interest of good taste.
