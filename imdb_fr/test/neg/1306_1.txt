As the title suggests, this is not the particularly good movie I was hoping for. I thought it would be great with mr fully monty man himself but tragically not. From the beginning, I literally lost interest when 2 women prepare tea, then suddenly, she points out that there is water at random under the door. Do not notice the rising water level outside or at least heard. Sorry for that sounds like a diatribe, but it really suits me and it affected me. Most of the actors were poor and the story was trying to copy almost every clich√© in every catastrophic movie, but it failed in that direction. CGI was mediocre, I could do a better job using MS Paint, also running mediocre, and in the end I did not care at all for a character !!! Do not waste your time, no wonder it was released directly on DVD. Well thank you for reading xxx
