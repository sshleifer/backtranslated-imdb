<br /> <br /> Very boring and laborious adaptation of the amusing satire of Friends. The hero is not described as a friendly loser, but as a whimsical idiot. Most of the others are pure caricature, with only Helen McCrory in real quality and giving some of the spirit of the novel. The decor of the period is encamped as in the 1920s, and not the post-war period of horror and rock'n'roll comics. A real failure, even by the standards of the bad British television. <br /> <br />
