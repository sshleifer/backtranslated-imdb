I really do not see how anyone could enjoy this movie. I do not think I've ever seen a movie that's half as boring as that piece of junk that's self-complacent. It would probably have been better if the director had not spent most of the film presenting his own works of art, which is not really remarkable. Another thing I did not really like is when a character gets hit in the face, a gallon of blood gushes up soon after. I do not know how people are bleeding in Japan, but I hope they will have a lot of blood donors.
