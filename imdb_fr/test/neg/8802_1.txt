This film is bad, so bad that my mother, who barely supports the "suspense" of Snow White Disney, chuckled through the entire film. My first warning should have been that he was in Wal-Mart's $ 5.50 range. But I actually found good movies in this trash, so I have no complaints if for this debacle. The second warning should have been that when the cashier launched the DVD, it actually amounted to $ 3.88. Once again I have never been one to ignore the cheapies. This film is certainly not for people who are looking for something good to watch, and certainly not for anyone who loves the bad movie from time to time. If you need background noise while playing cards with friends, get it, but if you're looking for something to watch, do not even worry. It was really disappointing because there were a lot of good actors. I felt like I was watching a chocolate version of Willard.
