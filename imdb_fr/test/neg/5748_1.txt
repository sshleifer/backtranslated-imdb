First of all, I want to point out that I voluntarily submitted myself to watching terrible movies. I saw what I thought was the worst of the worst. In my mind, the movies could not be worse than those of D.E.B.S., Leprechaun 6: Back 2 Tha Hood and Terror Storm. Until I see this movie. <br /> <br /> The Pirate movie, without any exaggeration, is the worst film in the world. I had been informed before watching that the film was really awful, but I did not believe the allegations. Believe me, this movie is simply an abomination. <br /> <br /> It begins with a 3-minute clip showing a pirate ship apparently in full battle with themselves. "The End" splashes the screen. Unfortunately, this is not the end of the film. The film is about an unpopular and clumsy girl named Mabel, who wears a ghetto blaster and who is attracted to phantomly homosexual pirates. She drowns and has an excessively long hallucination in which she plays the role of a skinny skank who falls in love with Frederic, who has just come out of the ocean. He could even be homosexual. The Pirate King has a piece of ruby ​​and diamond code. He honks and whines when he squeezes it. <br /> <br /> There is song in this film. You might feel like it's a hilarious musical. It's not. Believe me. These are the worst songs you've ever heard, and at the end of the original track, you'll be looking for items to pierce your eardrums. <br /> <br /> There are "references" to other movies in here. By references, of course, I mean "obvious scams". The inclusion of Indiana Jones, Inspector Clouseau and the lightsaber was actually anti-hilarious. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is, in its best moments, painful to hear. The direction is downright awful and at some point you can see the waterfall carpet in the scene, which is not very well hidden at all. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if there is even a shadow of curiosity in your mind about this film, eliminate it. There are times when people want to see how bad something really is, but this film is not worth it. Put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again. If you love your mental abilities, I beg you, NEVER watch this movie.
