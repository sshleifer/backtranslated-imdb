I just caught "Wild Rebels" on one of the archival compilations "Mystery Science Theater 3000", and this movie was so terrible that even the MST3K team could not make it entertaining. There are some "targets" MST3K that were movies whose concepts were so vague that they could not have been good movies (like "The Green Slime"), and others whose basic premises might have been to be turned into truly entertaining films if their c has not skipped them into the performance. "Wild Rebels" is a film whose basic premise was a good movie three years ago when Don Siegel made his remake of "The Killers" at Universal. Both films speak of a failed race driver who was seduced by a femme fatale to drive the car to flight in a burglary orchestrated by the woman's boyfriend. (Wildly directed but successfully against the guy in what turned out to be his last film) was Ronald Reagan. Steve Alaimo, Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are really funny! But what really makes "Wild Rebels" a horrible movie is the staging of William Gref√© (note the emphasis on the final "e", present in his credit on the screen), which does not has absolutely no sense of rhythm and seems to leave each shot at least half as long as it takes to make its dramatic point. It's unfortunate that someone did not make a mocking comment on this film now (in 2009); the comparison between Steve Alaimo's hairstyle and that of Rod Blagojevich would have been irresistible!
