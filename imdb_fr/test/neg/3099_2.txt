What is the story what is on the screen? At first, I must say, do not touch this film, it's for your best (it sucks). And really what is the story, at first it seems to go but after ten minutes, the situation gets worse. And that's not all, you can barely see what's on the screen, it's too dark all the time. <br /> <br /> Do not touch.
