It's just another Chuck Norris bad movie. Norris plays a cop in the footsteps of a crooked series killer of women. He had already arranged the guy three years earlier, but he managed to cross the bars of the house crazy using what looks like dental floss. Then the killer escapes into a cleaning van and drives it over a 400-foot cliff. He survives and spends time around a theater in renovation. The Irishman Jack O'Halloran is the best in this film, but as in Superman II, he does not say a word. In a way, this is supposed to make it more threatening. Ron O'Neal of celebrity Super Fly and Steve James are lost to the idea of ​​playing respectively with the mayor of the city and the sidekick Norris. The film also contains the silly subplot of Norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock; it's so 1980's. When you combine Norris's "serious" turn with exhilarating musical clues to predictably predict each scene, the film becomes a chore to take on. The focus when searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough. Norris crawling in the shadows to discover the refuge, but the final fight is disappointing after starting so promising. It's another disappointment for Cannon Films, and it's like a movie made for television. * 4 stars.
