... and in this series, I was reduced to a boring jock with a gay hairstyle. Remember my friend Marco, who has all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series his one-liners shamed Mr. Freeze. Remember our ultra-diabolical nemesis Visser Three? He is a bald guy with absurd slogans. Do you remember Rachel, "Xena, the warrior princess" and Cassie, my sensitive and caring loving interest? They were transformed into stupid bimbos by the 10 (!) Screenwriters who decided that the original characters were not cool enough for television. Do not forget the awesome Alien Ax, who was cool, smart and who really liked cinnamon buns? In this series, he is the Alien Token with an extremely annoying voice. Do you remember the spiritual joke our team had in the books? In this series, our dialogue is so bleak and stupid that it is obvious that the writers have let themselves go to the lowest common denominator. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you thought you knew about Animorphs! It's Cassie who has become allergic to morphing, and not Rachel, thought-word is * supposed * to echo, and Screwing Three and Axis have rarely appeared as Andalites (no, it has nothing to do with the budget !). <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy. And I do not lie The jolts are all around us. And if you are unlucky, one of them can adapt one of your favorite books, series or graphic novels to a really horrible TV show. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> "Finally ... the television deserves to be watched." ~ (very bald) Screw Three <br /> <br /> (r # 91)
