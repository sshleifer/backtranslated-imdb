Stanley Kubrick, a director whom I really appreciate for his masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Killing, Shining, Dr. Strangelove, etc.) has put the film out of circulation, leaving it only to hardcore for the find. fans and finalists. After seeing the movie for myself, I could see why. At the age of 24, Kubrick had already perfected his art of stationary photography for LOOK magazine and made short documentaries. Like many novice filmmakers in the decades that followed, his ambition for Fear and Desire was, in short, to simply make a film, cheaply, more than likely to see if he could do it. At this level, he succeeded. However, the film itself certainly is not. <br /> <br /> I can not really say that the movie is a failure because I always liked something about it. Even as the film's story got lost and the actors (of whom Kubrick had no idea of ​​the direction to follow, not being a theatrical man), his talent for producing and capturing beautiful images takes its source in this film. . Sometimes there are shots of close-ups and fast shots in suspense / action scenes that catch the eye. Unfortunately, that's all the good I can really say about the movie. Although there are some "name" actors in the film (Frank Slivera, who also played in Killer's Kiss, and Paul Mazursky, a full-fledged director), the performances are generally boring and very routine. <br /> <In fact, this is for me the main loss of the film; Whenever I watch a Kubrick film, even his first black films, Killer's Killer and the Killing, I can tell who did it, because his style has become distinct, and that will continue as he will evolve as an artist. It was not "artistic" as I would have imagined (which is generally the case for beginning directors such as Scorsese and Spielberg), but watching this film, I felt it was not Kubrick was a lot of the time, I was watching a film of category B (or even C) of a director that time had forgotten - not quite "Ed Wood", but close. The music is as standard as possible, the fades are pedestrians, and the plot does not really seem to hold so much attention. <br /> <br /> In short, as others have said and I can agree, this is a "doodle pad" of a future pioneer, which shows some plans and some retouching that get the attention (the best scene in all is the one where the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage), but not enough to really recommend, except to those, like myself, who end up seeing everything by Kubrick (or maybe I have to see all the very low-budget war movies ever made), if only out of curiosity.
