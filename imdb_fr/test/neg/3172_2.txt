Stephen Gyllenhaal (director) was looking for a serious yet comic film about the art of growing marijuana. Although the cast is simply amazing, this movie is extremely difficult to follow. Actors Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Phillipe, Jon Bon Jovi, Hank Azaria and Kelly Lynch could not even save this movie from failure. It would be wiser to throw three dollar bills in the toilet and then watch this movie at the local video store. <br /> <br />
