There is only one reason why this film is watchable. Until Schweiger. It's such a good actor that the movie is not completely terrible. Uwe Boll please take another career. Special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (An Evening With ...) talked about Tim Burton who never read Batman comics and it was shown. Uwe Boll must never have played video games for which he continues to make films. If you want to know how it goes, go see Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games to have been adapted. Some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie, you will find that ID guys have a lot to do with Doom. It does not seem that anyone at UBIsoft is close to this production.
