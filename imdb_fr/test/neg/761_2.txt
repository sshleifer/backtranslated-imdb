I think South Park is hilarious, and I have no problem firing shots at people on the left, but you might think that after filming a movie to attack celebrities for risking their career in a unlawful war, then being GASP, they would make sense to start giving w. and the bastards ruining the country a shot or two. Bush seems to be pretty free of these guys for as stupid and messed up as he is. <br /> <br /> gore is a fair game, but please, what do Republicans have to do, what harm do they have to run into the country before these guys finally act as maybe they were not just trying to do the best they could, and they had done real nonsense ... or maybe just going after limbaugh rush ... he's a good target ... or even just make fun of the rice teeth of Condoleeza rice.
