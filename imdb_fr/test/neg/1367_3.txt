"The Brotherhood of Satan" is a stunning combination of conventional horror elements mixed with imaginative characterization and direction (Bernard McEveety). It all starts with Father Charles Bateman (in the role of Ben) who heads west with his pretty blondes: Ahna Capri (Nicky) and his daughter Geri Reischl (as K.T.). Things are getting more bizarre for the trio as they approach the city of Hillsboro, which is prey to a satanic cult! <br /> <br /> When stupid travelers arrive in Hillsboro, the action passes to the most interesting group of characters in the film: LQ Jones townspeople (like Pete, the sheriff), Strother Martin (as Doc), Charles Robinson (like Jack, the priest) and Alvy Moore (like Tobey). Their interaction is sometimes fun. Soon, everything becomes very ridiculous and predictable. Mr. Martin is the star (as you would expect); he considers the possibility of a satanic cult as a "cock and bull story", but is (of course) the leader. The end "Enter, children" is confusing; unless it may be the original title of the film.
