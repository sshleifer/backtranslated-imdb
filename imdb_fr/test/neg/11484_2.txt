When I saw the movie trailer, I really wanted to see it. I thought some of the director's other works were pretty good, but I must say that I was disappointed. The plot involves a young woman living with a widowed father and two sons. They settle in a well-guarded community, but not everything seems to be; a kind of Twin Peaks. The woman begins to see or not to see things and people. During the first reel, I had a hypothesis and thought, "Can not that be the reason?" Well, the end was lived, or rather inferior, and gave us what I thought was a really weak final act. The sound mix and quality are excellent. I saw it in a THX certified cinema and was impressed by the audio, and only by the audio. The photo lacks substance.
