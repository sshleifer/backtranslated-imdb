It's not a good cinema. The film is cliche and in many places it is a copy of the original Carrie. The parallels with the original film are striking, but there is an additional improbability as to the congenital power of telekenesis. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I do not like the movie, because it has at least spent two hours ... but they were spent as we read a book demanding on a long journey. train. This book would not be a great literature, but would absorb one for a while and would soon be forgotten as it would blend into the many other clich√©s books. Likewise, the film was good as long as it lasted, but it may be forgotten. At least I think it is. I do not remember much now!
