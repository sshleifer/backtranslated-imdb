The adventures of Sebastian Cole speak of a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier) who thinks he is a writer at one time or another, since he is making efforts. This film is probably the years he gets his material for writing, the years of adventure, hence the title and the previous quote. We live there stories and very typical warnings about love, drugs and sex ... changes. Yes, there is a slight twist here that is very interesting is that very early, Sebastian's father-in-law (Clark Gregg) makes the difficult decision of getting a sex change that has a huge impact on the family from Sebastian-dad. <br /> <br /> Clark Gregg plays Hank / Henrietta, Sebastian's father-in-law and is very good in his role, very credible without being above, way that this movie could have taken quite easily. Fortunately, they did not do it. Adrien Grenier, whom I only know in Entourage, is also very good as Sebastian and together he and Gregg have a great relationship on the screen. It is always very interesting to see the relationship of these guys (?) Evolve and be really heartbreaking at times. <br /> <br /> And that's the best of what this movie has to offer. Unfortunately, this implies poor work, direction and cinematography. It's not bad, but it's far from good or memorable. The characters are also finely written, and it is clear from the start that most arcs will unfold. The only truly fascinating character of all time is Hank / Henrietta of Clark Gregg. I have already said that Grenier had played the role of actor, but Sebastian's character is not only uninviting, but it is totally inconceivable. Honestly, I do not see why anyone in the audience would buy his character in anything he does. He moans, moans, cheats, lies and lacks aspirations other than being a complete slacker. It would be different if he was perhaps a secondary character or a comic relief, but have it as a primary goal and be asked to take the character seriously? Go. <br /> <br /> And I'm not really angry at this movie, but I just want to say ... choose a different song in all those movies, Hollywood! No more "Where Is My Mind" Pixies, we all know it's a good song, stop using it in all other movies! <br /> <br /> I feel like I could continue to rip more and more of this film apart, but in all honesty I did not hate it. I did not really care and I would not recommend it to anyone. The adventures of Sebastian Cole is not a bad movie or boring, it's just not very good or engaging. It is very uneven and the script could have used a lot of work. I guess the purpose of the film is to give a glimpse of a writer's life before he realizes it, and it worked ... if that writer published works of fiction that I would not like to read.
