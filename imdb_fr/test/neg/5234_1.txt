** May contain spoilers ** Horrible. Just horrible. I loved Stephen King's novel and it's just a horrible adaptation of it. They change the end. They change the plot. They changed the character of Alan Pangborne, who had gone from a grieving husband to a happy fianc√©. If you're a fan of Stephen King's novel, stay away. Even if you are not, move away. <br /> <br /> The book was incredibly dark, even for Steve King. An 11-year-old child kills himself in the novel. A pedagogue is in the novel with child pornography. It's not nearly as good as the novel. <br /> <br /> This film is my least favorite movie of all time. I hate this movie with revenge.
