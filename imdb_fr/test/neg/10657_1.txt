... without anything to leave. This film begins with scenes in China with the discovery of a newborn. Although it was not a new concept, I was not going to give up there. Then there is a flash forward to adolescence. This man's wife and her biological child are fed up with the father who neglected them. Although it does not seem culturally accurate and the film does not offer any development for these characters or the purpose of the adoptive father's devotion, I insisted. <br /> <br /> Then we are in Malibu where we are bombarded. through poor classroom interaction and an extremely small budget (fill the void: actor / camera work / lighting). <br /> <br /> I will not give any more of the plot, because I guess the summary is accurate: the film is meant to show how a Malibu girl who (though she seems to naturally have compassion and the interest in helping others when she immediately questions her teacher about the trip to China) is spoiled and inconsiderate, she is a healer and helps the body and mind. <br /> <br /> Blade. BLADE, BLADE, BLADE. <br /> <br /> Now, I am certainly a severe critic, so maybe take one of these BLADES and you'll be on the right track.
