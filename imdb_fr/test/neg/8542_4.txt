Jess Franco makes exploitation films, and he made tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in the history of cinema, and God bless him for that. Unfortunately, The Diamonds of Kilominjaro is a really horrible film that does not meet its usual standards. <br /> <br /> Exploitation films must be judged on the basis of their history, their sex and their gore. What else is there? This film fails on most of these landmarks. The plot is thin as paper, placing a nubile girl in the jungle among the cannibals. We really do not know why she and her father were there in the first place. As expected, her father is the "Great White Chief" and she becomes a goddess, sitting in the trees, naked. Add fortune hunters and gems, and you have your base to save the girl for the greedy plot line The characters are in stock, without adding an ounce of credibility to the proceedings. <br /> <br /> Gore? None, or at least very little. This film is often cited in the same vein as classical Italian cannibal films. Those looking for this type of gore must run the other way. This film surprisingly contains little blood and courage. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, the only reason this film exists is that Katja Bienert, Aliene Mess, and Mari Carmen Neieto could come around nude. In fact, "Lita" (Mari Carmen Neieto) does most of the front work, while the two ladies of the jungle are shirtless. Yes, there are scenes of love ... probably the most sterile that Franco has ever supervised. Women are beautiful, but nothing here makes this movie an erotic classic either. <br /> <br /> This movie just smells of cheap buffoonery. Sets are laughable. The acting is horrible and editing is confusing. There is no real story that holds the page, and not enough of a budget (or effort) to shock or tickle. I think that Franco's fans are expecting more and more from the master of the exploitation.
