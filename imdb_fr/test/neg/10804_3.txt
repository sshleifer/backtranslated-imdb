Soultaker was written and performed by Vivian Schilling. He also starred Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen and Robert D'Zar in the role of the Angel of Death. <br /> <br /> The story begins with an introduction to Soultaker, performed by Joe Estevez. We quickly learn what role Soultaker will play in this movie. <br /> <br /> Then the young university people get ready for a summer festival aptly named "Summerfest". In this film, the battle of classes is omnipresent throughout the film. Girls belong to a rich class and boys, to the middle or lower classes. Class roles seem to play a role in the film for a reason that is not really clear or relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> At Summerfest, we learn about the apparent class struggle for which Zach is not encouraged to date Natalie. Soultaker also makes his appearance, apparently with his boss the Angel of Death. Here, the character of D'Zar indicates who must die and who must take the soul. It is also revealed that Soultaker will have a conflict of character regarding Natalie and the way he treats her because of someone from her past. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Natalie is left behind by her trip to Summerfest, and Zach convinces her to go home with them. During the return home, Soultaker plays an active role and destroys them horribly at high speed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story tells the story of Soultaker collecting the soul of the dead passengers, and that Zach and Natalie try to thwart him to return to their bodies so that they can continue to live . Conflicts between classes and characters are present in the story, but are never really emphasized or solved. <br /> <br /> We try, in the end, to draw a part of the drama, there are many lawsuits and lawsuits which tends to be really boring. It's not really acceptable, and it would have been nice if it had been treated differently, maybe increase the drama but not annoy the audience. <br /> <br /> The story and the acting are decent. The soundtrack is OK and even the production values ​​are good. <br /> <br /> Robert D'Zar in his film on screen does a good job as Angel of Death. Joe Estevez is fine, but his role is sometimes a little flat. Vivian is pretty and does a decent job as Natalie, although maybe playing a little in a few scenes. <br /> <br /> It may seem strange, but this film could certainly have benefited from useless nudity. Vivian teases us a little but that was not enough. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was a serious attempt to make a movie. The results, it's worth watching. Do not expect a perfect production. <br /> <br /> 3/10
