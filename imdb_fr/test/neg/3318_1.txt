Even if I had not read Anne Rice's "Queen of the Damned" in "The Vampire Chronicles", I probably would have thought that this movie was really horrible. <br /> <br /> It was tasteless, without intrigue, it made absolutely no sense. I sat for a moment meditating on the dissociated plot of the book, and the more I thought about it, the worse it was. To associate it in any way with the previous Chronicles film is ridiculous, it's ridiculously incompatible with this film, not to mention the book. The few simple ideas drawn from Rice's genius in "The Vampire Chronicles" have been vanquished and ridiculed. <br /> <br /> It's an absolute insult to Anne Rice fans and a pathetic excuse for her legacy of being Aaliyah's latest film. . Really, it's also an insult to Aaliyah fans. <br /> <br /> Maybe the only compliment can be made to sound effects as well as some of the graphics. Even if they are good, it is still not enough to make me regret the time spent watching this movie. In fact, I signed up for this membership for the sole reason of contacting people who were bothering to watch this movie (7 years after the release, which might be the case) so as not to waste their time or wait much more than their disappointment.
