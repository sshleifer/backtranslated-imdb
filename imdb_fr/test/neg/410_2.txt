This review tells the story of 4 boyfriends who went to watch the movie Angels and Demons the first night of its release, even if it was a school night, because "Angels and Demons is worth it ". Two of the four had read the book. Among those who did not, a guy was wearing pink skinny jeans. It was the least hectic part of the evening after watching the odious angels and demons. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a laboratory where antimatter is created while another process is underway. And apparently, someone knows it or something. Notice how confused I am. I do not understand what happened: they just made antimatter. Vittoria finds her own dead father ... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is an impression, not a burn on someone's chest. They eliminate the X-33 scene. They eliminate Maxmillian Kohler. Basically, they are eliminating CERN and the symbology associated with it. They leave Hassasin and replace him with a British religious type. They take out the Illuminati Diamond. They eliminate the rape scene near Vittoria. They eliminate the fight of Langond with Hassasin (British guy on crack). They take the guy out of the press that follows them. They leave the death of the fourth cardinal. They eliminate the fact that the Camerlengo becomes pope. They release the great project of Camerlengo. They eliminate the fact that Langdon is in the helicopter and lands on this island towards the end. They emphasize the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They eliminate Langdon's pleasure and, unfortunately, Vittoria's sexual appeal. <br /> <br /> Apart from the film, the film completely loses the sense of precision, it is filmed HORRIBLY. It must be admitted that there were good things. For example, the recreation of the Sistine Chapel had to be extremely difficult and extremely successful. The scene of the explosion was MIND-BLOWING. Other than that, SEE THIS FILM TO RUIN THE BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT READ.
