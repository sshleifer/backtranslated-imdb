If it's a black film, then black must be French for a cold slump. Take a cast of totally incomparable characters, give them nothing to say, punctuate the whole thing with ultra-violence free, and you have the formula of an aggravated Dash. Could be subtitled "Hollywood guys are trying to make money from a scam in Chinatown". Bruce Dern's one-minute portion is an order of magnitude higher than any other element in this film. By the way, I did not like the movie.
