It's been a long time since I've been in a film as lame and boring as this one. It's one thing to have a slow pace, where the characters are developed gradually, or certain aspects of the film are clearly improved by such a rhythm (like "Lost in Translation"). However, there is a difference between the slow progress and I do not know why, because of the face of Helen Mirren, she had to be upset by the disappearance of her husband !! Surprise, surprise !! . (sarcasm) And what a beautiful way that the whole story collapses in the end. Really a masterpiece.
