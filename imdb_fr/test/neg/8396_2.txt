I logged in here just after watching this movie, feeling it was so horrible that at least his reviews could be fun. But all your scoundrels seem to like that. And so, since I want the work to be done well ... <br /> <br /> From the first shoot, the film establishes its contempt for the attention span of the audience by showing a totally banal image of a irrelevant bridge for a long time, long time. Then we go skateboarding in slow motion, which is at least a little cool, but then it compensates for this glimmer of excitement by superimposing the most repulsive song I've ever heard. A girl screams in French in a whisper on what looks like planking planks. Anyone who has decided that this should be there has never mounted a skateboard, I guarantee it. He seemed to be there to test the limits of the patience of the public. <br /> <br /> From there, the movie shows an idle of about 50%. Do you know what is worse than a free idle? A free idle shot of * nothing happens. * This is a guy who walks in a path. Here is a guy sitting. Here is a guy who looks around. Here is a guy who is looking at another guy. After a while, I started watching the movie at double speed, reducing it each time people on the screen entered a dialogue, which was rare. Once, surprisingly, I slowed down the film to find out what a girl was saying, only to find that the camera was showing her talking, but the sound was another horrible and horrible song and her real voice was not audible. <br /> This reminds me of a good piece of advice I once heard about writing - if you have nothing to say, do not use sophisticated tricks to pretend as if you did it. Go back to work and think of something to say. All these camera tricks, like slow motion and strange lighting, lenses and weird music, are what the lack of content looks like. Apparently, a lot of people have bought it and they have an emotional depth and a deep meaning, but I think they are showing it on a movie that did not do any of the work that was necessary to create it.
