I think it's one of the few films I want to qualify as low as possible to give him a compliment. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for about 25 years, so I really can not say that much about it. It always seems to be very hard to find on video. But I remember my brother and I stumbled on it somewhere in the toxic drunk of UHF TV late night in the mid-1980s, when I was about 10 years old. So, I never really saw the beginning of the movie, but I saw almost everything. The first thing I remember is that this couple sneaking out of a campsite and rowing on an island to sneak, then get attacked by a crazy Scottish kilt with an ax! They manage to escape but are attacked by the monster of Loch Ness, which in this film is a head and a neck without body. The eyes and mouth of the monster do not even move, it looks like a pi√±ata. <br /> <br /> I mean, I had literally never seen anything of this magnitude and it completely upset me. In the early '80s, I had seen bad movies on television, but I had never seen anything so completely inept and built so simple and thoughtless that it seemed that those who had spent less time and effort than us. I had already seen some Troma movies and that kind of thing that deliberately tries to be "campy", but it was pure and real and it was my first encounter with very bad movies. This film was like the last breath of the drive-in era and I felt a puff just in time. In fact, when we were watching the film, we could not know if it had been made in the '50s or' 70s. It turned out that he had only been out a few years before seeing it. <br /> <br /> Later, I came into contact with Mystery Science Theater and discovered many old B Series movies and serials, but I had already seen it in this movie. The movie is so funny that I had never even laughed at the Monty Python, Bill Murray or any other comedian. After watching this movie, I was always looking for the "good bad guys" movies and a lot of my friends took part. But this movie was and is fundamentally impossible to find. I never really knew what it was or who was Larry Buchanan until the 1990s, when IMDb took off and the Internet took off and the news began to be transmitted. But this film has yet to be discovered by many other people who could appreciate its transcendent qualities. Search.
