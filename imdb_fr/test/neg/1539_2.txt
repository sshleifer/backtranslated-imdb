So, I wonder when watching this movie, did the producers of this movie save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging her "before" Miss Congeniality clothes? Did Mrs. Bullock also fall asleep in the role by channeling "before" Gracie Hart? As many critics have already noted, the film is very stereotyped. Add to that the viewer experience already seen with the character of Cassie Maywether as Gracie Hart a little darker with an older story and she quickly becomes a rehearsal festival. <br /> <br /> The two serial killers of bad boys have already been made (and better) in other films. Just as the "good partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence" has already been seen before. In fact, none of the characters in the film exceed the two dimensions or pretend to be stereotyped. <br /> <br /> One last mistake: using the term serial killer is a misleading advertisement. The murder of a person - even if it is premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer, but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer.
