I saw the episode about the minimum wage. It went as far as the appearance of an Oprah Winfrey for the said episode. It's hard enough that people are struggling to make ends meet. Then have this hypocrite exploiting the problem. I did not appreciate the constant complaint of him or his significant other, all the way through. Queston is how all people have the power to pay their medical bills from emergencies? Of course, he shows that the bill is high, but he paid the remaining balance (out of his own pocket) after his "heartbreaking" experience. How many poor people benefit from this type of privilege after 30 days to pay their bills. Instead, they starve and "rob Peter to pay Paul". Complaining throughout the episode is not a humiliating thing for him. The cinema and restaurant scene is appalling. He has another privilege that the poor do not have.
