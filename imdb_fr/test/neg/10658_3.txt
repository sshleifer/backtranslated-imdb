This film had two redeeming qualities: cinemaphotography and a hard-to-resist storyline. However, the screenplay, the staging and some scenes were horrible. I kept wondering why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie. My only conclusion was that these actors had to believe in the charity behind the film's plot, knowing that the film was full of flaws. <br /> <br /> This film could have been much better public as a result. What makes me think that with all the problems of the film, some scenes are terribly difficult to watch, I always wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would resolve itself.
