Not being a particular Western fan, I watched it mainly because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in a role other than "I Love Lucy" or "Lucy Show". Here she plays the role of Christine Larson, owner of a salon in the Arizona Territory in 1868, who is about to be married to the unscrupulous agent of the Indians (Dean Jagger). Ball's performance was correct - nothing more; she did not take me away. It succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what I'm used to seeing it - there was very little of the scandalous physical comedy for which she became famous afterwards, although the film has tried to maintain a fun feeling while gently. (A typical fun phrase - "There are two ways to treat women - and nobody knows them either!") I have not found the story so compelling, although I appreciate the fact that Indian women are portrayed as victims of the Indian Agent. There is a typical shooting and many horses - your typical western in other words. As for Christine, we can almost guess from the beginning how her planned marriage will end; it's just a question of how she's going to get there. If you like westerns, that would be pretty typical with a little humor. If you are not very good at the genre, you will miss it. I'm not big on gender. 3/10
