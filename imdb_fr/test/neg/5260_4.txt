Archie Moses, a drug rider, introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, the drug pillar Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually an undercover police officer. During the bust of the Colton factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats' head. He survives the injury and later stops Moses. By avoiding the murderers of Colton, the duo must defeat their mutual hatred to survive. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler's films are usually a story of success, with his comedies either loved by his fans or hated by everyone. This one is not as stupid as his other movies, but still can not overcome a lazy scenario. The direction is incredibly uneven, with fast action sequences that give way to slow comical exchanges between Sandler and Damon Wayans. Some action scenes ?? to fly a plane without an engine, a car chase at night through a forest ?? are quite absurdly artificial. The acting game is the norm for this genre, Sandler & Wayans making a good couple. In short, the movie is stupid but fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Note: C + Review by M. K. Geist
