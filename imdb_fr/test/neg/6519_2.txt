This film tries to take advantage of the success of Richard Curtis' films, in particular "Love Actually" - a series of disparate scenes that follow the love life of different couples. <br /> <br /> It's a good idea that is poorly executed. The script tries to be a little too smart and just does not sound. Most of the actors are on stage, which is more a reflection on the director than on the actors. <br /> <br /> The version I saw (in a plane) was called "Scenes of a park", more appropriate title. like all the scenes were not of "sexual nature". <br /> <br /> I could not wait to see this movie, but in the end it was disappointing. Do not bother yourself.
