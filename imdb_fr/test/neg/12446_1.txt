Wow, this movie really broke down below the normal boring, boring and unimaginative movies I've seen recently. The acting was poor and robotic. The story was so bland that you could have summed it up with a simple short film of 5 minutes. The audio was so poor and dirty that it was hard to listen even; Perhaps it was unpublished from the camera from which he had just been shot? I do not know which movie the 3 laudatory reviewers commented, but it was not that one. The director may have realized that his film had received a good review, at least before the real critics appeared. <br /> <br /> Save your time otherwise you will lose your time and money. this film. Absolute sugaring!
