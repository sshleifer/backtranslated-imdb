I really should give more credit to this stinker than 1 star, because the film has so many fascinating lines that it is almost worth the rental. <br /> <br /> The game of actors, if you want to call it that, is so artificial and artificial that it gives the impression that Ed Wood's actors have a real life. "Sammy", the only black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life as he appears in his other films, but he has no ability to act. His lines are priceless because of his absurd speech, although I suspect his intention was to create a sympathetic character. His old man made up in his other turkey ("Pushed To The Limit") is budget-free and top quality for college, with cotton ball eyebrows and white-painted hair. Buy this video, unless people like to hold their Mystery Science Theater evenings and need a copy of that kind of thing. It's really Beyond Fear - it's really Beyond Funny.
