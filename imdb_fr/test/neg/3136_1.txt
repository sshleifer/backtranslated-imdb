For people who have compared this TRASH to David Lynch's brilliance, etc ... please, listen to your caregiver when they say it ... DO NOT USE OTHER PERSON'S PC WITHOUT THEIR AUTHORIZATION! <br /> <br /> This is complete and UTTER OOP! There is no art here. This is a person who is trying to make a name out of a group of rude ideas that she was not smart enough to apply IN ONE main idea. He turned to the easy option. <br /> <br /> Anyone with a half-brain can stay home and evoke controversial images to shock viewers, but it takes a person with a real imagination to make a film that people WANT to watch. <br /> <br /> I am a LOVE of shock cinema. I have seen OR CARRY just about everything you can get ... And I can strongly advise anyone who LOVES the world of cinema to stay well away from this trash. <br /> <br /> This is ONLY for people who want to analyze too much what they are looking at, OR for 17 year olds who drink for the first time and do not know better. <br /> <br /> 0/10! <br /> <br />
