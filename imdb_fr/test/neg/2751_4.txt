I've read a lot of reviews about the IMDb (well, the five that were written at the time I'm writing this) and I'm surprised how much praise we've given to The Brideless Groom, is without a doubt one of the small comedies interpreted by the Stooges. I prefer the older ones where it was Larry, Curly and Moe, although Shemp gets a credit for most of the fun scenes in Sing a Song of Six Pants, another short of Stooges that's only moderately fun but of far superior to Brideless Groom. Indeed, there is only one scene slightly amusing in the film, the scene "does not hit a lady", which is hardly amusing and that lasts for 15 minutes. Not very promising in a 17-minute comedy. <br /> <br /> Shemp is a voice coach whose uncle died and left him a legacy of $ 500,000, as long as he gets married within 48 hours. yes, but as Shemp learns, he only has 7 hours left. This is a premise that was made and redone before, but it was not, in my opinion, a massive clich√© at the time this film was shot, as it is now. Throughout the film, there is a series of gags that are not even close to the level of comedy for which the Three Stooges are so widely known. It seems that the Stooges have experienced the same problems that hit so many Shirley Temple movies ?? there is too little trust in the content and too much in the fact that they are there. <br /> <br /> The standard features of the Stooges are present, Moe is the medium, whose wickedness is certainly not used modestly in this film, and the burlesque sound effects (although with more exceptions than usually) are pretty fun, but are plugged into their standard locations in this movie. The line "Hold your hand, you lovebirds" is immortal. The rest of the movie is not. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of discussion among the people who commented on this movie for this site and that this one is one of Stooges' best short films, which you will not find a weak moment, at about how it's their best since the shorts of the early 30's. That's just not true. I can certainly understand a level of automatic respect for the great classics and giants of primitive comedy, which is certainly the Three Stooges, but this respect is compromised when the poorest films deserve more than they should be. The Brideless Groom deserves a little respect because it's a Stooges movie, but for exactly the same reason, it should have been better. The Three Stooges were just better than that.
