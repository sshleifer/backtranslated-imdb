A cheap and cheerless robbery film with poor characterization, lots of stoic emotions (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy shots thrown into a disused factory ready to receive a few badly executed judo rolls at the John Woo. Even the squibs look horrible. At no point in the process does it look like America. The Mustang even has a flickering front right wheel. The plot, as it stands, is so derivative and predictable that the end is like a slaughter. He could not come soon enough. Even the flying jewels look like the cheapest fancy jewelry available. The frightful dialogue and the hopeless outbidding of all those who are killed represent a real waste of space and time. It's worth watching if you want to know how not to make a low budget movie clich√©.
