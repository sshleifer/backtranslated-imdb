I know it's pretty unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the whole piece - but I'm going anyway! I waited to laugh, I tried to give him time. I think 20 minutes is enough to wait in a comedy to laugh. My laughter never came, so I gave up. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid humor, not so stupid that you have to laugh, though. It's not anywhere near this high quality. Let me fix that, it's just * stupid * - no stupid humor. They may have wanted some scenes to be funny, but that was not the case. I guess if you really get bored, you could mix the movie with a hallucination and end up with a slightly entertaining experience. <br /> <br /> A very pathetic effort.
