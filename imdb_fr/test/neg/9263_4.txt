This film is a big problem. It presents many predictable plots and endless feelings from the beginning. It starts well with a class number but seems lost half way. <br /> <br /> Surya & Jyothika's on-screen chemistry works really well and a good part of Bhoomika. Why include Vadivelu? It disappears completely after a good half hour! Santhanam proves once again his intelligence by programming comedy. <br /> <br /> The airs of AR will last one day. But he could have done better. Whatever the inconvenience, it's worth looking at once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good hobby.
