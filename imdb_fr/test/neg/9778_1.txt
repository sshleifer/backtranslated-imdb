I lost 5 dollars by renting this piece of shit full. Dr. Zack is the most tireless main character I have ever seen. The film was full of EVERY cliche that you could think of and did not contain an ounce of originality. There was the typical sexism portrayed by rough aliens, all the guys had those attitudes "too proud to take advice" that are as bland as Grandma's Christmas fruit cake. The concept and the dead were really cool, but they lose all novelty once the monster is revealed. (read the SPOILER at the end) Nothing else is really revealed, the end is the biggest evasion you've ever seen. I planned everything before it happened, including who would die and how. Dialogue is missing, and this is a euphemism from a distance. There are mostly random howls, pensive looks, and thick sentences. The actors are just GOD AWFUL! I do not want to talk about this movie, it makes me angry. I'm just wondering if the director even looked when it was done. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER ALERT !!!! SAVE 5 DOLLARS!) The monster is only a group of ants that have "evolved". bones so that they can move (no matter that there is no evolutionary benefit, and the ants have just killed the one that was available, although the film acts as if they were killing by necessity.) "made stupid.) of the main fool killing the mother ant (a big blob thing) that destroys all the other ants. Nice shot eh? It almost ends up dying out because of a sudden emotional attachment to the mother thing that overcomes it. Leave me alone.
