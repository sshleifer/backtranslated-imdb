I should have realized it was a sign of things to come when the movie trailer annoyed me. <br /> <br /> After watching several "independent" films based on critics, My view is completely opposite to that of other commentators. I started to wonder if it is possible for me to watch movies that are completely different from these people, or maybe they are friends / family, etc. movie directors trying to "fatten" their work? Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Are you interested in seeing an amateur tribute to Pulp Fiction and at 11:14, except that you're done with worse actors, a stupid score (undermining various scenes) and jumps from incredible logic? Otherwise, skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Here is my open letter to two of the actors in this film. <br /> <br /> Alfonso Morgan, please, please stop trying to 'be' Samuel L. Jackon at Pulp Fiction. Nobody can do what he does as well as he does. <br /> <br /> Director, propose something original. It hurts you to produce that kind of thing by claiming to be Quentin Tarantino. <br /> <br /> Simply terrible, and I really do not see how you could say it's a good movie. It's a shame that people have managed to place a grade of 8.5, as in movies like Pulp fiction or Goodfellas. It's nowhere near these movies; a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average score, I give it a 3.
