I would say it's a background film. Play it in the background when you tend to work (laundry, checking emails, etc.). I thought it was a movie that had been done before Amy Adams was successful after Enchanted. False! It was done in 2009! The script / script is pretty awful. I like musicals but the singing is just average and does not advance the plot. Ughh. It almost looks like it's a TV movie based on cinematography. Do I watch a TV show? <br /> <br /> Even the secretary starts to sing. What is the f @ # $ happening ?! In fact, she seemed to have the best voice. Amy Adams was so great in Enchanted. The main actor is average. Disappointed for sure. This film would have been good for life, but that's about it. :(
