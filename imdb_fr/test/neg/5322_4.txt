A mysterious thriller ultimately dull, which may seem pretty pretty in theory but very badly played. The ridiculous scenario is filled with (MINOR SPOILER) dying then returning to life when the plot requires it, and the director does not seem able to create energy and suspense. The gooey sequence that "explains" the title of the movie is the only half-memorable of this tedious movie. (* 1/2)
