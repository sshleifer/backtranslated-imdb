I rented the DVD yesterday and first of all, it starts badly, it's a 4: 3 film, and it only gets worse, the acting is so bad and the movie itself is too predictable, I was like watching the movie and I said to myself: it will happen next and guess what happened? Right ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good action boxing movie, do not look at this one, you will be disappointed with this low budget movie as I did. Go see Ali better his way!
