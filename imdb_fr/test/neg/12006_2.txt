this movie was incredibly stupid to mean anything. I got into trouble for all the actors and actresses who ruined their career in this silly movie. the whole movie was based on how they could do it unrealistically, doing little like what made it even more stupid. even some names were unrealistic. the movie is fun to watch, which is why it got 2 stars out of 10. it's probably the 3rd stupidest film ever made. I really made myself realize that there were mostly adult actors but it was a children's movie. the most troubling was Danny Trejo, a horror film actor still filthy. the other actors were pretty clean as far as I'm concerned.
