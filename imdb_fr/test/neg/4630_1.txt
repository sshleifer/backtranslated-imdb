A film that tries to say something and usually fails. Like the stupid academics who populate the film, he meanders aimlessly, substituting a never-ending conversation (he seems to listen forever) to a direction of action or intrigue. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is one of the best examples of Canadian cinema I've seen.
