There is no "fun" to make fun of the plight of illegal immigrants! Or the desperate situation of the wicker owners, by the way! That Brian Glazer, richer than god, did not see the irony of having the "heroes" do exactly what the villain does-stripping the hard-working honesty of their savings-does not surprise me! God, how do you think he must be richer than God ?! <br /> <br /> In this so-called satire of greed, these mental dwarves reveal their own hypocrisy: McMansions, McToys, McChildren, McIllegals who are paid peanuts to take care of the McMansions, McToys and McChildren! But the main problem (aside from revolting bigotry) is the premise: as a former leader of a now infamous business, Dick would be the Big Scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country! No soups for him! And, in six figures, one would think he would not be surprised by a Gore / Lieberman poster!
