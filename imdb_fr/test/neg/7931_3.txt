This is yet another pseudo-intellectual film "Let's make the Nazis look really bad". The Nazis were pretty mean, no doubt - most of them already know it. However, that does not necessarily make each movie feel good. A Discovery Channel presentation on "The Wannsee Conference" would have been much more interesting. <br /> <br /> "The plot" falls between two categories: documentary and drama. It is not a documentary, the film is too "staged" and the presentation too "common". This does not cut the drama, the characters are too superficial and the conflicts too easily "solved". <br /> <br /> Another thing is the slogan: "One of the greatest crimes against humanity was perpetrated just after one o'clock." As the film shows the Wannsee conference, the meeting has nothing to do with seeking consensus on the final solution. The decision on the solution had already been made by the SS. The sole purpose of the meeting was to ensure that all major stakeholders committed to an already established plan. No decision or plan was taken at the Wannsee conference. There were only threats and coercion (some needed less than others). <br /> <br /> Finally: the film shows one thing (although not exceptionally), the man tends to turn to culture and aesthetics an attempt to hide that he commits atrocities appalling. This is seen in most "leaders" and hawkish politicians.
