Hard to believe - but it is! I should not be surprised. The commercials try to show how a show can be unique and "funny". Still, not only did the announcements announcing this new show have not been humorous to me, I did not speak to anyone who found these ads funny either. <br /> <br /> I do not remember ever seeing a driver so devoid of intelligence, kindness or humor. The characters were unbearable for the most part. Especially Selma Blair (which is amazing, she would agree to be in a faecal sample of a show like this). The few moments when the characters were a little redeemable were considerably ridiculed and banal. <br /> <br /> Rare is the show without any redeemable quality. And it's not one of them. Kath and Kim have ONLY ONE quality - it's Selma Blair. Despite wearing disgusting outfits and acting as a pitiful and stupid excuse for a young woman who looks like a cross between Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, Selma is always nice to watch. <br /> <br /> But you want to watch Selma, go rent Hellboy. You will maintain at least a minimum of respect for her instead of engraving this abominable character in your brain to associate her with it. <br /> <br /> In the end, Kath and Kim are a mess and truly embody the worst TV is or has ever been. He sets a new low.
