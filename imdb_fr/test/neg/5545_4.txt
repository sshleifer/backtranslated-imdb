Oscar-winning "Lilies of the Field" actor Sidney Poitier resumes his role as Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs in veteran director Gordon Douglas's film "In the Heat of the Night", "The sequel is tired and uninspired" "They call me MISTER Tibbs", "with nobody the equivalent of Rod Steiger with whom to exchange a dialogue." Clearly, the writers "Bullitt" Alan R. Trustman and Robert D. Webb of "Cape Fear" were irrelevant when they have written this predictable police procedural potboiler.The dialogue is dull and none of the characters are interesting, not even the main suspect.Nothing excites, is disturbing or surprising in this captivating polar.In the meantime, things have changed considerably since Virgil was last seen in "In the heat of the night." He worked as a homicide detective for the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, police department. call MISTER Tibbs ", our hero works for the San Francisco Police Department. In addition, he has a wife, Valerie (Barbara McNair of "Change of Habit") and a family, a rebellious young son, Andy (George Spell of "The Naked Kiss") and a younger daughter, Ginger (Wanda Spell) . from "Hickey and Boggs"). Tibbs drives a medium blue Mustang and his wife is holding the house down and flies over their two children since he does not have much time to spend with them. Literally, there are no surprises in this mystery of pedestrian murder. In fact, the best thing about "They call me MISTER Tibbs" is the Quincy Jones soundtrack, whose opening theme is memorable, more memorable than the memorable crime thriller. <br /> <br /> Joy Sturges (Linda Towne of "The Adventurers"), a prostitute, is stunned to death by an unseen assailant in the bedroom of her downtown apartment. The handyman of the apartment Mealie Williamson (Juano Hernandez "Intruder in the Dust") enters the apartment of Joy and discovers it strewn on the carpet, the bloody forehead. He briefly picks up the statue and places it on the floor and shares Joy's death with the apartment manager, Rice Weedon (Anthony Zerbe from "License to Kill"). Weedon gives Mealie and a handful of dollars and sends him packing. . Subsequently, Weedon anonymously notified the SFPD that the popular minister Logan Sharpe (Martin Landau of "Nevada Smith") beat Joy to death and seemed to leave Joy's apartment. Captain Marden (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") assigns to Tibbs the handling of the case; it seems that Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years. Naturally, Valerie, Tibbs' wife, can not believe that this known and politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime. Just to give the background of the film, it should be noted that when Tibbs and the police study the crime scene, they mention the word 'semen', arguably a controversial term to mention in a film from the early 1970s. /> <br /> Tibbs questions Weedon that he suspects he is a drug pusher or a pimp. Weedon explains that he has no record of Joy Sturges because she was subletting the apartment of another real estate company. Tibbs visits the real estate company and real estate agent Woody Garfield (Ed Anser of "JFK") runs away and leaves, essentially performing an OJ Simpson until he crushes his car after a long and docile pursuit . When Tibbs proves that Woody did not kill Joy, he let him go with his unhappy wife, Marge (Norma Crane of "Penelope"), ready to seek a divorce after the revelation that he paid a bitch to stay in a apartment. . <br /> <br /> Tibbs hunt down Mealie's handyman and clean him up, then pursue Weedon. Fortunately, for Tibbs, our hero catches the wicked Weedon in the middle of a narcotics deal. One of Weedon's henchmen assaulted Tibbs, but Tibbs left him briefly before embarking on a long foot chase after Weedon. Finally, he catches Weedon in an underground garage and they shoot him. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the house of the Tibbs are more interesting than his investigation. Andy goes wild, hits his sister and smokes in the garden. Our hero wants him to clean his room. When Andy refuses, Tibbs makes him appear three times in the jaw. These scenes of children's education could probably never be managed today, as was the case in 1970. At the end of the film, as to consolidate the family sequence, we see Tibbs move away with his wife and his children. There is a confrontation between Valerie and Virgil about the well-being of their children and the consequences of her long hours at work. <br /> <br /> The director, Gordon Douglas, leads with skill. Surprisingly, for a film released in 1970, filmmakers never play the race card. In one scene, when Tibbs digs into an African-American billiard hall, we see a mixed race of races scoffing at the hero when he finds Mealie and follows him with him. <br /> <br /> In all, "They call me MISTER Tibbs" is a poor follow-up of "In the heat of the night". Of course, Poitier offers another great performance with nuances, but everything looks prefabricated. All the sets look wrong and there is not much physical violence: a shooting in an underground car park that does not last long. Beyond Jones' flagship jazz score, the only surprise - and she can not really be described as a major surprise, but rather as a convenient trick - is the end. Donald Medford's "The Organization" is followed by "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs", the second most loaded sequel.
