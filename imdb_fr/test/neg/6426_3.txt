The movie starts pretty well. It is a truly terrifying scene as two fugitives who escape the law tear an innocent family living in an isolated cottage by killing their father and mother. The girl manages to escape with the help of a mysterious specter, who kills the two attackers while she covers herself in a wardrobe downstairs. We find her again 15 years later, as a drug addict student, looking for the supernatural, living with her aunt promiscuated and treated by a mysterious redhead. She has no real friends, was almost raped at a party and continues to have strange visions that no one else can see. So yes, life is beautiful. Things get a lot nicer when she argues with her mother's sister, who is later found dead in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances, with 11 engravings on the forehead. Hmm, I wonder who will be the main suspect of the police? This is quickly followed by other deaths, all linked by their relationship with our heroine having been on bad terms with them before their deaths. Could she be the culprit, or maybe the explanation could be something of a more ethereal nature? Hint: If you think about it first, you've chosen the wrong Blockbuster movie. Return looking for the good gimp at the short sight. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was ready to move quickly in the right parts, knowing that I did not miss my chance other than a mediocre potboiler. But the first ten minutes took me, and I decided to try it. I was quite pleasantly surprised: it was certainly not a masterpiece, but the acting was enough and the scenario kept creating intriguing situations for which I was eager to find the solution. Alas, after 45 minutes, I realized that my attention was beginning to wander in a long sequence during which the main character walked into a library doing nothing. We then have a cheap fear, followed by fifteen minutes of goddledegook about the paranormal between her and her new boyfriend. The situation is getting worse, from the moment the promising start is thrown out the window while we get an unconvincing plot after another, followed by an end so anticlimatic that it's as if we promise the moon and we were met with a tiny meteorite. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> If it was bad all the time, it would have been much easier to swallow. The fact that he starts at a gallop and barely ends with a groan is not only disappointing, it is heartbreaking. How can something that has begun in such a promising way end up being so stereotyped? I do not know and I do not care a bit. I'll just give the author and director a piece of advice for next time: do not spend five weeks writing the first part of your script, then five minutes to finish the rest. You tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as carelessly as here ...
