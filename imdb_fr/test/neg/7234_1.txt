Greetings, spectators! Looking at Octopus II, I look at the limpness inherent in the genus Octopus / Croc / Dino Horror. Many moviegoers can attribute the bad actor, an absurd storyline or a poorly constructed plot to the reasons that make the OCD film collapse. These reasons can certainly be derisory factors, but it is the difficulty inherent to the realization of a film of OCD which is at the heart of the lameness. <br /> <br /> You see, the technology does not exist yet to allow a realistic realization, full-size OCD and CGI technology currently used by studios do not have the ability to integrate seamlessly with environments and to the characters of the real world. Even with a clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea / semi-dark forest / semi-dark cave / semi-dark corridor so many times before the sci-fi aficionado gets bored completely of the genre (OCD subgenre, ie). <br /> <br /> What can you do, do you ask? I would not suggest that gender gives way to cheese, but another path remains to be explored. We can not really go back to the days of "Fade-to-Black" reporting that someone has been killed. Where can we go? If we can not achieve the goal of realism, we must compensate by other means, such as twists, innuendo and photo ingenuity. <br /> <br /> It will be by ingenious and alternative methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the subgenus OCD, will be cured.
