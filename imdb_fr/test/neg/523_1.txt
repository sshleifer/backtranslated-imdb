This film is one of the worst I have ever seen (without anything from Pauly Shore). I could not believe that a movie could really be THIS! <br /> <br /> Coolio must be the worst actor (again, without Pauly Shore) to have ever played the role of "star" in a movie. The temptation to press the STOP button during this movie was huge (in fact, if there was a THROW IN THE TRASH button on my VCR, I would have tended to press it). <br /> <br /> Make yourself one do something more interesting than watching this movie, like watching the grass grow or watching golf on TV.
