With actors like Depardieu and Richard, it's really hard to make a boring movie. But Weber is a master in the slowness and the realization of supposedly funny scenes, without intelligence nor depth. This film is high on the story but low on the character. You never know any of the characters except superficial burlesque. Unfortunately, Weber has no idea what a slapstick is. His style could be described at random. Of course, some people laugh at seeing someone slip on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor on this lot. It is unfortunate that he uses good talent. Many good French comedians have been wasted by mediocre directors.
