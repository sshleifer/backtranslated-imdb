I have no respect for IMDb ratings anymore. I think a group of Mormons flooded the website and voted for it. It's not an artistic film, it's Mormon propaganda. Nothing wrong with that, but the plan of the plot and its description are totally misleading. If you are a Christian beating the Bible or a Mormon, watch this movie, you will love it and find it really amazing. For the others, do not bother, the story is so artificial, random things happen that do not follow each other in a coherent way. This guy is trying to commit suicide because he is sleeping with his neighbor. Are you kidding? What a cat! Anyway, it's a horrible film.
