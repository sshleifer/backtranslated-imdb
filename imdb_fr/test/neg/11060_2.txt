What a shock. For starters, I could not stand the constant cry and constant panicked noise. It did not scare me, horrify me, or make me sympathetic to the characters; it was just annoying. The jerky movements of the camera were also annoying. The plot was the same as almost every other cheap horror. There were some pathetic attempts to give the characters a little depth, but that did not really work in the rest of the plot. And then there is the end. I still do not know what to think about it. I guess it was supposed to be a smart twist, then lighten up the situation a bit, but it was just stupid. <br /> <br /> The case had a couple of these little symbols of laureates / nominations on it, so I thought it could not be too serious. I was wrong. If you see it, you should probably leave it on the shelf.
