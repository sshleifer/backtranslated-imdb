I really wanted to love this movie. I read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. The book is wonderful. This film is very far from the book. The book is splendid - this film is a terrible adaptation. <br /> <br /> In the book, Sara is honorable, kind, strong and never does anything bad to take revenge on anyone. This is the POINT of the book! She behaves like a "princess" whatever the circumstances. An important part of behaving like a princess is not to make wickedness. It is behaving honorably no matter how you are treated. <br /> <br /> In the book, she endures a lot and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behavior after witnessing their kindness and ability to endure without sinking into scorn and revenge. Sara does what's right, just BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT. <br /> <br /> Outside the bakery, she falls on a beggar who is poorer and more hungry than she is. She has half a dozen hot rolls. She is very hungry. She gives a little bread to this little girl with the wild air, huddled on the threshold of the bakery. When she sees how voracious the girl is and looks at her swallowing the bun, she gives him another one. She keeps doing it until she gives 3 or 4, I think - I do not remember how many. <br /> <br /> The baker looks out the window. She is so moved by what she has witnessed that she takes the beggar and the student as her own daughter. Sara is also influenced by other people. <br /> <br /> And in the book, his father is dead. The man next door is his father's partner - he was looking for her. His father did not lose his money after all - the man is delighted to find Sara; he takes her with Becky to his house and raises them as his daughters. And Sara has her complete heritage, of course. <br /> <br /> Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep. In fact, she stays at school. But she is humiliated because Sara informed her new guardian of the cruel treatment she suffered. And Sara finally talks to Miss Minchin - Miss Minchin tries to minimize her treatment of Sara and Sara with a firm and calm demeanor, informs Miss Minchin that she was cruel. <br /> <br /> There is no continuation. for Miss Minchin. She continues her miserable life. It does not matter - what matters is that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her best friend in the world, Becky, is now virtually her sister. <br /> <br /> This book speaks of love and honorable behavior in the worst circumstances. It's about self-control and humility. It's a wonderful book. This film does nothing to capture the true story and the messages of the book. My wife was so disgusted that she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to stay back. We have not been rewarded. <br /> <br /> I can not think of a reason why the film should change this excellent book in such an unfavorable direction. This may be the influence of the horrendous scenario of the book in which Shirley Temple acted. I do not know - but this film is so far from the book in characters and values ​​that I do not recognize it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time - buy the book. It's unforgettable ... even for a dad!
