Voor een verloren soldaat, for a lost soldier, is a sad example of how not to translate into a film a touching and complex psychological study of this most magical period of a man's life, when he was still a male child . The novel chronicles the experiences of Rudy van Danzig, told by boy Jeroen, in the last days of the Second World War, at the age of 11, as he discusses his nascent sexuality, and his profound fears of abandonment when he was sent to the province. of his parents because of the lack of food in Amsterdam and has not heard from them for several months while the postal service was down. The arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film is painfully presented as old fashioned, with soldiers providing vaudeville style entertainment. Then a soldier, Walt, Jeroen and the couple introduce themselves as two frolics. They consume their love during a sexual experience. This support by the 11-year-old Jeroen. The reality was somewhat different: Jeroen describes his encounters with Walt, 6 in all, in detail but in oblique language. But there is no misunderstanding about their nature. Jeroen arouses an intense passion for Walt, during which he brutally treats him, so that during their last meeting, Jeroen is bruised and suffers from a painful shoulder injury where Walt bit him. During this meeting, Walt violates Jeroen twice. Jeroen could easily have avoided Walt after their second meeting, when Walt was assaulting him for the first time, because Walt is clearly anxious not to abuse the boy of other soldiers. Why Jeroen continues to search Walt out is a mystery of the human heart and can not be explained, anyway by me. What the film leaves out are the consequences: the nightmares, the discouragement, the frantic search of Amsterdam for the possibility of finding Walt, because Jeroen loved Walt, and nothing could stop him.
