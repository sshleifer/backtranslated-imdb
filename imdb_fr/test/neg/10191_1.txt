I stumbled on this movie and I checked for IMDb more information: Score 6.7, well ... not so bad. Like: scifi ... I love scifi. So, I had the film and I was looking forward to watching it Sunday night. But but ... NO. <br /> <br /> In short, it's not a film at all. It is a religious advertisement, including: preamble on Jesus, God, the devil, the end of the world, etc. The film begins with an epic abduction story: night driving, car stops, bright light, etc. the film. Finally ... frankly, frankly, I do not know what to call it ... was a dialogue about the end of the world and the last judgment. A bit the same as what these TV preachers tell you, but they are "good". <br /> <br /> Honestly, if you do not want to see a scifi movie or something with UFOs, please stay away from this "thing". It has nothing to do with them. If you want to hear the opinion of a cuckoo's head about what the Bible says and what you should do. Go ahead and look at this "thing", but I still prefer to go to church on Sunday. <br /> <br /> It's a complete bull. (and evangelical Christian propaganda, as another user has said = Well ... I should have another user's comments before getting the movie. <br /> <br /> (27% of voters attributed this rating to 10. Yeah, ok, please go elsewhere to do your propaganda)
