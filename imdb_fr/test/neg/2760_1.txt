I had to read this "love story" between a 24-year-old German prisoner of war and a 12-year-old Jew. This has "politically correct" written everywhere. It's a bit like the movie "SPIRIT" in which a horse wants to be free but the "bad guys" do not leave it, they need it. Well, I have good news that Americans are "perverse" in The German Soldier and His Summer Book. Why!!! The horses were given to us by God and if the Americans need a horse, we can use it very well. In the same sense, the German was trying to kill Americans, but this book / film gives the impression that it's okay. The casting is absolutely horrible !!!!!!!!!!!! The girl is Hispanic, the mother is white, the father is probably of white origin and the little sister is "Shirley Templish". The acting is pretty bad too, the serious roles become comedy! Concluson-Bad movie, bad book, but both have different purposes, do not read or see either!
