I had high hopes for this film when I saw the list and decided to watch it on television, without interruption by commercial breaks. I've loved Lee Van Cleef in many movies, but I'm afraid that the fact that other characters call him Chris many times does not even turn him into a reasonable Chris facsimile of Yul Brenner. <br /> <br /> I found this the movie had to be a total disappointment - the soundtrack of the music was trying to confer the magnificence described in the original, but it also did not result in giving the film the quality level of the original. The rich textures of the characters of the original were especially lacking in this film. I guess if you did not see the original, everything would be fine. Too many clich√©s and not enough depth for the characters. The humanity, the compassion and the three-dimensional characters of the original I missed.
