This movie was terrible. The acting was nil, but it's hard to tell if someone was playing well, because the writing was so bad. This is one of Johnny Depp's worst films. I strongly advise anyone to watch it. <br /> <br /> If you have to see Cry-Baby, I recommend you to mute it and just watch Michael Depp half.
