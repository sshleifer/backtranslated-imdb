I will not say too much, because this film is not worth it. To put it simply, the film is absolutely nil! This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The scenario was stupid, you could not follow what was happening, the characters were so annoying, especially the main character. I wanted someone to kill this kid and put it on stage, as well as the movie. <br /> <br /> Very, very badly.
