Dark Harvest is a very low-budget production produced by a group of high-level amateurs who manage to transform themselves into a kind of semi-professional film. Unfortunately, the mediocre effects, the wooden acting and the unpublished story make this horror film very mediocre, at best. Dark Harvest is by no means the worst horror movie I have ever seen, it's nothing special and has nothing to warrant a second watch or hope for a sequel. You know that a director has doubts about his own horror film when a) there is unnecessary nudity and b) the film is so short that they add rather boring excerpts to the end credits that nobody cares about really because the movie was not so good! A slightly better film that I can not help but think was the inspiration for Dark Harvest is the 80s film 'Scarecrows' which is an OK movie but still quite average. <br /> <br /> Dark Harvest is not as bad as some of the other reviews say, but do not think you'll be entertained much either. One thing I must also comment on is Angela's character who has a really terrible English accent! What was the purpose of this ?! Maybe give him a touch of class? Yes indeed! The English do NOT say "WAAHTAAH" when they mean "water" and I do not care about the region of England where they come from! If you can not find a real English actress or a non-English actress who can put a bright English accent (not many of them), DO NOT GIVE BERE! Sheesh! Final score: 4/10
