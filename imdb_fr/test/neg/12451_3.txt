It's an adaptation of a work by Edith Wharton, whose writing is incredible. Unfortunately, this film never questions the feeling that these 20th century moviegoers do not understand the 19th century repression and despair described in Wharton's work. Ward and Dalton are not that bad, but Alicia Witt's wooden performance made me wince. She was supposed to play the restless part of the story, but she held it all the way through the movie and I never thought a word from her mouth. When she asks Sela Ward, "Why can not I move?" Towards the end of the film, I could not help but answer: "That's what I had been wondering for an hour and a half !!!"
