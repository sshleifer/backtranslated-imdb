Another Day - this movie requires you to watch it another day to understand it. I really enjoy watching Shannen Doherty and I was very interested to see how Julian McMahon and Shannen came after the role they played in Charmed. I can certainly praise the acting skills throughout the film, even the staging - but the plot ... what happened? I am short of words because I am still confused. I have to stay true to the actors who really did a good job considering the madness of the plot. I must also recommend you to watch it because, despite the plot, I would watch it again and again.
