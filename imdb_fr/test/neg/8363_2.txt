I rarely see a movie with such a cast, a story as potentially strong and based on a hit book that has been so weak and, to some extent, unassailable ... <br /> <br /> The premise of a story reads like a Brent Easton Ellis novel - a lot of drugs, desperation and self-provoked tragedy while the young Elisabeth Wurtzel (played by Christina Ricci) tries to cope with the situation of suicidal loser, who does not seem to be able to accept the fact that she lives well She is fundamentally pathetic to be such a baby ... <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci does not only play a tragic character, she is also a tragic actor, whose sobs and shouts are almost always in the film. really makes you want to scream - kill yourself already and let us go to the credits ... The director is of no help, because it does not give the rhythm and the story is so disjointed that you do not have no idea what this damn girl actually has on. The director was apparently on Prozac when making this film imitation and so let the film go autopilot, which makes it an unbearable mess. <br /> <br /> The only characteristics that are exchanged are a nice Jason Biggs, Wurtzel's boyfriend (who happily decided to get rid of egocentric egocentric self-indulgent selfishness) and an incredibly good Jessica Lange as a mother of crying babies. Lange can not seem to be crushed by a terrible scenario, a direction and terrible co-actors. Pure class. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it's really who Wurtzel was or was, but the film managed to make me totally indifferent to his writings. <br /> <br /> In the end I finished watching this movie and I immediately started to think: OK. It's time to look at something, it's actually real problems ...
