I love this show. I watched all the episodes of last year. I bought the DVDs. And I'm watching to watch tonight and I see for some reason that you've reorganized this big show. And you took what made it work and ruined it. You won one of the best aspects of the show: the 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I also like other characters, but they are good in sleepy little girls like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It is as if the series had lost part of its family and everyone was trying to fill the gap. It's an overdose. Although things are fun in small slumber, when you are exposed to it all the time, it goes from funny to annoying. I could not wait for the return of this show. So please bring back the charm. Even if you can not integrate Piper into the series, bring Lizzy back at least. But I liked these girls. They brought pleasure. The show talked about Sam trying to live his professional life and manage his personal life and his friends. It was the charm. And that big dog too. <br /> <br /> I hope that the network (FOX) forced the scriptwriters to do it and that the writers did not do it voluntarily to the show. I'll give the series a few more episodes before giving up, but tonight's episodes were bad. I was coming back tonight with a big deal, I had people and I felt like a fool, because no one was laughing except two or three times. I apologized to them and told them that I did not know what had happened. And about 10 minutes after the beginning of the episode, I realized that they were not going to show Piper or Lizzy and that it was no longer a TV comedy not to be missed.
