A rather lame adolescent slasher from Brisbane. Although the plot is based on a pretty decent idea, the writing is deeply lame and two of the top three teenagers are absurdly wooden. The problem is that for children to realize their plan, they have to be a lot more reckless than what is shown, but if they were so devilish, it might be hard for them to be nice, so they end up being neither really. In fact, I only began to enjoy the film when I began to wish them dead. One of those movies where, in about a thousand places, the wisest option would be to call the police. I realize we would not have a movie if they did, but it would be nice if we could believe they would not do it. To avoid.
