This is one of the least original and clear films I have ever seen. Even if you did not like the background of this movie, "The Bad News Bears" and "The Mighty Ducks", they will surely have done a better job than this one. As soon as the new teacher welcomes her class and says, "Do not bother with us, we are all losers", you can see everything that is twenty kilometers away from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the usual suspects are here. Besides the spunky teacher, we have a group of what are supposed to be naughty and noisy kids (yes, but not so endearing), a slow-minded, slow-moving sheriff they love to torment, a head coach arrogant rival winning team, etc., ad nauseum. Only Olivia d'Abo, as a new teacher, displays probability. I have never cared much about Steve Guttenberg before and his performance as sheriff does not change anything. Jay O. Sanders is a capable actor, but his character, the rival coach, leaves him nothing to work. Let's hope that screenwriter and director Holly Goldberg Sloan offers something better next time.
