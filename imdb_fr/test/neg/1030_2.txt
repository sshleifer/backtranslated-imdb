it seems like if you're going to post here, it's going to be a 10-star rating, no one ever seems to hate anything, well I'm honest, some people do not like that, but let's go, the rachel ray show is just awful. !!!!!!, this show reminds me of linda's character, no matter if she had a kitchen -any show. i have to say i loved rachel on the food network at $ 35- $ 40 per day but I'm sorry she has enough experience of life to make it interesting day after day, give me ham in the street, Anthony Bourdain, interesting people, but especially I find it annoying, she even told a member of the studio audience to "shut up" yes in a fun way but you shut up, and who cares about her pet stories, sorry Rachel you were canceled !!!!
