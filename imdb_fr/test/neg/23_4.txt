When people say that kids are annoying, I think my little cousins ​​can be boring and I told them LITTLE. These kids are 10 years old and are without a doubt the most boring kids you'll ever meet (in a movie). Let's start with the blonde - Debbie - She's a girl slut, finally, she's wearing mini-skirts, she has frizzy blonde hair and a red bunny like face. She acts so innocent. Then we have the second child - the Geek - who thinks he's too cool, with his long-range shot and his use of a muffler (a coat on the gun) and especially his mischievous smile. The next child is the one who does not interest you, so that's all for him. This film made me angry at the intelligence of the children and the only pleasure I had was from my cousin who was constantly complaining about them.
