... So, some people might say that this can not be the worst movie ever, and no, that's not the case. I've seen movies with weaker intrigues, worse acting, and so on. <br /> <br /> So, why do I hate this movie Ã¼ber alles? Well, it's basically a man who's kidnapped for many years, and when he shows up, he tries to figure out who did it and why, to get revenge. The problem I have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror, but <br /> <br /> *** THE GREAT SPOILERS STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW *** <br /> > <br /> Our main character is led to have sex with his own daughter and he wants to cut his tongue so that his enemy does not tell him because she did not know it. It's so humiliating that he kneels like a dog in full submission. And why did he deserve that? Because many years ago, he saw a brother and a sister give themselves a tender moment - in the wrong way. He continued and told some people, and as a result, she committed suicide. And viola, it's the brother who put our main character in all this, just for that. I wondered: maybe I hate this movie so much because I think his punishment is too severe. Maybe because I feel that this film does not condemn incest, but confuses it with love. Maybe it's because I was waiting for something else. <br /> <br /> *** END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Believe me, nobody deserves what happens to our main character at the end, and I am very serious; you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there? Well, I felt completely dirty after watching this movie, and I really wish I had never seen it. That's been with me for days, and some people might be wondering, well, is not that the purpose of a good movie? The ability to affect us in this way? Yes, that may be the case, but this film did not only make me sick, it made me feel that I am being raped.
