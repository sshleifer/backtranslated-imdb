This film has a really strange mix of genres - toilet humor and action in one. It does not really succeed - it should have stayed in a genre. The best thing I can say about the movie is that the dog in it is cute. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the film when Moses (Sandler) and Carter (Wayans) decide to stop at a hunting lodge / motel. I am not entirely sure of the interest of this sequence, it seems simply gratuitous to the extreme. The owner of the hunting lodge ("Charlie") is a very nerdy guy. For some reason, Moses starts a conversation with Charlie about porn, wanking, homosexual sex, trio sex ... Charlie's picture of his "wife" seems to be Charlie dressed in drag. There is no reason for this truly youthful dialogue and scene. Be that as it may, the whole scene seems to be headed towards the moment a naked Moses finds himself with Carter's rifle on his back and Charlie sees them through the window. Everyone smells humorous about homosexuality - horrified and titillated at the same time - that I do not find funny at all. <br /> <br /> I have a friend who loves Adam Sandler's films. This is the first I've seen - after that, I'm not sure I want to see more. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is my husband's story - he saw Happy Gilmore and he tells me it's pretty good - maybe I should give Sandler one last chance. <br /> <br /> Countess Skogg
