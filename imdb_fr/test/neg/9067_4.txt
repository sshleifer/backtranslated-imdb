Is there anything else on earth that is more attractive than learning what awaits our fragile bodies after death? The Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (a companion of soul of his German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) gives a perfect answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables, scalpels, surgical saws, bowels human and twisted minds. . <br /> <br /> Welcome to the autopsy room! <br /> <br /> I do not know what are the facets of the film, apart from its notorious reputation, that may have helped it to get a high enough ranking. <br /> <br /> At the story level, it's pretty simple and straightforward - a day in the life (actually a half-hour) of a coroner (or maybe even a pathologist assistant or whoever is fed up with his usual morbid routine carries out his psychological tension in a non-traditional way, directly at his place of work. I am puzzled as to the particular message that the authors attempted to convey with this plot of a note. I guess it could be inspired by the original attitude of Udo Kier's character in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​of the film are also debatable. It is difficult to evaluate the performance of actors who do not press a single word. Their emotions are hidden behind the medical masks. There is also not enough room for a good camera job - basically, all the action takes place mainly between four walls. <br /> <br /> Authenticity - the effects and makeup are impressive and the configuration seems very plausible, but only a handful of medical care / Forensic experts can judge the veracity and the anatomical correction of the dissection (if we care) Honestly, I thought the purpose of the autopsy was to look at the condition of certain organs and determine the cause of death. Now, I know that corpses are separated, raped and humiliated, that the intestines are torn apart, that the brains are recovered from the head, driven into the abdomen and mixed with guts, and that the body is sewn back and washed - nothing personal. And what are these poor boys supposed to write in their misleading autopsy reports? <br /> <br /> Factor of shock and disgust: it is very unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer will discover, to his horror, that the disc he was destined to watch with his wife and children beside a Christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual on vivisection. This obscure article is hardly available, sought by people who know the subject well and hardly offended. It would be useless to ask anyone to sabotage this film. They know exactly what they are looking at and what they want to see. <br /> <br /> Cerdà is a truly talented and stylish director, which is clear from at least two other parts of his previous "trilogy". The Awakening ', an incredible short film in black and white and a 30-minute Genesis, a visually stunning and sullen piece with a quirky and interesting concept. And I'm sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new material, more oriented to the general public. And sooner or later, "the after effects" would become a rarity for meticulous collectors of his "early" "warm-up" works. <br /> <br /> But in the meantime, I'm afraid this is strictly recommended for medical students or specialists who study mental disorders and sexual deviations.
