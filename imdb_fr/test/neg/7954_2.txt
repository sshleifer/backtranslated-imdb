Scream Baby Scream is supposed to make sure I do not feel foolish about buying it? I bought it because, god help me, I'm an idiot of the old cinema B, even worthless. Nevertheless, something about this film irritates me, it's probably Janet, Janet seems cold and arrogant, apparently, with the intention of becoming as noble and deep, with a look on her face that screams of constipation, she does not seem to agree with everything her tense boyfriend wants. I'm glad it's his only role. What really irritates me is that it's a gore movie of the 1960s that went terribly wrong and, as we all know, the dreadful is Floridian for "zero gore". It's as if the director had started with a style of Herschell Lewis but had withdrawn from the gore scene when his wife had discovered it. So we ended up with a boring conversation after another, and basically a lot of irritants. In other words, we end up with Florida Bore. Joseph Adler should be embarrassed. Janets's boyfriend, Jason is almost as ridiculous as he is, this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything, to think about it, it's probably the worst kind of horror story . The only thing that really matters in this film is that it carries that B-gore vibe of the '60s and' early '70s that you can find in stuff like Undertaker & his pals, Blood Freak, or almost with Herschell Lewis. Even Rodney of the Twosome Gruesome is in this situation, I thought his caveman comedy routine was irritating, most things from one reel to another are stupid, even the trip scene was stupid. The only good thing is the small amount of beach scenery, but that includes Janet's complaints that life is not perfect. Scream Baby Scream becomes even less interesting once the story begins, at around 45 minutes. If you are indifferent to the fact that your entertainment is watchable or not, but you are offended by the color red, you may not hate it. Why is Troma distributing this? Is not this the domain of something weird? Scream Baby Scream is perhaps Florida's worst episode in horror, but I guess the potential is beneath the unimaginable characters and the incoherent plot. Scream, Baby, Scream really seems to have to follow the pattern of the Blood Feast, so to steal a quote from Janet, "If it does not suit you, I throw it in the trash". 2/10
