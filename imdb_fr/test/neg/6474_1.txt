The remake of the Disney studios of their own slapstick of 1965 concerns a clever feline leading a F.B.I. agent to an abducted woman. Christina Ricci gives a disgusting performance and lets me out here as the owner of the cat and the nurtured is played by Doug E. Doug, embarrassing to the extreme, like a human cartoon. A pair of rich neurotic (Dyan Cannon and Dean Jones, member of the original cast of "Cat") are fun and the scenario-formula still has some juice, but the manipulation here is so cumbersome and lugubrious, and the cat is lifeless, that it's strictly DOA <br /> <br /> * from ****
