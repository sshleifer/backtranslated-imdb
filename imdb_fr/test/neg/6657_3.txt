This plot had more holes than an OJ Simpson alibi! <br /> <br /> I noticed two references to Star Trek in the movie and, ironically, <br /> <br /> we have a main character played by Andy Garcia <br /> > which is the antithesis of the Vulcan philosophy of "The needs of the majority outweigh those of some or one". <br /> <br /> Let's just say that trying to save his son from cancer poses an incredible risk to the rest of San Francisco. The character of Michael Keaton is also almost unrealistic. He neglects to kill on many occasions and is angry when Garcia foils his attempt <br /> <br /> to kill a group of cops at a time. The child's doctor remains in charge of his / her faculties even after being <br /> <br /> repeatedly held hostage for a short time, but <br /> <br /> installs him / her on a large scale. 5 story walkway and she loses it. <br /> <br /> The child of Andy Garcia is anathema in this film <br /> <br />. He is the most sympathetic and real character, one of the highlights of the film. It also states a line, which must have been the result of chance, with regard to the fight against cancer and which corresponds to Keaton's motivation to escape. Overall, the film was not a complete waste (see Dusk to Dawn 2: Texan blood money <br /> <br />), but disappointing given the talent he had.
