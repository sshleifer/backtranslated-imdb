Movie Review Heart of Darkness Can a book known for its eloquent formulation and complex concepts be transformed into a film worthy enough to describe the book's deep meaning? So far, this goal has not been achieved. We tried to turn the heart of darkness into a film in 1993, but it was a failure compared to the book. <br /> <br /> It's hard enough to turn a book into a movie. There is always the worry of not being as descriptive or having the same meaning. So why the novel, The Heart of Darkness, is turned into a movie, I'm clueless. There are so many descriptions and meanings hidden throughout the book. Reading the words clearly, I think a person would think it's pretty boring and would not get the symbolism. I think that's what happened in the film. the film only scratched the surface. <br /> <br /> The film did not follow the full story of the book. Major changes have been made which, in my opinion, have aggravated the film. For example, the director did not accompany Marlow and the rest of the crew on the boat, but the spy did. I think this has eliminated some major intrigues and the manager's big disappointment with Kurtz. In addition, Kurtz was not even on the steamboat when he died, making the whole trip even more futile, which became boring after a while. And when Marlow told Kurtz's fiancée his last moments and last words, it was not as descriptive or important as that, the fiancée had not even been angry. <br /> <br /> actors did a very good job, with the exception of the actor who played Mfumu. In my opinion, Kurtz was not very mean and it was sort of an important thing in the book. In addition, other characters such as Marlow, the director and the fiancé did not do justice to the characters they deserved from the book. Their game was not very exciting or memorable. Overall, I do not think this book should have even been tempted to become a movie. I think it's good to use some of the themes in a different story as in Apocalypse Now. But to follow the same story of the book is shameful.
