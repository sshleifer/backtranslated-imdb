The gargoyle begins late at night in Romania 1532 while a peasant woman (Daniela Nane) travels in her coach to take care of her business when, under the clouds lit by the moon, above a living gargoyle she manages to escape from the gargoyle. & arrives at a castle of any description where an angry crowd of villagers and a priest are able to end the Gargoyle, or at least they think so ... Bucharest where two CIA agents, Ty Griffin (Michael Pare) & Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are on the verge of negotiating the safe return of the son of a wealthy US ambassador from his captors. In pursuit of one of the kidnappers, Griffin loses him on the roof of a building but finds a large pool of blood and no visible sign of what happened to him. Meanwhile, Dr. Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) and her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) renovate a church when Gregor (Mihai Bisericanu) church worker informs Richard that he has found an ancient relic. Both investigate and find a cave with many sticky cocoons and a very angry and very lively gargoyle who does not waste time killing them both. Griffin & Wells are on the case when they are missing and soon realize that the local legends of monstrous gargoyles are true with a local priest named Father Soren (Fintan McKeown) planning to flood the world with them ... <br /> > <br /> Co-written, co-produced and directed by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym, Jay Andrews Gargoyles is another masterpiece that Wynorski can add to his credits, no. The scenario of Wynorski, Ion Ionescu, A.G. Lawrence and Bill Munroe is shit, is uninteresting, dull and as simplistic as possible. To begin, I would like to know if there is only one gargoyle who has laid all these eggs, because I am almost certain that it could not have been pregnant. How did he survive in this hole for 500 years? What did he eat? How did the priest know he was here? Why did not anyone else ever understand him? Why did the priest want to flood the world with them? To govern it? The Gargoyles will barely conquer the world and then let a priest rule him like a king and if they did, what would he leave? Just like the guys who wrote Gargoyle, I do not think he stayed there, did he? No matter how many times I try to make up the circle, gargoyles simply do not make sense and their story has huge holes in the plot, lacks logic and it's not great to start from anyway. The characters are sad and clich√©s, the action repetitive and not exciting while the film as a whole is a real trouble. People do illogical things and everything that happens is convenient, for example when the priest tries to convince Griffin that Gargoyle exists and that one of them suddenly appears and attacks them. The cave full of cocoons is such an alien scam (1986) that it is embarrassing and that the end was lame. The piece on the ferris wheel at the fair was funny when the guy made fun of the fear of heights and forced him to climb on it. <br /> <br /> Director Wynorski reduces costs and steals footage from other films, In reality, Gargoyle's best scene is a car chase through Bucharest, but it's taken from the action movie by Jean-Claude Van Damme, Maximum Risk (1996). There are no shocks, frights or atmosphere. The special effects are terrible. The CGI Gargoyle looks like a computer game and does not interact very much with all the actors of the distribution. Many scenes show people looking up at the sky and trying to appear marked. There is not even an interesting gore to watch, there is a horrible decapitation and that's it. <br /> <br /> Technically, the special effects are awful, but otherwise it is passable, the Romanian places look Romanian. Gargoyle went straight to the video and it shows with a pretty cheap look and feel. Comedy does not do much, the victim of bypassing the personality, Michael Pare, is the dullest and dullest hero. <br /> <br /> Gargoyle is a crappy movie, it fails everything a decent creature should strive to achieve. A total loss of 90 minutes for me, to avoid.
