This is not the best of the Lone Star series, but it is moving fast with good performance. <br /> <br /> Introduced under the name of "Singin 'Sandy" in the main title, John Wayne as a "singing cowboy" has no success - you never see it in close-up before. The current singer is the son of director Bill Bradley, who seems to sound like many popular singers of the day such as Hutch or Joseph Wagstaff. <br /> <br /> The film features: Cecilia Parker (also in the series "The Lost Jungle", "Tombstone Canyon" and as Marian's older sister in Andy Hardy's movies) doing her best Katherine Hepburn-- "Really they do not have to, I really am not"; Al St. John, before becoming literally "Fuzzy", taking all of his available time on the screen with his characteristic activity of tipping his hat, scratching his head and chin, grimacing and gesturing and disgusting physical movements; George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as a father who gently smokes the pipe; and Forrest Taylor, veterinarian minor of 395 films and TV shows, plays the oily villain with a bow tie and a cigar. <br /> <br /> Fun or strange moments: the grand tour of Yakima Canutt's stable; the 'gay' scene where Singin 'Sandy links Bert and Elmer face to face, drags them to his horse and throws them to Kincaid's office, where Kincaid says, "You're a good pair of love birds!"; Denton's enthusiastic comment after an excruciating song and guitar playing performed by 'Sandy' - 'Ummm. I could listen to it all night! '; Kincaid's answer, we will not get into that, "after a farmer told him," You have the soul of a snake! And, of course, he pronounces the immortal, "I made an offer to Denton I can not refuse. "<br /> <br /> The plot of the film is saved by Kincaid, a seducer of Sandy, and later he says the three magic words of many of these films:" I come from Washington. "FDR has saved us since the Depression!" (That's why villains are still bankers or realtors?) <br /> <br /> The shootout sequence is from Bradbury's previous film "Man from Hell's Edges" (1932), Lone Star westerns are special because of their unique mix of interesting characters, the cast of actors and stuntmen, and the turn of shots and stories and situations repetitive: it is a little low, spoiled by the "Cowboy singing Gimmick" used. I will give him a 4.
