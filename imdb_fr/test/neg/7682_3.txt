Sorry, I love Ray Bolger's work, but his only thing is a prominent man. Maybe if you claim he's the last man on earth, this romantic plot may work, but go now! <br /> <br /> Here is a film that exists simply to present the title song that was a great success for the band Basie the year before (1951). And some pretty songs and dances that make it a total disaster. <br /> <br /> However, the story is pathetic, even by the standards of the 1952 musical. And the other songs are just as memorable as the Evening In Paris cologne. The dialogue embarrasses the stars, Day & Bolger. Only the charms Boyeresque Claude Dauphin keep his character in three dimensions. <br /> <br /> So, how to enjoy this film on video? <br /> <br /> A.) Fast forward in all dialogues ... <br /> <br /> B.) Indulge in Doris Day's voice and Ray Bolger's relaxed footwork. And do not miss the hilarious film of Dauphin on a cover of "April In Paris" soaked in rain and swept by the wind ... C.) Finally, keep some bottles of Cabernet fresh and at hand. <Bob Raymond
