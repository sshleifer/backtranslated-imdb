It was one of the blandest movies I've seen in a while. I'm in my late forties and I watched it with my son-in-law (in my early 20s) and my son (17). The scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. We watched for about an hour and turned it off. I spent more time on my iphone during the time we watched it than watching the movie. I gave it a 3 because I enjoyed the landscape and cinematography; otherwise, I would have given a 1. I'm sure there are some people who are really in the "art" of all that will find my criticism appalling but we are all entitled to our own opinions, right? I could not tell if it was a mother-focused "girls movie" or a boys-oriented, fight-and-adventure movie. In my opinion, that did not succeed either.
