Pacino, and Maconadump have really hit the mark with this stinker. I swear I am a movie enthusiast and a fan. I have been a fan of most people in this abortion at one time or another. Until now. The hogwash of the story The actor's hogwash (Ren√© Ruso's League was good) The spunk of the plot The trash can of the plot The teenager tries to relate to the junk food The meeting of the high school Michelle twice a day for seven days is my punishment for not turning this colostomy bag after 10 minutes. I went out of town for a seminar and this stack of mung cost me $ 9.99 and 2 hours. I was deceived. This director should be in prison for fraud. <br /> <br /> Bring me with you if you have other questions. I'm always right.
