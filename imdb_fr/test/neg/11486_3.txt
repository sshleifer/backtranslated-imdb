Throughout the history of cinema, some films have disappointed the viewer, such as "hassle" of hitchcock, "abre los ojos" Alejandro amen√°bar, "the game" David Fincher and "ausentes" ("absent" "). For starters, I do not like this kind of movies, I feel like someone is trying to pull my leg. <br /> <br /> moreover, after seeing this film, we do not know what happened. confusing film. kubrick "the shining" is perhaps a better or a worse movie, but it is certainly more honest than this load of pretentious and dubious situations. <br /> <br /> technically, it's good - nice photography, fair performance, etc., but the scenario is so mediocre that I wonder what the producers have seen to continue and turn that shit. <br /> <br /> and this movie points out that the 3 characters who wrote the screenplay (calparsoro, loriga and quiroga) are lost in the movies trying to make a masterpiece - or trying to do something to satisfy their stomach, waiting for more personal projects.
