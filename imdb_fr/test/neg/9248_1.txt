... or should I say involuntarily hilarious? Anyway, it's one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. I always laugh at the antics of some of the most stupid fictional characters on this side of Homer Simpson. It's just a painfully stupid scene, a frontal slap, while clownish cardboard cutouts with a dark spirit replace the actual humanoid characters to push, pull and pull the "plot" to its inevitable and obvious conclusion. > If I had to describe this film to someone, I would call it a mutated hybrid of Fatal Attraction, Dumb and Dumber and the Three Stooges, with a "climax" strangely similar to the Family Guy episode in which the whole family fight in the living room. <br /> <br /> Advice to the Benson family: When you next visit a new pet, give it a favor and do not name it Fred!
