It's a polarizing film. People like it or despise it, it seems. I despise him. The film comes from the same background as Lindsay Anderson's Oh Lucky Man, but if it's a masterpiece, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> Both films are inspired by Kafka - America 's unfinished novel for their inspiration and general purpose. America is a surreal story of a young man's journey across the country. Kafka uses the character as a pure observer, one who does not change during the trip (although the book is about 300 pages long and does not seem to be finished yet on a quarter, so we'll never know it). Allow Kafka to focus and comment on absurd / surreal situations and environments. Oh Lucky Man follows this same pattern to show Britain through the eyes of Malcolm McDowell and Weekend does the same for France. <br /> <br /> The two films are also very Brechtian, using various tips and techniques to emphasize the fact that It's not real, it's confusion, etc. But the difference comes from the fact that Oh Lucky Man uses the film built to express the absurdity of life and the class system, Weekend uses the film built to crush us to death with an ideological controversy. As Godard goes further than Anderson in his Brechtian principles, we end up with two main characters in which we have no investment. We have to spend 90 minutes with them, but we do not care. Deliberately. In doing so, Godard leaves us a film that deals entirely with his own message, which, in the first half of the film, is presented by an implacable and domineering symbolism, and in the second half by a series of long speeches directed towards the camera. . Combined with unpleasant and useless scenes such as the really horrible pig slaughter, far worse than all the off-camera violence of car accidents. <br /> <br /> The end result is as listening to a buzzing student political apparatchik continues to talk about his views while kicking you in the head so that you receive the message. The problem with Brecht is that if you alienate the audience too much, you get rid of what you are trying to convey. Which has always seemed obvious to me. <br /> <br /> What really contrasts between this movie is the contrast between the highly sexually explicit verbal description of the original three-shot and off-screen. A rape in the center that, although it can be considered allegorical, completely destroys the faith of the film itself and its characters, the little that existed at the beginning. It's so French with a capital F that it hurts. <br /> <br /> Observe Oh Lucky Man instead. It's a work of genius. The weekend is a pretentious job. <br /> <br /> Two stars, reserved for bottling scenes and piano, which are only allusions to genius, even if they make the end result even more frustrating and unsatisfactory, it's a bad movie the worst pretentious filmmaker in the world, with them, well, it's obvious that he's a good technical director who makes the most intellectually pretentious film in the world. In a way it is much worse.
