It is difficult to decide who or who the target audience of this film is. Jean-Pierre Limousin probably had the opportunity to seriously explore the problems of amnesia and instead chose to use it as an excuse to make a porn movie soft. After seeing, loved, admired and respected Remembering the beautiful things that explores the loss of memory - although it is the result of Alzheimer's disease - in a heartbreaking and heartbreaking way, especially in Isabelle's luminous performance Square, I think Novo is an insult to His memories. I have no problem with soft porn as such - and even if I had it, I would practically have to give up going to the movies so prevalent today - but I have a problem with the writers / directors who try to respect it by hiding it as here under the guise of medical research. What's sad is that nice actresses like Julie Gayet - so wonderful in Clara and Me - and Anna Mouglalis - who seems to have played a double game after last week's Deluge and now - are wasting their time like that.
