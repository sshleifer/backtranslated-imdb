Imagine a GILLIGAN'S island located in the African desert in modern times. Add to that people as fanciful as Skipper or Marianne - and enough anxiety to occupy a place in a German psychiatrist. Immerse yourself in an intrigue that is of interest only in an episodic and literary parallelism that never allows one to dive deep enough to truly satisfy Season with a really morose subject that has been exploited since the world's first travelers found themselves very, very lost. <br /> <br /> If the king is alive are not a product of the tsars of the day of Dogma 95, would this film attract as much attention? Dogme 95 is in Hollywood as modern danish is rococo. As a by-product of digital technology, this Scandinavian movement seeks - quite dogmatically - to eliminate the artificial in the making of a film, by using more natural elements and returning to the essence of the story. PEARL HARBOR, for example, is the Antichrist Dogma. <br /> <br /> The saga of director / co-writer Kristian Levring questions interpersonal relationships and human nature in the heat of his life. Eleven people on a bus crossing the Namibian sand dunes suddenly find themselves trapped in the remains of an abandoned city. An African local who does not speak their language serves as an observer and narrator (whose ideas are among the most incisive of the film). While the strongest leave for a five-day walk to the nearest village, the rest stay there, surviving on bumpy canned carrots and surrounding their likely future as vulture chow. Former spy Henry believes that this unattractive crew requires a diversion and writes KING LEAR memory. He assigns roles and the group spends several days learning and rehearsing, to divert their attention from what seems inevitable. <br /> <br /> Little by little, the actors start to lose it, as well as the savages of their nature? "Or, will say William Golding, human nature" begins to surface. If you have ever seen LORD OF THE FLIES, you know that these things can become ugly, that being in a lifeboat can transform even Mother Teresa into the PMSing spraying Calcutta. <br /> <br /> The film was shot by appealing to an international group of American, English, French and South African actors who, as the dogma of dogmas wants, develop themselves and develop their ideas. roles in a very organic way. THE KING was also filmed chronologically, adding realism to the growing desperation of his characters. After taking three digital cameras, the results were transferred to 35mm format. <br /> <br /> The most important performance comes from Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays a Boho Pop Tart to reinforce the spirit of the group in every possible way. Henry (David Bradley) is another very well-played character, whose passion for the work of his life ultimately saves the gang from total despair. It's hard to feel sorry for others? Cruel wives and their husbands out of the ordinary, elderly women who make hirsute, French intellectual sulky, wealthy men who have other places more important than the Namib desert. Beckett might hate this question, but why does this group get on a bus through far-away Africa in the first place? Life-threatening morbidity! Total despair rendered in the graphic details! A relentless pace and tedious! Enjoy.
