I had the misfortune to watch this film at the Sitges Festival last month. If there was a possibility of "not filming" a movie to avoid its existence, it should be first on the list. María Lidón is not a director, she's just a silly woman who claims that holding a camera with her hand and shouting "action" makes her a professional filmmaker. What an error! The film itself is useless and represents a total mess of good actors who could do better in another project. Val Kilmer just puts his face in front of the camera. His character has no specific weight in the film. The same can be said of Joss Ackland, Vincent Gallo or Joaquim De Almeida. It's a pity that the character of Rade Serbedzija was written. WARNING SPOILERS <br /> <br /> He spends most of his time alone in tunnels talking to himself on the way (now I'm doing that, now I'm running out of bats, I'm going to look in my bag, now I turn left, now I turn right ...) only to bring to the public a clear idea of ​​his actions. It is simply absurd and proves the lack of talent of the director. END OF THE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The usual joke about this rubbish among the audience was that the title of the film itself brought the slightest idea of ​​the note that everyone should give him: ZERO
