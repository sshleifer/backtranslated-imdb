BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror movie supposedly based on real events from 1817 to 1821. <br /> <br /> Not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE star Betsy Palmer based on the same events. However, I can say that I would have liked to see this other movie rather than the one I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's frightening performance on Friday the 13th. As such, I believe that even on a bad day, she would get a better performance than anyone involved in the tragedy known as THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> Regarding my title, this film is not painful. to watch because the content is disturbing. It's painful to watch because it's downright boring. <br /> <br /> Reading the positive reviews of this film, I could only identify three possibilities. The first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in a certain way. The second possibility - the authors, although not directly involved, were paid to write positive reviews once the production was over. The last possibility - none of these authors has seen enough horror movies and therefore has no knowledge of the concepts used by successful attempts. <br /> <br /> The storyline of the plot is located in Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston is visited by two journalists eager to hear the story of the witch Bell. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events begin to occur in John Bell and his family. It soon appears that an avenging spirit is behind all this. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the plot seems to be a standard poltergeist affair, even if it is based on real events. <br /> <br /> Where the execution However, just about anything that could go wrong goes wrong. And then some! <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting game. The acting is almost uniformly terrible in all areas. This factor is the most damaging to production, undermining any possible credibility of the viewer's belief or interest. The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenager prey to teenage angst than a powerful demonic force expressing malicious intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of his lines. Unfortunately, this voice started to become very annoying very quickly! I may not have been alive in the nineteenth century, but I find it incredibly difficult to believe that a young woman living at that time would speak like this "ghost"! <br /> <br /> Second, the direction. The direction is hazardous and very uneven. Some scenes are promising, but the director, clearly inexperienced, loses all his potential. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to scary scenes. The atmosphere is also flat. An avenging spirit is supposed to be at the origin of supernatural occurrences. Yet, the effects are so incredibly unacceptable that those who saw a horror movie would not accept it. I will give an example. In a scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost. <br /> <br /> Third, the script. While it is possible that the events presented are true stories of real events, it is undeniable that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes seem much longer because of a mediocre dialogue, a dialogue that does not bring depth to the characters or the story. This film relies far too much on conversations to advance the story. If this style was also the case of British films of the British horror of the 1960s and 1970s, it is undeniable that dialogue exchanges have always been interesting to look at in these earlier, more professional works. Peter Cushing could for example read a phone book while keeping the attention of viewers. The same can not be said of THE HAUNT's actors. <br /> <br /> Finally, humor. The ill-guided humor attempts in this film are atrocious. An obese boy is the target of many jokes. A particularly frightful scene sees the boy walking towards the outer toilet. This scene should never have been included - but it's complete and has sound effects in case you do not understand what it's doing! <br /> <br /> The only positives of the film are the venue and the costumes. The decision to take the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen. <br /> <br /> Overall, THE HAUNT is a terrible movie. It's not even in the league "So bad, it's good". It's rather boring. I advise everyone to save money and avoid this film like the plague. Do not even bother to see him for free! <br /> <br /> I have never seen the other movie about the Bell witch. But that could not be worse than THE HAUNT. Could it? I will give this other film a chance if I can find it. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I would advise everyone here to watch horror movies about ghosts and obsession. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.
