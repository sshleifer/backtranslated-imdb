Think Jumanji but with a curse of death. A group of surfers gets their hands on a game that takes the life of someone who plays it. Supposedly, it was made from the skin of a witch during the Spanish Inquisition and carries a nasty curse. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's not something you've never seen before. It's really nothing like it. It's really a story that has been launched that has allowed this story to hit every button with real surprises. Far from the worst thing that SyFy ran but it's certainly not the best. There are better choices, but if it's your only choice, you will not hate it completely.
