This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. It's been a long time since I've seen it, but the jokes are NOT funny, the plot is painful to guess, call the main characters stupid, it's greatly improve their intelligence ... yuck! I just wanted to hit Tom Arnold and make him cry because he lost two hours of my life when I'd finished watching that cinematic dirt. I do not even know why I always wanted to watch this movie, but remember if you see this movie: DO NOT SAY I did not warn you. <br /> <br /> PS character Tom Arnold sings a song in this movie film titled "I'm my own grandfather." Said Nuff.
