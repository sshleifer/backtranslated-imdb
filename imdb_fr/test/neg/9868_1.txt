Without a doubt, it's the worst comicbook movie ever made. PERIOD!! Yes, it's worse than Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (1989). Yeah .. worse than the 1979 and 1991 Captain America movies. Oh yes, it's even worse when Christopher Reed wrote the screenplay for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. Sheeshh .. this movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man only played in another movie and it was on T.V. = oP <br /> <br /> This movie is of "D" quality. I had the opportunity to watch it on the SciFi channel in 1997. I had heard that it was bad enough, but I had nothing else to do that night, so I decided to verify. What a loss of an hour and a half. I would have done better to watch reruns of Different Strokes. In addition to having the most unhealthy special effects and the worst acting I've ever seen, the entire storyline was horrible and not at all well directed. Fortunately, a NEW Fantastic Four movie is in progress and hope that this version will do justice to the heroes. I was hoping for a new SPAWN movie in the future, but it has not materialized yet. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this movie. If you see it is televised on a cable, take a look at it. Be warned however, you will most want to change channels after the first 15 minutes.
