Normally I would say that I loved this movie. Not to play, although it was OK. Not for the script, which was average, the reason I would normally love this movie is for the intense action that start from the beginning go and do not finish before the end of the credits but the problem with this movie, and I felt that it was a big problem, was the horrible computer image CGI.it shots. most effects seem to be in their most brutal form. As it is obvious that they did not have enough money to finish the film, they should not have published it. found the insulting effects.It seems obvious that they do not have do not worry about making a decent final product for the consumer.If that was not for that, I would give this movie a much higher score. My vote for Air Panic is a 3/10
