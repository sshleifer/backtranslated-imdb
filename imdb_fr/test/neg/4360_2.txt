It does not say much. This Killjoy movie has better cinematography and is more professional than the last one. That does not mean it's more professional. This last horrible film talked about gangsters killing a child and then haunted by a voodoo clown. I thought the guy who was playing Killjoy in the last was a bad actor, but wow !!! This Killjoy is honestly the worst actor I've ever seen in a movie, and I've seen a lot of movies. The last movie of the clown arrived in about 15 minutes, it is shorter and the clown does not even arrive before 40 minutes, and its duration is only 65 minutes! I give it a 2 because the game of some characters is OK.
