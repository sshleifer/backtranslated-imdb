The good points: it's pretty good. A few interesting peripheral characters. Main character sympathetic (although weak). <br /> <br /> The bad: Intrigue / story. Edition. Lost characters. Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of shabby movies, but this movie is really bad. I do not understand how anyone can give $ 12 million to this guy Jenkin. And before I go any further, I just want to say that I do not hate Jessica Alba - I really wanted to love her in this movie. However, Jessica Alba in her false accent and style made me miserable. She has absolutely no presence on the screen in this film and ruins all the scenes in which she is. Needless to say, romance is not as credible (not even a little bit). <br /> <br /> The actors were flapping their wings trying to get this thing off the ground with the little they had been given - but unfortunately, all the film does is to sink. There is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict and nothing is won. It's a nice empty film.
