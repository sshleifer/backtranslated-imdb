Has a university actor class exercise been filmed and broadcast as a film? The formal posture and stylized replica of a "horror" soap opera for people who do not like horror movies but want to be able to tell their friends that they have actually seen a horror movie. It even contains soap opera music. <br /> <br /> Do books falling from shelves in a library scare you? Do closing doors terrify you? So this movie is for you. Have you ever been kidnapped? Yes, most of us have. When you were raped, was it just ignored, because the rapist was the cool kid? What is scary is not this film, but the worldview of this filmmaker. <br /> <br /> And then the little twists are not even original. This is a movie for people who have never seen a horror movie before, who do not want to see one now and want to see another movie showing that everyone is conspiring against this weird child.
