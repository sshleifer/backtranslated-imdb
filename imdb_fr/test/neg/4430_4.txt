This derisory adaptation hurts me through the intrigue of Dickens' wonderful book, replacing the emotional impact with precipitous transitions and any outside location with drawings. It's not the fault of the actors and the production team if the budget is so low, of course, but we have to wonder about how to do it in the first place when there is no time nor the money to do it justice. Michael Hordern's Scrooge is way too nice at first, making his transformation less powerful, and the lack of reaction from him does not dissuade him from looking at the visions. Other actors range from the acceptable (Clive Merrison, Paul Copley) to abstention (Bernard Lee) until giving the impression that they are about to forget their text (John Le Mesurier). To be honest, he does not even score points for his efforts.
