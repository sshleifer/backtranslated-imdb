This movie has gone crazy. I think the original of this movie, "The Mask", was a great movie, worth buying and watching a lot. I firmly believed that they should do a sequel, but when I saw that, I thought again. <br /> <br /> This film ruined the whole idea of ​​"Mask". Mask mode? A baby flying in a room? My seven year old brother did not even laugh, and he loves these childish movies, but it was worse. A load of shit !! I tell you now, please do not watch this movie, it's a waste of money and a waste of time. Instead, you could really have fun! Look at 'The Mask', but do not repeat, I repeat, look at this piece of bric-a-brac. Thank you.
