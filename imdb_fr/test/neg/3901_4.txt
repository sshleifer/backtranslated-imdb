Do not be fooled by other reviews. Although this film contains an impressive number of talents, the material they present leaves much to be desired. The 3 numbers of Nat King Cole are pretty lame and are not close to his later efforts, although he impresses with his piano playing. 'Moms' Mabley is not very funny, although I remember her as a very entertaining host of my youth. In fact, the best performances come from two fat men who impress with a live tap and a takeoff of Four Tops, and by the jazz band itself, especially the number with the bass player. The impression itself is of poor quality and the wonderful Butterfly McQueen is totally lost in the wrapping intrigue.
