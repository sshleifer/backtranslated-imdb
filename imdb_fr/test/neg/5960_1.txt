Want the worst horror film of the 21st century? El Chupacabra is this. "Manos: the hands of fate" is the worst film of all time, but El Chupacabra is certainly the worst film of this century. He must also have the distinction of having the worst actor of all time. Eric Alegria, the main actor, has never shot a film other than El Chupacabra, but I wonder why. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the monster attacks people, but everyone who is attacked moves very slowly and is really stupid. And, there are no cops at all in this city, but two idiotic detectives - Hello! The cops first arrive at the homicide scene, then the detectives arrive! And, apparently, the monster attacks only in a person's garden and in some deserted areas near the docks. Or ... these are the only places where filmmakers have access to the film. <br /> <br /> This "film" is the reason why IMDb must allow us to give negative stars. This deserves easily -10 stars, or at least 0. They should allow a score of 0.
