Mansfield Park's 1999 adaptation of Rozema is far superior to this seemingly more faithful film. The 1999 film is criticized by many Austen purists, but I admire the work Rozema has done to make Mansfield Park his own. It may not be strictly Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, but at least it was well written, beautifully shot and well played by a top cast. I do not see how the purists of Austen can be happier with this 2007 version of ITV (and rebroadcast on Masterpiece Theater / PBS). The scenario is carefully glued and imitated, the production values ​​are mediocre, and the actors (aside from Jemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson) are largely guilty of bad actors. I can not think of a worse error message than Billie Piper as Fanny Price. His look was wrong (faded hair and dark eyebrows ??) and his talent was just not suited to the material. Sir Thomas looked constipated all the time. Michelle Ryan in the role of Mariah was on autopilot, as well as the actors who represented the Crawford (when I think how much Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were superior in the '99 version, I shake my head a little). <br /> <br /> I have not seen the 1983 version, so I can not talk about it, but I would advise anyone who is curious to give the 99 version a chance. Read the novel before or after and decide for yourself.
