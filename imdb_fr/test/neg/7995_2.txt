Terrible action movie in which Franco Nero swaps his cowboy hat, his gun belt and the coffin he dragged in DJANGO (1966) against an all-white Ninja outfit with all the catchy paraphernalia that goes with it! Despite almost continuous action, the film is completely clich√© and unintentionally funny - with a nasty campy, to start with in Christopher George. Susan George (no relation) is the seductive woman with a dilapidated husband, Nero's warlord, whom the bandits are trying to fend off from his oil-rich country - but he has not relied on the martial arts of Nero (and the cascades). heavy gymnastics. The solution to their problems is to hire a Ninja with similar skills, which turns out to be the deadly enemy of Nero (played by Sho Kosugi, who appeared in two other sequels and is currently engaged in another!). The climax takes place inside an arena where Nero, an army of men, "eliminates" George and what remains of his gang in previous clashes. the subtle way in which he despatches his sworn enemy is however effectively accomplished.
