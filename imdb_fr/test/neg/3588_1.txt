The only reason for FC De Kampioenen is its local popularity. It has been more than 15 years since this sitcom works (and it still counts). <br /> <br /> This is an amateur football team that focuses on "amateur". Each scenario deals with the same subject: a misunderstanding that takes ridiculous (and predictable) proportions to be solved at the end. <br /> <br /> The series has existed for more than 15 years and the production probably decided not to do it. change a winning team. This means that the series has undergone slight changes over the years (apart from a few players who have been replaced (almost all of them left on their own rather than being cast out of the series)). The humor has not changed a bit over the years and it was already out of date when it aired for the first time. <br /> <br /> I guess you have to be Flemish to have that, and be over 60, to enjoy an old-fashioned TV show like this.
