This movie is by far one of the worst B movies I have ever seen. There are no twists. Although the game is decent, the scenario is terrible. There are also a lot of mistakes in the movie, and it was embarrassing to watch. For anyone who likes horror movies, slasher movies or even B-movies, I do not recommend it to anyone. Most of the film is centered on useless killings, in a way that does not even deserve to be discussed. This film could very well be compared to a shit remake of Jeepers Creepers, which was not as fantastic. For those who wish to spend a day at home, watching poorly made movies, this one takes the cake.
