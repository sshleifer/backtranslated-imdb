It must be remembered that Gammera's films, like many of Gozilla's first series, were actually intended for children. Little Kenny and his comrades live in the daydream of the children of the public: they run and play with top secret things while the adults get ready and allow it; they end up with monsters and even when the bad guys enter, they are never really in danger. <br /> <br /> Maybe the first film of Gammera is an aberration, because the child is punished and endangered. but the rest of the series is just a pure fulfillment of wishes. <br /> <br /> As one critic has said, it's not adult films that have failed, but successful children's films.
