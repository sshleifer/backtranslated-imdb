Like other films of the worst director of all time, Ed Wood, this film is very bad, but for that reason, it is also very funny. Maybe not for everyone, but I laughed a lot. It's a strange thing when you like a bad movie. How would you rate? As a very low film, as entertainment at least a little higher. <br /> <br /> The film tries to explain what a transvestite is. He does this through a scientist (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot) who speaks to a doctor (Timothy Farrell) who is aware of these things. The doctor tells two stories to the detective and that's what we, and apparently the scientist, see. The doctor comments on these stories because we find a dead transvestite, a suicide, and because the newspaper talks about a title about a sex change. The first and longest story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself), in love and about to marry Barbara (Dolores Fuller), but he never told him that he liked to dress up as a woman when he His name was Glenda. The film says the same thing over and over, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual. The film almost says that being a transvestite is not a bad thing, whereas being a homosexual is, since he keeps telling us that the transvestite is not a homosexual. The second story tells the story of a transvestite who really wants to change sex and who not only wants to disguise herself as a woman, but who is much shorter and less interesting. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of bad charm, and therefore laughable. The way the story is presented is the first thing to do, the way the same things are told over and over again and the conclusion is different. This is not where it ends. The acting is very bad, especially Dolores Fuller seems to read his lines directly from a small screen somewhere. All she says is funny. The whole dialogue made me laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> There is also a sequence where someone enters a room. The door is half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not completely straight. Then the door, in what seems to be the same plane although we know it is not the case, was a little less open and suddenly the thing hanging on the wall clings. Ed Wood did not hesitate to leave this kind of continuity errors in his film. Maybe a good thing, because deep down, it's an extra laugh for the modern audience. I think you understand it's a bad movie and I think there's a good chance you're laughing at some ridiculous mistakes as well.
