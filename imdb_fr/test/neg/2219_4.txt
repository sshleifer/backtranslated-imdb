Doug McClure has played in some of these genre adventures produced in Britain and this one must be the worst of all. I know that THE EARTH THAT IS IMPOSSEE has its critics, but please, at least, this film features filming a place and its relatively good production values. This is the problem of this film - The values ​​of production go far beyond "So bad they are good" and become "so bad, I think I'll go see what's happening on other channels ". <br /> <br /> A typical case is the first scene featuring the intrepid Cushing and McClure meeting a monster. It is painfully obvious that the monster is a medium-sized man dressed like a rubber monster who must look more than ten meters high through an excessively blown back projection. It becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot. Have I already mentioned that this is one of the most convincing pieces? No, really, it looks like it was filmed in someone's living room with the spare parts left by the DOCTOR WHO budget. Even former WHO doctor Peter Cushing is bland and what should have been a fun phrase "You can not hypnotize me - I'm British" is presented in a very flat way (a very similar line is spoken by Cushing in HORROR EXPRESS) in a scenario devoid of characterization, conspiracy and memorable dialogue. It is not only the fact that dialogue is immutable, it is also uncommon and rare since monsters do not speak. Would not it have been better to have the bad guys' humanoids like in WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS so they could explain the plot. Does anyone here know what plot is? <br /> <br /> A very tedious British film that even Caroline Munro's twins can not save. The mood of the film is summed up by the final sequence featuring two key cops
