Swoon focuses on the homosexual relationship of Leopold and Loeb - a facet of the affair that has been largely (and unjustly) ignored since their trial, even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But even in his treatment of Swoon, he does it from a distance. Worse still, it twists, combines and directly modifies the details of the file, which irritates all those who know a lot about what is happening while managing to confuse those who do not know it. Although this is an interesting movie, Swoon stinks. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 - horrible
