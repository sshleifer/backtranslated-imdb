The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934. I bought it because I like adventures in the desert and says on the box that this is a drama. This is certainly not the case. <br /> <br /> This is a couple going to Egypt to capture desert drug couriers. <br /> <br /> It would have been a lot better if it had been done that way. a drama instead of a comedy, which leaves a lot to fall. It's pretty silly in places. Depsite this, there are good scenes of action and place. <br /> <br /> The cast is directed by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as a love interest. <br /> <br /> Only one view is enough for this film. Overall, a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5 stars.
