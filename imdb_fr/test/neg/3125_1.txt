This film is so unreal. French films like these are just a waste of time. Why watch this movie? Even, I did not know..why. What? The well-known sex scene of half-siblings? Although the sex scene is so real and explicit, the story on which it is based is so unreal. What is it for? Can you easily find in life a half-brother who does such things? <br /> <br /> Did I learn something from this movie? Yeah: some people like to waste so much time making such movies, stories, such nonsense. But for those who love nihilism, nothingness in life or simply a life without hope, you are here .. you have to see this movie. <br /> <br /> One worthy of worship, however: CATHERINE DENEUVE. She is a woman of striking beauty.
