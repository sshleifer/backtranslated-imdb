I was looking forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend watching a good movie about Jefferson. This movie was not that. It was quite long, elongated, dull and unbalanced. Too much time has been spent exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and not enough time to his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was absolutely awful. His playing was so painful it was like watching an aerial head A1 try to recite Shakespeare. His constant whining voice grated nerves! Nolte's accent gave the impression that Jefferson looked like an ignorant man, rather than a genius. Jefferson's relationship with his daughters and their feelings about slavery were also underdeveloped, but the rebellion of his eldest daughter (Patsy) is a key event at the end of the film. The film was too long and the screenplay lacked energy and enthusiasm. On the plus side, the costumes were beautiful and Greta Scacchi played the role of Cosway. If you want to watch a film about the revolutionary era and / or Jefferson, then look at 1776, it's a lot better than Jefferson in Paris.
