I love horror movies and I try to give all those I see the most credit (or sometimes more), but that's what pushes you as far as possible. at all - but, again, think about the writing / dialogue of this mess ... good makeup, but a special effect absolutely ridiculous. Overall, I give it 3 out of 10 - and I'm thinking about that !!
