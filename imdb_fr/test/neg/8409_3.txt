Ugly suite made for television of the classic of Roman Polanski. Rosemary's son, Adrian, grew up and is played by Stephen McHattie. After eliminating Rosemary (here played by Patty Duke), a group of witches, again led by Minnie & Roman Castevets, prepares Satan's son for world domination. It's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor. Instead, writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a thriller adoring Satan, full of songs and candles, and Ruth Gordon trying to act at the same time. Gordon is the only vestige of the original. George Maharis replaces John Cassavetes as Guy and Ray Milland plays Roman Castevets, replacing the late Sidney Blackmer. The newcomer McHattie is the only real saving asset of the film. He is very offbeat and looks really sinister without doing anything. Charles Bernstein's music is rather scary, but if overexploited, it ends up being intrusive rather than effective. O'Steen, who edited Polanski's previous masterpiece, shows no talent or subtlety.
