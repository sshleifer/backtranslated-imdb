hey .... I really do not know why this movie was so popular, maybe I misunderstood. The way I see it, many international filmmakers have made brilliant films that deal with informed, excited, shocked, evoked emotions and forced the audience to stand out from their own reality and reflect ........ While it is true that Aparna Sen's project was ambitious in the light of all the other films, it falls short ..... miserably ...... it was too slow, it there was no detail on anything and the end ... was completely ... useless ...... it was not open or anything .... just useless .... so watch it if you want to see a good concept completely lost .......
