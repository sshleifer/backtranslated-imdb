This film had the potential to be a good little thriller in high school. Instead, we organized a party about a cheerful and spoiled babysitting. The problem was that there were too many useless things. A fight with the boyfriend, random friends coming to be killed. It was obvious that they were only killing time. The main character was bland and uninteresting. Camilla Bell had no emotion during this movie. She was right there. Another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat. The kids are surviving, so obviously they'll let Jill survive. The only reason we got a 4 is because the last ten minutes (when the killer finally comes out) are really exciting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
