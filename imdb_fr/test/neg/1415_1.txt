I am quite surprised to see that this film has earned lukewarm reviews, I found this film absolutely awful. The plot struggles to decide whether it's a comedy or a thriller, then realizes that it can not be achieved either. So he throws in the towel and continues with his absurd plot highlighted by an involuntary hilarious scene with Laura Linney, an injection, and a spilled coffee that lets the audience squirm awkwardly on its seats looking at each other as if it really is? Basically, it's abominable and really disappointing for the fans of Robin Williams, and it suggests that Laura Linney had the person singing by adding this trash to his otherwise respectable resume. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes and I would have liked, even seeing it for free, I wanted someone to pay me for my lost time. The little computer problem in this movie was embarrassing and stupid, and in the end, we do not care who wins the election. I vote directly on DVD.
