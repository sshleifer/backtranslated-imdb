Interlaced views may seem like a good idea in some movies. Here, the disorder is total. <br /> <br /> But the total disorder begins with the story: a small video clip wants to film a light comedy with a pernicious female character black type. She is beautiful and no man could resist diving, crawling and sucking her toes. It is all the more materialistic if the butter does not melt in its mouth. <br /> <br /> The film blends in with its own pretentiousness: to be intelligent / funny / beautiful. Phalocretinism at its best. White trash only, please.
