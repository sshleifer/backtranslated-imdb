Looking at the ratings, we can assume that this is a classic, but again, it's just another example of poor independent filmmakers trying to spark interest in their film. They are not even smart about it 10/10 in the votes? I guess to reverse the curve and compensate for every 1/10 it will get. Is it better than any decent zombie movie? No. <br /> <br /> Acting, nerdy and nil. <br /> <br /> Sound effects, economic and unpleasant, if they were not where the actors looked, you would not know where he came from. from. <br /> <br /> Cinematography. These people act as if they had borrowed their father's camera just after looking at the matrix. Less is more, but more of this team is absolutely pap. <br /> <br /> Zombies are also garbage. I have no doubt that most of these people will never be heard again and it will be for good reason. I hope the zombies will eat their eyes, because it was 90 minutes that I would not come back. <br /> <br /> And falsifying the ratings makes it a million times worse. <br /> <br /> A critic said it was one of the best horror movies he's seen in the last 30 years? I can only assume that his recent corneal transplant was a success. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer as a warning about the seriousness of this movie.
