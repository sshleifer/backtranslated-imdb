Welcome to the world of Vikram Bhatt, a man who has already had success and had several successes with small actors such as KASOOR, RAAZ and also the multi-starter AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA and his film with Aamir GHULAM <br /> <br> /> A foretaste about these films are that all are Hollywood remakes and some worthy ones like the one who once worked <br /> <br /> SPEED is a remake of CELLULAR and that is a terrible < We have Urmila and Sanjay Suri, once marketable but without work, then we have the Aftab flop, Ashish Chaudhary, Zayed Khan and others. <br /> <br /> The film could be a decent thriller, but many problems remain The narration features several wacky scenes such as Zayed hijacking a mobile phone company and many more. The stunts are also laughable, but the twists are too laughable. The film also took a long time to reach the theaters that are losing its spark <br /> <br /> The direction is bad The music is obsolete <br /> <br /> Zayed Khan shouts and grimaces. that he is still Urmila is good in his part, Sanjay Suri is not convincing Ashish Chaudhary is trying to play a negative role and he is fine Aftab is horrible and he makes you laugh in a negative role Surprising, the same director gave him his only solo success KASOOR Sophie is horrible Tanushree is a non actress
