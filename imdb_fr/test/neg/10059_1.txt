I have never seen so much talent and money produce anything so bad in my life! As noted in other reviews, some talent, such as Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, Donald Sutherland, and many others have come together in a film that does not recognize the story of Agatha Christie. I can not stop thinking about what it could be with the same cast, well done. <br /> <br /> The film has even less privacy than Christopher Reeves' Superman movies. The big distribution makes smooth production even less effective than in these films, because there is not enough time to get to know anyone. The progressive jazz soundtrack of Dave Brubeck had asked me if the bad video was in the case of the rental shop. The music became more and more offensive as the plot progressed. It is difficult to say whether the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from previous scenes was more shocking. From someone who has seen most of Christie's films (that's what attracted me to this movie, it's one of the few I've ever seen), this one miss. This is not an Agatha Christie film. Golan-Globus is better suited to producing films on the big fight than for the warm atmosphere of the English mystery.
