Eh. I watch this movie in class because someone has recorded it and brought it. I was expecting a half-hearted attempt to portray Herakles' myths, and because the resulting commercials looked serious, I was expecting something decent. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes after the beginning of the film, I realized that it was a total disaster. The only things in the movie that are half-way faithful to the myth are the minimum (and I mean naked). The parents, the half-brother and the jobs seemed to have been named correctly. Other than that, the rest of the movie seemed like a giant inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> I would say it was not much better than the Disney version of the movie. The Disney version was made for little kids, so it was not too bad. This movie, with all the sex, violence and nudity, was clearly aimed at an older audience. Still, the story presented in this movie was almost inaccurate as in the Disney movie.
