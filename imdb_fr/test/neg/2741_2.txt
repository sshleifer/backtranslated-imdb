I'm a pretty tolerable guy, when it comes to movies, even movies. I regularly watch B movies for fun, and they can go from amazingly good to just awful. Before watching this type of film, I usually set my expectations very low. Even after that, Descent was just horrible. It did not bother me that they tore the Core to some extent, but they did absolutely nothing interesting with the material. Some scientists are worried about the seismic activity of the Earth and have to move in the depths of the Earth in order to stabilize the mantle. We thus obtain a long monotonous configuration in which two dueling scientists, interpreted by Luke Perry and Rick Roberts, must work together on a very secret mission, called Project DEEP. The man responsible, General Fielding played by Michael Dorn, secretly conceals vital information to Marsha Crawford's assistant, played by Mimi Kuzyk. Natalie Brown, interpreter of the mission, created the forest "Mole" which plunges into the depths of the Earth. <br /> <br /> In addition to very good special effects, and scenery, nothing on the descent is worth it. The film begins quite amusing, but it quickly gets bogged down in a boring story about an uncontrollable seismic activity, which has been lived to death in other films such as Core. The descent also has a mediocre script, with a useless and forgettable dialogue between the characters. To make matters worse, there is literally no action, no threat or real danger. Attempts at comic relief are painfully impossible. The plot has gaping holes and some of the subplots are left unbound at the end, leaving a bad taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> In closing, this film was an inexpensive way to get a salary for everyone involved. There was no thought behind this film, no innovation, it's just there. Apart from beautiful special effects and scenery, this film fails on all levels. The story comes from the trash of Hollywood and the characters are of no interest to start. The descent will simply plunge you into boredom and frustration. Avoid at all costs.
