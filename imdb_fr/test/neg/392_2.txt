Now I liked "Lethal Weapon" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", but I can not believe that Shane Black wrote this stack ... or that David Morse and John C. McGinley are there. I screened it for a film festival. Terrible. Everyone was laughing. It's preached and heavy with hands ... not to say stupid. In addition, it is amazing to see how L.A. looks like Cambodia. The idea of ​​traveling back in time through post-traumatic stress disorder is a bit silly. Imagine "Born July 4th" mixed with "The Butterfly Effect 2" (as an example to show how bad this movie really is) but directed by the director of Michael Bay's 2nd Unit. So bad. The 2 stars are purely based on the value of the production.
