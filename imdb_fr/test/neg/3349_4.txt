I saw it on a cheap DVD called "The Entity Force". Since I love the horror movies of the 80s, I thought I was a real treat. Unfortunately, the movie is mostly boring and you are always waiting for something. It ends up interesting enough, but we are in the last quarter of the film. It's a case of too little, too late. When the action happens, it's not terrible, what we get are dead corpses floating on the floor and chasing girls in the mausoleum. It's not the worst I've ever seen, but you can do a lot better. I would only recommend this to the intrepid horror collectors of the 80s to cheese.
