This series, made for Televisión Española (TVE), is essentially a series of chapters from the life of an ordinary family in 1968, mostly seen through the eyes of the youngest son. <br /> <br /> Founded on a background of historical events, such as the May 1968 student uprising in France, the declining Franco regime, the Vietnam War, the rise of imperialism and other events specifically related to Spanish life at this moment, could be considered as a simple series. a compilation of characteristic weaknesses that manifest so often in this kind of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Generally, treated in a light vein but not missing at times that could be described as dramatic, the series would seem to target people about fifty people who can remember of these moments, because, it should be specified, any younger person chooses to ignore such events or is busy with something else. <br /> <br /> The best thing that can be said about this series is Ana Duato's role as a mother of three: she plays very well the role of housewife of the time, demonstrating this peculiar Spanish inclination, particularly perceptible in women, to let all her thoughts and actions continue under the impulse of her heart, without recourse to the use of the brain. As they say in Spain, common sense is one of the least common sense. Imanol Arias offers very little, apart from not being his usual stereotypical hard cop as in other TV series. Indeed, as an actor, you should not entrust anything that is not a television series. His resources are too limited. however, his share as a father of the working class is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> This is not really recommended for other audiences, even Spanish speakers in Latin America: the topics are too closely related to a specific place in contemporary Spanish history, so that, if the viewer did not live here at that time, most references would miss him. It is even likely that some situations causing some Spanish smiles do not mean anything to other viewers.
