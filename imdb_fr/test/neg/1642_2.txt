I mean, you have to like the Italian film industry. Someone imagined an action movie after the end of May ("Road Warrior") and the Italians were busy for years to get ripped off one by one. Then another film arrived with a successful barbarian movie ("Conan") and the Italians were busy ... eh, see above. <br /> <br /> In addition to countless other variations of the theme (one of my favorites is Umberto Lenzi's "The Barbarians" with the Paul twins), the Ator series was created. And this, the second, is probably the worst (or the best, depending on your point of view). <br /> <br /> Ator is recalled by his former teacher, who discovered a kind of nuclear energy. this, of course, must be protected so as not to fall into the wrong hands. The old man sends his daughter to Ator and, after some complications, Ator, his sidekick Tong and the girl return to the castle, which has fallen in the meantime into the hands of a malefactor (of course, a former "classmate" Ator). Somewhere on the way, the heroic trio forgets the intrigue and eliminates for pleasure a giant cult worshiping snakes (not before virgins were sacrificed). Just in time for the madman to finally get carried away and kill the wise teacher, our heroes remember their homework, invent paragliding and grenades and save the day. <br /> <br />), incredibly hilarious "special effects" (just adore the snake fight scene, which must be somehow a tribute to "Bride of the Monster"), fight scenes poorly staged, many errors of continuity (Ator flies over the climate battle, look at it, just an example) and a global misunderstanding of the concept of history (cavemen, barbarians "civilized", builders of castles, all thrown away in the same film). <br /> <br /> If you are, like me, doomed to bad movies, this is the one of the series to see, you will probably end up with ROTFL. For recordings: the third part filmed by Malta is actually quite watchable. <br /> <br /> Considering Joe D'Amato's other efforts, this is probably his most entertaining film, as he certainly did not succeed in producing horror or erotic films to discover. . But I'm convinced that it's completely by accident. <br /> <br />
