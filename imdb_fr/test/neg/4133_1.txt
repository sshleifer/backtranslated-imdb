If you are making a suspense movie, it is quite important that the "bad guy" is not more sympathetic than the "victim". And that fails miserably. It was so horrible and frustrating to watch that I was really moved to sign up and comment. OK, so the husband is rich and arrogant. There are worse vices, and the boy and the hut show a lot. The husband is a fool because - he did not approve of the fact that the cabin boy physically assaulted this woman - the witch who had absolutely nothing to do with the BTW plot. The cabin boy threatens the husband and repeatedly tries to seduce his wife. He then forces himself against her - that the woman finds so hot that she stops thinking about rape and begins to think that she wants it. Uh huh. The misogynistic and intricate inferiority thoughts that the director displays are simply revolting. It's one thing that a good movie like American Psycho deliberately tries to make us understand the villain, but at Survival Island, I felt like watching a film about Ted Bundy, but the director did not succeed to make it inimitable and to make us hate its victims. What was he thinking of ???
