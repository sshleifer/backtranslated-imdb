Anne is way too old. Wentworth looks younger than she and he should not. Louisa is way too young and upbeat Oh, my sister Mary is too pretty. She's supposed to be mean, not pretty. When this actress complains as Mary should think, all I think is that she is too pretty to complain. Lady Russell is too old. It's crazy. If you read the novel, she is Anne's oldest friend, perhaps as old as Annes's mother, who would be about 18 to 20 years older than Anne, so about 50 NOT 70 years old! It's crazy, it's not right. How is Anne so happy at first? She smiles saying "Oh, the worst is over, I see it now, the worst is over" yeah, okay. OK, if anyone has seen Roger Michell's 1995 version, it's impossible to compare these two versions. That one is right on. This one is far away. Read the novel and you'll know what I mean.
