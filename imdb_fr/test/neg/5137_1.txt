Hmmm, it started well, like a hybrid of X-Files and First Wave, unfortunately, if the mere notion of Da Vinci's time machine is absurd, then the final "battle" between a man with a pistol and four 16th century monks armed to the teeth with automatic weapons will seem ridiculously positive, matched only by poor acting, a poor script and scenario, or, in other words, a captain factor 5 of crazy laugh.
