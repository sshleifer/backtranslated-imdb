It's not since "8 heads in a sports bag" and the "premieres" <br /> <br /> that I laughed so much that the filmmakers thought that <br /> <br would be hysterical. <Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is rejected by the army as a 4-F <br /> <br /> and decides to use his money to form his army <br /> <br /> of about half a dozen. He then passes for a Nazi commander in Italy and finally tries to kill Hitler. This is the description of the fragile plot <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> This movie is as funny as a heart attack. This film makes Shakespeare look like "Hogan's heroes <br /> <br />." If the silver men of "The <br /> <br /> Producers" really wanted to lose their money, they should have <br /> <br /> watch this movie I can not emphasize how bad this is. <br /> <br /> Lewis's direction consists of two different cameras filming the action <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> sitcom works on television, but this is an obvious attempt to deceive the public. He finishes most of his <br /> <br /> scenes with a freeze frame, as if to give the viewer a chance to double <br /> <br /> his stitches before going to the next tired edit I spent most of the film <br /> <br /> lined with abdominal agony, accompanied by <br /> <br /> severe flatulence on this thing. <br /> <br /> Lewis, the director and pr oducteur, set up the film in 1943, but does not try to use costumes or period decorations. Everyone wears the latest style <br /> and has the latest interior design ... for 1970. The <br /> <br /> distribution is lost as Lewis clinches his patented tangents, <br /> <br /> that last as long as a major surgery and are just as painful to watch <br /> <br />. When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander, he spends the last half of the film screaming in a <br /> <br /> performance so odious that it poisons all good will. you are trying to get <br /> <br /> to the beginning. <br /> <br /> The last embarrassing blow to Lewis and his friends who are trying to <br /> <br /> put a point on the Japanese. They have prominent teeth, squint <br /> <br /> and speak with a "fun" accent. This is perhaps one of the most obviously racist events since the internment camps. <br /> <br /> I was speechless in front of what Lewis did during this whole process, but it put me <br /> <br /> on the edge. Watch for the very tasteless scene of Kaye Ballard <br /> <br /> where she tries to commit suicide again and again. <br /> <br /> George Takei of "Star Trek" has two small scenes, then wisely <br /> disappears from the picture. That's less fun than the last three Mel Brooks combined movies. There is nothing more sad than watching a former comedian screw up a project so horribly that you really feel ashamed of it. Jim Carrey learned this with "The Majestic <br />", but Jerry Lewis still appears on television once in a <br /> <br /> while shooting the same idiot. I'm sorry for him. <br /> <br /> "Which way to the front?" is cheap, not funny, offensive and stupid. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for everyone involved and whoever has to endure it. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> Although noted (G), it contains physical violence, gun violence and some adult situations. If your child has an interest in seeing this, please consult a professional. <br /> <br />
