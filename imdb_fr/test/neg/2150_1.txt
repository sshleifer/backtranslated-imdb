This must be the worst case of over-action since the silent era. Not just one or two actors, but almost all actors. Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were doing well, but the others seemed to be playing for the first time. <br /> <br /> The budget was not extraordinary. Most of the costumes and sets were credible, but a lot of things jumped to the viewer to let us know that they could not check or that all the accessories matched the period. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any aspect of the film that I like or that does not shake my head. Your time will be better spent burning the lint collected from your belly button.
