The film begins a little interested in the son interested in a teenager of his age. Clayburgh's shy-looking husband is killed in a car accident as she prepares to go to Rome and sing as a diva. Matthew objects but arrives. He makes contact with the girl but this time, Matt takes cocaine. His beautiful voice, his beautiful and impetuous mother is in the spotlight. She does not know how to handle Matt's addiction. The film hangs in search of a field. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may have had his head in the moon while directing the photo. The moon has a great symbolism. <br /> <br /> Save time. I may be too generous with 4 *.
