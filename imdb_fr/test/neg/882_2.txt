My husband has reported this to the video store house so I can watch something while I'm stuck at home sick. The kind of sick person where you could never concentrate on a book, but a kind of romantic, silly, light and romantic movie sounds good (with a bowl of chicken soup). Well, he meant well. <br /> <br /> My first thought (like some others here too) is that the house MUST be fake ... it's not just isolated on the beach, it's moored in the loose sand, and so close from the ocean as the surf waves go directly under the house! That sounds so obviously dangerous (in hurricane country, in AUTUMN), so potentially disastrous that I was sure that the filmmakers simply had CGI (or used the magic of cinema to dive a pretty B & B into surf). <br /> <br /> But I have to tell you guys, thanks to "teh interwebs", I can say that the house "Serendipity" is very real, is indeed near Rodanthe and, with the exception of some window ornaments and shrubs, made in the film. You can rent it yourself, out of season, for $ 1710 per week (or about $ 3,850 in summer)! Dark! But ... curiously, the house has serious problems. The second thing that struck me after "would be washed away" was "what about plumbing / electricity? In this surf? ", And of course," Serendipity "was sentenced for a break in sanitation, caused by the ocean washout. (They rebuild.) <br /> <br /> And the house does not Not to mention that Viola Davis, playing "the best friend of the black clich√©" (ungrateful role for a remarkable actress, seen for the last time in "Doubt"), is not old enough to That his grandfather was able to build anything during the American Civil War! GREAT !, it was 150 years ago! Try great, awesome! (In fact, "Serendipity" was built in 1988, ridiculously recently. ) <br /> <br /> The basic film is based on a typical Nicholas Sparks painter, which means a lot of coincidences and predictable events, and it is also very painfully aimed at "women" - you know, we, women who love lodgings, bulky antiques and trinkets ... who dream of romance and guys who laugh are flowing to Richard Gere and dancing in the moonlight. Do not give us plot, or the development of thoughtfulness; Just set up mechanisms and bring the love scenes! <br /> <br /> Gere plays the role of a plastic surgeon, who lost a patient during a routine operation for a benign cyst on the cheek. Of course, she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA, so you wonder immediately why the surgeon is guilty of guilt and not the anesthetist! HI! where is this guy? Why does the bad doctor feel guilty? <br /> <br /> Gere came to pout and confront the woman's husband, and stay at the B & B ... who should be there, why the ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE HOSTEL ... Diane Lane! She is a solitary divorcee, with rotten children and an ex-husband who wants to get her back. While she's trying to make a decision on this, the best black friend's snapshot replaces her as a B & B host. Now, in the real world, if this setup happened, the doctor would have Ernest Borgnine ... and the lonely divorcee, like Rosie O'Donnell. He spent his horndogging vacation on 22-year-old girls on the beach, while she sulked and thought about going on a diet. But it's not the real world; I move away from the subject. <br /> <br /> The couple confesses everything, falls in love, a hurricane strikes ... he makes love, falls in love, he has to leave, he dies and she cries a lot about it. The end. <br /> <br /> Here, I saved you; Now you no longer have to torture yourself or make any acquaintance of male (husbands, sons, boyfriends) to get through this guts. Very exhausting. <br /> <br /> Someone else has asked why Diane Lane, a perfect little woman (whom filmmakers seem to love to play with, because she is just pretty and skinny enough for most women to want to look like her, But she is constantly covered with big tarpaulin-like shawls - that would make sense if she was chubby, but she's not. <br /> <br /> Anyway, someone will throw a nice paisley shawl on this movie, so we do not have to look at it Conclusion: read a book unless you are too sick If you are too sick, go to bed.
