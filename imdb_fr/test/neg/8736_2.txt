"A researcher is experimenting with human DNA in order to create the perfect human being, and his work has taken a human fetus and accelerated growth to reach an adult in a few days. (spoiler omis), but side effects of the process ("spoiler"), "according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> "Embryo" opens with the promise: "The film you are going to see It's not just science fiction, it's based on the medical technology that is currently available for growth of the fetus outside the uterus.This could be possible tomorrow or today, "according to Dr. Charles M. Brinkman III. Right. And, Dr. Joyce Brothers appears, later, at a party with Roddy McDowall. <br /> <br /> We first see Rock Hudson (as Dr. Paul Holliston) light a cigarette and drive carelessly (watch this speedometer!) during a storm; Unfortunately, he hits a dog. Mr. Hudson brings the wounded man home. He learns that he is pregnant and manages to save one puppy's life through his experimental knowledge of fetal growth. In summary, Hudson uses an experimental drug to grow the embryo so that it can survive outside the mother's womb. The dog "Number One" quickly reaches adult size and becomes his mother. <br /> <br /> Hudson lives with his sister-in-law Diane Ladd (Martha Douglas); since his wife Nicole, also a doctor, died in another car accident. On the death of Nicole, Ms. Ladd appears to be more emotionally stable than Hudson, who survived the crash that killed his wife. Things start to get scary when the Hudson dog shows a level of intelligence far superior to that of a normal dog. Then, Hudson decides to use his accelerated embryonic growth on a human, Barbara Carrera (under the name of Victoria Spencer). <br /> <br /> Hudson and the cast do their best; but, the "Embryo" storyline is a miserable absurd nonsense. If you take off her stupid opening and closing scenes, Ms. Carrera's valiant characterization almost works; she could have been a bigger star if we offered her better movies than that. The infantile end suggests a sequel; but fortunately, the idea was abandoned.
