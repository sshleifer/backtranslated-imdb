"Hoods" does not deliver the goods. This Mafia half-length comedy features a remarkable cast including Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly and Seymour Cassel, as well as many familiar faces for those watching crime movies. never been one. Screenwriter and director Mark Malone, best known for writing "Dead of Winter" for the director of "Bonnie & Clyde", Arthur Penn, wrote a pedestrian pot-driver whose boss of the miffed crowd, Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel ) sends his son Angelo (Joe Mantegna from "House of Games") to hit Carmine DellaRosa. It seems that a rival crowd has bombed one of Pop's warehouses (in the opening scene) and that Martinelli wants a return on investment. The problem is that no one has any idea who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other crowd comedy, such a complication can be fun, but here it's just plain. Angelo and a group of wise men, including his best friend Rudy (Kevin Pollack of "Deterrence") spend half of the time trying to find out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to play the tube, so they're looking for Charlie (Joe Pantoliano from "Bad Boys") to do it. Before they can convince Charlie to make the move, they have to locate him, and his wife, slut Mary (Jennifer Tilly of "Bound"), reveals that he is locked in a psychiatric hospital. Our unsuitable heroes go to the psychiatric hospital and get Charlie out. About half of the movie is over before they discover that Carmine is a bland and harmless boy in short pants (Vincent Berry). Indeed, Carmine has the only decent line of the film. As our group of brainless heroes move away from his house with him in the backseat to take care of his belongings, Carmine warns them that they need to take him home in time, otherwise his father will kill. Charlie tries to freeze the kid but he can not. Instead, he renews his feelings and wants to return to the psychiatric hospital to be able to announce the good news to his doctor. Meanwhile, after Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine, the kid catches his paw on the gun and makes several scoreless rounds. Angelo and he are fighting for the automatic. The gun slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground, goes off and makes a hole in Rudy's chest. Now, keep in mind that Rudy never wanted to shoot the kid in the first place, and he and Angelo argued over the wrong head of the hit. So Rudy finds himself on the ground with a deadly wound, while Angelo struggles to stop the bleeding. You speak of a scene of dull death. Angelo is himself in conflict because his father ordered the blow and Angelo fears that his father will do it if he does not execute his orders. There is a secondary intrigue of flashback about Angelo's father who taught him how to handle a gun, which gives a glimpse of Angelo's reluctance to prepare it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing redeemed about this depressing comedy with a demeanor. . The situation is getting worse and if you lose 90 minutes, you will see what I mean. Comedy is largely without laughter. Good actors wallow in sketchy roles that are not even funny. Maybe the director Malone was trying to do another comedy like "The band that can not shoot in a straight line". If he was, he was missing a mile. Jennifer Tilly, busty, shows the cleavage and collisions through a few scenes with Mantegna, but she does not do much else. It's the stereotypical slut who does not even get naked. A paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast, otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish. Initially, I had hoped that it would be an imitation of "Ransom of Red Chief" where the kid sinks the sands, but no chance of this type here. Of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a child, but this is not the kind of surprise that makes you want to look at his resolution. <br /> <br /> I actually bought this film on a Canadian DVD label "Seville" and it contains only the most basic special features. If you hate previews that betray the plot, do not watch the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna, one of your first questions should be to know why he helped produce this yawn. It's neither hilarious nor dramatic. There are no lines that can be quoted, and none of the characters stand out as interesting or likeable. The Seville DVD presents the film in full screen, without subtitles or subtitles.
