Dark Reality is a slightly decrepit saw-shaped film. Although the plot and story are good, there is a little too much useless nudity. Although I think the film was technically well done, the acting was irregular, it was just a bit too dark for my mood as I watched it. IT basically says that there are many missing people who will never be found and who may be tortured by sick whackos. I think that some information about the kidnappers and their reasons for being so sick would have helped some of them. It was a snuff film designed for violent content. If you like to see women beaten, tortured and murdered, then this is for you. If you are looking for something a little more literal and more expressive and reasoned, skip this one.
