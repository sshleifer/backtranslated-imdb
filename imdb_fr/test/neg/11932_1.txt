This film is a cash in. A cash based on a catchy theme created for a previous classic. Yul Brynner has long since left the ship, as have most production values. Lee Van Cleef takes over the lead role of Chris. I do not see any actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could have at least shaved his hair and lost his mustache, for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centers broadcast this film to punish offenders. A step out of line and The Magnificent Seven Ride! is put forward and handled. They did not even bother trying to make this movie look like a TV movie! Terrible.
