After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and the other in Amsterdam, the main suspect is the leader Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) who operates in the Middle East is charged by his superior to Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) to monitor a "shelter" in Amman, and he joins the chief of security in Jordan. , Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Roger does not disclose the whole operation to Hani, who fails because of Ed's intervention. Meanwhile, Roger has feelings for local nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and is getting closer to his family. When Roger plans another plan to capture Al-Saleem by using the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) as a lure to lure Al-Saleem, he jeopardizes not only Sadiki's security, but also that of Aisha who is kidnapped. After Sadiki's execution, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and offers to save himself to save the nurse. <br /> <br /> "Body of Lies" is a disappointing pyrotechnic tour in Europe and the Middle East. despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. The classification of IMDb users indicates that many viewers love this type of fast spy movie using high tech, satellites and any kind of disrespect for the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil, without leaving the time for reflection, but that's not my case. It is boring and ridiculous to see the fat Russell Crowe with a cell phone as a father, while his partner risks his life in a dangerous operation. The rich character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio is undeveloped and, in my opinion, this great actor is misinterpreted as an active agent in the Middle East because of his biotype. But the film never explains its links with the Middle East. The rescue of Roger Ferris alive is also very stupid and corny. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rede de Mentiras" ("Network of lies")
