That's what this movie really takes. A big piece of cheeze. This film is about a sister duo and brother Bonnie and Clyde who creates his own party line to lure their victims, trap them and kill them. But why? Just for the pleasure of leaving with? Comes Richard Hatch who appears as a delicate feminine man. A real bad version of a man with women. And he is involved in the discovery of who is behind all the murders committed in Los Angeles. He finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and the rest is made for your pleasure. But there are parts of this movie that really make me go like in the scene with Lief Garret wearing her mother's wedding dress, acting like a sissy chicken in front of her sister telling her he needs her and that he could not live without her slapping him on the face that dominates him. I can not believe it was Lief !!! Well, I guess I could. But it's worth watching, but only to see one of the worst Garrets films he's ever done.
