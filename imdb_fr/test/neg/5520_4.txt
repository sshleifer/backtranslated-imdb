Curiously, it is Fred MacMurray who plays the most "naughty" role in this comedy. Carole Lombard shows a great performance combining light and dramatic moments and serious. <br /> <br /> As usual, Fred MacMurray remains a mystery to me. The camera is not a fan of it, it is not so attractive and it does not have the style and the panache to assume this role very Cary Grant. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bellamy is an excellent friend. reborn through his relationship with the character of Lombard. One can only wonder why his character would not want his sweet and reassuring love instead of the almost certain loss of MacMurray's inefficiency. But it's Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The image works almost but misses the goal, mainly because of the performance of MacMurray. It would have been nice to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role. Lombard and Bellamy are largely credible and friendly; MacMurray is stiff and makes you want to keep it at arm's length.
