First, let me say if you have not liked a Van Damme movie since Bloodsport, you probably will not like this movie. Most of these films may not have the best intrigues or the best actors, but I appreciate this kind of movies for what they are. This film is much better than any other type of movie (Segal and Dolph) that has been staged in recent years. Van Damme is good in the film, the film is only worth watching for Van Damme fans. It's not as good as Wake of Death (which I highly recommend to anyone who loves Van Damme) or In Hell but, in my opinion, it's worth watching. He has the same kind of feeling as Nowhere to Run. Good fun thing!
