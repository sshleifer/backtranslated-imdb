A film about an interesting and sensitive period of history, filmed in a beautiful setting, has managed to present a dreadful and clich√©d production, a grossly awkward scenario, a mediocre continuity, an invading music, a sweet flow and a wan game. <br /> <br /> It was a difficult situation between the scenario and the actors' game. The scenario probably won - the historical context, the background and the descriptions of the characters were painfully detailed in the dialogue. .. in reality, words can not describe how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> During the preliminary screening, there was a mass exodus after about thirty minutes. At about the end of an hour, many of those who remained are laughing loudly. I would add that I am a francophile, I am fascinated by Canada and I love the historical film. It was really a one off.
