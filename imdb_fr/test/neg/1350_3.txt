I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's something I have not done since - I've never fallen asleep at the movies. <br /> <br /> I LOVE the original and have seen it many times and recommend it to everyone. That may be the problem, but I do not think so, because there were some positives that indicated that, if they did it right, they could have made this movie work. <br /> <br /> Bette was underused and Anne was finished. used and miscast. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the English or anyone else does not let things happen in this state. <br /> <br /> They presented it as a sex in the city but better? Not a chance that I really liked Sex in the City and that I was disappointed by this movie. <br /> <br /> So do not waste your money on this movie - go see something else!
