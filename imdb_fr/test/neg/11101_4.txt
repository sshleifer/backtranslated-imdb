After placing a mummy in a local museum, a metal object in his brain reacts negatively to the procedure, thus freeing the mind, or ghost if you will, from the Belphegor mummy. Due to favorable circumstances, Lisa, who lives near the museum, finds herself possessed by the evil spirit. Soon, she steals the Egyptian treasures from the museum. Detective Verlac leaves his retirement to catch the supernatural thief. <br /> <br /> It's quite useful, if you've never seen an incarnation of "Belph√©gor". If so, I recommend you do not use this version because it can not help but fade compared to others, despite the beauty of the premises and landscapes. It's really a compliment. <br /> <br /> Candy in the eyes: Sophie Marceau shows her big tits <br /> <br /> My note: C- <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: none
