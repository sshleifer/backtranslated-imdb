It was like watching the trailer of a promising movie, except that there was no movie coming. The film is so unsatisfactory and obviously unfinished that it is almost laughable. The subject of this film is very short and, frankly, not much happens in 90 minutes on the screen. I was hoping to have the final Australian movie about our soldiers during the Second World War and how they fought against incredible odds in appalling conditions. This is certainly not the case. <br /> <br /> That said, the acting was great and the places authentic. It could easily have been a good movie given a lot more time and money. Instead, it is not even mediocre and I can not recommend it at all.
