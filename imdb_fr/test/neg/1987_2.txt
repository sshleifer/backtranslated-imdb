This film is meant to be artistic but seems as childish as the first attempt of a student of a film school. Then he tries to be erotic but appears as awkward as the first attempt of a virgin. Finally, it tries to be cruel and captivating, but aside from Kinski's performance - powerful but remarkably misplaced in the midst of amateur melodrama - it's as striking as your hand around a wet noodle (an appropriate metaphor matters given the non-eroticism this film is). He presents a blowjob scene even more confident than that of ChloÃ« Sevigny in The Brown Bunny. Flee now while you are lucky. Rather, look for a lingerie catalog Victoria's Secret - it's more artistic AND more erotic than this tripe.
