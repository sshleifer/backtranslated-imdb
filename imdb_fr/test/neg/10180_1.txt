This is the third movie in a month that I watched and did not go as planned. The first two being The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, who gave no new idea of ​​who committed the crimes. <br /> <br /> I have always been fascinated by UFOs and I was so excited to see a new film about a UFO investigation that was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes, everything went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> I could have represented the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if only there was a good story about the UFO hunt, but not here. I'm not saying that there was something wrong with the subject, but Netflix has pushed this film as a skeptic about UFOs and a UFO believer investigating multiple sessions. <br /> <br /> I stopped looking halfway. I can not believe I lost so much time with this one. Please do not make the same mistake I made.
