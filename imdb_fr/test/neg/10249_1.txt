... what would a porn movie look like if you get out of sex and you stay in the wrong dialogue, inexpensive sets and bad acting, you would have Galaxina. <br /> <br /> Star Wars has proven that there is a market for science fiction. This in turn leads to some gems such as Alien and a revitalized Star Trek. Unfortunately, this also led to bad movies, and this one was obviously one of them. (I say of course, because I had never heard of this movie until a few days ago, it escaped me when it came out in 1980.) <br /> <br /> Here is the problem underlying. Dorothy Stratton could not play, so for most of the movie, they did not even let her try. I understand that his tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status, but I do not understand why. The film has clearly tried to falsify Star Wars, Star Trek and Aliens, but they clearly do not understand that when you usurp something, it must be funny! This movie was not, or at least, the comic timing on jokes that could have been funny was not. Science fiction is ripe for parody, as shown by Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest. This film, however, did it badly.
