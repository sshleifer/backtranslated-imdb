Robert Downey Jr. in a wig and a 17th century dress was enough to make me shudder, but I could not believe that a great actor like Sam Neill actually took part in this movie. The whole thing was amazing. I particularly like Merivel's "cure" for fools. They dance ... and presto! everyone is happy and they are all better! I guess I just did not like the character of Merivel. Therefore, watching an entire movie about his supposed transition from a prostituted jester to a great doctor was grueling. <br /> <br /> Besides, I'm not quite sure, but I did not think that the plague as well as the famous London fire had occurred simultaneously.
