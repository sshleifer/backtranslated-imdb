Deanna Troi Naked! <br /> <br /> Richie's brother, Chuck (from "Happy Days") with an inverted Mohawk! <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 has all this and more, including a clever scene where Chuck Bronson's character sets up a mousetrap like a punk-like device when he opens the window. <br /> <br /> Chuck also places a picture with a handful of nails on the floor near another window and smiles on his return and sees bloody prints moving away. <br /> <br /> All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it's one of the most incomprehensible "serious" movies I've ever seen - loaded to extremes with chaos and a near-zero police reaction, despite the use of military weapons to mow punks. <br /> <br /> From what I understood, Bronson disavowed this film, but fortunately cashed Golan Globus's check. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy quality movies, avoid this one, but if you like a "Jackass" thrill, take a look at it.
