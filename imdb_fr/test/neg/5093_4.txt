I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but unfortunately it did not fit the wait. <br /> <br /> A good movie asks the audience to identify / sympathize / sympathize with the main actor. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to do with Samantha Morton. <br /> <br /> The story seemed very disjointed and did not flow as it should / could have been done. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland seemed to be a little more than the decoration of the window and made me wonder why he agreed to play what seemed a little part. The beautiful scenery and the cast of actors Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis were pretty much the only benefit. <br /> <br /> Maybe being a kiwi, I set the bar higher for locally made films. Maybe the change of director / so-called tough to work with the main actor has skewed my opinion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just trying to find excuses for a film that could have been great. <br /> <br /> Many maybes that still do not explain why this movie just lacked something special. <br /> <br /> It could have been great, it was not.
