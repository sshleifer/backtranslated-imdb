I was greatly disappointed by the quality of this documentary. The content is poorly produced, a video of very poor quality and, in particular, a terrible sound. There is very little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and virtually no examples of direct connection to later or contemporary electronic music. Interviews with people who knew Bruce Haack are ad hoc, mostly inarticulate fools. Too much yak and not enough Haack. Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and I pay more than average attention, even for slow and / or difficult subjects, I fell asleep watching this documentary and had to see it again to see the parts I crossed. If you look at this, make sure you are well configured before you watch, like Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Bruce Haack deserves a lot better than that. Shame on the producer and director.
