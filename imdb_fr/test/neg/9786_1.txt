Nine out of nine people who watched this movie declared themselves mentally scarred for life. Nobody should ever have to see this abomination. The English language is ill-equipped to express how terrible this "film" is. It's really not worth the plastic it's made of. No more serious crimes have been committed by the human race throughout the history of creation. never is there a chance that the situation is worse. <br /> <br /> It was unanimously agreed that the scene featuring Tommy's shrunken head and the girl's blouse was incredibly sick and twisted; In fact, many of us have not yet recovered from this ordeal and are currently sitting in a corner of the room swaying, sucking our thumbs and moaning. <br /> <br /> The fundamental question on all lips, however, must be "Why ???". How is it possible for anyone to create such a monstrosity and then submit it to so many innocent people? After watching the trailer, we thought this movie could make you laugh: how wrong we were. <br /> <br /> Thank you for signing the petition to rid the world of "Shrunken Heads" so that no other poor civilian is exposed to it. Please, for the sake of humanity.
