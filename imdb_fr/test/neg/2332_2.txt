Commenting or reviewing a movie like this is an inherent problem. I remember feeling the same after hating Dogma. If you do not like a film as strange and controversial as Dr. Mulholland, you are perceived as "not understanding it". Of course, for those who have already seen this movie, you know that the problem is not understood. <br /> <br /> I learned from different sources that the unique and likeable aspect of this film is a dream-like the quality it has. In other words, the plot is not structured like other movies. With the case of Mulholland Dr., this is more like a fuzzy collage made by a third-year boy who wavered until the last second to realize his artistic project. It does not make sense, it's not supposed to be, but I know it was primarily a television series. It seems that Lynch had a pile of unused film and decided to crush it with a lot of new things. You will notice that towards the end, nudity, sex and foul language increase. All the things he would not have filmed for television. <br /> <br /> To rent a better movie that is not told in a linear and traditional way, rent The Thin Red Line from 1998. It was a great movie, it's not. Rating: 2 out of 10
