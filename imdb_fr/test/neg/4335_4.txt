Ben Stryker, a former green beret, stops in a small town called Agua Dolee to visit an old friend Tick Rand. Shortly after arriving in town on his Suzuki and settling down. A group of bikers known as "The Savages", led by the tyrant Pigiron, invades and eventually takes the place. Stryker does not want to get involved, but it changes when his friends become the target. <br /> <br /> Is there anything positive to say about this fuzzy object? A difficult call, because the only fundamental reason for looking at this low-budget car wreck is for the formidable b-cast that the crew managed to retain for this project. Although I do not think it's a complete job, it's not very good either. Now, what a casting! Lance Henriksen (being the main character, he is strangely not the star, but the last), Karen Black, George Kennedy, Richard Lynch, Bill Forsythe, Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon. Now, what was wrong with this shabby bungle on a budget? The superficiality of the material is too one-dimensional to borrow strongly from the ideas of better films (especially Mad Max) and create a complete mess of ideas that do not just gel and that could have been better thought. The shots used can be manipulated to give a good view, even if they are predictable, but "Savage Dawn" seems to let it go in haste without leaving the viewer to impregnate. The actors are mostly wasted in roles of nothing. Henriksen, a whitened blonde, is very strong and despite his appreciative presence, he gives an enigmatic glow to his character. He does not get up very much and sometimes disappears in battle. Too much action on the sidelines, but when he kicked the ass of some bikers, the good times have passed. Karen Black's whistling performance is very strange and concerns howling and cursing. Even though she is taking part in a memorable cat fight with Katie, Claudia Udy's flirtatious flirtatious character. George Kennedy, in a wheelchair, wanders about until the final assault and Richard Lynch looks embarrassed as a lost priest / mayor of the city in a very redundant role. A state-of-the-art Bill Forsythe simply recounts it as the big hocho of the notorious biker group. <br /> <br /> The junky story (written by William Milling and Max Bloom) has this comic strip feel and is very influenced by the western genre. Just look at the bad guys for that. How they found their names is a mystery. Maybe they pulled them from a hat. This is second-rate material that moves most of the time from one scene to another. Funny comic elements are inserted and a little mischief. Exploitation that does not become serious enough and the dead are quite laughable. An awkward script is full of complicated details and unbearable banalities. The unequal direction of Simon Nuchtern was in numbers and lukewarm. One or two intense scenes can not wear makeup for its turtle rhythm and its many stunts. Cardboard games looked depressed and dirty, but lacked organic sense. Gerald Feil's gravel-like cinematography was better managed when the main focus was not to focus on the city, but on the sorry background (like the climax of the beginning and end of the film) with a few touches apparatus. Pino Donaggio's clumsy musical choices are drowned out by his own incompetence. <br /> <br /> "Savage Dawn" is a forgotten midnight film that is missing forever. There are exercises of the same kind that are more effective and more convincing.
