How can you make a totally unattractive movie from a story of one of America's most famous writers? Watch this movie and find out. I may be crushing author Carson McCullers, but I was impressed by "The heart is a lonely hunter" and I was hoping for something memorable here too. Leave it alone. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave looks like a man with a short haircut and clothes. Anyway, I've never found her very enthusiastic in almost every movie. Rod Steiger as a preacher? How is this insulting? Incomparable characters, one after the other. Well, maybe it's the book too, and I'm unfair to this movie. I do not know the story other than what I saw on the screen and it was such an unattractive film that I could never recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> It's just one person after another in a backward city. Apart from a beautiful cinematography here and there, there is nothing to recommend. It's amazing how someone can sit for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> I did not even explain how much it was directed. There is good news: it's the only movie directed by Simon Cowell.
