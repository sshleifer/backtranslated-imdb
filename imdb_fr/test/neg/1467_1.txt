If you want to see the worst film ever made, look no further. Some miserable movies are watchable because they are unintentionally funny. Alas, American Movie has no wit, no unintentional humor, just obscenities considered by its director as laughable. <br /> <br /> For those who liked this film, I suggest you watch Kevin Smith's "Clerks" in similar tones. At Clerks, you'll find creativity, wit and fun, all on a budget. This should make you forget this hideous effort.
