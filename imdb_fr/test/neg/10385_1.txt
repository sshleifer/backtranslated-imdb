While the metaphorical flies fled this watery and wet stool of a movie, I found myself joining them. <br /> <br /> From the first sentences, you quickly realize that the actors are without talent. The script editor was probably dead and the director should be dead. To be honest, I was not able to finish this film because about thirty dark minutes under the eyes of the main actress swaying like a Shetland pony in the ass was too hard for me to endure. <Br/> <br /> I've never seen, and I mean ever, a movie as sweaty as this one and I watch tons of crappy movies. <br /> <br /> Turd.
