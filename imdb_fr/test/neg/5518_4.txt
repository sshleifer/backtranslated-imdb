Composed to perfection of recycled film sequences, music and ideas, this film can not really be called "good". But for me, when I watched her as a teenager, it was pretty funny. (I did not know BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS before.) In retrospect, he has something nostalgic about the SF wave of the early eighties and the special effects of that era. Its disorderly appearance and its naivete give it a certain attraction. To enjoy this film, I recommend focusing on the paternal relationship between the characters of Vince Edwards and David Mendenhall. In addition, I liked the idea that a group of villains discovered her heroic qualities after being involuntarily confronted with the challenge of caring for a child.
