... and it says something. No matter how difficult a film is, I'm normally able to watch it to judge the full movie. Thanks to this one, I did it about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the DVD, or maybe my laptop, but I could not hear the dialogue, even if the volume was at maximum. The sound effects were good, so with the volume increased to hear the dialogue, I blew my eardrums with the effects. Even if I wanted to carry out this project, I was not going to sacrifice the audience. <br /> <br /> From all I could say about the plot, the movie was a big flashback from the public. the girl of the character. It seems that the mother, a military pilot, had to flee her ship because the only person aboard the ship she trusted proved to be the enemy and is now pursuing her on a desert planet. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked in the movie was the look of the main character; There was something I liked about her hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Well, it looks like this one goes into the dumpster ...
