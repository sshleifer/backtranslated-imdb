Everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me go hunting. <br /> <br /> Forced frivolity. Underproduction artists work hard to have fun so you can have fun. The brilliant Meryl Streep makes an excellent test. Pierce Brosnan is simply embarrassing. Inexplicably put on a Greek island. Many women screaming and screaming. A lot. <br /> <br /> It was a silly musical on a jukebox scene, now it's a big, big-splashy, badly-turned music scene. If you like ABBA, otherwise, an aggression of the senses and an insult to the intelligence that you have left when you leave the theater. I willingly admit that I did not really want to see this film and that I went there with friends who wanted it, but for God's sake. Why is my cock screaming and screaming to convey joy? Have you ever been sitting next to a table of women who have drunk too much and who are absolutely determined to spend an excellent evening in town? This is the feeling of all this project. I felt so good when it stopped.
