The Bone Collector is set in New York City and begins as one of the world's leading criminology and crime scene experts. Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident that leaves him a bed-ridden quadriplegic. Four years later, Alan (Gary Swanson) and his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped soon after New York cop Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is called to a crime scene and finds the body buried and mutilated Alan. Amelia notices unusual evidence at the crime scene and takes note of it, which impresses Rhyme when asked to work on the case. He quickly realizes that the evidence is in fact enigmatic clues to where Lindsay is. After discovering the clues, the police arrived too late to save her, but this is just the beginning, as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill and leave rhyme and medico-legal clues to her. police ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Phillip Noyce I watched The Bone Collector last night and I must say it's one of the worst big budgets after The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers I saw. In fact, this is Friday the 13th (1980)) look sophisticated and realistic! Jeremy Iacone's script is based on Jeffery Deaver's book and is so poor on so many levels that I'm not sure where to start. For starters, this is taken seriously and it makes all other faults appear twice as serious. The characters are really awful and I did not think any of them were real human beings. First we have Lincoln Rhyme, who is paralyzed from neck to foot and the script does not allow him much, but in reality, he can literally do nothing but stay in bed for the entire movie. He is apparently impressed by Amelia because she stopped a train and thought that a fresh print near a murderer might be useful. I'm not funny here, but would not a policeman realize that an imprint near a murder victim could be helpful? Why is he so impressed by her? Then there is Capatin Cheney, who is not only implausible and shouts against everyone for no apparent reason, but he is so incompetent that he has failed to associate several murders committed in a short time, each victim having suffered surgical cuts of his body, how exactly did this guy become a police captain? Then there is the murderer whose motives are less than plausible, are you trying to tell me that they have elaborated a complex plan to murder at least seven people, because they spent six years in prison for something they have actually committed? If they wanted to get revenge on Rhyme, why did they kill anyone who had no connection to anything, maybe I could almost buy someone who would take revenge on whoever put them on However, not to kill several other people who have no connection with themselves, the targeted target rhymes with something else. Moreover, having developed a complex plan to kill these people and get away with it, they suddenly become the most stupid person in history, because despite holding a large knife and being able to walk and use their arms, they are actually defeated and almost killed by a quadriplegic. who has no movement in his body below his neck! How did it happen? I should also mention Amelia, who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take pictures of crime scenes and shoot rats for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Besides some of the worst written characters of all time, history and plot is not much better. We never find out why the murderer is inspired by The Bone Collector. We never find out why the killer was taking shreds of flesh from his victims. He has never explained why a rookie police officer like Amelia is allowed to enter the crime scene even before the relevant forensic science teams are created. There is no reason given for which the killer chooses his victims. Also, the hints of killers are a little obscure, are not they? I mean a blood bone and shaved rat hair? Logically, how are we going to go from bone and rat hair to the exact location of the next victim and choose from all of New York? There's nonsense about a bird sitting on the window sill of Rhymes, which is totally random and at almost two o'clock, Bone Collector is really slow. There are so many problems with The Bone Collector and the result is one of the worst scripts of all time, it is atrocious at all levels and has no credibility. Apparently Angelina Jolie said she shot nude scenes for this film, but they were cut off because they seemed too embarrassing. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of about $ 48,000,000, The Bone Collector is well done with good value production & that Hollywood slips on it. I must also add now that I think Angelina Jolie is giving one of the worst performances I've ever seen, I think she's absolutely terrible about that. Denzel Washington is really lying, Queen Latifah is awful and even Michael Rooker can not do much, so much is taken with a cliche and one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> The bone collector must be one of the worst Hollywood films I've seen in a long time, I saw them free on TV last night and I always feel cheated and scammed. There is so much to do to make it ridiculous, embarrassing or so terribly embarrassing? Work anyway to be honest ...
