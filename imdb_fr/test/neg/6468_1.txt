I really do not know how we could give this movie a 10 (or even more than a 2!). It's full of bad lines, bad acting, bad slapstick, etc. I had never thought that I could see a worse acting than the deliberately misunderstood scenes from the beginning of UHF, but that was it. And just when you think it can not be worse, it is! Again and again! You could have watched that in a theater? It was not worth it to be free on TV! My 4 year old and 1 year old loved it, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never lit.
