We all have to start somewhere, it's in movies like Escape In The Fog that someone like Budd Boetticher was able to learn his craft before producing good movies. In fact, the film was dated even before it was released on June 25, 1945. <br /> <br /> The war in Europe was over for almost two months. Of course, even Harry Cohn could not control the events in the story. So I wonder why, even then, the public was not wondering why a Nazi spy ring was helping the Japanese. Another very bad historical inaccuracy is that the FBI has nothing to do with the Pacific Theater or Asia. The cloak and the dagger were the territory of the OSS in this part of the world. <br /> <br /> When you're an FBI man like William Wright, it's nice to have a psychic girlfriend like Nina Foch. He is about to go on a mission to the East to pronounce the names of clandestine leaders in order to trigger a general uprising in China against the Japanese occupation. The Germans who disturbed the house of Otto Kruger have heard about it and the whole film is spent with these guys who have already lost the war trying to help their allies. By the way, they refer to "Japs". When Foch is swept by a high-speed car and stunned, he dreams of Wright's danger and sees what will happen to him on the Golden Gate Bridge. She goes there and foils the plot. <br /> <br /> Everything you expect from a good movie is there, the foggy atmosphere of San Francisco, the dimly lit decorations, Budd Boetticher did his best, just like the actors. But they were just not convincing, probably because they did not believe that in themselves. <br /> <br /> It is possible, but it is unlikely that Nina Foch's dream and its psychic consequences were more developed and left on the floor of the cutting room. I think it was just an ugly scenario. <br /> <br /> And Budd and Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures have been confronted with the fast-paced events happening here.
