It is an extremely technically competent film. The work of the camera and the staging are excellent and the acting is also very good, especially that of Daniel Auteuil as a marquis. I really thought there was no problem with these aspects of the film. Instead, I was a little annoyed by the way the Marquis was portrayed, as it did not sound so honest and seemed like a very revisionist view of history. In fact, over the last few years, the Marquis turned himself into a defender of liberty with great insight, and not as a sadomasochistic big rapist he was. In a way, this is a reminder of the whitewash given in THE PEOPLE VERSUS LARRY FLINT - where these men are raised to the status of heroes. Even if you do not think that the Marquis's perversions were not so bad (they included extreme rape and violence), his portrayal in this movie as a "sex worker" in this prison seems pretty ridiculous. Instead of Sade, violent and selfish, he spends a lot of time caring for a young virgin and slowly helps him explore his own sensuality. What a nice and kind man. In fact, now that I think about it, this performance makes me think of the man Maurice Chavalier played in GIGI (but without singing) - a cute old man who loves ladies. I very much doubt that the Marquis de Sade recognized this character! <br /> <br /> The film, surprisingly, does not have much nudity, even if it is extremely explicit. Only a maniac would let their children see him because it's a very adult drama. It is very well done and very amusing - but not quite true. The director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview among the special reports of the DVD I watched. So go ahead and watch the movie if you want - understand that it's not very good historically. In the 18th century, sexual libertines were quite accepted in France because they were rather broad-minded. Despite what the film implies, it is not SEX that is in question, but violence and rape that were (and still are) the problem.
