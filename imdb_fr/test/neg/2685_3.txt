This movie was unfortunately terrible. <br /> <br /> The clich√©, the tired words, the dialogues on stilts and the play of the actors make it almost unassailable. <br /> <br /> The well-being finale is ridiculously lame. <br /> <br /> There is a reason why Judge Reinhold's career has disappeared. <br /> <br /> If you do not live in New York and you are not Jewish, many jokes will be impenetrable. <br /> <br /> Me too, I found it very insulting the need for the unconfessed lesbian girl to get straight to the point. <br /> <br /> I just can not understand how popular this movie was at festivals. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.
