There is no Esperanto in this movie <br /> <br /> I watched this movie specifically because IMDb lists Esperanto as one of the languages ​​used. But IMDb is mistaken about the languages ​​used in this film. There is absolutely no Esperanto. It's almost all English with a few words from Navajo. Do not watch this movie if you are looking for Esperanto movies. The other options instead are "Idiot's Delight" (with Clark Gable) who has some Esperanto, "Incubus" is all Esperanto (although completely mis-pronounced), and there are Esperanto street signs in "The Great Dictator "of Charlie Chaplin. There was supposed to be an Esperanto spoken to "Gattaca" as well, but I have never heard of it. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the other critic is right. This film is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> Spend your time elsewhere.
