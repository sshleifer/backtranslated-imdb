This junk was as much like a novel as a cucumber pickle. The filmmakers removed the Alamo section of the book, made a film and said that it was based on the book. Hah! Wondering what they did to encourage Mr. Michener to approve that piece of fluff? It was just another flintlock rifle Davy Crockett, Santa Ana, 13 days of poppy glory collecting. I almost started to root for the Mexicans, just to end this damn thing. And what was this scene where Stacey Keach was trying to convince James Bowie to let him look at the knife? The sexual insinuations he used were juvenile and useless. They could have used the film they lost with this foolishness to establish a real dialogue. This show was an embarrassment for Hollywood. Or can these clowns be embarrassed?
