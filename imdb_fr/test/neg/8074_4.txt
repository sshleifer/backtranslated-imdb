The movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of Stooges. The story is told from the point of view of Moe Howard and his relationship with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, as well as their long friendship with Larry Fine. The film mainly deals with the ups and downs of the decade of stooges. The casting director and the makeup artist looked for actors who looked like the famous ensemble. The actor who plays "Curly" Howard did a great job in describing the antics on camera of the beloved Stooge. A must for all fans of Three Stooges Shorts.
