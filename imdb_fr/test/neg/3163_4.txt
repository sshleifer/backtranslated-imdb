Frankly, I met the real Han Su Ying before and saw her played by an American actress who does not look like anything from the Chinese who makes me turn my head while I watch this movie Why Hollywood can not she get Nancy Kwan instead ... true to the story ... because God ... Dr. Han Su Ying is Chinese, I know, I met her in person <br /> <br /> and I look at all the actors. ... so few Asians Faces in a film about an Asian love story also make me wonder <br /> <br /> I think the acting is good, but without Asian faces in a story of Asian love makes the plot so corny and a bunch of Baloney <br /> <br /> It's like another movie I know of "THE CONQUEROR", imagine my eyes coming out when I see John Wayne under the name of Genghis Khan !!!!! <br /> <br /> and the situation is worse. ... how can a man born in a MONGOLIAN STEPPES have a Southern Alabama accent ??? !! and a cheap imitation of all that is Asian <br /> <br /> Good grief <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised to see Dr. Martin Luther King one day played by one of the boys in the group Black and minstrel show <br /> <br /> I'd love to see that <br /> <br /> and laugh all over the roof !!! <br /> <br /> Cheers
