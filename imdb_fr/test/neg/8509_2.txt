If you have not read Tolkien's masterpiece; get ready for perhaps the best movie experience of all time! If you have ... After reading the books several times, over many years, I learned to love the characters and their story, and I feel like I know it intimately. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the character gallery. So, for me, the movie was a disappointment. Why? It dictates (inevitably) the appearance of the characters, it modifies the events, it removes the important scenario, it removes the unimportant scenario. The great pieces of what makes The Lord of the Rings what it is, are simply ignored. Even the special effects of 2001 can not do justice to Tolkien's (and yours) imagination. Peter Jackson honestly tried the impossible and I think no one else could do it better! But the fact remains, I regret to see the film. The next time I read The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson's limited vision will leap forward, not mine.
