The film "Hypocrites" by Lois Weber was and still is a very bold and daring film. I enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and its history. The priest sees the hypocrisy of people in his church and tries to show them the truth "naked". People are dismayed when he reveals the naked statue describing the truth, after not having driven it and the few who did it, helped them along the way. People do not want to face the truth that they are doing something wrong, but it shows them to put things in front of God, to go to beach parties by acting inappropriately, with their materialistic manners and other things in which the people of our world tend not to be morally right. In the end, for lack of followers, he must enter the gates of heaven alone. This film seems to me very daring, in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout this one, especially considering the period during which this film was realized. The images and symbolism described in this film seemed incredible to me. The way they made the woman nude translucent and using a nude woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art. Showing the different sins of people as they walked the streets and refused to follow, each with different excuses, failures and / or higher priorities, was a great way to represent the people of today. This film is very successful in getting the moral message to its audience. Lois Weber has a great way to capture the attention of her audience with her creativity, symbolism, visual and sound elements. Even the piano music throughout this film is very beautiful and fits the whole theme.
