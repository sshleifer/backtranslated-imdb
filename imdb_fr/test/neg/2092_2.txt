"CLOSE THE FRONT DOOR" That's what I said when I was told that Blockbuster had a new movie called Snakes on a Train. Ok, maybe that's not exactly what I said, but you understand the point. I did not need to know who was in the movie or anything else. All I knew was that I rent this movie. <br /> <br /> I probably should have asked what it was. In retrospect, I do not know if I really wanted to watch a movie about a Mayan curse that caused a woman to give birth to snakes and spit them out of her mouth. I would not want to see a movie featuring a guy who looks rather oddly like a pedophile version of Leif Garrett. there remained the promise that these boring characters would be eaten or at least killed by snakes. So, I was ready to spend the first hour of very little except a Texas Ranger forcing a girl to make a nice little nipple to keep her cocaine, or the Hispanic shaman who sometimes likes to stab people. But then, hell broke loose and the girl started spitting out more and more snakes. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * So all is well in the end, and I'm ready to forget the fact that some of these snakes have suddenly reached 25 feet long. After all, people are being eaten, so everything is fine. But all of a sudden, and I'm not going to tell you how, because that would spoil the best, one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. Then he presses and devours the train, with all the graphic art of Serpentaur from the old cartoons of GI Joe. Unfortunately, I could not establish a connection with Nemesis Enforcer with this movie. In any case, one might think that a snake as big as a train would be unstoppable. Not if you know your Mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from the sky. Yes, that's all I'm going to say about it. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is bad. Really bad to the point where you could be numb after watching this, or your brain could be hurt. I did not give him one, because no matter how stupid he was, it was not as bad as Date Movie. So, if you like camp or badly constructed horror movies B, this is the one that suits you. If you think it will be really cool like its bigger and more infamous brethren, stay away from the box if you see it. And I leave you with a quote from the movie that should summarize the whole thing. <br /> <br /> "Snakes can not get on a train!" Because it's just stupid. Not as if they were making stops or anything ....
