The original film The Road House was a classic film of the 80s that, although it did not deserve to be written or performed in the theater, was a very enjoyable and popular film, thanks in large part to the presence of star Patrick Swayze and the mass market 16 years later, MGM / Sony is trying to recreate the magic that has left us all by citing a single lining and reciting the three rules of the rebound ... with A film that quotes all the best original films and recites the three rules. <br /> <br /> If it was a film made by amateur fans, it would be considered a loving tribute to one of Swayze's most popular films. As a professional-quality film, it falls flat in the Bargin Bin DVD, with its continued reuse of lines and plot from the original film becoming an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than fresh references to the original . <That said, with new lines such as "I'm going to kill you like I'm killing your dad", it's no wonder the writers have decided to overhaul much of the original storyline. <br /> <br /> I knew it would never be special, being a DVD sequel, but I had at least hoped that there might be some new ideas and new elements included to be at the height of the name Road House, but get is simply a remake of the same film dating back to 2006, to which we added a few narcotics. <br /> <br /> If I had been the director, I would have deleted all the references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original. and they are characters. As things stand now, Patrick Swayze's character is supposed to be dead (lame by Jake Busey), and his brother and son are now the main characters, who strangely have completely different last names. . <br /> <br /> My favorite part was that Dalton's "son" was driving the same car as his father, a really cool tribute, even though it was ruined later if the car had reached its end EXACTLY from the same way as its predecessor. This is a good example of how this film goes too far by including sequences and ideas from the 89 movie. <br /> <br /> And of course, who can forget the legendary moment when Wild Bill promises to kill Shane "as I killed your father" and then try to send it in a completely different way. Amazing writing there. I see that Schaech is listed as a co-writer. Stick to it or, preferably, nothing. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an acceptable movie if there is nothing else to watch and you want to turn off your brain for an hour and a half or I have not seen the first Road House, but fans of the classic Swayze will be totally disappointed, to the point of feeling insulted by the fact that this film is a real scam. As someone has already suggested as an alternative subtitle for this movie, "Even Jeff Healy is happy not to see this one!" Stay true to the original Road House and relive the good old days of Swayze!
