Well, how to start? I saw The Italian Job for the first time a few years ago and during a visit to a rental store, I did not know why I had a bad feeling. Now, I do it. <br /> <br /> After voting for the ratings of this movie, I saw the statistics. Apparently, this film appeals especially to girls under 18 years. Not surprising. They did not pay enough for Charlize to flash and I guess a girls magazine called Mark Wahlbergs abs "AWESOME". <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that this film is totally predictable, the actors are mostly still B stars and even the good ones are used in a horrible way, the film is filled with an obvious product placement and imagine it: it even manages to repeat itself without doing away! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the movie and everything is downhill from there. Once that was understood, they decided to use the best time again at the end to repeat their golden flight in detail. Overall, a lot of noise for nothing. <br /> <br /> I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more like he was before. Aside from Donald Sutherland's "look, I'm here too" appearing at the beginning, I'd say this movie should have a "pass if you're over 18".
