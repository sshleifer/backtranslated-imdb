I have this movie in a basket of bargains, hoping for a bad movie fun. Boy was disappointed. (except for avon.) You see, the movie is really horrible, but so horrible, it's not even laughable. The plot, oh wait, there is no plot. I suppose you could say that this is the main character who gets into the ranks of street fighting. At the end of the film, the filmmakers decided to no longer make sense or, more likely, to die and let a monkey finish the film. DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE END OF SPOILED! although the end does not spoil anything. The main character ends up in a room filled with mirrors, like the Enter The Dragon, then gets angry, has a stupid flashback and hits a mirror. The end. Wheeee. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor in this film was Avon's scene. He talks to the leader of street fighting and says something like, "Do not worry about him anymore, sir, I killed him in a sophisticated way, we had a lot of fun, and then I killed him." how well the boss says "good job avon.You are number 1." And Avon says, "Number 1! Alllriiiiight! Alriiight!" The scene continues with avon continuing to say "everyone!" again and again. The next scene is that of a dead Avon floating in a pool. Intelligent? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Finally, I own the "Homeboy" version of this movie, which means that the title of the box I own is "Homeboy". It shows a huge guy holding a giant gun and shouting. It never happens in the movie. This man is never in the movie. High quality. <br /> <br /> Note - I'm new to this exam, but hey, I'll keep it.
