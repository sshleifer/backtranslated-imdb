Congratulations to Baxley's PDD for making this movie look like a real movie, the first time this happens in this series (with the notable exception of F / X scenes). By moving closer to film production values, however, he lost most of the entertainment value of the top two. They were really in the category of movies "so bad they are good". Can one argue that "believers" were simply trying to make a generic action film in which he prayed? There are so many times in the film where they give up their own belief system that they are boring. If all that is going on is God's will and only its instruments, then do people infected with the virus have the same goal, right? Apply this to all situations in which a person of faith does not submit to the will of God and you get a rather hypocritical little film from Action Jackson's director.
