ATTENTION SPOILER: At the end of the film, it is announced that the bridge collapsed just days after its capture. The impression is that the attack was for nothing. In fact, taking the bridge at Remagen was the last major victory for the Western Allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies had been trying for six months. The Remagen Bridge having been borrowed, the war ended in just a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The bridge must last only one day after its capture. It was enough time for the Americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side, and they could then start building a series of pontoon bridges. The taking of the bridge was a complete success and meant that the end of the war was near and would not last all summer. Contrary to the cynical nature of the film, the victory was proclaimed exalted by the troops who made it. They knew how vital the battle was. <br /> <br /> This film has little to do with the real story. It was rather a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced.
