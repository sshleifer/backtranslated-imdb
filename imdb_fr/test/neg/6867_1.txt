The idea is good, spoiled by the judges. <br /> <br /> Why make fun of people? if what the inventors say is true and, as most of them say, they have spent their lives saving the invention, the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun of the people. <br /> <br /> shows when they want to accept an idea from the crier they added to the judges. <br /> <br /> The only one I respect judges is the one who is always sitting right on the table, he is a respectable person <br /> <br /> of course the English snob who claims to be a man business, wearing a suite does not make you a friend <br /> <br /> last but not least, the big guy who sits between the English and the crier. Wake up man, there is no work called and inventor to call you one. an inventor is an attribute and not a businessman. <br /> <br /> I think they wanted to add someone like Simon, of the American idol, they thought it worked out there, it can work here too. the context is different and the idea is totally different. <br /> <br /> it's a good idea and they could have done well if they did not change the judges and suppress their behavior and attitude. <br /> <br /> Stop making fun of people.
