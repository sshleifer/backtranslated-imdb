I loved it so much All the dogs go to paradise that I went to see the movie suite and I do not remember being more disappointed by a movie. The story stank worse than a bag of manure too old. I mean, come on! How could Carface imagine being able to take revenge on an animal so much bigger than him, no matter how angry? More portraying Satan as a cat?!?! How can you get a snapshot? So much for the story. Is it any wonder Don Bluth, Burt Reynolds, Melba Moore and Vic Tayback do not touch him with a 10-foot pole? The animation was absolutely miserable. All the colors have been faded and I can not count the number of times I have seen through objects supposed to be solid. It must have been the worst animation I have ever seen! I usually like animation movies, but not this BOMB!
