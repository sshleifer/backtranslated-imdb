First of all, I personally love Demons and Demons 2, I saw them although it was difficult to find good horrors without a good official movie distributed in Russia when I was a kid and it's an immutable part of my childhood. Then I did not hear anything about Mr. Bava. Then I saw his ghost son. Well, it's definitely not a good return! Why was the main character, whom we never really knew at least to be like him, an accident in the middle of a deserted road? Why do African servants say such stupid and stupid things about the human soul? Why is the plot so primitive? Have not we seen enough ghosts for 100 years of film production? It is clear that Lamberto Bava has nothing to show us so far. Too bad.
