People call a "party line" 976 to talk dirty to strangers and perhaps meet for a sexual affair. A deranged, somewhat incestuous sister and an occasional cross-dresser use this line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they do not discriminate! A pair of 16-year-old girls also call the line for fun, posing as an older man, of course.

He teams up with an Assistant District Attorney. <br /> <br /> Nothing special here. Richard Roundtree has little more than a role of chief of police. An actress is 16 years old.
