If you want to see someone accidentally eating another man's testicle, or watching a series of pathetic pretense during a wedding, or listening to a man tell how nice it is to sleep with a girl while she vomits, so that's the movie for you. Alternating, fashionable, a romantic comedy and disproportionate, Tomcats is certainly interesting. The charming Jaime Pressly plays the wife of Horatio Sanz (tell me another) who finds herself in many silhouettes with other women, but surprisingly, there is no nudity. Jake Busey is completely revolting in hunting dog that you would not want to become your friend. Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell are good and make a convincing couple, but the movie is far too busy trying to disgust to be good.
