... This one is just not worth the price of a movie ticket. What these filmmakers did can not be properly called instead, they simply chose sixteen students of a certain diversity (but not as much as the critics suggested) and left them free. The results are, to be frank and brutal, much more often boring, complacent, too grumpy and shocking than really insightful. <br /> <br /> There are of course moments of recognition and identification of the genre This is only possible in a documentary film, but overall, there is not much more truth only in "Bully" or, in this case, a decent television documentary of the same kind. Although the film is about sexual diversity, sexual diversity and racism, the film does not bring anything to the table that is useful to anyone who has seriously thought about one or other of these issues. And while some segments are useless, except to bring some comic relief (certainly welcome), most of the time, the five-minute limit does not let emotions get involved with either students. An interesting idea, but congratulations for CHAIN ​​CAMERA.
