Yes, the title line actually appears in this movie. Why? I am not sure. When the reply was said, did not a member of the crew who filmed laugh at some point? I would have liked to see the excerpts of this movie, mainly because I think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Helmed by director Jim Gillespie, "I know what you did last summer," comes a slasher teen movie that seems to assume that we have never seen a slasher movie before. Of course, you must not blame everything. There are also three responsible authors, and this is somehow based on a video game that is still in production. The title of this game is "Backwater", but looking for information about it, I found absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> And so we start the movie ... I would like to say before continuing. I did not expect it to win an Oscar. When I'm in the right frame of mind, I enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time. I think there is an opportunity for an effective, original and intelligent slasher film. "Venom" is not this movie. <br /> <br /> There is almost no character development at all. It is very good. You do not expect much. However, instead of a tightly knit cast, this film decides to present us with the following many horror movie clich√© characters ... <br /> <br /> 1. The Final Girl: She just broke up for her boy friend. This means that at some point in the movie, when they are in danger, they will decide to get back together. Which means more than likely that he will die and be the last survivor of the film. "Eden" is played by Agnes Bruckner, without much enthusiasm, I might add. <br /> <br /> 2. The boyfriend: He's about to coexist with The Final Girl until he disappears. Of course, he can save her, but he is doomed and we know it. "Eric" is played by Jonathan Jackson. <br /> <br /> 3. The Bimbos: Usually horror movies only need one of them, but here we have two. They shoplifter, they steal, they can show their breasts (not in this case), or they can be alcoholics. A staple of the genre. They also walk in dimly lit places, all by themselves, usually saying things like, "Hello, is there anyone there?" "Tammy" and "Patty", so named, are performed by Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwood. <br /> <br /> 4. The Jackass: Of course, he looks pretty, but it's the idiot of the movie that is inserted only to be an idiot. He says stupid things, does stupid things, obviously has never seen a horror movie, and it's one of the funniest movies you watch that kind of thing. "Sean" is played by D.J. Cotrona. <br /> <br /> 5. The girlfriend: She loves Jackass, even if just about everyone, and she usually stayed alive for a while, so she can scream and cry until she it starts to stumble and gets left behind. "Rachel" is played by Laura Ramsey. <br /> <br /> 6. The scary guardian: In this case, the attendant at the scary gas station. Enough said. "Ray" is played by Rick Cramer. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you understand. The remaining characters are not so common because they are also deadly. There is "The Gay Guy" (Pawel Szajda as "Ricky") that has been permanently stolen regarding the time spent in front of a screen and "The one who knows what's going on". Of course, that does not matter, because in the beginning, everyone always thinks it's crazy. "Cece" is played by Meagan Good. <br /> <br /> There are a few other characters, including a deputy played by Method Man, but he and others are killed fairly quickly and get even less character development compared to the following shots. <br /> <br /> So you probably think, "Why does this film require such in-depth analysis?" It's just a summer horror film, to cry aloud! " On the basis of this question, does he deliver the goods? Yes and no. The acting is not particularly convincing, even considering the number of talents involved. Bijou Phillips was hailed for her performance in Larry Clark's Bully and Agnes Bruckner has been a promising talent for quite some time now. <br /> <br /> So what about gore? There are some. It's really about it. Many of the juiciest pieces are cut-aways. This is a scene featuring someone's face and a sander used to remove paint from cars. <br /> <br /> To the credit of the filmmaker, there are two interesting scenes. I liked the case where part of the house was literally torn off so that the unstoppable villain could reach the characters. <br /> <br /> If all this had been centered around a smarter scenario in which the characters had not made the same stupid mistakes, literally made by hundreds of horror movie characters, it's is perhaps a more enjoyable experience. All the most interesting characters are immediately killed in the first third of the film, then the countdown becomes particularly interesting until we know it's just The Creepy Janitor and The Final Girl. <br /> <br /> I guess I have to be a little jaded, but as a horror movie fan, I wonder why I should worry when I could easily write a better screenplay myself -even. I will not even mention the many cases of terrible CGI.
