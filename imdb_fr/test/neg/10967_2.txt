A glance at the classification should tell you that this film was voted by shills, in order to artificially improve the ratings of this movie. <br /> <br /> This film brings nothing new to the zombie genre. In fact, he is ridiculously bad (actor and cinematographer) and derived in his plot. The makeup looks horrible and the zombies are even worse when they are shot. The lines are very tense and poorly timed, with the exception of the female bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this movie mess. The worst offenders are the Italian (Hans), the protagonist Ryn and the villain in mind. I saw a better pizza truck delivery with a flat tire. <br /> <br /> It's a self-proclaimed "western zombie", but the only thing that makes it a "western zombie" is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and that the real name of the main actor is Clint. The protagonist is not cool and mysterious like a traditional Eastwood hero, and as an anti-hero he also does not have the wise demeanor to get away with it. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. by the false rave reviews. This is just another category B zombie movie that was done competently for the budget it had (it has a good lighting), but it smells of the little director, the first director and the bad actor. There are LOTS of really stupid scenes that make this look really amateurish.
