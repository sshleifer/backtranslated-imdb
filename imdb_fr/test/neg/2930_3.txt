In general, I like Iranian movies, and after seeing Kiarostami's "10" the night before, I was expecting a good movie. I was very disappointed. It is by far the worst Iranian film and one of the most boring Asian films I have ever seen. If you've never seen a Kiarostami movie before, look for "Ten" instead. If you want good Iranian movies, you can also try "Bb", aka "The Apple". This film is divided into 5 parts, and only the fourth, with some funny ducks, deserves to be watched. If this is the first Iranian film you see, you probably will not want to see it anymore. I do not blame you, but you will miss very good movies.
