When Hollywood tries to understand what a "smart person" is, they fail so sadly, finding it difficult to put words in the mouth of so-called "genius". <br /> <br /> Okay, any genius walks around rubbing his superiority at every instance. Of course, they hang out in bars and decide to fight ?? it's not like they (wildly generalizing) autistic nerds who have never tanned. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you are a genius, you know everything about mathematics, history and politics, and of course, you are always ready with the current events and a thorough analysis of those- this. Because these things, for example, everything is fine together, you know? <br /> <br /> Plus, you walk around with a smile all the time. You are just a sufficient son of a you-know-what, that's how you are. <br /> <br /> And of course, you smoke, as if you've never smoked before, but you smoke because it's like it's cool, you know. And you are different. It's understood. <br /> <br /> And of course, can you fight ?? you are a tyrant. A bully who finds the time to study 10,000 pounds without lifting weight. And every time he does not smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health regime. <br /> <br /> And you go out with a student in his thirties? Minnie Driver. Well, I will not even comment on Matt Damon. Team America has already put their finger on it. <br /> <br /> This film is the reverie of a Beavis & Butthead student (95% of them): "Yeah, that's what I'd like to be, if I were a genius "But stupid people and stupid authors in this case can not imagine the life of the geniuses.
