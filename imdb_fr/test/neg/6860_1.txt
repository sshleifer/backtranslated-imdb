I loved watching Lost from the beginning and enduring some bad actors in badly written episodes because when Lost is good, it's really good! But this episode that staged Mr. Echos' disappearance had so many scenes stretched with persistent close-ups of bad actor that I found myself tapping on the fast-forward button. This episode is far from the worst. In fact, Lost's quality variations have been so inconsistent that I often wonder how many writers they use. <br /> <br /> I will continue to watch but hope things get better and that I secretly stop wishing for the actors sub-par in the series to die.
