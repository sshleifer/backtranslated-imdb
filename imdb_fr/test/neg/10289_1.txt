This is a snuff film. I am shocked that it is even considered part of the IMDb library. And, Bill, Julia and all the other "professional" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick movie. I thought I was going to watch a somewhat classic horror movie with a creative end that writers like to invent ... which usually does not make sense when you're writing a horror movie, but as a viewer, we let's try to rationalize and understand. This end was not creative. It was sick and has all the features of a snuff film. I am shocked that it was published for this purpose, and more shocked that it was released for distribution by the end of June 2009. It should not be shown in a theater. It hurts innocent spirits on many levels ... watch the movie, its end, and you'll understand that statement. In addition, a pretty girl "not yet 9", indicates his character. She is not finishing, but she is an integral part of the film. Why do filmmakers think they have to shock with a sick movie to be recognized? The director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks it's an art film.
