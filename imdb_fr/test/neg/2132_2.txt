movie I have never seen. In fact, I find one of the most entertaining episodes of MST 3000 I've seen. Not that it was good, but for all who have seen Manos: The Hands of Fate knows that this one was not bad. The movie's monster looked horrible, everyone was wearing a swimsuit swirling and the plot was laughable. I still have no idea why they made the monster, they never really gave good reasons. The leading woman must have been the leanest girl I have ever seen. They would have done better if they had chosen as the main role the girl killed at the beginning. On the plus side the acting dolphins were great !!!
