Visible but quite terrible. What a shock it is the last staging credit of the great Gregory La Cava! Even in his best-known roles, I do not care about Gene Kelly. It seems to me to be enough, hostile and involved. Here, associated with a minor actress like Marie Wilson, he seems to show these characteristics to the shovel. <br /> <br /> Marie Wilson, an heiress who falls in love with the military, is exceptionally hard and unfriendly. The actors seem to work hard to overcome the hard and unpleasant core of the image and they are doing well. <br /> <br /> The butler knows everything, apparently to be funny, but he seems to be an extended character Phyllis Thaxter is as always very attractive in a rather underdeveloped secondary plot.
