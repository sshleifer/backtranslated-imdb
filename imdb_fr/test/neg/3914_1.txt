Okay, <br /> <br /> I realize there are people who doubt that Thomas is there ... I was one of them ... but then I have seen this masterpiece of celluloid. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that the scene in which George Wendt is sucked out of the spaceship BY HIS A ** left me shaking. Sometimes I sit up straight in my bed, screaming like an old man on the table of a proctologist who thinks about it. If the director reads this ... I would pay to be an extra in the sequel.
