Nobody can say that I was not warned because I read the reviews (users and external), but like most of us attracted to horror movies ... curiosity had this cat. (Come on, we all shout at the movie people not to go into the dark room, but you know that they are horror lovers who are dying to know what's inside, even though we know that it's going to be bad.) <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie has left me angry. Not because it claims to be real (we do not care ... gadgets are allowed), or because actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in the movies? horror?) Or even because the film is so bad to be polite here). What really pissed me off is that the film is not only a BWP scam, but also a lazy heartless scam. <br /> <br /> I do not believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could then surpass BWP, but they did not even try. The film was made with little effort and care and it is the most unforgivable sin in the horror movie (or any)!
