OK, from the point of view of an American who, I suppose, does not know much about rugby. It would be a fantastic movie for them. First of all, it's good, the moral, the good typical coach trying to change the bad boy. HOWEVER, rugby is our # 1 sport, it's a way of life, it's played by the bravest and the winners are acclaimed as heroes as the Americans would for their baseball / basketball stars. I do not really know if it was the cheap budget or if the director or actors knew very little about rugby and being a rugby fan all my life, I can see that some actors did not even know that rugby existed before playing in this movie. . In summary, this movie was terrible. If you look at it and think it's great, take the time to go online. Maybe Google "All Blacks" will be part of the national team of New Zealand and those who made the haka famous. Believe me, they will make Highland boys look like schoolgirls.
