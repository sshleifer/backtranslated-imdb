*** Spoiler possible but probably not *** <br /> <br /> The game is called Donkey Kong but Donkey Kong is not even more! <br /> <br />! Diddy is gone too! <br /> <br /> The 1st Donkey Kong Country was one of my two favorites of all time <br /> <br /> Super Nintendo games. (The other being Super Mario World) <br /> <br /> The 2nd Donkey Kong had at least Diddy Kong and good levels, <br /> <br /> although it looked more like a game based on pirates. <br /> <br /> However this one is the worst of the lot! It does not feel like the original or the second, the enemy looks stupid and the levels are even worse. It does not seem realistic anymore! I did not like his game unlike the last two, the first had good background music and the second was not bad, but the music of this game is horrible! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It often happens nowadays that films, broadcasts and sometimes <br /> <br /> video games that start fantastically are ruined by <br /> </ p> A stupid sequel! I'm sad to say that I feel that the donkey kong as a saga is no longer as good as it has now Donkey Kong 3! <br /> <br /> They should have left it to the original or maybe the 2nd.
