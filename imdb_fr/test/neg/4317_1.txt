This film was disappointing for at least one of two reasons. The suspense created has disappeared because of the horrible game or lack of direction on the part of the director. I do not know. It was like a good chewing gum that seemed to lack flavor, but you keep chewing it because it was so good in the old days. . Like most thrillers, The Hitchhiker had promised not to keep his promises when he watched me closely and he was ready to turn down the volume (I watched the movie alone .. in the dark) turn into something else . He just ran out of gas and let me watch a TV-style movie, with one exception ... he was probably rated R.
