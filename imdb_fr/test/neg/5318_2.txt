It was painful! Recently offered as a free DVD with a British newspaper, this Belgian-British co-production of 1977 (it could have fooled me, it is at least ten years older than that) is rather obscure and if you succeed well beyond half - mark time, consider yourself a soldier. The combination of animation and live action is at best spooky and at worst dreadful. So you wonder why it was decided to try to make the film this way when the technology clearly did not exist. Harris is only a human accessory and animation is one of the flatter and more lifeless scenes I have ever seen, with the obligatory "tripping" moments (especially when it comes to Brainiac type character, Subtracto) that has rendered countless feature cartoons from the late sixties instantly dated. Don Black's scenario provides a compelling argument for a generally resilient lyricist who wants to stay true to what he does best, and the pace is so slow that even the youngest will get bored. As for adults, stick to Jonathan Swift's original novel.
