If I want to love a movie, I have to worry about the main characters and what happens to them. In this garbage can of a movie, I found myself in the hope that they would all die at the end. None of the characters are people you would ever meet, they all made me sick. If it were not for some nude scenes, I would have given a 1 to this miserable movie.
