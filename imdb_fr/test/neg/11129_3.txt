What a boring movie. Although it had humorous roles, it was just boring and long (for a 90-minute movie). I think the cause was a lack of action. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I thought I would see the white blood cells fight the evil viruses, but no luck. It was more than the virus was thwarted that defeated. <br /> <br /> The film was promising, but since then it has been designed for small children, but it has not reached its potential, in my opinion.
