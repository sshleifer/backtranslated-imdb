The story of Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's most successful. This may be due to some features that place it near the slasher genre, murder, murder, kill, kill, gallons of blood, tense sex between the main characters, etc. More than that, the original piece is very attractive taking into account the length (this is only half the size of Hamlet) and the attention given to Macbeth for whom we are obliged to take care of him despite his bloody nature. The game would seem ideal to found a movie. Not so long as it gives directors the opportunity to explore many levels, a good actor can play the role of his life, the film has a deep meaning in all periods of history. Unfortunately, this was not the case with Macbeth. The version of Polanski is quite close but insists too much on the medieval period. Welles' film is too personal, with an interesting twist to totalitarianism, the TV version of 1990 is too superficial. This 2006 film is no exception. It is very far from a Shakespeare film, but it is interesting to see how the director understood the story and how it situates it in contemporary life. No knights in shining armor, but gangsters in bright cars. Many drugs and catchy music replace the dread of the night in the original room. Macbeth's idea is so simple that taking it and bringing it into modern life does not need Shakespeare. The worst part of the movie are the lines. Most of the poignant scenes in the play, such as the dagger scene, are so thin that they seem useless. Replacing the knocking on the door with bells and horses by cars seems fun. If they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation, they could have done it easily without Shakespeare. This Macbeth seems to be a loser with a brain injury and not a valiant, brave and ambitious warrior who wants so much power that he is ready to kill and is caught in a net of fears and despair. The film does not specify what drives Lady Macbeth to madness, it does not give a reason why some characters should fear Macbeth and his "terror" (since there is no hereditary ascension on the throne, what without throne and all) and this places Macbeth in a delicate position, as the direction of a gang is as far removed from royalty as all this film is far from all Shakespeare. In conclusion, we have two superimposed ideas that never meet, making it a ultimately useless film. Do not trust the order in which you go, but go for it!
