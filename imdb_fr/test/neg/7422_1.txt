(r # 64) <br /> <br /> Garbage irretrievable, without merit and especially sad. You know that a movie is going to be bad when its star power is Lance Henriksen. The French title of this film says it all: "Inexplicable". How can you make such an incredibly bad movie nowadays? Whatever Jonas Quastel's thing was, it worked. It's a big trash, I mean shit at the level 'Manos', meaningless, unassailable, not so bad that it's good, cinematic bile of the highest order. <br /> <br /> Lance Henriksen IS Harlan Knowles, a character who could have been interesting if he had not been so devoid of features or personality. With a bunch of morons, he goes on an excursion looking for a diabolical Sasquatch who allegedly attacked a plane that crashed in the woods, or something like that. There is not much else going on. There is soft-core nudity (level: Teletubbie) and flagrant "Predator" scams. After 92 minutes of total pain and another scene ripped off, this time from "Blair Witch", the film ends up staggering on the finish line and ends. As a bonus, we only see the monster for about one or two scenes of the movie. <br /> <br /> There is really nothing to say about this film. All you need to know is a very bad movie and is not even worth seeing as a "really bad" movie. "The Untold" is an entertainment value, which Orlando Bloom is a role-playing game. Avoid it like arsenic.
