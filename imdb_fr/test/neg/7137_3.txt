Hollywood cinema is the most lazy in the world. It only takes one blow to overwhelm the theaters of the same old shit reinvented again and again. Take the superheroes, for example, for each X-Man and Spiderman, there are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. The Japanese horror remakes are even worse. It only took The Ring, which was perfectly perfect (mainly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to create a ton of horrors like scary women, for example. The Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was good, but useless) and grudges. <br /> <br /> The first grudge was not entirely bad. Most of the time it was scary, and that's what you'd expect. In addition, the plot had brains mixing stories. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous one; it could be a good thing, but hey, what boy in Black II? Was it a good thing to xerox the whole scenario and change the villain? For Grudge 2, the critic goes in the same direction. <br /> <br /> Fear tired, bad actor (except Amber Tamblyn) and clich√©s everywhere. Three stories take place at different places and at different times. Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigates the causes of the death of her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar); Allison (Arielle Kebbel), taken by colleagues to the house where the incident described in the first film took place; and finally, an American family witnessing strange things happening in the neighboring apartment. I'm happy to be able to say (and I mean it) that everything is linked to the end, but do not count on the end to make a good photo, while all the rest is just boring and boring. <br /> <br /> There are chills everywhere, a girl alone in the lockers, a person who should not enter a house, others who dig too deeply. Meanwhile, ghosts continue to kill and kill and kill, which seems even more lethal than ten world wars or the Ebola outbreak. Hey, does not that sound like another bad Japanese remake, something called Pulse? Yes, day after day, it's easier to keep a grudge ... against Hollywood bullshit.
