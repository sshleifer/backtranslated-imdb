Oh again another Seagal movie. In no less than a few months arrive to populate the shelves of the video store. As bad as submerged? No, but that does not say much. Like perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to resign but is looking for a last job before being dubbed by his boss. He lands in prison and befriends a gangster who helps him to get a refund. <br /> <It's nice to see that Seagal does not play an agent, a cop or what he usually plays. We actually get a location in the United States in Las Vegas, it seems. Then a territory of Eastern Europe as usual. Don Fauntleroy does his job well. <br /> <br /> However, most action and fight scenes with Stevie are clearly doubles. Scenes from other movies, lack of realism and logic in even the smallest of situations. Seagal and Treech form a rather inspiring team (unintentional) bursts out laughing for a minute.Suffering the rest. <br /> <br /> Several remarkable faces are turning to him. Sleepy, Kevin Tighe is far Nick Mancuso comes in sleepwalking mode to take a check. No more rappers.Please? <br /> <br /> At this point, action scenes and intrigues are more predictable and generically recycled than ever before. Seagal must step out or hang up. He should have gone out some time ago.
