This film is a big disappointment. Director Vicente Aranda has provided many interesting films throughout his long career, some of which have been showcased by the powerful and powerful performances of Spanish actress Victoria Abril. In JUANA LA LOCA, he also relies on a talented actress, the newcomer Pilar Lopez de Ayala, but it is hardly the only positive element in a terrible disaster. While Lopez de Ayala strives to present Juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed with love for her beautiful husband, it seems that she has not been able to develop her character in relation to this one-dimensional feature. Juana was an important figure in Spanish history and the politics of that time were essential in her story ... but she is presented here as a leading romantic woman from a soap opera; it's a shame, and the film misses an opportunity to show how personal lives can influence history and vice versa. Worst of all, the Italian actors Daniele Liotti and Manuela Arcuri are doing very poorly, which in Liotti's case is a real problem because he describes Felipe el Hermoso, a central role in this story. It seems obvious that the choice to attract a young audience is obvious, because they both look like the greatest models of that time. On the other hand, talented actors such as Giuliano Gemma and Rosana Pastor are completely lost in clearly underdeveloped support roles. Even though it was a big-budget film, little care was taken to display a good screenplay or to create "vintage pieces" on screen. The costumes are particularly grotesque in some group scenes, as if they were caught in stock material, without any real coherence. Overall, the main problem of JUANA LA LOCA (and that is what makes the difference with much higher historical films such as LA REINE MARGOT or ELIZABETH) is the lack of point of view of the director. This is a strange turning point in Aranda's career, as he was able to develop it in other works (LIBERTARIAS and AMANTES come to my mind), creating very personal and interesting films, while this JUANA does not is really only a historical element of history. and not very good at that!
