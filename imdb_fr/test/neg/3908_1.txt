About five years ago, my friend and I went to the video rental store to get something to watch. My friend saw Space Truckers on the shelf and we understood it. Once we got home and started looking, we realized how absolute it was! A can of beer floating in space? A guy takes a toilet dump? A guy with a mechanical dick trying to wake up a woman saying, "Whiz, whiz!"? WTF !!! The stupidest, the most stupid, the most retarded, a horribly together throne, a garbage bin to which my eyes were exposed. My friend and I always refer to it as the worst film we have ever seen. Only one other film is close to his sadness (and that would be Jackie Chan's stupid film, "The Medalion"). If your eyes ever see this scrap piece on the shelf of your video store, do the following: 1. Remove it from the shelf and throw it on the floor. 2. Press it for at least 30 seconds. 3. Continue to set fire to a confined installation (bathroom). 4. Finally, take it to your local hazardous waste facility immediately so that it can be treated properly. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM "SPACE TRUCKERS" !!!!!!!!
