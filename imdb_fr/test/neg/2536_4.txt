Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon start in Switzerland. Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone), the world's greatest detective, thwarts the Nazi and successfully smuggled a brilliant scientist, Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.), and protected him. from London. But is London as safe as Holmes thinks? Dr. Tobel has devised a revolutionary new bombscreen that will forever change the aerial bombardment and has agreed to give it to the British government, but these Nazis want it as well. Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill), the enemy enemy of Holmes, plans to steal the secret of the sight of the bomb and sell it to the Nazis. Add Scotland Yard inspector Lestrade (Denis Hoey), Dr. Tobel's enthusiastic lover, Charlotte Eberli (Kaaren Verne), assassins, mysterious scientists and a confusing coded message & Holmes has done everything possible to maintain the Dr. Tobel in life delivers his bomb ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Roy William Neill, Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon is the fourth in a series of fourteen films made by Holmes between 1939 and 1946 and featured Rathbone and Bruce in the role of Holmes & Watson. Edward T. Lowe Jr., Scott Darling & Edmund L. Hartmann's screenplay is based on the short film 'The Dancing Men' by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This is not the tradition of the Holmes murder, it is rather a story of war adventures. To solve Holmes' problem, the resolution of complex crimes and mysteries is a grave mistake for me and the involvement of the Nazis and the war as a backdrop to the story is misplaced, embarrassing and inimitable . to sit too well with me. The dialogue is not great, Professor Moriarty feels almost like an afterthought, as if they could not find a villain, and overall, it's a lot less engaging than others in the series. However, at least it's short. <br /> <br /> The director Neill does his usual efficient work, but you have to reduce it a bit and keep in mind that it was made more than 60 years ago. He does not really have style or imagination and lacks both atmosphere and intrigue. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is acceptable if the scene is black, the film is black and white, but I understand that a computerized version is also available. . The acting is ok, Bruce and Hoey are doing their usual comical relief tricks and Rathbone's hairstyle in this appearance is ridiculous and I'm glad he changed it for later episodes. <br /> <br /> Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon were a disappointment. Compared to other excellent entries in the series, there are very few things I can recommend and everything that made the other so interesting seems to be missing here. Leave this one to the end and look first at some of the best, only for the hardcore.
