I must be honest and admit that this film basically did nothing to me except to completely deconcentrate me. He is charged with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, who are then linked to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. The story never really makes sense, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) starts having conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I never really understood that.) Jones did not ask problem, even though I thought he was really starting to show his age here. John Goodman was horribly misinterpreted by Julie as Julie "Baby Feet" Balboni, who is supposed to be some kind of local character. I just did not think that Goodman was working in that role, although I recognize that it might be because I'm not a big fan of John Goodman. Justina Machado appears as an FBI agent at one point, although I never really understood how the FBI was involved, which could simply mean that my attention was still drifting off the screen. If that was explained, however, I missed it completely. Fortunately, this is a fairly short film, so you will not lose too much of your life. 2/10
