I can overcome political parody; even though it was EXPOSED to be a "Masters of Horror" movie. <br /> <br /> But what I can not forget is the blatant use of our war heroes (and their sacrifices) as pawns in some horror maker's political statement. <br /> <br /> For me, it was purely insulting to desecrate Arlington and our heroes. I have family in Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) can even portray Arlington's tombs being disturbed just makes me want to throw up. <br /> <br /> I'm done with Dante and finished with MOH.
