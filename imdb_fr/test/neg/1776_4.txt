I played the role of Eugene Morris Jerome in the adaptation of the play in high school and this film does not correspond to the scenario or the imagination of Neil Simon. I know this game upside down and I can honestly tell you that the acting game was inactive. The production was old fashioned. The changes in the script of the play were poorly made. If you really want to enjoy this game, you should see the actual game, not a Hollywood movie adaptation. Eugene's character was soulless and too sarcastic in everything he said. The other characters were also out of order. A general disappointment, disordered, unfair to the game, performed with amateur!
