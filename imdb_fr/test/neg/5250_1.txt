Ha ha! First of all, if you have never seen a "Dimension Film", let yourself be tempted by a real treat! Known primarily for SUPER LOW BUDGET horror / slasher movies, "Beowulf" was no exception. <br /> <br /> However, this video was more of an ultra-nerdy genre. I missed the K-R-A-F-T label on the side. <br /> <br /> Think of anachronisms! (something out of time and place) <br /> <br /> We had: candles, armor, swords ... <br /> <br /> Yet we have seen: telescopes, soled shoes, lighters, speakers, Electricity, body bags, aluminum boxes, spoons / forks. <br /> <br /> Not bad for something that happens in the 8th century! <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie, it's a horrible movie. It's very laughable. It's really a comedy made to look like a horror movie! I could not help but laugh! <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert ("The Highlander Series") - had to really switch in his career if he worked for "Dimension Films". <br /> <br /> I learned my lesson though. I will watch movie studios on videos, MUCH more closely now. <br /> <br /> EVALUATED WITHOUT REAL ON 5. If you want to laugh, it's hard to miss this work! <br /> <br /> This maneuver has some low-cut - I particularly liked the blonde baby! <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
