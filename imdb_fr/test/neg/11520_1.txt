Ed Wood goes up again. The fact that this film was shot should give hope to any aspiring filmmaker. Any scenario you might have imagined to use to align a litter box or a birdcage should no longer seem so serious. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy supply of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching this movie, I realized that Boa vs. Python was not so bad after all. It probably would have been better to make this film in Claymation because at least no actor would have to be credited with being in this movie. We understand why this director has so many pseudonyms. There is a good side to watching this film in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of potato chips, you can make your way out of the cocoon of cheese around you to allow you to get some <br /> <br /> head to the cocoon of cheese that surrounds it.
