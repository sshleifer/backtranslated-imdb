Having spent the previous six years writing and producing, Luc Besson returns to the presidency of the board with Angel-A. I am a big fan of Leon and I really like the prospect of a black and white French film of the same type. <br /> <br /> Andr√© is a liar and gambling fanatic, he owes money to almost all usurers. Paris. Unable to repay his debts, and tired of being held by the Eiffel Tower, he decides to commit suicide. He does it at the same time as a mysterious woman whom he decides to save. Determined to thank him, she begins to help him repair his life. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a few bursts of laughter, which are going well. The visuals are pretty cool and work well with the views of Paris. But that's it. That's all the film has for her. And these two simple facets can do nothing to retain the torrent of terrible filming of the film. Although I can not blame the main character (his inconsistencies are however very close), the character of the same name is terrible. A terrible screen presence and bitterly boring. The plot is ridiculously incoherent itself, and sometimes oddly stupid, especially the end; an end that completely bleeding the nascent redemption engendered by the scenes immediately before. This is perhaps the most ridiculous scene I've had the ignominy to observe: it's stupid, indulgent, melodramatic and far too awful to be "so bad it's funny". The principle of the film might have already had potential, but it is brutally slaughtered by the endless implementation of his ideas. The movie was really a task to watch, and that made me scream on the screen all the way through. <br /> <br /> Massively and incredibly flawed, Angel-A is just plain bad. Although his sometimes amusing dialogue manages to attract chuckles at rare intervals, in the end, it is clear that this film is nothing more than disgusting.
