This film could very well have been a propaganda film for the North American Falangist party - or a similar group ... The strong man (Kersey) is above the law (but not out of the law) and liberates eminent citizens by killing worthless garbage. The only thing that made me think that it was not done by the KKK is the fact that a Jew played the role of a good guy ... Try to see him again thinking that it's a propaganda film for a far-right group - and I'm going to see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> It's a tragedy that Jimmy Page actually did music for this movie ... :(
