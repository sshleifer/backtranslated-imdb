Fame did something strange. It was not just a musical originally created for the screen (most are based on Broadway musicals), but it spawned a television series and a Broadway musical. Let me correct this sentence. Fame is not a musical. Musicals have song numbers to advance the plot or show the characters' feelings. The song in this music is not used to do either; in fact, it is useless. People sing randomly to fit the plot. And this is not the kind of musical I know. <br /> <br /> The so-called plot of Fame has an avalanche of characters (all of which are presented at the same time, I saw this in a film [Gosford Park] disastrous results) that audition and enter the High School of the Performing Arts of New York. They are all for different reasons, namely. play, sing, etc. The drama between quotes takes place as these middle-aged people posing as teenagers spend their four years. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that high school is supposed to be selective. After all, it's a free college, and they can not let everyone in. So, how come people who are really bad are entering college? Obviously, this drama could ensue between all these different people. And why is the person in mind not charged in the film before the end, for no reason, if not to make us feel uncomfortable? There are many troubling situations in which these people without talent find themselves, but you can not feel bad for them because you do not know who they are! These relationships occur between people whose names you do not know. And these characters do things about themselves throughout the movie, but you do not realize it because you do not know how they were. <br /> <br /> Regarding singing, it appears at random (and is supposed to be funny?) and does nothing. When the title song is sung, it is played in the middle of a street and before you can say Ferris Bueller, everyone is in the middle of the street, dancing wildly and quirky. The song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is useless. Fame is an unpleasant film, to say the least. I would say more, but most of the movie is happily out of my head. Just do not see it. You will make a service. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> R-rated for language.
