Good cinematography, good acting, good direction ... can not justify a story that is and can not be accepted by any society. Amitabh has often used the media to make this junk food possible by saying that - if such an incident occurs ... then what? I would like to ask him if such a thing happens for your own child or grandchild (say a little girl) so what will you do? I think that all parents will have to be very careful before interacting with a 60-year-old neighbor if you have one -jia- with you. These films should be banned and discouraged, otherwise you will inhale more Nithari cases. Such acts are bad and the bad guys in the movies are punished. This should be the moral of the story and not glorify their act or them.
