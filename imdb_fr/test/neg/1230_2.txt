Having grown up in Westerns and given the current shortage of Westerns on television and in the theater, I really enjoyed Commanche Moon. <br /> <br /> After watching two nights and not another, it seems to have been shot on a tight budget. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are notable absentees. There's Val Kilmer, but what the hell's going on with him? Four or five buildings on either side of the street, plus Scull Manor, make up the entire city of Austin. The capital is never seen, only inside the governor's office. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is often hokey, meaningless. The line of disjointed plot. Absolutely, completely forgettable.
