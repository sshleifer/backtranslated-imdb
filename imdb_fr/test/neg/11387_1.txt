First, the place stinks ... the little boy likes to dress in girl's clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are old and lame, you've seen in a dozen movies of the 50s and 60s. The entire cast is wasted. I bet people signed just to be in a Shirley MacLaine vehicle. Please, if anyone told Shirley that she did her best comedy in TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA. See it ... if there are no reruns of Andy Griffith.
