"My Blue Heaven" is boring. The plot is tasteless; characterizations and dialogue stink; the musical numbers, although sometimes staged in an interesting way, are not only too absurd, but also lyrical, derisory, painfully luminous and emotionally hollow. The managers, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive professionals; However, despite all their talented efforts to breed dismal and unconvincing material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, despite all their talents demonstrated in other projects, are more or less cyphers here. <br /> <br /> There is only one reason to watch "My Blue Heaven". One reason ... a star: Mitzi Gaynor, in his film debut. The total duration of its screen is probably less than ten minutes, but what? Her disturbing and promising personality, her feline beauty and her exceptional charisma shine brightly and make these minutes the most watchable, memorable and exciting moments of the entire film. If you want to have the opportunity to see a wonderful young talent on the rise, check out Miss Mitzi Gaynor in "My Blue Heaven". <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I despise (and I urge you to avoid) Drew Casper's manic, obsessive-compulsive DVD commentary for this movie. Wordy, digressive, excessively tedious, often uncomfortable with what is played on the screen and galloping with an excess of nervous energy, his comments are absolutely indigestible.
