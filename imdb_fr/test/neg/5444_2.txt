Badly acted and badly directed, "Congo" tries unsuccessfully to recreate the feeling of "Jurassic Park". But the truth is that the book was not so good either. Still, the film's first problem is that Tim Curry's character has been added. the second problem is that the speaking arm has been added; The main problem, however, is that the actors do not create realistic characters. I guarantee you that this movie will not make you think that there are killer gorillas anywhere on earth. Also featuring Laura Linney (happy birthday, Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I guess they do not want to put this film in their CVs.
