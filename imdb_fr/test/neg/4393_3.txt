Me and a friend rented this movie the other day. At first glance, it seemed like another teen movie, which was also what we hoped for, as fans of simple horror and comedy. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. It accelerates quickly to become something that has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, he never leaves the ground completely. We had looked at something that seemed to last an hour. When, finally, half asleep, I managed to say: "Dude, this film is bad". There were only 35 minutes left ... I agreed. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the movie is just not funny. It was supposed to be funny, but it failed. It failed in a way that made me sad. It reminds me a bit of myself. I had the potential to be everything I wanted, and instead, I was watching horror / funny movies all the time. I pity the directors of this film from the bottom of my heart. It's so sad. All this potential .. and nothing.
