Last fall (2001), I took a film class taught by the director of this film (Mark Hoeger). His vast knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to dissect any film scene, and his Academy Award win in an obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent director. When he mentioned in one of his classes that he had just completed a film called "Full Ride" and was in the post-production stage, my interest was stung. . However, this would be the last time I would hear about this movie project. Until last week ... <br /> <br /> Last week, I saw in a TV list that "Full Ride" was going to be broadcast on the WB network. That immediately triggered a red flag, because I can not help but associate WB with programs for teenagers such as Dawson Creek, Charmed, etc. PLUS, the fact that Full Ride was going to be broadcast directly on television was not too flattering in itself. But, nevertheless, I booked this moment and sat down to watch the creation of my former film teacher. <br /> <br /> After two hours and the end credits starting to roll, I thought a lot about what I had done. seen. What I had just seen was a typical WB quality show lasting two hours. In fact, it almost seemed that this film was made for the sole purpose of appearing only on the WB network. Criticizing this film will basically be like criticizing a typical WB show. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The characters are superficial, the story is clich√©d in every sense of the term, the scenes are completely artificial and the development of the characters is forced and incredible. This film screams just "without originality". <br /> <br /> The main character, Matt Sabo, is a hot shot from the wrong side of the track (literally) who plays football in high school as a right-back but who sparkles off in a life of crime. He is then offered a chance to get a full scholarship instead of going to jail. Obviously, without much choice, he agrees to play football with an all-star football team, but he is not excepted among his peers because of his bad team spirit and bad attitude. <br /> <br /> Then comes the love interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a nice character, unlike Matt Sabo, always so aggressive, so we applaud her almost when she rejects him at the beginning. But, of course, the inevitable happens. She falls in love with him, changes her attitude towards everything and everything looks good and happy. But now it's time to argue! <br /> <br /> A little earlier in the film, Amy makes it clear to Matt that she does not want to score with him because it would be "shameful" for her and her mother. It is to the dismay of Matt and his football friends (yes, they end up warming up), who bet he would get none. But, of course, Matt eventually accepts these conditions and decides not to be completely the type. Here's where the exciting plot gets thicker. If you do not want me to ruin this surprise, move on. <br /> <br /> [BEGIN SPOILER] <br /> <br /> Matt discovers on the part of locals that Amy Lear is still trying to mark every year with a guy from the all-star team so she can try to use it to escape from a small town life of working in a cafeteria (which is baffling in the first place) and going to the big city. Suddenly, realizing that he had been used and that his love was a sham, Matt was tempted to return to a life of crime and leave the football camp before the game. Amy tries to reassure him that she's really in love this time, but he's too reckless to buy it. So what will Matt do? Will he take it back? Or will he go back to stealing gas stations and be a complete fool? I will not spoil the super-ultra end surprising for you. <br /> <br /> [END OF SPOILER] <br /> <br /> So if I get you a helping hand for this film, know that it was my sarcasm and not a sincere enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of "Varsity Blues" or "Summer Catch". And it does not say much. There is hardly any comedy to save him and the characters are too superficial to worry about it. So what are you left? Not much. <br /> <br /> What I disliked most about the film is how unflattering that Hoeger painted is Nebraska through this film. He seems to be trying to capture the essence of the Nebraska countryside and teenage life in small towns, but his approach is all too stereotypical and superficial. The character's high hopes of being part of the "big city" and the actions they undertake to do it are greatly exaggerated, and this only reinforces the stereotype that Nebraskians are a hick living in farming communities. I do not know if Hoeger's intentions were good for trying to put his country of origin in the spotlight, but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to present Nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates it into the plot of Full Ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he turns, that he ends up dumping garbage. superficial that would seem to come from outsider. If Hoeger really lived here, you'd think he'd know more than that. <br /> <br /> In total, I am completely disappointed with Hoeger's first big film and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a bit of originality to create something different and reflective .
