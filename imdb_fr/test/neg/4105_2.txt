This movie was really bad, clear and simple. How a movie like this gets a big release is for me a wonder. <br /> <br /> It's a decent idea, but it has not been realized. Edward Burns is a decent actor though. His small role in the rescue of Private Ryan pleased me. <br /> <br /> Let's move on to the major issue. <br /> <br /> The pictures were so bad that I was thinking of watching an old "Dinosaurs in 3D" Demo of adventures point-and-click on a CD-ROM under Windows 3.1 I mean, I saw cinematic scenes in console games from the period before 2000 that have more beautiful dinosaurs than that. I mean, damn ... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex looked better than this one. <br /> <br /> Lizard monkeys were laughable. I thought they were a kind of scam of "Killer Instinct". I've seen better slipper monsters now that I think about it. <br /> <br /> You know, there's a ton of movies designed for TV movies that are better than that. How can a jewel like Scifi Channels "The Shining" attract such a small audience, while this load of "CGI, easy to create 4 Kidz" is uncovered? I do not care if it's a Ray Bradbury story. Lameeeee
