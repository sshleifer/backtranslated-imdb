This is the sequel to Octopus. <br /> <br /> Pff ... OK. Many archive footage, but pretty good. I'm surprised they really had a giant robotic octopus that did not look so bad! In fact, I was quite surprised. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was very entertaining. He never explained how the octopus became so big, and is in no way related to the first one. But it was always fun. <br /> <br /> The end, my friend and I, made fun of me. Basically, after detonating the octopus once, the two main characters launch a bomb and five explosions, most of the archive footage, appear on the screen! We joked that they went to the dollar store and bought a toy "five missiles in one"! Believe me, you have to see it to believe it! Overall, just a stupid fun. It's worth giving a chance, buy if it's cheap.
