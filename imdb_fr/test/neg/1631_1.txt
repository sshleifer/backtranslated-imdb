Like almost everyone, I discovered this turkey in Mystery Science Theater 3000. It easily ranks as one of my favorite MST3K episodes of all time. I really could not imagine trying to watch this movie for myself ......... it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe plays the role of Ator, a muscular Fabio aspirant who lived at the time of the cavemen. The spectator is invited to suspend his incredulity as he knows the chemistry and alchemy and can manage to build a complete glider in about 5 minutes. Yes indeed! There is also a pretty attractive actress (I do not remember her name) who wears a headgear as a chest shield. Oh, and I can not forget this wacky Asian Thong. He had the easiest role in the film since he did not say a word of dialogue throughout the film. He had to figure out how to make his character interesting without speaking ..... and he failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The film is not viewable in any way and should only be viewed in its MST3K format. If you look at this version, you will laugh at yourself! <br /> <br /> "I am HUGE !!!!" <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
