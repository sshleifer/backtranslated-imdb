Ben Affleck, about to be married, is shaken by a plane crash and mingles with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, who is obliged to act for a madman). Who is to blame for this idiot and fool? It's so badly edited that when I looked in the credits, it was not to read the name of the publisher - it was to see if the person had really taken the credit! Rich in clich√©s, fireworks and with Sandra Bullock in makeup for raccoon eyes, the film does not even bother to create a chemistry between the two main characters. The laughs are nonexistent: the scene in the gay bar with Affleck might have made a lot of laughter if it was not so stupid (customers of the bar - a big gang of thugs!) - scream Affleck to undress and start digging their money). It's not supposed to have any meaning other than to get Ben to relax a bit, but the orientation of the scene as a whole is wrong, and the result is invisible because the silly publisher has cut .. or was it all the movie he had? It's a small moment, but typical of this film, a piece of amateur pop-merchant who wants a modern comedy edgy but has no courage. It is tailor-made for the bottom shelf of your video store. * from ****
