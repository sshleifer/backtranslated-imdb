I must admit that although I am a fan of Shakespeare, I have never really known this play. And what I really can not say is that it's a bad adaptation or that the piece is just a bad choice for a movie. There are some good deals in this, but the execution is very clumsy and the plot is obvious. The theme of the play is on the nature of debt, using the financial idea of ​​debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional issues. This becomes evident when the rings issue becomes more important than the affair with Shylock, who sadly falls into a variety of anti-semitic garden despite the bard's best attempts to save him with some beautiful monologues. <br /> <br /> Away For Jeremy Irons, I did not think there was a decent performance in the pack. Pacino's Yiddish consists of a slight moan added at the end of each statement, and some of Shylock's best scenes are reduced to variations of the standard "Pacino gets angry" scene that her fans know and love. But Lynn Collins is downright embarrassing, to the point where I would have thought she would have tested it on screen right from the start. When she becomes incognito as a man, it's hard not to laugh at all the things you're not supposed to laugh about. Joseph Fiennes trying to sound sincere and complicated, it is difficult not to make catastrophic comparisons with the performance of Gwyneth Paltrow in "Shakespeare in Love". The big problem, however, is that lack of emotional focus is paramount. It's really hard to tell if this movie is becoming a serious comedy or a strangely stupid drama. Surely, a good summer stock market performance would draw more laughter from the material than this dark production. The actors seem embarrassed about wanting to humor and not knowing where to place a dramatic and comical emphasis. All this is essentially the fault of the director, Michael Radford, who seems to think that the material is much heavier than I think.
