I must say that it's better than most SyFy releases, but that does not say much. <br /> <br /> The plot is that someone buys a game made from the bones and skin of a dead witch of the Spanish Inquisition (and no one expects the Spanish inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, but are interrupted mid-way when the friend who participated in the beer is killed in a way that the game predicts. <br /> <The following is a series of scenes typical of a film like this, or one of the films of the final destination. There's the puzzle at the end and the interesting sub-plot with the cop who wants the game to bring his family back ... but otherwise it's just a mess.
