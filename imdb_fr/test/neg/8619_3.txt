Although it was designed to serve as a showcase for kickboxing and swordplay, "Vampires: The Turning" could have aspired to something else. Because it does not even aspire to become a good vampire movie, ATV failed to give the punch it could have attempted. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​an 800-year-old Thai vampire was interesting. , but the story of the offspring she created by mistake (and must now clear) actually reminds me of Gizmo and his difficult situation in "Gremlins", and that's not a good thing when it comes to a vampire movie. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Chao is attractive and serves as a "good" vampire, but her lack of focus makes her cringe when she realizes she is an 800 year old vampire. Moreover, when she tells Connor that he is "a young soul", she does not deliver the line with the weight one would expect from an "old" soul. Attractive, but not credible. <br /> <br /> Meredith Monroe was more credible in her role, but for an alum of "Dawson's Creek", one would think she would have more time on the screen. The question of whether Amanda succumbs and "turns" is the most compelling reason to keep watching this movie, and you never get it. You are used to it, but you never get development among the characters of this graphic device. It's an inexpensive way to play your audience, guys. <br /> <br /> If you want something that is a good vampire movie, go get "Dracula" from Lugosi and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you have dozens of hammer blows with a lot more by force than this one. In the end, if you want good or sexy, this is not the place. It's just forgettable.
