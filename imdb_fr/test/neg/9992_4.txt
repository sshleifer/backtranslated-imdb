Some describe CALIGULIA as "the most controversial film of its time. While questionable, this is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually all the big names associated with the movie have made an effort to stand out. The author Gore Vidal has actually continued (with mixed results) so that his name is removed from the film and when the stars have seen the film, their reactions have varied, ranging from disgust aloud to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was that it went away. <br /> <br /> For a moment, it looked like such an eventuality. CALIGULA was an important box office and a critical flop (the producer Guccione had to rent rooms to be screened), and although the film was released on VHS on the national market, many problems of censorship were raised. edited, and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than ten years. But now, CALIGULIA is on DVD, available both in the edited versions "R" and original "Unrated". And no doubt that John Gielgud is happy not to have lived like this. <br /> <br /> The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say that it's as if DEEP THROAT was meeting David Lynch's DUNE through Fellini. day off. The script of Vidal fell into the hands of the publisher of the Penthouse, Bob Guccione, who used the reputation of Vidal to finance the project and seduce big stars. He then emptied most of Vidal's screenplay and called soft-porn director Tinto Brass. Then, when Guccione felt that Brass's work was not explicit enough, he and Giancarlo dubbed him some hardcore movies. <br /> <br /> Viewers who watch the edited version may wonder why everyone is talking, but those who watch the original cut will soon realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. There is a huge amount of nudity, and this remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there is a very explicit sex, gay sex, lesbian and heterosexual, weird sex, and a big orgy with dancing Roman guards thrown for good measure. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture and mutilation on the agenda. In a particularly troubling scene, a man is slowly stabbed to death, a woman urinates on her corpse and her genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs. <br /> <br /> In a documentary that accompanies the release of the DVD, Guccione said he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the target. We know very little about Caligula - and all we know is at best questionable. Other than that, orgies and casual sex were not commonplace in Roman society, where adultery was a punishable offense. And certainly, ancient Rome has NEVER resembled the strange, slightly oriental costumes and costumes of the space age proposed by the designers. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, these costumes and costumes are often of a fantastic beauty, and cinematography is banal at least it does them justice; the score is also very, very good. Helen Mirren is the most talented member of the cast. She succeeds in promoting our interests and sympathy as Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in good conditions. The same can not be said of McDowell, but in law he has little to do with it. <br /> <br /> The film has a dark fascination, but it's finally a more interesting quirk for her. design and strangeness flat only for the content. Some of the exposed bodies (including those of McDowell and Mirren) are extremely beautiful, and some sex scenes work very well like pornography ... but again, some of them are so uncomfortable that they could lead you to abstinence. and the grotesque nature of the film compromises his eroticism. If you wish, it is worth seeing once, but once will suffice. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
