Oh, man, they knew how to do them at the time. Hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of a bad film: steel cardboard and the dreaded hero of scientists! <br /> <br /> This film was so close to a masterpiece, alas it was not, because it did not show the ray cannons and invaders of the moon. The MST3K version attempted to solve this problem by adding a pilot to the Captain Cody series, in which a man with a rocket-powered jacket was fighting the moon's makeup artists, but that was not adding up. In addition, the comments of the theater guys were not as funny as I expected them. Overall, a big disappointment.
