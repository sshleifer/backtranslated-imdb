The first 10 minutes of the movie make fun of sequels and movies pg-13. These are the 2 reasons why the movie is so bad. They are constantly referring to a movie called "Get Leo", which is the film version in film of get shorty. Whenever they do that, you will be really angry. Travolta is not very cool, any more than Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious. This is not the kind of funny you would expect to see in a Elmore Leonard movie. If you have not seen it become shorty, you will probably like to be cool. If you like to be shorty, you'll leave the theater to kill the director and the screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.
