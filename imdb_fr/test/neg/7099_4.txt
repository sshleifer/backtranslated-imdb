On a scale of 1 to 10, I gave him a 4. I thought the movie was not very good, with too much violence and not a character to like. <br /> <br /> On an erotic scale, I give this 6. Many sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness. I still love nudity and Nancy Travis and Faye Grant go by, but the sex scenes are more humiliating than erotic.
