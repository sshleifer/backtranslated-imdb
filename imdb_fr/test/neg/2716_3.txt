The tender but slightly entertaining early comedy from the early '90s features Xena (Sarah Bellemo), Luna (Tamara Landry) and Sola (Nicole Posey), three teenagers from space. Xena's parents have gone on vacation for a few days. As a result of persistent persuasion from her friends, Xena agrees to take a ride with her father's spaceship. The final result? They end up running out of gas in space and land on planet Beta 45, AKA Earth. Meanwhile, teenagers Dave (Michael Todd Davis) and Jerry (Ken Steadman) came to California to stay in the summer with Dave's uncle Bud (Joe Estevez), a beach buff who lives on the beach. The three of them end up meeting our three space girls who have left the crash without a scratch. Uncle Bud is about to be kicked out of her soon-to-be-sentenced beach, thanks to Sally (Linnea Quigley), who lives on the top of the hill and has a relationship with Bud. She is also a bikini mogul and is trying to win a $ 30,000 bikini contest ... exactly what Bud would need to repair his property. The girls decide to try to win the prize for him. And that's about everyone. Knowing that their film was barely enough to support a feature film, the filmmakers submit, step by step, countless parties at the beach featuring tons of extras turning their half-naked bodies in the hot sun . Oh, and do not forget sex. There are many. Before going further, I must put this film in context. It was released in 1993, well before the advent of labels such as Surrender Cinema and Seduction Cinema. Compared to these newer, more incisive and more explicit films, the base films of the 90s seem rather clear. When Beach Babes From Beyond was first released in 1993 from Torchlight Entertainment's Full Moon subsidiary, it was announced as the first release of a label specializing in "mature public" films. Needless to say, times have changed. This particular kind of movie has gone from some hot but brief sex scenes to ephemeral glimpses of female frontal nudity to protracted sex scenes that sometimes threaten to venture into the realm of hardcore. Looking back at Beach Babes From Beyond after watching it on the 93 'album release, we can say that if the same film were to be shot today, we would insist much more on sex scenes and less time spent on this film. plot and dialogue. As for the sex scenes themselves, they tend to be hot and cold. Our three space girls quickly got comfortable with the boys that night. Thus, each couple receives a gentle basic scene, with a slow camera work slow idling and lighting too dark. They are really not so horrible and are amazingly graphic in a few places, especially the scene between Xena and Jerry happening in the back of a trailer. But the sex scene that REALLY leaves a lasting impression and surprises you with its overall intensity happens quite early in the film. Sally attends a topless photo with three of her models posing at the edge of a pool. All the actresses in this scene are beautiful, but Nikki Fritz stands out from the others by his huge presence. Remember that at this stage of her career she had not yet achieved the kind of huge popularity that would follow. Her nude pose at the edge of a pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence in which she shows off her soapy body in a bathtub, then again moving away from her bath. As we head for the bed, we wait for an entirely naked scene with its back almost heart-shaped and its back perfectly formed. It's good that Nikki's back is so muscular that he's about to do a very good training. Nikki spends the next few minutes completely naked with a beefy guy in a variety of positions in a scene filmed in a completely different way than the other three scenes of love. No dark light or boring slow motion here ... just two actors in a huge bed with no sheets and blankets that seem to be barely playing at the same time. Nikki's ecstatic body language proves that few actresses seem to enjoy filming sex scenes as much as she does. It's really the only time Beach Babes From Beyond really delivers the goods. But even without this spectacular scene, I kindly recommend this film for the simple fact that it is rather observable and never boring, thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive cast, many of which would appear in various direct or video functions of the rest of the decade.
