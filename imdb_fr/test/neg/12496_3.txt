Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret service agent who prevents the assassination of a senator, but on the way he finds a plot and has a tracker. The tracker, by the way, is determined to end Phillips. Robocop is, of course, the most obvious inspiration for this low-budget cheesemaking film: although this film has a little imagination and real energy, it has a real kickboxing champion who is leaking a robot. The film is not so awful that it's just empty and repetitive. The story is written in clich√©s and the characters are prepared to be shot by the different shots. Don Wilson, as usual, is terrible in the lead role. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on 4- (mediocre)
