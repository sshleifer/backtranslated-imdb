As Americans, we now expect crapility to become "the norm" for HORROR and the unknown directors who direct unknown actors who act for unknown writers. We really expect it to be zero and when they do not, it becomes an immediate success. <br /> <br /> This is NOT an immediate success, nor a weekend nor a month. It blows from beginning to end and my only recommendation is: GO, know it well, enjoy it for what it is, for what it is not and if you have anything better to do, keep it in the back. Burner WAY BACK. It's fun to see the elderly cross a busy street during rush hours, but do not expect much, they are almost never hit by a real car, it's just a lot of hype.
