The creature? Yes, and the movie in which he plays. Hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to look at this for all eternity. Six students enroll in a convict hospital to save money and become victims of a former monster who has to kill five victims before he returns to "the dark world from which he comes!" In addition to the major problems of logic and coherence (plus the fact that it seems unfinished), this disaster is terribly acted, written, edited (by J.R. Bookwalter) and realized, and the effects of make-up are almost non-existent. It is also significantly shorter than expected (only 80 minutes), but I'm not complaining. This is the worst movie I have seen Full Moon productions of executive producer Charles Band, and the boy is so bad! here and I thought a different opinion was in order. Proceed with caution!
