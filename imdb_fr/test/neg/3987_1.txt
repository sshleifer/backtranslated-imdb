This was to take place in the Bible Belt of Northern Ireland. Well, as a person who grew up there and was a child of the time described in the movie, that did not sound right! The accents were everywhere - everything except in Antrim / Derry County. The church looked like none of the ones I've ever seen. "The Church of God" is a Pentecostal denomination, but the film was certainly not Pentecostal! At first, the elderly minister was dressed in the Church of Ireland (Anglican) dress - and no Cd.I. would be called "the Church of God". The minister has often been called a "reverend" - this may be the case in some parts of the world, but I have never heard him say when I lived in this area. The ministers were addressed as "Mr. ......" <br /> <br /> This film was very poorly documented and presented - quite typical of Irish cinema - boring! A movie can have a great plot, but if it does not look authentic, it's bullshit.
