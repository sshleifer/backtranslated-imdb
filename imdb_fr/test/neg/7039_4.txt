A faint story about a demonic warlock looking for a centuries-old satanic Bible to respond to Lucifer's demand for defeat of creation. A bounty hunter from the 17th Centruy named Redfern and his reluctant acolyte, Kassandra, are all the rage. Sounds like a load of bunkum? It is. <br /> <br /> This letter from author D. T. Twohy receives the superficial treatment he deserves from director Steve Miner (who directed this romantic idiocy "Forever Young"). Twohy obviously knows nothing of the real harm. <br /> <br /> Julian Sands flies and laughs, trying to look mean, while Richard E. Grant manages to squander his rich talent. Lori Singer's career has also stung with him. <br /> <br /> The special effects team is having a little fun, and Jerry Goldsmith is offering a higher score on it.
