This movie tried, but eventually it was a waste of talent. He tried to be "sexy". I do not denigrate the work of actresses such as Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson (who will find something other than the TV "The Nikita Woman" worthy of her talents.) I just have not found, even in the so-called pretense from Mrs. Wilson. quasi-seduction scene with Mrs. Barkin any real emotion, although I know that the thespians have tried very hard for the scene to work. If the sexual elements of Wilson's troubled sexual victim did not touch our heart (which was not the case with an end he did not deserve), the murderous element of the plot was not . Maybe it was the script or perhaps the direction, but I did not feel anyone in this film, and without that feeling, a movie does not work for me. If you are interested in a movie about lesbianism, there are at least two movies on either side of the spectrum to check: 1.) The "Bound" goulity delight that works well in a black frame; and 2.) The more honest and touching story of a lesbian who grew up in Hell's Kitchen and is called "All Over Me". It is a well-defined independent film from the mid-90s that deals with the problem of coming to adulthood with feeling, and not with forced sexuality. Both would be a better rental than "Mercy" which has almost nothing.
