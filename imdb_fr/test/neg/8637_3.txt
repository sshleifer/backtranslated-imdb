When George Sluizer was told that he could direct an American version of the book "Het Gouden Ei" / the movie "Spoorloos" (this film also bears the name "The Vanishing" outside of Holland) if the end was changed - it was said that "the American audience" would not approve the original ending. Of course, the original ending is much better, and without it, the film loses its impact. Because I have already put this in the "trivia" section, I will not give the original ending and will keep my comment without spoiler. If you want to know the original ending, look at "Spoorloos" or read the book. This film is an absolute waste, and the first film of Kiefer Sutherland that I do not like. Watch the original Dutch film, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.
