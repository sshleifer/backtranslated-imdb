one of the worst excuses for an Irish accent I heard. of a very great actor too. it's a bad Irish accent not to mention a dublin accent (which is completely different) anyway the film is loosely based on the story of ganglord martin cahill and it's a lot better done with Brendan Gleeson in the lead role in THE GENERAL
