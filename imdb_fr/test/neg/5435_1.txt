Anyone who has seen the smoky and smoking poop called Congo understands my title. And I feel for you. This movie was not only bad. It was painful. The book was stupid, the story was even silly and the cast was terrible. Dylan Walsh? Rumor has it that Julia Roberts threw your ass because this movie suffered so much. Huge diamonds? Gorillas killers? Talking gorillas? Hmmm. It sounds like a blow! OH! The accent of Tim Curry is so bad in this film that I would prefer to be deaf! I recommend this film to bulimics who seek to purge themselves after a hearty meal or to Kavorkian patients who need only one more reason to die. If this is true of the book, I would say that we have a good old Footloose book to burn and destroy each copy. If future generations looked back and found this waste, how would we explain it? Listen to others who hated this movie! Do not look at him! Run away! DO NOT WATCH this movie! If you think it's full of action or suspense or cool effects, YOU ARE NOT! If you think that it's more than cock Nicole Ritchie, you'd be right. So, if you're going to watch Crapo again ..., I mean Congo, do it after you've just taken 50 Tylenol PM.
