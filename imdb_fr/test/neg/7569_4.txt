It is a family film shot in rural America in the 1950s about a boy whose uncle is pleading for the killing of his Drum dog, which has not only resulted in a legal quarrel as a family, but also in a discord between the communities as their city begins to take sides. <br /> <br /> It's a movie formula that tries to be very touching and sweet. His biggest weakness was that the only people who could really act were Scott Bakula (defense attorney), Ron Perlman (father / Drum owner) and the dog. (John Shuck and Kathy Garver, "Sissy" from the original "Family Affair", like Uncle and his wife, were fine.) The kids were not very good (basically they looked like acting) and it's a problem when The movie really turns around them (Aaron Fors, who plays the tyrant Donny reminds me that actor Russell Crowe must have looked like a kid, only with no talent but with a lot of ham). <br /> <br /> Preferred line (pronounced by the Prosecutor after the closing speech of Scott Bakula's defense trial): "We will be lucky if they do not lynch us." <br /> <br /> Favorite line pronounced by Ron Perlman (after his son hit the bully): "Make it your friend, this will be the hardest part." <br /> <br /> Pretty cute to rent / buy used.
