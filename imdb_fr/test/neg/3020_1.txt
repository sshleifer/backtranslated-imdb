That's what we need, a show about people no one likes in high school or college. Man or woman. People objectifying and welcoming others are exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking. And this show is only disgusting to do exactly that. <br /> <br /> Four men sit down on a chair and watch two other guys trying to get the women to have sex with them. And in the end one of two wins, great ... just great. I am also supposed to accept these four shower bags as "judges" of the "game" of people. The term "game" has to be the most stupid thing in modern English since the term "Bling Bling", added to the fact that these men are called "experts" just makes me want to throw out what remains of my respect for the modern culture. They are not damned models, they are the result of the MTV culture that comes to bite us in the throat. If you like bullshit overflowing with this monstrosity, you probably think that Paris Hilton and Britany Spears have talent. This is not true and you should be ashamed to think so. <br /> <br /> And for all those who say that I would prefer it to be better if I am fired or just jealous. Fuck yourself in the air, because obviously a real girl will not do it.
