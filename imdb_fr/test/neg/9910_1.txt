This film must be the worst film I've seen. There is a reason why it was made to be a MOW (Film of the Week). The continuity was completely false (palm trees in a Chicago setting even though the film was shot in Toronto, Canada), the effects left to be desired for the year 2004. HELLO. "The Lord of the Rings" had a better CGI than that. But I guess they also had the money for that. The budget will certainly have an impact on the outcome, but whoever calls this MOW more than 2 must return to film and television school. Next time, remember that care and time is a classic that does not rush to a tornado box office or a TV hit. <br /> <br /> In addition, I know that networks can reuse images from old networks or affiliates, but using images of 80's for 2004? I'm having trouble buying that.
