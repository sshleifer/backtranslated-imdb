1st viewed 18/02/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Leon Leonard): Adventure film just based on a novel by the author of the fame of Moby Dick, Herman Melville. This film tells of the captain of a ship that had stolen eyes (which were extremely rare black pearls) from a God sculpture of an aboriginal tribe and hid them in a place he was the only one to know before leave the island of Tivi. He fell very ill and made a secret trip back to the island to get the pearls for himself while other people (like his daughter) thought he would go back to the local healer to treat him. Others did not know the reason for the trip. A stowaway actually knew the real reason for his journey: to return the eyes to their God. The silly part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue and all the while, the natives led their tribe without their God having eyes (which caused them all kinds of problems). On the way, we are treated (for some reason) to a short underwater nature show with an electric eel fighting a local octopus (I guess only Herman Melville knows what it was about). Once on the island, the captain dies but passes the place where the pearls are to his daughter, but she also suffers the sick spell. One of the villains discovers where God is lodged and convinces the girl to go and steal the pearls, but at this point, the brave ones discover what is happening and a fight ensues. I will not tell you the results of the fight or the end, I'll let you know if you want. As I said earlier, the movie was OK, but some very stupid things I mentioned earlier have lessened its impact. I wonder if this new "Pirates of the Caribbean" had a plot of it --- hmm ?? black pearls, a curse (I wonder ??) Well, whatever, these elements do not make a very good movie in this case or in the other. It looks like they would learn well, but with the money invested in this new movie, I'm sure they will not do it. Never mind.
