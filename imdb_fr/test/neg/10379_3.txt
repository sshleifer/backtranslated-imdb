An exorcism exercise by numbers with a disappointing non-allegiance and the use of the term "black waters". The cinematography appears right out of the base cable, eliminating any appearance of marshy atmosphere and procedural disorder. In addition, there is not enough gore, sex or pretty young things to satisfy the majority of moviegoers. That being said, the main actress who plays the possessed has a sexy presence with olive skin. What remains to be said about this non-winner? Do not rent unless you have something to do with middle-aged adults who lament their past and fish with clich√© priests, shrinks, Hispanic schoolchildren, regretting all their past deeds.
