I felt that last night's episode was slow and somewhat boring at the same time. Honestly, I do not think it has to do anything with writing. Because I know that the story was well staged and tried to keep things in place. I thought it was not that bad, but overall I did not appreciate it. The director of this episode, Stephen Williams, is the main person in charge. I have always hated the direction of Stephen Williams. If Jack Bender continues with this episode of the first of the season, he would have kept it at a good pace and keep things afloat to keep things interesting. I'm glad Jack Bender is leading the episode next week and it will be a lot better. I'm glad he had the first episode of Syaid to shoot and I'm curious what he's going to get this time since Stephen Williams has done too many episodes before. <br /> <br /> I still think Stephen Williams has to be ejected from the show. He does not even do anything interesting with the show. <br /> <br /> Why does the opening have to be done with a target object while being in the helicopter? It was so boring! Bad perspective of the camera work too!
