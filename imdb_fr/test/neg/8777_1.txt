I guess it's not entirely the filmmaker's fault. The film suffered from the incredibly stupid decision of telling Clayton Moore (who had played the role in the 1950s and was the Lone Ranger with which the old ones grew up) that he could not wear the mask in public. Now, notice that the poor guy was not making so much money and it was not like he was going to take anything away from the movie, but everything seemed ... free. <br /> <The other thing the film suffered from (aside from an influential man whose voice was so awful that it had to be overdone) was that westerns were not as hip in 1981. John Wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a decade-long Liberal guilt trip on the construction of the West on the Amerindian genocide. (That and Blazing Saddles sent the whole thing!) The Campfire Scene: Enough said!) Hollywood moved away from the Westerns, because science fiction was COOL at the time. <br /> <br /> The scene that stood out was that of the drunken President Rescue President (and seriously, I would have let Grant stay with the bad guys ... the country would have been better off!) Grant asks Tonto what should be his reward "Respect your treaties with my people". Yeah, that's right, as if it would happen!
