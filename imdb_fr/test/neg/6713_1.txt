I think Cockpuncher is the best work of the Steven Seagal factory for a long time. This film is the first that I have seen since this overview. My point? It's done. Each film is the same. Maybe he will be good at Machete because he will not be the star. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> P.S. Thank you for talking to UCSB when I went to college. It was an incredible speech. You really influenced some people. <br /> <br /> So I have to write ten lines on this film? Umm .... I like the smoking guy who killed a bunch of fools. Whenever someone smells menthol LOOK OUT. Because there could be a silent glock murderer (and another noisy one) who would like to kill you. <br /> <br /> Is it ten?
