I like to think that I can enjoy a film that is out of the ordinary and I certainly love a good film that makes me think. <br /> <br /> If you like movies out of the ordinary, it makes you think, then look elsewhere. This film is so bad and so disjointed that the only thing you'll think about once you're done is how you can lose 90 minutes of your life watching it. <br /> <br /> A film of this type requires driver to get buy from the viewer. Why are we interested in the main characters? What motivates these characters through their existence? Why do they make the decisions they make? This movie makes a very weak attempt to make them and fails in the process. There is no chemistry between these two actors, who are both superb in their ability to be comfortable in any role. So why did they fail here? I firmly believe that they did not know what their motivations were, and that an actor did not know it, his audience could not follow. <br /> <br /> In summary, I've seen Macromedia Flash plus videos in the way of provoking thought, at least I'm more interested in the transformed hamster who loves the moon than the why this married family man would risk everything for a violation of "Code 46".
