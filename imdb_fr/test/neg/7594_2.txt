New Year's Day The day after eating a little too much vodka martinis and Cosmopolitans mixed with a sparkling bouquet at midnight, my wife and I discovered that the local cable company was offering free digital specialty channels for the month of January. We had a choice - are we using freebie channels or are we starting to watch the eight seasons of X-Files on DVD that we received from our daughter for Christmas? <br /> <br /> We chose the digital freebie because DVDs do not go anywhere and it takes us about ten days of twelve hours to watch all the X-Files files from start to finish. The Drive-In channel featured a marathon classic of three horror movies: Asylum (1972), House of the Damned (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). Asylum is well examined here and the Pit and the Pendulum was too late for us to watch, which meant we could only be critical for House of the Damned. <br /> <br /> To be honest, we tried to: be serious with the film since its stars have quite good acting skills - Greg Evigan (crushed Tekwars by William Shatner) and Alexandra Paul (the only babiote) Baywatch can play even if she has the body of a ten-year-old boy). Unfortunately, we soon dissolved laughing, under the influence of a little hair of the dog, shouting each the name of the film to which this dog borrowed his scenes: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hell House, House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Busters! <br /> <br /> The role of actor, especially that of the real girl of Evigan, was not so bad considering the silly scenario with which they had to work. The CGI, for 1996, was hilarious - at its worst point in the final scene when it should have been the most horrible, it was so serious, my wife and I broke up laughing. <br /> <br /> Overall: 4/5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5
