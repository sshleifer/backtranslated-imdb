I was fooled too. Here, I was expecting all kinds of men eating Piranas and what are you getting. <br /> <br /> An hour and a half of nothing, but annoying silences with a weird guy, who is not weird enough to be Scary. <br /> <br /> I thought it was impossible for $ 5 to cost too much for a movie. <br /> <br /> Heck, I got terribly wrong. It was very difficult to watch everything. <br /> <br /> Do not go wrong. It's not so good that it's bad. It's not even that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> It's nothing. an hour and a half of absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> PIECE OF CRAP !!!!!!!!
