[Spoilers possible] <br /> <br /> The sixth film "Halloween" is a totally depressing affair, but unfortunately not in the way envisioned by filmmakers. Now everyone knows the story of how he was slaughtered and published in such a sloppy and incoherent form. The second half, in particular, makes little sense, because the elements of the plot are introduced and abandoned, seemingly at random. The very end let me scratch my head. What happened? Is Dr. Loomis dead or what? This is what you get when you are shamelessly pirating a movie. It is not beautiful to see. <br /> <br /> On a related note, this is the most graphic entry in the series. I have no problem with gore if it's in the right place, but this film takes it to absurd levels. The famous explosive head must be a new low for the series. Michael himself seems to like the killing of another human being, in contradiction with his efficient and methodical approach to John Carpenter's original. <br /> <br /> I do not know who was responsible; director Joe Chappelle or the producers, probably a combination of both. I would be perfectly happy to forgive all those involved if they only publish the legendary "Producers' Cut", a more complete version of the film, which is a significant improvement over each report. From what I understand, it's like a completely different movie. I propose to pay the full price to buy the DVD if Miramax regains his spirits and frees him. <br /> <br /> There are, however, a handful of good things. The idea of ​​Michael controlled by the druids is intriguing. Paul Rudd is as solid as Tommy Doyle, whose appearance is in perfect harmony with the original. Smooth graphics help make the procedure a bit more observable. But these meager offers are eclipsed by the overload of drivel that we have to support. <br /> <br /> Finally, "The Curse of Michael Myers" is known to be Donald Pleasance's latest film. Many of his scenes have been excluded from the final cut, and when he appears, he seems fragile and unhappy. The film is dedicated to his memory, a blatant (if involuntary insult) if it is one. The fact that a talented artist has to end his career in this way is too depressing to even think about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (on ****) <br /> <br /> Posted by Dimension Films
