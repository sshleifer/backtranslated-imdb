"Stick Around" is part of the short series of films that associated Bobby Ray with Oliver 'Babe' Hardy before Hardy's immortal collaboration with Stan Laurel. Several critics have suggested that Ray and Hardy - the ruthless little man and the big domineering man - were a prototype for Laurel and Hardy, but that's just not true. Ray and Hardy play well but do not really form a team. In each of these films, Ray has more footage and is clearly destined to be the hero, while Hardy tyrannizes him in a very different way from his subsequent treatment of the "Ollie" character by "Stanley". It is very clear that the relationship between little Bobby and Big Babe is inspired by Chaplin's previous films, in which Little Swamp was bullied by the huge Mack Swain or beefy Eric Campbell. <br /> <br /> However, in "Stick Around", Hardy sports a bowler hat identical to his "Ollie" title later (although he wears a thicker mustache), and he and Bobby - after passing most of this film as adversaries - end up as drunken comrades. <br /> Bobby is a paper maker for the firm Matz and Blatz, with Hardy as boss. When the self-timer Bobby tries to pretend to show up quickly, there's a clever physical deal between the two men that reminds me of a routine performed by Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton in "The Garage". A little later, Bobby Ray - whose brief acting career has never developed a screen character - performs an "impossible" gag that would have been inappropriate for Stan Laurel, when he pulls out a long stool of a much smaller toolbox. <BR /> <br /> Papermakers are going to work in a sanatorium, and there are the usual unrealistic representations of mental illness: a resident insists on sitting on a toast because he thinks he is a poached egg! There are also racist jokes (and tasteless and without fantasy) involving a black man who inevitably let the prisoners break nuts over his head. When he sees a * image * of a lion - not even a photo, he notes - he goes wild as if he were a real wild animal. <br /> <br /> "Stick Around" is pretty terrible. Most of the pantomime and acting is much broader than necessary for a burlesque comedy; Even Hardy, already a very subtle actor in 1925, plays badly with his over-actor here. There are several bad examples of hit matching. I was impressed by an unusual camera setup, when a big pedestrian face is dirty and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand mirror, rather than his current face. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS COMING. During their brief couple, Hardy usually played the leader, the opponent or both at the same time. here, for once, they end up as buddies. It's a nice ending, but it does not make up for what's really a bad movie. My rating for this one is only 4 out of 10.
