Eric Roberts "stars" in this first prison movie by Tommy Lee Thomas. He plays the leader of a corrupt group of guards. Although evil in the eyes of most people, his character is the kind of guy who is kind enough to give you support wires while you're hanging from the ceiling while he tortures you with "Lethal Weapon" electric prods. . <br /> <br /> The film has a complex plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense. Thomas has the clear eyes of Clint Eastwood, the linings of Dolph Lundgren, JCVD's acting abilities and the body of the youngest guy you knew at school who took steroids after graduation. <br /> <br /> Martin's career "Cobra Kai" Kove shares this weak point with Roberts: in the movie, it's hard to say if Kove's character is supposed to be drunk for the whole movie or if Kove came like this. I could not blame him if he did. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for all participants, the quality of this film is "so bad that it's good" and can be fun IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ABSOLUTELY anything to do better.
