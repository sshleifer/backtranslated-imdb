This film was nothing like the book. I think the scriptwriter must have wanted the writing work of the sequel to Gone with the Wind and have been refused. It was his way of getting their ideas across anyway. The only similarity between this movie and the story it described was the name of the main characters and the location of the main action. None of the events featured in the film happened this way in the book. For a fan of Gone with the Wind (the book and the movie), it was deeply disappointing. If you liked the Scarlett book, do not watch this movie in the hope of seeing it play on screen. They only share the title in common.
