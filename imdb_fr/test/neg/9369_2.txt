I usually do not write show reviews unless I've seen them in their entirety. However, there were so many positive points of view on this show here that I thought it was necessary to balance the whole thing with a bit of realism. <br /> <br /> This show is hysterically bad. I do not think it was supposed to be, but it is. I see there is a lot of praise for the show, and honestly, I do not understand why - this show is so badly played, the dialogue is so awful and the intrigues are meager around their holes. <br /> <br /> I think this show is interesting because it is a test of your standards. Some elements of the show work, and maybe they are just more important to some people than those who do not work, making the show almost impossible to assimilate to people like me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy having a show that you watch, anticipating clichés and other replicas, it can be a nice show to ridicule if you have that kind of time on your hands. <br /> <br /> The pilot is a pretty good example of the whole show. If the senseless ending of the saccharine cliché does not leave you speechless, it can be a show for you.
