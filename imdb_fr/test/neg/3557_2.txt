I watched this movie based on the good reviews here, and I will not repeat that mistake. <br /> <br /> The first two minutes show that a group of people have been reunited following a tragedy, but you do not see what it is. After 12 hours of flashback, we see the boring life of each of these people, who ultimately have no sense for what will happen. When the end is finally over, you realize you've just lost an hour of your life waiting for a big win that does not happen and means nothing to what you've watched. The only connection between these people is that they all had a "bad day" - but even this continuity is lost in boredom. <br /> <br /> If it were to be a clone of "Crash", it's a complete failure.
