I really do not understand how this movie could get a score above 4 here on IMDb. It's just a huge mess, and I must admit that I liked AvP 1: almost no history, okay, I can live with that, but at least they came to the point fast enough. AvP 2 do not. After the presentation of the stupid place, there is well over half an hour of stupid and unsuitable clich√©s for teenagers, a stupid and diabolical dialogue, with the exception of some Alien scenes that give the impression of being an excuse to have the first half of the movie. and scenes from Predator that make you wonder if the guys who make the movie have even looked at another Predator movie or if that was not enough to be disturbed. <br /> <br /> Then this crappy festival finally arrives at the point where the predator begins to attack the aliens, or at least pretends to do so. And my boy, is this predator stupid, blind and deaf? It's horrible. How he even managed to win what he has, it's beyond me. It misses almost every shot, only notice the extraterrestrials when they are in front of him or if it is absolutely necessary for the script, so that it can move where it should be. He is even surprised by teenagers and miserable deputies. What is this guy supposed to be? After the first hour of this abomination, I shook my head more or less constantly at each scene. Almost no scene in this movie goes by without stupidly stupid dialogues, Predator's stupid actions, a stupid lack or stupid actions on the part of our "heroes". <br /> <br /> Then this thing finally ended. To my surprise, not only did my friends and I not know whether to laugh or cry, but everyone I heard heard leaving the room was half crying, half laughing at those hours and a half they had just lost. <br /> <br /> Do not look. Never.
