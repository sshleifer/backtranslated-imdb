Here is another mediocre quality film from Disney. There is no more Disney spirit. The story is boring. All emotions are wrong. It's not cute or moving. The Disney company was both a kind of magical society that made children dream. It's now about making money. Shame on people who use Disney's name for their personal benefit. It's the fall of an empire. And by the way, Pixar is NOT Disney!
