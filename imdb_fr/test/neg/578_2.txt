A divorced single mother in a picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows her to stimulate her dormant love life. Animal project for actress and co-producer Kate Capshaw, who plays a warm and modulated lead role, and yet this story is so thin and the direction and editing so erratic that a slight discontent is seeping. Initially, Helen of Capshaw is considering several friends who read him the love letter (an interesting visual joke), but the first person they make this ploy with is Ellen DeGeneres, who does not play a lesbian but who passes for a gimmick. Different ideas circulate in the hope of staying, and continuity is extremely unstable. The support cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who acts mostly without his t-shirt) is very good, but they can not save the last act, which is disappointing. Discreet, weird and nice, but it's a little bland, nothing more. ** 1/2 of ****
