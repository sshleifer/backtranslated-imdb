...the first? Killjoy 1. But here's the review of Killjoy 2: <br /> <br /> (contains spoilers, beware of readers) <br /> <br /> Oh my God. Oh, my, my, my. I will start by saying that I had no hope that this film was good. Whereas Killjoy (the first film) is without a doubt the worst film of all time, the following has not been very promising. <br /> <br /> As expected, it was not delivered. <br /> <br /> The dead were even more tragic than in the first film. There was absolutely no eye candy, and all the accessories looked so fake that I would not be surprised if they had a kindergarten class prepared. <br /> <br /> Listen, I do not even know where to start. . Hm, for starters, the movie was not even long. It was only one hour and eight minutes (68 minutes), but again, finishing it earlier was actually a reprieve. In fact, that's the only reason this movie was not as bad as the first, because the first one was longer. <br /> <br /> Usually, I do not give comments to critics, but as I do not want one of you to suffer the ordeal of watching this movie mess, I will spoil it. Not much to mess up. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the end. KILLJOY IS THE KILLER MOST ALWAYS. You need explosions, incendiary bombs, firearms, et cetera. to kill all normal serial killers in horror movies. Guess what it took to kill Killjoy? A F *** ING GLASS OF WATER. No lies. In the end, a girl took a cup of water and threw water on Killjoy's face. Then Killjoy screamed and they tried to make him feel like his face was melting by applying dried rubber cement on his forehead. Then he lay down there and people fell asleep. <br /> <br /> Now let's take action. VERY TERRIBLE. Not even a person was credible at all. I do not even know what to say, except that they just hired some hobos living on the street to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I sincerely doubt that they spent more than 100 dollars in total to make this movie. They had nothing. Most of these events took place in the woods, which would not have cost them to film. The actors yielded no effort, so it is obvious that they "work" for free. They had no special effects or sympathetic props, and they probably used ketchup for the blood. God, who am I kidding? They probably did not even spend $ 100. They probably spent $ 3.29 for a bottle of ketchup and that was it. A f ** kin film made with a budget of 3.29 dollars. <br /> <br /> For Bob's sake, they could not even afford to rent a police uniform. Finally, after Killjoy's death, the girl wakes up and says, "Where is he?" and the main woman replies, "He's gone." Then, all of a sudden, a big, goofy guy with scars in his face comes out of nowhere with a cell phone saying, "You have a phone call". The girl answers and says, "Oh, hello mom!" and smiles. Then the big, clumsy guy walks around and reveals that he's a policeman. However, he wears khaki pants and a buttoned green shirt, with a lame badge on the front pocket. Hell, it was probably the badge that the director had received when he was on security patrol in grade 3. Then they all took a beige blazer and left as credits flew. They could not even get a police car, so they just had a beige blazer. F ** kin 'drinks. Killjoy did not even have the ice cream van he had in the first movie. <br /> <br /> Killjoy is without a doubt the most flamboyant gay slasher of all time. If there was a slasher with hot pink spandex and a rainbow flag, he would not be as gay as Killjoy. Killjoy is not funny either (and believe me, he tried to be). <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is an extremely lame threat from one of the offenders. Someone makes a remark to a boy about not going into third grade. The boy replies, "I'll show you the third year!" in a threatening way. This must be the absolute worst threat I have ever heard of. "I'll show you the third year!" <br /> <br /> This film does not even work at the level "so bad, it's good". It's dirt. Unless you have done something wrong and you feel so guilty that you want to punish yourself severely, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not forget; if a fiery homosexual clown with a huge black afro tries to bore you to death with gay jokes (and tries to kill you at the same time), throw him some water. Case closed. <br /> <br /> FINAL EVALUATION: .1 out of 10
