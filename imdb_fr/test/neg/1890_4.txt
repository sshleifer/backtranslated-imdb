I did not understand what the chosen title has to do with the film. This is another monster gathering, just like the FRANKENSTEIN HOUSE. Not really a masterful plot, but Universal had yet to capitalize. <br /> <br /> Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) is very ambitious or exceeds the goals of the ego department. He is working on the cure to prevent Larry Talbot from turning into a werewolf. In one way or another, Count Dracula passes by to get an idea of ​​his vampirism. And to complete the good doctor's experiments, you have to restore the energy of the monster Frankenstein. On the way, the blood of this generous doctor is imbued with that of Dracula. <br /> <br /> John Carradine plays Dracula again. This time he is more convincing. As usual, Lon Chaney Jr. is the Soulman Wolf Man. Glenn Strange is the Frankenstein monster, who does not have much to do for this outing. Lionel Atwill and Martha O'Driscoll are also mentioned.
