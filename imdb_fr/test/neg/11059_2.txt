Audio: <br /> <br /> Seriously, I've never seen a movie with a worse sound. There are scenes where people walk in the grass and we can hardly hear them in their footsteps. They must take their feet. <br /> <br /> You know how, in some movies, they forget a line, so they have to copy it on a picture of the back of someone's head. Here the publishers were not so smart. There is actually a scene where Shannon Tweed's character says his line without moving his mouth at all! <br /> <br /> I'm sure that, for their sound background, they played live effects loops during the shoot, because in many scenes the sound effects will be different or will be absent when the camera will change angle. <br /> <br /> I could write a lot more about the quality of the audio in this movie. <br /> <br /> Other nuggets: <br /> <br /> In this film, they probably consider the opening credits as a special effect because they seemed so difficult to produce. The main title and the first names of the opening credits are in white text on a white sky. They flicker as if they had been carefully painted by hand on each image. <br /> <br /> The reuse of extras from this movie is amazing. There are about 15 rebels in the cast, and yet in a given battle, thirty or more of them will be killed. If only the film was of sufficient quality to distinguish those who died again and again. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that rebels are usually killed by explosions that are always between 10 and 20 meters away. There is a scene, a scene where some rebels are running out of their huts in the rebel base, and a hut trembles when the rebel leaves the door. One wonders if the hut will last long enough to cope with the inevitable explosion. <br /> <br /> There is a blue helicopter that looks as threatening as a running shorts, but has an infinite number of missiles. When they show that the missiles are fired from the helicopter's missile bays, they often fire in unpredictable directions that look a lot like big bottle rockets. They are still able to reach their targets with ease, which, as noted above, is still at a very safe distance from the rebels they are killing. Note the recycled images of the driver pressing the LIVE button to launch the missiles (as it is printed vertically, we read it as the "EVIL" button). <br /> <br /> Notice how the grenade launcher they use generates explosions identical to those created by helicopter missiles. It's also fun in many scenes to see the actor in the foreground shoot in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers he kills. And often, the characters shoot a disproportionate number of bullets on the soldiers who are killed (as when a short burst kills a large group of enemies). <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is really very bad. The plot was thought almost as good as a 5-year-old's football match, and editing is the worst I've ever seen. But honestly, it is sometimes fun to spend 90 minutes laughing at a group of adults who have sincerely participated in such a dreadful movie.
