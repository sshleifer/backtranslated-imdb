The synopsis of this film led me to believe that it would be the story of an unconventional woman defying the conventions of the society with which she lives. I like strong female characters and I was expecting a film that looks a lot like "Chocolate" with less fairy tale and more pizzazz. What I got was a cast of despicable characters. <br /> <br /> For a character-driven film to be effective, I need to feel a connection or compassion for people. There was no one with whom I could tell in the movie. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired in Rain Man) describes a woman suffering from mental illness, probably bipolar, often rough, aggressive and violent. Her husband is screaming and screaming when he does not hit or slap anyone. The kids are rude kids. They scream at each other and the women in the movie. They attack other children without provocation. Violence begets violence. It seems like an island of insensitive, aggressive, violent and rude people all around. <br /> <br /> Management is not convincing. There are mixed scenes that try to be art, but annoy the viewer. The location is exceptionally beautiful, but even that fails to be captured to the point of being filmed. <br /> <br /> I should recommend that you stay away from this failure of the movie.
