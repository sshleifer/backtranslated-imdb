My friends and I watched it so many times that I lost count. It's worth the detour for those who are in the right frame of mind, which means it's not a good horror movie, but a dumb movie for his fun quotes and perverse effects. This movie is better watched by other people with the same ideas as you and so you have someone to laugh with. <br /> <br /> You'll laugh as Greg hops and stirs the lab, stroking his pet rabbit, while his hunchback moves from right to left on his back. "Greg, stop clowning!" Growls Dr. Brandon. You'll laugh as J.G. Patterson beckons Greg to head to the other side of the operating table, while his hand is in the shot. And you'll probably sneer when you realize that the last woman does not have the characteristics with which he built it.
