Family Guy is without a doubt one of the worst shows I have ever had to watch (but not at the bottom, I saw The Jersey Shore). A popular success among middle and high school students who confuses immaturity with nervousness, this show is unprecedented and obsolete. <br /> <br /> As it has been dubbed a comedy show, let's take a look at his "humor". 1. Random Flashbacks / cuts to celebrities, movies, politics or anything that can be cut to make you laugh. It has aged after about 5 repetitions per episode. Simple solution: every time you hear "It's worse than / like time ...", plug in your ears. <br /> <br /> 2. Inadequacy for herself. This show is notorious for the insertion of inappropriate gags having little to do with the plot in general. Solution: Watch for South Park. They did things right. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that Family Guy is not worth your time and does not hold the candle instead of the Simpsons.
