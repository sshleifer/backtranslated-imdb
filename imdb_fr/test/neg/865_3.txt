I just saw Caribe two or three nights ago at the annual Vistas Film Festival in Dallas and I must express my dissatisfaction. The opening caption tells us that the film is a representation of the current invasion of South American countries (Costa Rica, in this case) by the North American oil companies and the negative effects, both economic and environmental, of this invasion. The main characters are a married couple who leads a simple and enjoyable life by maintaining a banana farm. Immediately a woman arrives and announces that she is the half-sister of the woman. I will not go into detail about this (and to be honest, I do not think I'm spoiling anything with this review), another key point is that the company they distribute their bananas to budget requirements in a poor economy. Thus, the main conflict that is supposed to be dealt with in the film is that of the husband between the hammer and the place, who tries to preserve his livelihood. On the one hand, the Reynolds oil company essentially offered him a job and financial compensation (essentially a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the city to allow him to start drilling. in his city (thus jeopardizing his status with the community and the community itself). On the other hand, he faces bankruptcy, but on the side of his community, to protest against drilling. Given the length of this film, it would have been plenty of time to explore the problems just described, but it just does not happen and I'll explain why. You will notice that this film has won two awards so far, one for the direction and a prize for the public. I will not separate Esteban's guidelines, it was not bad enough or good enough for me to be passionate about writing. The public prize was awarded to a film festival in Spain and for this film to win a public prize, I must imagine that the Spaniards are digging soap operas. In fact, Central America and South America love soap operas, I know it. I suppose Esteban was either trying to take advantage of that, or was digging soap operas himself, because that's what's going on over the course of the film, so much so that the whole plot of the oil company is sidelined, almost as if they imagined at the halfway point of the making of this film that it had become tiresome, because it seems that at least three of the secondary characters have seen their history and their development seriously compromised for give way to more scenes of sex and crying. The only real villain of the film is one of these three characters, and you can not at any time discover who he really is. It's almost like cutting screen time just before you take it out of the movie. From time to time, they play with the conspiracy against the plot, but they are at best digressions. What we see much more are scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. These themes saturate the plot to such an extent that the intrigue of the oil company becomes useless. It's almost as if it's a coup to legitimize a soap opera by adding some political relevance. Nevertheless, the film is so caught up in romance that it does not really know what to do with itself, which ends in such a sharp end that you wonder what you expect or expect. if there was anything to start. Here are two things that, in my opinion, could have saved this film: either eliminate the half-sister or the oil company. It is obvious that one of the two interests them the most. Or maybe if Caribe had lasted an hour longer, they could have fixed all that. Be that as it may, I would have done well without a direct soap opera, and I think that the question of oil companies operating foreign nations is in urgent need of response from the film community. Caribe is both and neither. These two angles could have worked together if they had been balanced accordingly, but with a romantic plot going around in circles and taking almost twice as long as necessary at the expense of an oil plot barely established at first, both sides suffer from it. Better still, the love affair is never resolved. I would like to say that I would watch this movie again to see what I missed, but I feel that I already know what it is. As far as I'm concerned, it does not matter if I see Caribe ten more times. I missed that because it's just not there.
