I recently watched this movie because I am a big fan of Kinski. But, oh my god. Do not mistake yourself. I like this guy. But in this film, all his game is simply a refusal to work! But fortunately, he is not the only one to blame. First, the entire scenario is totally unsatisfactory when faced with an armed man looking for a murderer, while Kinski is stuck in jail for a crime he did not commit. That's all. All dialogues and characters are so bad that it makes you scream. But maybe that's the pleasure of it all. If you know Kinski's biography, it's obvious that Kinski did not care at all about these films. Especially all his Italian-Western roles. He just took the money and that was it. Once again, this whole movie is totally strange. Only for hardcore-fans of the genre.
