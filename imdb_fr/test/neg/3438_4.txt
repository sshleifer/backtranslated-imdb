!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> With the exception of THE TERMINATOR and TOTAL REMINDER, I do not think Arnie's action / adventure films are worth much. It's better than his comedies, but it's hardly said much. The problem I have with its blockbusters is that they are overwhelmed and they lack morality. <br /> <br /> Morality? I mentioned in my TERMINATOR 2 review the scene where a good man, Terminator, pulls out the SWAT team kneecaps. Should we think that because the hero mutilates the people who do their job instead of killing them, we will admire him in one way or another? This is the problem with ERASER, when the character of James Cann is revealed as a traitor within the Marshal's department. Arnie's character, John Kruger, runs away with a witness he protects, but in several subsequent sequences, Kruger kills a pretty large amount of marshals working with the villain. Are we assuming they were all traitors too? Many of them were surely honest men trying to stop Kruger because the villain had told them that Kruger was the traitor? It is a rather embarrassing thought that Kruger killed several people who were really trying to silence the law. <br /> <br /> Despite the cost of a hundred million dollars, the special effects are not so impressive. Watch the scene where Kruger releases the jet wing and struggles to put a parachute. It is obvious that the action ends with a stuntman who performs the free fall sequence while Arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen. ERASER is also a film that contains useless synthetic images with killer alligators, not only useless synthetic images, but also unconvincing synthetic images. There are also a few holes in the plot, as in the opening scene, involving two people from the witness protection that the crowd has caught up. Kruger opens the trunk of a car and takes out two bodies and lights a fire, projecting the crowd of perfume. Kruger is then rearranged the computerized dental records of the couple he saved. It would be logical, but would ALL dental records of couples be kept on a computer? More importantly, do we believe that the US department Marshal has a freezer filled with corpses for such events? <br /> <br /> So you're going to go, a typical Arnie thriller that takes a long time on improbable scenes and lacks information and it's interesting to note that ERASER did not make much of a box-game profit. office, with production costs almost exceeding the number of potential viewers. After ERASER, Arnie did not do much more box office except for TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, which was an event film and it will be interesting to see if it will stay in the box office. memories as a political man rather than a movie star.
