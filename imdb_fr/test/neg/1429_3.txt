Strangeland (1998) D: John Pieplow. Kevin Gage, Elizabeth Pena, Brett Harrelson, Robert Englund, Tucker Smallwood, Amy Smart, Dee Snider (Glasses Sister), Amal Rhoe. Disturbing scenes of torture "showcase" this dark and disgusting movie about a sadistic psychopath who drives teenagers to his torture chamber via the Internet. Snider (from the ex-Twisted Sister rock band) plays the putrid psychopath, which is a filthy twist (no pun intended) on Hannibal Lecter. Pena is wasted as the mother of the victims. Harrelson (Woody's brother) delivers one of the worst cop performances I've ever seen in a movie, and Rhoe proves why this is his only screen credit with such a pathetic performance. The soundtrack of heavy metal is finally numb, the scenes of torture very graphic and rude, and the end is zero. RATING: 3 out of 10. R rated for graphic violence and torture, strong language and sexual situations.
