I got seriously scammed with this purchase. The other posters cover quite well the weaknesses of this poor movie. My DVD that I bought was actually a 1978 Piranha poster on the cover with the credits of this film on the front 'Directed by Joe Dante', etc. I was really disappointed to find the wrong movie on the record. I'm actually a fan of a lot of bad movies. There is always something funny or at least fun on most of them somewhere. NOt this movie! In fact, I'm going to spend the three dollars in gas to return this DVD of two dollars just for the basic principle. False blatant packaging here. Easily the worst movie of all time. No redeeming factor at all. BORING !!! Not worth checking, just to see how bad it is. Seriously.
