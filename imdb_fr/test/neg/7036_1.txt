one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but extremely funny (not on purpose though). Every scene that contains something to do with; An airplane, a love story, a scenario or a scenario is badly ruined. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all the drivers, it is so bad that you should burst out laughing at some point in the movie (see also Airport 79: the Concorde, for the same reason). <br /> <br /> Anyone else, avoid this movie as a plague (except for fans of B-movies, of course) <br /> <br />
