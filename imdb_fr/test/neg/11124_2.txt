Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a "crypto-zoologist" (sophisticated term for one of those losers who make fun of himself and who likes to study extremely rare - read: non-existent - animals) and his team of hunters arrive to trap a Chupacabra, a big, frenzied, scaly and evasive beast. To transport it to the mainland, they smuggle it on a Greek cruise ship and some idiots open the box containing it when they have been specifically ordered not to do so. I suppose the strange grunt sounds coming from inside were also not a sufficient deterrent. The monster then makes the monster thang; drag various pieces of passengers until the ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies), a special square jaw agent pretending to be an insurance salesman for some reason (Dylan Neal), an instructor from Hoarish blond Tai Bo (Chelan Simmons)), a group of guys with machine guns and others trying to stop him. The main victims (who, I think, are supposed to be comic relief but hard to say) are a rich old bitch (Paula Shaw) with a yippered burrow and an erased gold digger (David Millbern). Apparently, the monster can be knocked out with a single dart of tranquilizer, but can survive dozens of bullets. Chupacabra's design is acceptable (although not original) but the rest of the film is devoid of suspense, surprise or interest. An annoying "original" film from the Sci-Fi channel; they made dozens of movies like this one with almost interchangeable characters and intrigues, but with slight modifications on the creature. Already enough!
