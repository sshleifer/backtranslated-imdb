It is tempting to consider this film as a daring avant-garde experience. I like to think that the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the conventions of the comic film and produce something completely, totally, totally insane. <br /> <br /> The answer, judging by "De Venus", is a resounding 'Yes'. It may not be the worst movie I have ever seen, but my brain seems to have repressed all the memories of others. This horrible movie is just about right: enough for thought to still cause pain, but not too much for my internal censors to erase from my consciousness. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to imagine what the director and actors thought was what they did when they did that, or why they decided to take it out time they had done it. I doubt that all the people who work there earn a lot, but they certainly could have raised enough money to buy all the engravings and have them engraved. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that has absolutely nothing to recommend. he. It's not even pleasantly bad. It's just a movie in which nothing interesting is happening. I was seriously thinking of getting it back and getting my money back, something I have never done before. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about renting (let alone buying!) This horrible movie!
