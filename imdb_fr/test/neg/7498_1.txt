Hello everyone. For what it's worth, I'm a doctoral program on Indonesian politics and I came back this semester after about a year of field work, mostly in Jakarta. <br /> <br /> I'm a big movie fan As a general rule, I would go out as often as I could and buy tons of local VCDs during my stay. This one I saw at the theater, since it opened during my stay and, fortunately, closed soon after. <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience for this film? The wives and spoiled girls of the Indonesian super elite whose antics are weakly and unnecessarily parodied? The vast majority of Indonesians who could never afford even a single dish, let alone a full meal, in the central restaurant of the movie? Or Indonesian gay men, whose dilemma in the Muslim-dominated society of the country is reduced to an absurd simplistic preaching, to self-respect. <br /> <br /> If all that was not enough, the soundtrack was either recorded or mixed so absent that even native-speaking Indonesians could not hear many lines. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for a cutting-edge gay-themed movie in a part of the world that seems to be among the least likely to produce such an animal, forget it. "Westler" of the early 80s, or "My Beautiful Laundrette", of the same era, far better to give a face more happy to the fight against homophobia, not showing through scenes incessant and verbose. <br /> <br /> All in all, an unfortunate waste of money in a country that still can not educate all its children or keep them healthy.
