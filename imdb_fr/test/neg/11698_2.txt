This film has gone too far from Straub's novel for me to enjoy. Barely passed in the middle of the film. In addition to transforming Don Wanderly, Edwards' nephew, into his son, he removed most of the main scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life. What was left was garbage. Straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. I also do not think the cast did a great job selecting the Chowder Society members. I hope someone will come and remake this film properly in my lifetime. I just hate when Hollywood slays the works of talented authors because they think their version is so much better. Makes me sick.
