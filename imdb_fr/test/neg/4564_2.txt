I love teen / high school genre movies, but this movie was really lacking in originality. The only premise of this film is that four friends cheat to go to high school and put a strain on their friendship. There is simply not enough depth in the story or the characters to hold the audience's attention for the duration of the film. The acting is not that bad, even if the actors do not have much to work, the dialogue is tripartite and clich√© '... After watching this film, we must ask how a producer could meet a project like this and think: "I have to do this movie." No wonder he could not go out in the room. Andrew Gurland is a hack, to avoid or burn.
