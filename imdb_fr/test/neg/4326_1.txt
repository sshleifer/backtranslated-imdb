Look, a movie must be worse than ever. I suggest it may be India Song. When I saw the movie in 1976, he was playing at Carnegie Hall, a place frequented by people who are very interested in film. About half way, people were just coming out of the theater. My girlfriend did not let us go, but in the end, the theater was practically empty. I kept telling people when they left that "the good part is yet to come". And it was. The good part was the screen at the end that said "end". It was the only good part. I am still annoyed by this movie 24 years later. It was useless, stupid and derivative (Marienbad, second part). Only see it if you want to spend two endless hours learning to distinguish between simply bad and just horrible.
