Milla stands out in this film for her sense of style and the way clothes hang her. I learned to hate that little crumpled face of three years that she does every time she pretends to cry. She makes all the arguments she tries to make as a serious actress. Of course, in a movie with a BALDWIN and Denise, she always shines like a mature actress. David seemed to be doing Woody Allen by Howdy Doody. Not a word or gesture in the whole movie seemed sincere or even sincerely acted. "How Harry met Sally" and "Two Weddings and Funerals", even "Sleepless In Seattle" had scripts, places and ACTORS. The script seemed to be a chain of nasty and rude gags separated by LOTS OF WORDS. The sites seemed to be a few blocks away from each other. Milla and the lady who played the girl who was in the stars are only two actors in this breakaway of an independent film. I watched almost all that the first time with the sound cut, just looking at Milla. This clue gag was old the first time I saw it and it's a silly swindle of a song in "How to succeed in business without really trying".
