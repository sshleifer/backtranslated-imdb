You living them? OK I think I am a smart, educated, liberal and really in the movies. I like a lot and I have a great sense of humor. I felt it was a terribly painful comedy. They were paid to do that, gasoline was used, electricity burned, food was consumed, sets were built ... why? I blame the current state of the world on this film and all the people associated with it, I will even include the audience. We must all blame and deserve all that will happen. It's not funny, not much happens, everyone seems bored or bored. There are no conversations, communication is minimal. There is no conspiracy to my knowledge. In fact, I just lost 89 points, something of my life. I will never find this time again. The only message I have left is maybe life is too short to watch movies of people who do not do much ... and then you die!
