It's better than Cronenberg's first horror movies, but nothing more than your basic story. The theme of the video game has already been said. There's nothing original left except Cronenberg's strange atmosphere (which is not so strong here) with the fun sexual references and Shore's dark score. The story never attracts your full attention. It flows right after event with event with a boring rhythm. Note 4/10.
