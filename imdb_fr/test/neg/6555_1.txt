I told one of my friends the time my grandfather chose this horrible shit to watch a night at the theater. He never chose another one again! It was so bad! Anyway, my friend then told me that her father had written for this trash. I thought she was joking. It turns out she was serious. In fact, she had never seen him before and said that it would quickly end his father's career as a writer. I told him not to waste his time. But if she broke down and looked at her, she would understand very quickly why it ended her father's life as a writer. I mean, even for the 1980s, this shit is bad beyond description. I mean, Joe Frazier as Terrible Tucker? And why in the world do two cops care a bit about a house full of ghosts? And the movie poster? A ghost with his tongue hanging? What is it about? Nothing about it makes sense. Well, I told my friend that this shit had not only ended his father's writing career, but also that of everyone involved. Or at least none of them have ever fully recovered from being in that garbage can of a movie. Let's just say that I will always ridicule my friend for telling me that her father was a writer for this movie! That alone should say how bad it is!
