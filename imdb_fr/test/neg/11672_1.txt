Every time I see this film, I have the same impression: some parts are so incredibly stupid / bad that they make me shit, they are unintentional and there are many; the rest is just bad, stupid and / or unimportant. A film like Evil Dead is credited with being bad at its own expense because it's the expected result - it's stupid and silly because Sam Raimi did what he was trying to do. This film does not have that excuse, it's stupid and lame because the filmmakers have failed miserably. The crappy result is superimposed on shit writing and its performances, which is a pity that the lowest score awarded to a movie is "terrible". Watching this film has the same effect as listening to an essay by Billy Madison: "Everyone in this room is now stupider to have listened to it." I should be able to give this movie something around -5.
