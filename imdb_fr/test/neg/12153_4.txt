This movie did not excite me. During my holidays in Turkey, I noticed that he was playing at the local cinema and I decided to take the opportunity to go see him. The action sequences in the film are well choreographed, however, the story lurks in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the things I did not understand was how Borte got the money for guards. <br /> <br /> The other thing I did not particularly like was the missing segment of Khan's life. This does not indicate in detail how the criminals were able to find him and re-imprison him after he disappeared for so long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I rate this movie as one (4) because I enjoyed the action sequences, but they were too few to warrant a higher rating because the dialogue left less than impressed ...
