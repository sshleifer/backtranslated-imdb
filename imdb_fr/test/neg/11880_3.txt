What a stupid waste! 30,000 square feet of reconstructed ancient Rome, 2 million cubic meters of buildings 50 feet high, 10,000 costumes, 2 years of work, an international committee of ancient history (sic!), Actors and actresses of first class. The final result? An empty TV movie for a one-digit IQ.
