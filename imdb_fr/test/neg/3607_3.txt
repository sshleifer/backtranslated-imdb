... but of course, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Now, I did not think I liked the first movie. I'm not sure what's going on with the Disney marketing group, but it seems like every trailer they make for an animated film ends up making me too childish, or stupid or stupid, and yet the movies themselves are usually anything but. And no film seemed as bad to me in the caravans as The Emperor's New Groove. That's why I was quite surprised to find that I really enjoyed this movie when I finally broke down and saw it. I came in with zero expectations and came out nicely. <br /> <br /> Despite Disney's track record with live action, I had hoped for a better experience with Kronk here ... but in the end I was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately not really surprised that I feel this way). There is almost no humor for adults. The original songs are uninspired and cute. The animation, although not bad, still does not approach the emperor (who was not a lion king). <br /> <br /> The main plot, as such, is surprisingly "minor" and mainly consists of a sequence of mini-track flashbacks - in fact, everything looked more like a sequence of pilot episodes of a series of Saturday morning cartoons only to one well-designed entity. <br /> <br /> David Spade has about four lines The whole movie and there is not a lot of John Goodman either, so overall we still have too much of Patrick Warburton's Kronk - which was entertaining as as a secondary character in the first movie but that is completely inappropriate as a main character. drive here. <br /> <br /> Even though kids find it a bit of fun, the only thing New Groove has done for me is to make me want to go back and look at the original.
