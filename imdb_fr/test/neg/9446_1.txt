I never comment on a movie, but I have to say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I think it was done by a beginner film student and not to put talented students in the movies, but it was horrible! I did not buy the lead actress and I felt like I was in class with her while she was shooting. Her decisions were very healthy and I felt that she imitated other actresses in movies without acting or making her own decisions. The management was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. The end might be a little more meaningful if someone told the story and not a song. I love Patsy Cline, but his songs appear quite often in the movies. Maybe the selection of songs could have been a bit more original. The song "crazy" was such a clich√©. As I said before, I never comment on movies and I saw my share of good and bad, but it was the worst. Sorry.
