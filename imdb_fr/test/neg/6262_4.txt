I never expected a movie from Jim Wynorski, director of B trashy movies: silly premise, cheapo effects and a bit of nudity from a busty babe, and I'm usually pretty happy . /> Well, Cheerleader Massacre delivers the first and certainly the last, but is unfortunately a little light with regards to splashing. And when a movie has the word "massacre" in the title, and stick to gore, then Houston, we have a problem. <br /> <br /> Wynorski's film is centered on a group of cheerleaders who, with their teacher, minibus driver and a few guys, find themselves stuck in the mountains during a snowstorm. They walk to a deserted mountain retreat where they find food and shelter. And a crazy killer who wants them all dead! From the beginning, the good old Jim makes sure that his film presents many scenes loaded with T & A, including the obligatory shower scene, as well as many other moments during which tasty women are nokkid -babes -in-a-hot-szene). None of the women seem young enough to be a cheerleader (and we never even see her in her outfit), but who cares about these details when they are all too willing to undress in the name of art? <br /> <br /> I care, however, about the many unsightly deaths of the film. With such an insane title, I had hoped that inventive bloodletting would accompany all butts, bushes and breasts; instead, virtually all murders occur off screen or are almost not gory. Only a stupid post-decapitation scene (made with a cheap CGI) can deliver the goods. <br /> <br /> Yet, if you feel in the mood to titillate yourself for slasher minus the crane, then, at 82 minutes, at least the cheerleader's Massacre will not be too much of a loss of time.
