I like JAG a little. That's its charm, but lately it's too much propaganda. For a foreigner (not American), the patriotic feeling can be a little excessive. <br /> <br /> I do not like Rabb and MacKenzie ceasing to be lawyers (as they were at the beginning of television). show) to become superheroes who stop wars and save whole continents. It's almost like watching a recruiting video from the US Army. <br /> <br /> I always watch the show, so it's not so bad. But I would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigate military accidents and do not save the world in the future.
