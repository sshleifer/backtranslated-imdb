Of all the rave reviews, we could not wait to see this show. We love crazy humor and creative material, especially from Australia and New Zealand. <br /> <br /> I admit that this may not be a fair report, we only saw the first 15 minutes. But we just could not bear the misery - it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever seen - in 15 hours. The songs can be (slightly) interesting in themselves, but inserted for 3 minutes endless in the middle of a scenario scene simply do not work. <br /> <br /> We are now trying to erase the memory. . If you want a good mood in a charming and engaging movie, see "The Dish" instead.
