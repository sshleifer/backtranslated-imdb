The people of the Bay Area probably remember Paul, the Diamond Center, a creamy huckster who flogged easy credits and cheap rocks to late-night television in the '80s and early' 90s. I only mention it because there is an actor in Death Machines that looks like JUST LIKE IT playing the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene of this absolutely dreadful and almost unassailable policeman drama about a dragon lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely hung up after finishing this movie) who controls the local union. Our hero (let's call him not Paul of the Diamond Center) plays the role of the restaurateur with all the subtlety of Luigi of the Simpsons ("you lika da spaghetti?") And seems unimpressed when one of his clients complains about the food . No, there is no fly in the soup or hair in the sauce: there is a red Buddha in the pasta, the business card of the murderous crime leader, who sends a statuette to each of his potential victims . Death Machines is bad in every way and quite boring, which is an even worse crime.
