This film was one of those films where he completely deceived me by saying that it was a slasher movie of the 80s, based on the cover, but it was not. It was perhaps one of the worst slasher films I have ever seen. The image on the cover does not correspond to any part or scene of the film; in fact, it was not a chain saw. Even the slogan does not fit the film. The film is about a group of cheerleaders and two heads of hen escaping into a desolate hut in the cold woods for a weekend. However, things get even colder when they start being murdered by an unknown killer. At the same time, the local sheriff's department is pursuing a dangerous killer. I will name the problems in a list. <br /> <br /> 1. The game. Boy was it cheap and horribly bad. It did not look natural and seemed to be thought of as very scripted. None of the actors seemed to have tried to play with good intentions and as a result they seemed stupid and tired. All the characters in the movie did not play well, so I will not point out specific people, but I want to say that the stoners did a horrible job, as did the police and the cheerleaders, which is not not a surprise. <br /> 2. The plot. This story had set up a perfect scenario for a good old slasher movie, but instead, they riddled it with intrigue, useless and useless scenes and a stupid general story about the killer's intentions. There have been many plots, including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and yet, remains in the group of girls when it happened? The ex-prisoner has almost no use in the film, apart from its useless usefulness. There was random and useless sex and nudity, even for a B movie or for my taste, it was a bit too much. Regarding the intentions of the killer, let's just say that it was stupid and that it makes no sense to know why he / she kills young girls. In addition, there were some very predictable loss of sight that I saw arriving about 30 miles away. <br /> <br /> 3. The technical side. The lighting was ok, it was certainly not the worst lighting I saw in a movie, but there were places where it was supposed to be dark but it looked more like the afternoon. The house seemed darker with the lights on, then with the lights off. The camera work was average, there was no good shooting, no great panoramas or zooms, but I thought that the work was done, it was necessary to create a suspense with its framing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film, in the sense of intrigue, character development and performance was a huge disappointment and a waste of time. What I thought was a great horror movie turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was really bad and wooden, the plot was meaningless and there was no emotion for this movie. However, the technical aspect of this film saved me, because if the camera worked badly or if the lighting was bad, then I would have turned off the DVD player and added something else. I would recommend this film to those who like really soft B-movies as well as those who follow cult classics, because this film certainly is. I would recommend this film partially to those who love slasher movies from the 80s. But for me, this movie was pitiful and quite horrible.
