It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I could hardly stay awake. The acting and the plot were horrible. I like B movies, but this movie has nothing to make me laugh or think. Okay, there were two or three fun moments in the beginning, so I have to give this movie to 2 out of 10. If you really want to watch it, look at the first 10 minutes. After that, you will be more and more disappointed when the movie is aired.
