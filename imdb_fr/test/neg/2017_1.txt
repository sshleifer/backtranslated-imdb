It may be the worst movie I have ever seen. I knew it was a movie B before watching it (it was actually the reason to watch it), but I never thought it could be so bad. The title promises Dracula in space and the book, but the story does not really use the fact that the character of Casper van Dien is a descendant of Van Helsing. And pay attention to the end of the film, it's going fast. I have never seen an end shout "And now, we are over budget!" in a clearer way. Their resolution of the movie was rather comical, however, the story was so clearly written in a corner. If you feel you have to see it, watch it with a friend who shares your love of B-movies. If I did not do it, I would not have done it until the end.
