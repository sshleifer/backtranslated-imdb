I will precede my article stating that I am not a fan of the independent genre "Direct to Video" which owes a lot to Grindhouse movies of the 60s. I have none, I have never rented, so he I may not be very appreciative for those smart and low budget puffers that many other people have. <br /> <br /> I caught this film on Cinemax late on a Saturday night with a friend. Please do not ask me why I was watching Cinemax late on a Saturday night with a friend. We were bored with World Championship Poker. Misty Mundae (and I wish she did not recognize being from Illinois, as we are revealing very bright thespians here) caught our attention. Normally, the purpose of some good soft-core porn movies would be to put you in the mood of your partner. Good sex, tongue in cheek, and who knows what could happen? After about 15 minutes and a scene where the main character seduces a victim of aggression, my friend told me, "If you want to watch the rest of the fine, I go to bed so you do not have to. please turn off the volume, this is what I understand from the plot: the character of Misty is an asexual nerd who is bitten by a spider and turns into a super-sex kitten with powers of super slings that do not come from There's a kind of nasty meanness involved, which does not look particularly nasty or sexy Spiderbabe saves the situation, has sex, MJ (who is a man in this movie) constantly receives proposals of stereotypical bikers who make gay homosexuality and, in one way or another, the nasty villain is pushed back from a building that could be dead. <br /> <br /> of course this film? ended. <br /> <br /> What was the problem? To make a third-year parade look like an Oscar, this scenario was written by people who, in my opinion, are drunk, are perverts of college sex who would not know what sex is if they were taking a class taught by Mrs. Ruth, special Effects as special as someone jumping from a trampoline, humor as funny as ?? Well, I have not met anything yet. Sex scenes? If we were watching a video, the only thing these scenes would have activated is the fast forward button. And the action scenes? Some of my old Atari VCS games had better choreography. <br /> <br /> Now, I know that this type of movie is supposed to be appreciated for its inherent wickedness. Companies like Employment Insurance do not try to make good films: they have a niche and target it. My experience as a marketer taught me that they have the perfect means to serve their audience. But after my brief exposure to 'Spiderbabe', I can say that I'm not going to plunge into this world any time soon. The problem with filmmakers in this kind of problem is perhaps this: they are putting so much emphasis on the poor quality of the films that, if they made an effort to try to focus on what they do very well they will be very pleasant. 'the bad' Cinema, at the Troma, in the 80s. Sorry guys; the spirit is there, but the efforts are not. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that "Alice in Acidland" intrigues me ??
