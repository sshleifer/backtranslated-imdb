This agglomeration fails so badly at all levels that it is difficult to decide what to say. It does not deserve a line, let alone ten, but to adhere to the IMDb rules, that's it, I probably will not succeed the first time and I will have to type a little more to compensate for the acceptance of this submission. LOL <br /> <br /> If I had seen this schlock in the 70s when I was going through my mushroom phase, I would have always considered it unimaginative and superficial. The most exciting shot for me was the long shot when the elevator door was opened and closed. I was at the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> A person at this place wrote that she had met the creator of this mess, as if it was a red letter day in her life. We can only pray that something much more exciting happens in the life of the posters. Get a hold, amigo.
