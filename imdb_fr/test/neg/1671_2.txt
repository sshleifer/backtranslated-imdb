What really stupid film, all I can say is that the writer must be very interested in magic mushrooms and LSD, because it must be the result of one of his "travels". <br /> <br /> You follow the film as a whole. very well it's very weird but hey I'm sure in the end there will be a very good explanation for all this ... Only to be disappointed to find it, there is no explanation at all and the twist at the end makes it even more confusing. At the end of the movie, you will probably get the same facial expression as if you were in a paying for you and the merchant tells you, it's going to be 11.95 please and proceeded to nudge you in bullets without any apparent reason. There are so many factors in this film that remain unexplained and I think that leaves the viewer's imagination in a very weird way. Do not get me wrong, I like weird movies, "The Cell" could easily be described as strange and twisted, but to me it's a brilliant movie (despite the J-Lo cast I do not like not as much as I did not manage to make him balance my opinion). This is not one of these movies, and I think you should take into consideration the characters of those who rent this movie. I can tell you that they are probably the kind of people who would go to an art show, would see a lot of pigeon droppings on a whiteboard and say "Oooooh, what a masterpiece, the artist has really found a unique way of representing eternity "when in fact it's about bird feces on a board. <br /> <br /> Keep this last memory in mind when you watch this movie, <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading!
