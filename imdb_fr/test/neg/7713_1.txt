I am furious! It had been a long time since I had seen the last zombie movie, so I was really looking forward to watching a good old zombie movie. HoTD2 was a major disappointment. A reasonable story but an acting game, filming, dialogue and clich√©s nauseating and striking lines. I did not even see the first one which is supposed to be worse than this one ... now I am curious to know how much it could have been so bad! The movie is full of mistakes and blunders. Who on Earth analyzes DNA using a blood sample !? Why do these "special forces" who "have been in hell and back" fight like spoiled girls of 6 years? We see ferocious zombies that would bite at any risk, then hundreds of them waving our two "heroes", bringing them to the ground, then letting them go without even a scratch. I could go on and on about it, but life is too short and I have already lost two hours watching this pathetic film that is an insult to the film industry.
