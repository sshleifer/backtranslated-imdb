"DO A." is a sensational thriller directed by directors Rocky Morton and Annabel <br /> <br /> Jankel. The acting is ok and the scenario is pretty bad. This film also contains some moments that will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence are. <br /> <br /> For example, someone is shot near a window. We then see from outside <br /> <br /> the building that looks like this person jumped. I laughed my head when it happened. This film strives, but ultimately fails. Watch this film <br /> <br /> only if you have no choice. <br /> <br /> My review: ** <br /> <br /> Rating: [R] <br /> Reasons for the evaluation: Violence and language. * <br /> <br /> * There was no reason for evaluation available because of his age.
