I can not hit this movie too terribly, because it's obvious in the middle of the observation that they were trying to make it bad, or "campy" if you prefer. Anyway, many of the pieces they have tried to make funny are actually, but often just for the cheese factor. Watch the game "Space Invaders", played in reality! Scratch your head in front of the ruined robots ... oh, madness! And watch everything go all the way, towards the end, with the "time chain"! And sexual insinuations continue to fly ... I am actually surprised that this has ended in a PG. Never mind. A fun way to lose a few hours, but Star Wars / Trek is not that, dear friends. 3 out of 10
