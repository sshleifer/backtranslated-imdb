This video contains audio to be heard by someone while they sleep. And the same can be said for the video. <br /> <br /> Morgan and his wife claiming to be in trouble at the minimum wage? With a rolling camera? And his little wifey-poop complains? Leave me alone. They are both rich. They are sitting in their fake apartment for $ 350 a month filming this with their $ 1,000 video team a month. I used to respect Morgan, but now his "30-day" experience is nothing more than trying to deceive the volunteer viewers who want to be fooled. <br /> <br /> Go Morgan, we film you for work at $ 6.00 an hour and you are paid by naive employers who do not see these big cameras filming the whole ?? And we do not think they do not pay you under the table?
