Perhaps one of the worst (if not the) film ever conceived, played and played in the history of cinema. Who on the green earth of God would ever think of founding Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? She looked like her mother. God forgive me but I am just honest. And that was the least of the many problems that plagued this horrible excuse for a film. It was a horrible statement against women, but at least if you want to blame women for the world's problems, tell a decent story, not with so many boring loop holes and pathetic excuses for suspense and chills. Everyone should get their money back who has gone to the theater or bought the DVD.
