If you decide to watch Wild Rebels, do not expect something deep and meaningful. If you're looking for a movie that explores the relationships and structure of a biker gang, Wild Rebels is not the right movie. If you're looking for a talk about the deterioration of the US education system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, Wild Rebels is a bad movie. If you're looking for a film that shows how badly rural police are underfed by a well-funded and well-organized gang, Wild Rebels is the bad movie. But if you're looking for an absurd movie full of scenes of unintentional humor, dreadful actors, complicated storylines and community-style production values, Wild Rebels is the right movie. <br /> <br /> Wild Rebels tells the story of a disappointed stock car driver named Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo). After a violent fall (that Rod leaves completely unscathed despite the fact that he only has cotton pants and a jacket London Fog style), Rod decides to abandon it. Having no plan for his future, besides wandering aimlessly through the alleys of the South, he comes across the Satan's Angels biker gang (a gang being one of the dumbest in the world to have donned a leather jacket and a woman they seem to share). This group of hooligans spends their time terrorizing a rural Florida town by committing atrocities such as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox. These stupid idiots need someone to act as their driver for larger crimes they have planned. Apparently, these three Einstein can only drive two-tire vehicles, not four. They are recruiting Rod to make daring exploits that only an experienced stuntman would be able to hold the car in the middle of a gravel road during a low speed chase. They end up holding a bank, launching into the aforementioned low-speed pursuit and organizing the wildest gun battle with the police ever filmed. I could go on forever, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> I hate the term "too bad, it's good", but that seems to describe Wild Rebels.
