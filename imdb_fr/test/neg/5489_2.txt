Illuminata has expanded the boundaries of John Turturro's mediocrity from a minor actor to a director, screenwriter and third-rate producer. This film was awful. It is disjointed and sails from stage to stage with little flow or meaning in relation to the main plot. <br /> <br /> We are served with a set of fragmented scenes, all different from each other. The only common thread that seems to cross them is that they occur in the lives of members of the same theater repertoire company. The few scenes that matter to the plot are so complicated that you often can not know if the dialogue comes from the story or if the actors interpret their lines for the piece in the story. <br /> <br /> If this story was a person, it would be a schizophrenic with a multiple personality disorder. He could not decide if it was a drama, a romance, a comedy, a tragedy, a sexual farce or a parody of a theater. Turturro was lifeless and impassive as Tuccio, supposedly a complex and passionate writer whose play has his great luck when the current show is to be canceled due to the illness of the main actor. Susan Sarandon gave a good performance as an aged actress trying to seduce Tuccio for a role. Unfortunately, she felt it was necessary to go topless, which only illustrates that the computer hardware of aging sex symbols is much better left to the imagination. Christoher Walkin has given a delightful performance as a haughty theater critic who makes passionate openings to a cast member. Beverly D'Angelo and Ben Gazzara also had minor roles. <br /> <br /> I gave this film the note 2. Apart from the thumbnail of Walken, there is really not much to recommend, except that the puppets used during the opening and closing credits were incredibly realistic and beautiful. Avoid this movie as the scourge it is. <br /> <br />
