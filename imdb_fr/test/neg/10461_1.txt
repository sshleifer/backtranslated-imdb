I agree with all the comments posted so far: this film was a waste of time and energy, both for viewers and for those who did. A terrible CGI, a horrible scenario, a stupid plot and hey, the decor is that of Alabama but it looks like California. But the worst thing must be the Amerindian angle on it, which incorporates all the stereotypes you can think of, the smoke-stricken leader, the angry warrior, people talking without using contractions ("Do not do this thing!" ), Amerindian pipes playing in the air, etc. It just shows such lack of respect and understanding that I pulled my hair out. A Native American with an ounce of self-respect would have thrown his television out the window in this trash. In conclusion, I would say that this film is an offense for everyone.
