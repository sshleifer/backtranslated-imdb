The Hebrew hammer is a clever idea wasted because the execution is weak. As is often the case with iconoclastic humor, we rely too much on indignation to make people laugh, which is simply not enough. Bad taste humor has two elements - a mediocre taste and humor - and both are needed here, but the humor is rather rare. As a result, it is often painful to watch, especially because of good attempts on the part of the performers, notably Adam Goldberg as HH. Shaft's references are funny, however, but only for those who know these movies, and they certainly do not wear The Hebrew Hammer. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that many jokes are based on the knowledge of American Jews culture, and many in the audience simply will not understand the jokes.
