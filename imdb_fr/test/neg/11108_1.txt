This is another original film from the Sci-Fi channel with Rhys Davies where it's hard to decide what's worse, the acting, or writing / directing / producing (John Sheppherd heads all three.) Basic Story : an obsessed exobiologist captures a chubacabra monster a container aboard a cruise ship escapes and the bloodbath begins. Sci-fi film of the rugged captain with the beautiful girl, the handsome hero and the mad scientist. Captian triggers a terrorist alert for the ship (because of course, I would not believe a monster story.) No dramatic dropping of seals from the navy by helicopter. The budget allowed an entire force of eight seals to arrive in a fiberglass fishing boat and board a girl. Puleeze. In addition, the computer animation of the ship can be improved on your computer. I also loved it when the commander of the Seal, looking for standard binoculars about fifteen kilometers away, was able to see three people jump from the ship. If the Sci-Fi channel wants to continue the original films, I hope they realize that their audience is not at the kindergarten level and they are buying better scripts and directors. If it was directly on video, you'll find it in the 99-cent bin.
