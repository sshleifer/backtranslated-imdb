Yash Raj's films are so funny, no matter which movies they watch, are they called the best production house? <br /> <br /> Seeing Bhatt's movies work, they copied the formula, the bikini and all that is intended for them, as well as the low actors like Uday and Tanishaa The film is so horrible that it makes you cringe <br /> <br /> jokes are so bad and so exciting that you slap them Uday looks like a gay and a monkey <br /> <br /> Tanishaa looks like an idiot <br /> < The director thinks we are all idiots Arjun Sablok takes the viewer for granted Music, a saved salvation The work of the camera is good <br /> Uday Chopra is an idiot, Tanishaa looks like Kajol in K3g if Kajol was boring, so Tanishaa is worse, the rest is fine
