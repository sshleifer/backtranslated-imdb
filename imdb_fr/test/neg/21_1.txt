Bloody Birthday is a totally stupid slasher movie from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I found the acting rather good given the kind of film and its obvious budget. I do not know what was happening with cinematography, but it looked horrible. Too much saturated. Maybe it's a bad transfer to DVD or maybe it always looked like that, I do not know. <br /> <br /> There is really no redemptive quality to speak of. There are some dead but not really gore. I would not care if I was you. The best thing about the DVD was the 15-minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg, who was very entertaining and honest. He has nothing good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits that the film is a failure, but he would like to do it again because he thinks he has a decent plot. However, he died in 2004, so I guess it will be up to someone else to take up this challenge. I would not be surprised by the way things are going for a few years: there is at least one cover per week at the movies these days. I guess it could not be worse, but I do not care if it was redone or not.
