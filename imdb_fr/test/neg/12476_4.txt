I was surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. It seemed boring to me, although I liked to watch Penelope Cruz and the details of the plot were often poorly crafted. It also sounded like an intensely sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone who had any meaning would embrace complaining that the movie was intensely misogynistic. It is not only that the two main men are described as fools and sexual predators, but also that women are described as almost flawless, forming a utopian community without conflict of any kind and relying on generosity and good mood relentless. Utopias are notoriously boring and this one is no exception. But it's also interesting to note what's going on (and here's the intrigue gift, although it refers to a very early scene) when the teenage girl kills her father. (1) Her mother rushes to take responsibility and (2) the girl does not seem to feel remorse (and her emotional life disappears from the movie). It is not a glorified murder, although Aldomovar's camera lingers on the blood-thirsty blood, as if it were an attractive painting, and then disappeared without leaving any blood either his daughter or his mother, neither materially nor emotionally. Later, the film reveals another murder, committed by a woman, and it is once again a murder that the film implicitly endorses. In short, Volver is an ideologically driven film with an unpleasant and even disgusting ideology. so I write an ideological critique. But other than that, it's not very interesting. For example, he has nothing of the depth of what I loved, that's what Aldomovar told me.
