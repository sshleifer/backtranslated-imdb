It's a very mediocre film by Jackie Chan and one of his worst absolutes, James Glickenhaus, ruined it! I guess all the characters are correct, but so is the story, but Jackie Chan is still amazing, even if he was having trouble. Jackie and Danny Aiello had no chemistry together, and it was very annoying many times, but the final was above average and managed to be quite entertaining and doing good stunts! I have not seen the Hong Kong version yet, but I'm sure it's better than this, the more predictable the twist! It's really lifeless and bland, and I do not blame Jackie for not looking happy, and if he had not played in that scene, it would have been unbearable and completely unassailable. The opening is supposed to be memorable, but I did not see anything better and I did better, and I thought the whole movie was rather lazy and could have been a great movie if Jackie had control! does not have root for any of the characters. This is a very mediocre film by Jackie Chan, and one of his worst absolutes, James Glickenhaus, has ruined it! Not recommended even for fans of Die hard Jackie Chan. The management is terrible! James Glickenhaus does a terrible job here, with extremely bland camera work, bad angles, and keeping the movie boring for most of the time. The game is so much. Jackie Chan is AMAZING as always, but he's not his usual habitual energy, he looks bored and does not mind lost throughout the movie, has no chemistry with Danny Aiello, and I do not really blame him either! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Danny Aiello agrees here, as Jackie's partner, but his character is a bit of a jerk, and he had no chemistry with Jackie, he reacted well, I guess. Roy Chiao is decent as the main villain, but he just followed the moves and was not so threatening, he's still cool. The rest of the distribution is at best average. Overall, it's not worth your time or money. * 1/2 out of 5
