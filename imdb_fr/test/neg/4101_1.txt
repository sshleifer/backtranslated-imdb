What could have been a good story was destroyed by the ridiculous scenario of time travel. If something has changed in the past that has changed evolution and humans have never developed, the time machine would never have been built. If something of the past were introduced into the present, it would have no effect on the past. <br /> <br /> I really want film producers to put their ideas before a scientist before finishing the screenplay. Even if you suspend reality and assume that time travel is possible, you must stick to logic. <br /> <br /> OTOH, Ben Kingsley seemed to be having fun with his superior performance. All the other actors seemed to do their best. It's the writing that left them wringing in the wind. <br /> <br /> "Back to the Future" has done better.
