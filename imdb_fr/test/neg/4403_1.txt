A Brazilian cable TV channel presents "Yadon Ilaheyya" this month in its "Cult" channel. I saw the trailer, listened to the ad and decided to see this movie. In fact, it's a ridiculous and pretentious, stupid and baseless nonsense about the conflict in the Middle East, and with "Soultangler", it's certainly the worst films I've ever tried to see. I really lost 43 minutes of my life watching the first half of this shit, highly indicated for torturing enemies. How can this film be rewarded and nominated for the included Cannes prize? My vote is a (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Intervenção Divina" ("Divine Intervention")
