The writing and direction of Duncan Roy are really and regularly below average. In fact, it stinks a little. AKA is almost as bad as its recent remake (horrible and selfish) of Dorian Gray - an absurd and distorted dialogue between characters from the "upper class", both silly and pretentious, amateurish and persistent. The characterization and the scenario - and sometimes the acting - creak like a play at school ... but worse, there is a kind of peacock certainty about the direction to follow that destroys the soul. when the director clearly did not catch ... not well. Diana Quick must be embarrassed. DR, you should get out of the movie ... seriously.
