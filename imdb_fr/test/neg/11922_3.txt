Pleasant. <br /> <br /> Clich√©. <br /> <br /> Overdoses of style to compensate for a mediocre writing. <br /> <br /> Remember when MTV was broadcasting clips and other reality TV shows? Aeon Flux (2005) is based on such a show ?? a cartoon from the mid-90s? featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing. Aeon, played by the charming Charlize Theron in this adaptation, is a cold and detached rebel, as dexterous as the line dancer and mortal as the snake of vipers. She needs to be, if she hopes to mess with the totalitarian government. <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but I hate the sudden influx of overdosed movies with dystopian and futuristic technology like The Island (2005) and Equilibrium (2002) (bottom of the pile). Aeon Flux has all the problems present in these films, but amplified. That is to say, there is nothing original to show, so they compensate with the sleek style catalyzed by Matrix (1999). The special effects are so sensational in Aeon Flux that brings him some points, but there is literally nothing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, all the performances of this film are atrocious and even some of them hurt me to watch. Charlize Theron's character, Aeon Flux, is nested in the most corny schtick, and it seems that director Karyn Kusama can not really decide where to go with her. Should it make it more detached or more emotional? She does not know! Let's go back and forth! Imagine taking a shotgun, loading it with numerous developments of characters of different kinds, and shooting in a random mess. This is the character of Aeon Flux. <br /> <br /> The film Aeon Flux puts forward all the "obligatory" ideas of a dystopian society - individual against society, nature against science, emotion against cold reason, etc. You've seen all this before, and you'd better do it. Go read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even look at Logan's Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982) ... nothing! Avoid this cheese festival without any involvement as long as you can. <br /> <br /> 3/10
