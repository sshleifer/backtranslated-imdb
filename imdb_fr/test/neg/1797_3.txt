Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness is a dark, deep and lasting novel that describes the futility and irony that reigns in Africa. If you are looking for a good book to read during the weekend, this is not the book for you. Conrad hides nothing by describing nineteenth-century imperialism, but the novel makes no sense without giving it the thought and consideration it deserves. If I read this novel in search of a beautiful adventure story, I would say I lost my time, but if I look at the prospect of explaining the uselessness of the 19th century civilization, I would say that it's one of the most significant novels I've ever read. Since I read this novel during my English class and analyzed each page, I think I enjoyed the book more than just reading it for entertainment. I'm not going to lie, this book was difficult and it encourages the reader to go to the bottom of this novel to find the true meaning. The film however, I found tiring and boring. The movie "Heart of Darkness" is far from doing justice to the book. The film omitted many key elements that I consider important to get the true message of the story. If you have difficulty understanding and visualizing the novel, the film might be a good recourse, but I would not recommend seeing the film as an alternative to the novel or even a different perspective.
