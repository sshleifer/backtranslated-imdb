striving to fit into the genre of scary space comedy, this film breaks down in two. It does happen in space - but it's neither funny nor frightening. The plot is lugubrious and the only joke about the computer's intellect is too often put to death. By saying that Paul Whitthorne in Ethan, Angela Bassett in Fran and Brad Dourif in Al Bert make the most of their ham script. The homosexual relationship between Ethan and Al Bert is evoked but never explored, while the attempt of sexual tension between French and rick is crude enough to be laughable. Overall, turkey is best suited for late night viewing, preferably during ironing.
