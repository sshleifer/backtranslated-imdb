When I looked at this shit, it reminded me of the title of the movie FIRE, who owns that garbage can, in a fire. I do not even know what to say. The comedian blew the fire, the fire looked really wrong, Andy girls are not exactly top models. And finally, I do not know what you're complaining about, I have this damn movie, yeah, happy birthday, well, I guess it could be worse than I could be trolled behind. And to make matters worse, I have everything in DVD fire, volcano, earthquake, avalanche. All I miss is the impressive tornado film that I hear suck the balls. <br /> <br /> Well until the peace of my next shit movie
