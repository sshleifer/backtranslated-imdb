It was like someone was trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time. The historical aspect was great. Everything else was horrible, the plugs for the director's other films that seemed to arrive every two minutes, the actual ghost hunting video was mounted as a horror movie rather than as an investigation, they had haunted house music and the sound effects that distract you from what was happening. Thank you for losing 2 hours of my time! When there was evidence, he stole! It was mostly people talking about the place. The episode of the Ghosthunters show that went absolutely destroyed the course of this show. I'm so mad at the science fiction channel for playing that, I have not watched it since it was released.
