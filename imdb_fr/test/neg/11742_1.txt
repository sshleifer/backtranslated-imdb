Van Sant copies the masterpiece of Hitchcock, blow for blow, with some modern facets: a walkman and the nakedness of Anne Heche. Unless you want to see Mrs. Heche naked, there is NO reason to see this movie instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is a lot better and Van Sant does not realize that by hiding nudity and gore, the original shower scene is even more terrifying. Ask Janet Leigh about this. The acting is also much flatter and the technical aspects much less impressive.
