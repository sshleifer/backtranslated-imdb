I bought this movie on DVD for Â£ 4, but it was a waste, the movie is very bad. The plot is your average monster movie, where it kills a few people, the mayor / leader does not believe it, and they fight it at the end. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the quality of the film is very good, and the New York setting is impressive for a low budget movie - as opposed to a small coastal town. The acting is also reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, the special effects, the main scene in a monster movie, are laughable and adding a random number of buses to the plot midway becomes simply strange. The end is simply bad. <br /> <br /> In summary, whenever you have the chance to see this, do not do - there will be something better about. <br /> <br /> RTC "Authentic horror movies do not have a PG rating"
