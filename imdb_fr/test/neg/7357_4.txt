When you get a head start on a movie, you know you are wasting your time watching the movie in question. That's exactly what I felt while watching "Darkness". I could see every turn and turn easily. It is a combination of "The Amityville Horror" and a myriad of films dealing with occultism. It's so stupid that I almost found it naïve. I can not say that I was completely bored but I found the film too derivative for my taste. The director Balagueró tries to redo his first Spanish hit "The Nameless", but he can not escape. I admit that some sequences were pretty scary but I hate when I can understand what will happen next. Plus, I hated seeing good actors like Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini sweat so much by this thing. Finally, Anna Paquin as the star of a horror movie? It must be a joke. She is cute but she is one of those good children actors who have become a very monotonous adult actor. You can live without looking at this one.
