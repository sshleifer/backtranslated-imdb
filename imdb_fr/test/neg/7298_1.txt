This film is, far and beyond a shadow of a doubt, the worst and most despicable film in the history of the universe. <br /> <br /> He's really * as * bad as ever. <br /> <Personally, I have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible movie, and I praised this one thinking it would be one of those. To my disappointment, this was not the case. <br /> <br /> The script is delivered in such a way as to give the impression that they read the lines directly on placards, the story makes absolutely no sense, and the film itself seems like he was shot on a home video camera. I could not even finish watching him. It's even worse than "Witch Academy", and it's quite an achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to understand how a director could shoot this film and still have the sense to believe it. decent enough to be released. <br /> <br /> Painful, frightful, appalling.
