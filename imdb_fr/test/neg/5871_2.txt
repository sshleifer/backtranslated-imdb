It's one of those movies you find when you're standing up too late and you only have the basic cable. It's hard to believe that this film was shot in 1995, since it looks like something from the late 80s. Brave young people with various family problems face a mad ice eater who is responsible for creating the best flavor of all time: the Soylent Cream !!! <br /> <br /> This film is extremely insane and scary just how scary and absolutely ridiculous it is. In fact, the really scary thing about this movie is the nature of the problems that these kids are facing at home. The fact that these children can not escape their silent suffering in the suburbs is reminiscent of a random hogwash in the neighborhood like a walk in the park. <br /> <br /> The most laughable part of this film is the fact that the "big kid" stereotypes is so obviously a thin pre-teen with a mountain of stuffing under his loose sweatshirts. I guess either a) they did not invent / could not afford a big suit, b) the casting director was too lazy to find a chubby star or c) we honestly assume that this child is starving and has an enormously distended belly. <br /> <br /> So if you're up at 2 in the morning and need something ridiculous and disgusting about which you can rub with your drunk friends, go for it. Personally, I would prefer to sleep.
