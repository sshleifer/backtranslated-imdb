I rented this movie because I am a big fan of Dudikoff. I thought it could not be so bad. Boy I was wrong! After 15 minutes, I begged others to let me extract the DVD and send it back to the rental store, but they refused. They swore it must be better. <br /> <br /> They were wrong! This film lacked everything. The actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock! The plot was ridiculous and I was offended by Hollywood for assuming that people were stupid enough to enjoy it. None of the characters interacted very well with each other. Ice-T gives here one of its worst performances. <br /> <br /> After watching pictures of the wrong plane, villains getting up to get shot and empty clips and missing everything, I wanted to scream and bang my head on concrete. The film reached its plateau of ignorance when members of the space station used a lift to move. Space suits are not necessary and there is gravity in space, no matter what real astronauts can say. <br /> <br /> I did not finish this movie and I hated it. I do not want to finish this movie. It's a slow suicide. I could feel that my cerebral cortex was planning to avenge the torture I was undergoing.
