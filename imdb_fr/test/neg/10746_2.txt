I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to this excellent series of horror anthologies from Showtime, but it was by far the worst. It's a shame. This may be due in part to the choice, strange as it may be, of raw materials. Why Joe did not just write an original, I have no idea. Instead, we get this episode of soapbox where the "message" overwhelms the script, the characters, the staging, everything, and in the end I wondered if it could get worse, and I would not spoil it .. but it ended up getting worse. What a stink from a creative team so talented. Skip this one and buy John Carpenter's instead. He manages to balance all the elements: horror, humor, character, vision and entertainment. Returning home is about as much fun as letting a bear get caught while you sleep.
