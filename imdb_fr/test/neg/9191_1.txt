It's really a grinding exercise. Disguised as a tribute to firefighters, it contains stupid scenes of "we are just a group of crazy fools" in the middle of the part "my God, it can be very dangerous". Above all it's just silly. You could not believe for a minute that real firefighters were doing this. It's so horrible that I could not bear to watch sometimes. If my daughter had not rented it and then insisted on finishing it to the end, I would have had no choice but to turn it off. <br /> <br /> It is true that I am a fan of John Travolta. Every interview of his that I saw simply raises my opinion about him. I think it was strictly for the money. I am sure he will be happy when it is forgotten.
