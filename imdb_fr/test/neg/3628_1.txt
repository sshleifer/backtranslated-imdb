This show is bad. it was put on a rollercoaster on Fridays, and although it definitely destroyed the theme of Friday's programming, I will judge it rationally ... but I think it sucks. It's really lame. Zoey and his stupid friends are weak characters and the pot is bad and really bad. <br /> <br /> The lame continuity and the pot sucks and I think the dialogue and joes are weak. The weak humor and the stupid characters, it sucks, and the whole series is frankly a disappointment that is not worth watching. It sucks and is really, really bad. This really has to be one of the most unhealthy shows on television, really do not bother to watch. I mean how can a lame show get weak before being eliminated?
