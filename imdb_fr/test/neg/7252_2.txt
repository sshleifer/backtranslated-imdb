I do not think that the number of gaffes contained militarily and strategically in this turkey can be beaten. Everything in this mess was done cheaply and gave the soldiers a really stupid air. Examples: In the beginning, the 2-star general receives strategic advice from a lieutenant and accepts them without reservation. The map used by the lieutenant shows the positions of the enemy, but apparently he has only one narrow valley to advance on the battalion (although the map shows a dozen more). The rear guard takes position from which they are clearly spotted by the enemy and exposed. They crush our heroes from the heights, but this superior firepower makes little difference. Only one enemy tank advances towards the end (at the beginning called armored division), followed by a solitary infantry point (!) Which moves very slowly without covering the zone, then abandons the tank when it considers it good. - a weirdest scene. The soldiers take shelter in a cave. All around them there is ice and thick snow, but in the cave, just steps from the entrance, is a deep puddle in which they wade repeatedly - their feet would only last a few minutes. minutes before freezing. Later, the survivors waded slowly and chest tightly in a river to return to their unit. Remember that it is deep winter and the ground is frozen. Yes Yes! <br /> <br /> And so on. They scream orders at the highest positions, they lay mines close to their position and warn each other not to trample on them (!) Initially, a soldier to whom the Congressional Medal of Honor was awarded is honored. Was he blind or did Director Fuller just ignore him? These are really the most inept soldiers I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> One of them digging his injured leg with a bayonet and ending up shooting a shine, without a grinding or grimace. He announces that this should call him a surgeon. Now it was funny.
