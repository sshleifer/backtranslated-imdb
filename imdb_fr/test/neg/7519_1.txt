If you liked the "The Time Machine" version of the early 60's, do not waste your time; as in "The Planet of the Apes" last year, it was "reinvented" and not for the better. And, just like in "Planet ...", his main actor is dismally bad and leaden; Guy Pearce, a formidable actor and of a great extent, has everything wrong for this role, giving a performance of a note which does not arouse any sympathy; he is so hard and serious, and does not fear the amazing (supposed) things he sees and you do not believe for a moment that he experiences them. Even worse, who had the idea of ​​resembling him like the child of love of David Spade and Calista Flockhart? Handsome actor, he is terribly lean, which is, believe it or not, a major distraction. Frankly, the man looks seriously ill and is photographed cruelly. It does not share absolutely any chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance out of sync with that of another. Unfortunately, even with a real main character, this film has no chance, it is fatally cluttered at the time by a director completely inept - entire scenes go nowhere and are poorly done - and a scenario totally inferior, scattered and sometimes incoherent. - not for a moment, do not worry about anyone in this movie, just because there is nothing in the development of the character! In the original, you must KNOW the Eloi. So you felt for them and felt their terror against the Morelocks. here, as the film repeatedly points out, they are just sheep and act accordingly. Unless you are a member of PETA, scared sheep are really an entertainment! <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba is doing as well as she can during her film debut, but, like everyone in this mess, especially Jeremy Irons (if he's the head of the Morelocks [who looks like releases of "The Mummy Returns"], why does he look like Edgar Winter's long-lost brother?) Is COMPLETELY TRUE. The money spent on the infinite "special effects" was also wasted, which belies the $ 70 million spent on the film; they are uniformly dull, obvious and unconvincing. And then there is the look of the film: poorly photographed, his artistic direction and his decorations are only "there" and his costumes are typical in the design. There is no thought or original idea expressed behind or on the screen. Above all, it's not even fun! (Filmmakers use Orlando Jones, now ubiquitous, as "comic relief" but, as usual, Jones is irritating and HOW does his character in electric driving survive in a world apparently without electricity?) <br /> < In short, it is an empty matter, lifeless, mate, sterile and confused: have not they already taken over the "Planet of the Apes" ??? (At least THAT was lucky to have good performance!) <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! * The last insult (beyond a head that shakes your head, not to mention the convenient ending)? Not only do they sport changing figurines in clothing stores, but they even make the machine wind up an anachronistic glass-n-chrome windshield! (If "The Sopranos" had a time machine, THIS was exactly what it would look like.) Pathetic ...
