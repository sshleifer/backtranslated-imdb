The original Australian Kath & Kim is brilliant. Why do American producers need to redo and ruin another classic show? Remember the original version of "The Office" with Ricky Gervais, it was an absolute masterpiece and it was not necessary to redo it. The producers said that the British humor of "The Office" and the Australian humor of "Kath & Kim" would not be translated into American public ......... WHAT ??? So, basically, they say that Americans are too stupid and stupid to understand jokes. So they have to redo the shows with extravagant gags for Americans to understand the humor. The original Australian version of Kath & Kim is fantastic and very funny. Avoid the American version like the plague !!
