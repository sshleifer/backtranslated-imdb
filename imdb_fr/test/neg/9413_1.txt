I'm usually a big fan of Pacino (Scarface, Serpico, Devil's lawyer), but since Scent of a woman, he's been playing pretty much the same role and shouting a lot. This movie had no endearing characters to warm up. Brandon played by Bongo McConnahey is the least friendly of the group. He has not even anywhere approached a real human being. Pacino was hopeless and my God, how old is Renee Russo? The only big light of this miserable mess was the hot whore with the perfect lipstick and she has like 10 lines in total. Even the very reliable Jeremy Piven was quite improbable. <br /> <br /> Note to movie writers, they usually do not work unless one of the main characters is at least a bit friendly (notable Scarface exception). As the film ends and old Brandon is at the airport, my only thought was to let a plane crash on the airport and kill Brandon.
