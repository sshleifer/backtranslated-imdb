I'm sorry, but for a film that has been so called semi-classic and horror film, but seriously, I think when the director makes me laugh inadvertently, it's not a good thing. The characters in this movie were so incredible and incredible. I just could not help laughing at Issac's voice, it was like a British voice with a shrill, whining voice. Not to mention the dramatic nature of Malicai. <br /> <br /> Children of the Corn is a city where all children have killed adults and revered a god who orders them to sacrifice the over 20-year-old people. When a couple has a serious car accident, he comes to town to ask for help, but he is of course trapped in the kid and is sacrificed! Malicai has other intentions when he is tired of following Issac's orders. <br /> <br /> Children of the Corn could have been great, but it turned into a bad movie that can be easily mocked. Although I love Stephen King, I'm sure it's not what he intended to do and it was a pretty lame story, or at least the actors destroyed it. As I said, to laugh, look at it, but I warn you, it's pretty pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3/10
