Too bad. There is an interesting idea here, but it is completely lost in a confusion of Commodore 64-style computer effects and bad stories. The plot, as it stands, is about a souls hunter. It should be a fairly simple story of hunter / hunted, but the director and / or writer seem to have forgotten what the film was supposed to be when they were about to shoot. The fact that the main villain seems to be wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask, which they tried to conceal with flowing colors, has no problem. Not much to recommend here, even the title seems to propel it into the darkness.
