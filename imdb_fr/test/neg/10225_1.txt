Take a snapshot story and insert Steve Guttenberg. I need help, it's as bad as you'd expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) and Anna Montgormery are trying to turn a group of useless and incompetent children into a winning football team. For lack of originality and direct orientation, it is quite difficult to maintain the interest of this film. Despite my reservations about Guttenberg's intermediary capacity, I can safely say that the coaching role of the rival teams is worse than that of Guttenberg. I imagined unimaginable. This type of story of the oppressed who are fighting to the top has been done before and better every time so-called "movie"
