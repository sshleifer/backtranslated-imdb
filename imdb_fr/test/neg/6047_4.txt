In Chicago, four electricians led by Dean (Richard Grieco) go to an old building to cut the power. They accidentally activate a portal and arrive in another dimension, where Chicago was destroyed by a spider queen and inhabited by mutants. The group meets survivors led by Crane (David Nerman) and Elena (Kate Greenhouse) and finds the inventor of the portal, Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who has lived in this dimension for thirty years. They join forces and try to rebuild a portal to bring them home. "Webs" is a visual plagiarism of "Sliders", but worse. Most dialogues seem to be written by a person who has not completed primary school, they are so stupid. In addition, the story is illogical and it seems that Chicago is the only city in the world. The scientist trying to start his sophisticated machine with broken wires as if stealing a car is a lot of fun. The face of Richard Grieco looks like a white version of Michael Jackson and is horrible. If the viewer closes his brain, he can love this forgotten TV movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Na Teia do Terror" ("In the Web of horror")
