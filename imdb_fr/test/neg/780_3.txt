Strangely, I have very little to say about "The Box", so it will be pretty brief. I've never read Richard Matheson's new "Button, Button" from which the movie is based, but given what I saw in this "adaptation", there could not be much work of such a legendary author. "The Box" tells the story of a family discovering a strange object with a button on its threshold. Frank Langella introduces himself and explains how they will receive a million dollars if they press the button - the only "trap" is that he will automatically kill someone somewhere ... ?? SPOILER ?? They push him ?? END OF SPOILERS ?? This concept was interesting in itself, but they still managed to extend the film to a convoluted imitation of Stargate that restores it until a fairly decent result ending in a pretty deep message. Although I try to be as "fair" as possible, I still have to say that it was not my cup of tea and that it bothered me severely. I guess it's the same director as "Donnie Darko", which I remember enjoying when I saw it years ago. "The Box" would have worked very well as a short film, but as it was so adapted without life, I can not afford to recommend it ...
