Michael Caine may have tried to create a larger-than-life character to a satisfactory degree, but the whole story and character around him were neither friendly nor interesting at all. It was very boring and somewhat predictable. Martin Landau, one of my favorite actors, had no role to play. It was useless. Michael Caine became a bit irritating after a while and the film could not decide if it was a serious comedy or thriller. Caine tried hard and well with him, but I felt that the direction and the story let him down. Do not waste your time. It starts well in the first 10 minutes, and that's about it. A movie for fans of Die Hard Caine Only. Stay away from this one ...
