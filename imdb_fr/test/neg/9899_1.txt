There have been excellent TV movies in the past. We think of epics such as "Roots" and "Lonesome Dove". Category 6: We will not remember the Day of Destruction to advance the cause of films made for television. A ridiculously bad story, surpassed only by the horrible storyline, Cat6DD, as I like to call it, inspires more sympathy for the actors involved than the terror that the movie was supposed to bring out. This sound you hear during the movie is supposed to be the sound of the wind, but rather the career of Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy and Thomas Gibson (Greg, duo Dharma & Greg) that collapse faster than houses, trucks and the cows. can fly away from one of the 15 tornadoes we see in the first 5 minutes of the film. The movie was announced as "nature is unleashed", instead, we have a lame story about how 15 different weather systems conspire to produce 150 degrees a day in Chicago, then a snowstorm the next day, provoked by a hurricane that has a storm system from Canada, but has actually had its origins in a jet stream modified by global warming ... ENOUGH !! No matter the story, the acting was awful, the lyrics of the actors were silly, and 13 of the country's scientists had coronaries after hearing the dribble from the movie. I did not care what happened to one of the characters, the special effects were poor, even for the standards designed for television, and the scenarios were useless. Overall, I really do not really like this "TV event".
