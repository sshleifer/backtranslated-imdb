In fact, it hurts me to say, but this movie has been horrible at all levels. The blame does not rest entirely on Van Damme, as you can see, he did his best, but let's face it, he's almost fifty, how much more can you ask him? I have so much trouble believing that the same people who made up Undisputed 2; probably the best (Western) martial arts film for years, created it. Everything from intrigue to dialogue, editing, and acting was horribly staged and, in many cases, downright boring and insane. Scott Adkins, whose combat scenes looked more like a demo, was also terribly underused and not even the main villain, which is a shame because 1) he is more than capable of playing this role and 2) the main villain current was also not intimidating at all but also quite annoying. Again, do not blame Van Damme. I will always be a fan, but avoid this one.
