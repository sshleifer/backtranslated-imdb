THE GOOD: The actors were great, especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor in place of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> THE BAD: I am a visible minority (not white) and I experienced a form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the subject of the film, I certainly would not say that this movie is the best of the year, in fact, it's FAR. This film poses problems for me both from the point of view of a spectator and the point of view of a visible minority. Some of my problems with this movie are: <br /> <br /> (1) Poor character development (or no development). For example, the fact that Matt Dillon is a racist cop and that he cares for his sick father is because we have seen extremes, it does not mean that the character is well developed. Yes, I admit that in a large casting group like in this film, it is quite difficult for each character to be well developed, BUT that does not mean that none of the characters should be like that. <br /> <br /> (2) The dialogue seems so artificial that I am really surprised that this film won the Best Original Screenplay award. They have to show this film in a script writing class not because it's good, but to show students and future screenwriters what not to do. I just felt like I had been hit on the head over and over again how serious racism was. I understand. <br /> <br /> (3) The plot seems so fortuitous, it's laughable. What are the odds that a black car thief crushes an Asian guy who happens to be a human trafficker when he gets into his van, and that same black car thief found himself in the act of stealing only to discover that several Asians are being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car thief has a good side after all? Or, what about this scene where a white woman of the upper class with prejudices fell down the stairs and all her prejudices and hate disappeared? If it were so simple, why not throw all the American racists on the stairs for a change of heart? <br /> <br /> (4) I think my biggest fear about this movie is unrealistic. view of racism. As a person who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I was refused to enter a supermarket because I am not white. Did the store owner say because I was not white? No, he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside. Did he yell racial insults? Racism in America is more hidden. Some taxi drivers will probably not stop to pick you up because you are not white, but that does not mean they will try to crush you or go out and say racial slurs. If a Chinese girl stops me, I will not say "Blake! Blake! Learn some English bitch!" On the other hand, if I were a Chinese woman and had accidentally stopped a Mexican, I would not say that "Mexicans are bad drivers" in front of her face. That's not how it works. Instead, I would give my information on insurance, say sorry, and go home and tell my Chinese friends and family that Mexicans are bad drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. This is true racism. It's hidden and not in your face. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Crash is not original, contrary to what some people can say. Intrigues, intrigues and intertwined characters have already been made. "Magnolia" is a movie that does it a lot better than Crash and yet it was never nominated for the best Oscar film. The actors were outstanding: Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who recently won Best Actor), Tom Cruise, etc. It's really beyond me to see that Crash has even been nominated for the best movie.
