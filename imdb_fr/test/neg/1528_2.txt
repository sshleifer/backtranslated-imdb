Where should I start with the murderous spirit before mentioning the good side? This film is about a young woman doing the psychological profile of the FBI, or something that, for some reason, will work for the LAPD for a little while. There are some recognizable faces, like the "I love you guy" type of Wayne's World, playing a cop (nice beard too!) And two guys who always seem to play cops playing ... you guessed it, cops. One of them was one of the Gross Point Blank cops after John Cusack about the place, and the other was the FBI guy with the Final Destination specs, which is also in the Fugitive in as another cop. I know the FBI, the American Marshalls, the CIA, etc. are not cops, but they are all identical. They apply the law to a certain extent, which makes them cops in my book. Do not hesitate to oppose the definition of a police officer whatever you want, they are always considered as those who try to bring down the bad guys. Everything, I go astray. The woman works alongside these police officers who just seem to sit in a basement library or something and who, for some unknown reason, decides to reopen a file that has not been examined for a long time. She saw the corpse in her childhood. She naturally decided to reopen the file, because she was personally attached to it! I also like how the person who describes the psychological state of others has witnessed a murder as a child. This is surely the kind of thing that can fool someone's head ?! She begins to ask questions of a reporter who covered the story when it was opened, even though he appears to be the same age as the woman. So he was probably writing for a newspaper at the age of 10 or writing some school reports. on it, and she decided that he would be the best person to ask questions about it. <br /> <br /> We then see that, while reopening homicide cases dating back 25 years earlier, she is trying to steal like some A very discreet guy sprinting on a busy street wearing a balaclava . Way to mix, moron! Anyway, she and the cops with whom she eats ice in the park are chasing him and, while crossing a bridge with a woman and a child standing on it, the thief grabs the baby from the mother's arms and the throw in the river. If you have not already guessed, this is the best part of the movie. I'm not sadistic and I have no hatred for babies or anything, but the scene is so stupid that I promise you to wet your pants laughing with laughter if you watch this movie. The situation improves when the officer of Final Destination & Fugitive intervenes to save the baby and then declares to his friend "It's a baby!" How did he ignore that before jumping, it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, she chases the thief but loses it. Later, she recalls that a random dog did not bark against the thief. She therefore assumed that it must be his and decided to find him through the dog. The dog was not wearing any marks or anything, so how did she know where to find it and finding the thief is another issue I will not enter. It was not long after I stopped watching. The story was moving very slowly and, having stopped laughing at the baby's throwing, I had somehow lost interest and did not understand what was being said. <br /> <br /> By saying that, I'm going to go ahead and assume that the murderer was the type of journalist because he looked a little devious and spent a lot of time with him and whoever looks at Columbo knows that the person outside the police who spends the most time with the investigating officer is your bad guy. Plus, other people's reviews say the killer was pretty obvious, so I'm sure it was him. <br /> <br /> So, all in all, a movie about pants, but worth watching just for this glorious scene.
