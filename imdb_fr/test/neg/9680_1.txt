I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER redo another "biblical" movie, if Noah's ark were to become the norm. Aside from the horrible, meaningless game on the part of the cast (Voight and Steenburgen may have lost control of the day they agreed to shoot this film), the timeline has been completely changed. I also missed the passage in Genesis of the pirates fight on the bridge of the ark or the traveler who was passing by his paddle boat. Hello? Everyone was dead except Noah and his family, according to the scriptures. God piled wood and added plans to build the ark when Noah wondered how ?? I also do not remember reading anything about Noah's wife constantly harassing her during the 40 days, or Noah wandering around him with glassy eyes and dazed all the time. The screenwriter obviously had very little knowledge of the book of Genesis, or did not care to make fun of his abomination of a story.
