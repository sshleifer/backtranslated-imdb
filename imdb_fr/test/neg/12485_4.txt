Face! Antoine Monot, in an imitation of Kevin Smith's Silent Bob, continues to ask, but the writer / director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert simply can not say no to a joke, no matter the price. The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, a discreet old-school bard of fame "There is something about Mary," would be honorable for any story of abandoned young villager. Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks cool enough to drive his BMW six-door tanned six-series, wearing aviator sunglasses, without success. Of course, he accidentally slept with his bohemian child with crazy eyes (Marie Zielcke), but then who would not want to? Thanks also to the way it goes in black and white with a generous dose of this mysterious substance they call zero to zero, but if you're looking for a slightly more serious interpretation of what intoxication can do to you, I suggest you to verify. on "Fear and hatred in Las Vegas".
