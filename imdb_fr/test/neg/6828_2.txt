"How many people are aware of this?" ... "Let's keep things that way!" I wonder at least new dialogues can be made or not? The film is a very bad copy of the original. Bruce Willis probably made this film while he was half asleep. The way he looks at Richard Gere's face with his cold look when they meet near the harbor ... oh my god! scared the hell out of me. Why is he killing Major Koslova and his companions, it is still not clear to me. Another thing I could not understand was the poison solution he had put on the car. Another fun thing is how the Russian was killed in the club. I fell from my chair laughing when I saw this scene. Also, what was this thing about the gay guy .. what purpose was he serving. I think the movie is too fast to be understood easily. You really have to think that hell was in the director's mind. LOL. <br /> <br /> And the best scene after all was Richard Gere trying to stand at the pillar between 2 fast trains. must have made someone lose his mind if he did not touch the pillar.
