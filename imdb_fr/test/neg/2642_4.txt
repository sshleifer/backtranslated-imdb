"Milo" is another answer to a question no one has ever asked. Do we really need more slashers? For my part, I think we already have more than enough. I guess the big professional guys are overloaded, so in this one we are dealing with a killer kid who is also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it.He long ago, he drowned but that did not bother him and he always kills people ("Friday the 13th", what is it?). One day, his survivors have a great reunion and, surprise, Milo comes to visit them. With very bad moves that show everything except the killings, the cast is brightened until only the final girl is left to discover Milo's sad and dark secret. She and her friends were dying to know. Once discovered, Milo continues to make another murderous murder (is not it still time to go to bed?) And the girl, well she screams a lot. The game of actors is not even at the bottom of things, the barrel refuses to be associated with it.Milo can be a bastard bastard from time to time I give it to him, but some movies One simply can not be saved without a good scenario or a free nudity.
