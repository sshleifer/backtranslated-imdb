This film is at the "Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael" level for the biggest garbage that has ever been on the big screen. If these guys were not Adam Sandler's gay friends, this script would have succeeded where it should have been: to be the toilet paper of a great director. I hate this movie, it makes me want to hurt people. I will admit that I have high standards, but honestly, I prefer to watch Step Up 2. What's really sad is when I connected to IMDb and I read that you gave this movie a score of 6.9. This is the testimony of all the retarded in our society who will watch terrible movies that last only an hour and a half of jokes of cock, fart and weeds with little or no originality. After seeing this note, I would like to suggest "The House of Pain of Tyler Perry" to all who enjoyed this movie. you will see a humor of high quality at about the same level as this abominable abomination.
