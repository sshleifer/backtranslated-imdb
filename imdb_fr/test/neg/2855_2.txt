This movie is just silly. Do not get tired of looking at him; Believe me, you are better off. <br /> <br /> The plot is short: a defense lawyer represents a man who murdered his son and other children. In defending her, she falls on a Pinnochio wooden doll. She brings the doll home. Pinnochio is possessed and starts killing people. <br /> <br /> This movie moves very slowly to have such a low end. The plot is very bad and the musical score of Dennis Michael Tenney is pitiful. The story, written by Kevin S. Tenney, is just useless and evokes NO horror or fear. It's far from his work on Night of the Demons and Witchboard, which are decent releases but have nothing to tell. Its realization is correct, but with such a story, no one could have made this film a success. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: 2 out of 10, perhaps the most bland and boring movie of the whole year.
