Gordon Scott has made good Tarzan movies, but it's not one of them. <br /> <br /> As I looked at him, grimaced in front of the seemingly obvious interior decorations and the hollow wood slamming resounded then Roads and tensions because of the bad dialogue and the worst action among the actors of support, I kept thinking, "Sheesh, this is the level of a TV show!" Then I discover that three pilot episodes of TV shows have been woven into one. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Scott come out (alone), far from the empty sets, in some of the scenes; and the fights have very beautiful movements ... but oh, and now for dialogue. And did I mention acting? Heck, Cheetah (or "Cheta" in this version) was a better actor than most humans. <br /> <br /> And that does not say much. <br /> <br /> It's a sort of Assembler to see a younger Sherman (ie Scatman) Carothers playing the native role. But probably not worth the overall time investment.
