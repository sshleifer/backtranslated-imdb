Yes. Those of my generation who grew up watching these old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. Joe Tune of the 80s is one of the best cartoons in the history of television. Well-written stories, well-developed characters. I admit it was nothing more than a glorified toy advertisement, but it certainly helped to carry that line of toys. Nearly twenty years later, move quickly and enter Valor vs. Venom. The animation was average at most. The movement of the characters seemed jerky and looked like a puppet. The film was more like a series of Small Soldiers than a story about a special military force. Then we have the development of character or lack of. Dusty likes to be all Dusty? Slice and Dice like to do things together? What? Have writers taken a writing course on how to develop characters with a depth equivalent to Jar Jar Binks? As for the story. I like a little science fiction. But the whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army was put to death in Joe's universe. Mega Monsters or Toxo-zombies, do you like it? But I want to thank the creators for trying to make fans fans happy by organizing martial art sessions every 10 minutes. I'm not a big fan of SE and SS but I liked the fight scenes in between. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you will appreciate it. I admit I can not appreciate VvV as I should. Again, all that Joe compared to what was done in the '80s and, honestly, nothing will ever be comparable to GI Joe's glory days. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you will appreciate it.
