Okay, I just had to apologize about this one ... Like a great mind fool, I just watched this movie in its entirety. <br /> <br /> You will notice that the "trivia" section of IMDB points out that some parts of the 747 lift were "borrowed" from Airport 1977. This really does not scratch the surface ... Virtually all the plans Outside the plane skimming the ocean, landing, wreck and even resting shots are taken from Airport '77. All of the "surveyed" plans are from 1977, including most inland flood clips, with the exception of Dennis Weaver's drowning. I could not help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland could arrive at any time, or maybe a "dead" Tom Sullivan. Another name: Dennis Weaver's name in this film is Stevens, to compensate for the fact that the plane at 77 Airport belongs to Stevens Corporation (led by Jimmie Stewart of course). <br /> <br /> This is a real calascale of actors who do not work much, or at least have not worked for a while, which could have been the first clue that it was going to be a real evil. <br /> <br /> I This film is worthy of "1", but if this film can not offer any other quality, at least someone helped Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert and Dennis Weaver to pay their car month!
