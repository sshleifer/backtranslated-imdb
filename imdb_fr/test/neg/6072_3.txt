I was expecting so much more than what I received while watching this movie. It's not that I oppose the literary license (if that's how it should be called), especially when there is no obvious attempt to say "based on a true story". But this movie is about Beethoven - a real historical character, known and deeply rooted in our musical experiences. I expected the film to be true to the story, at least in its raw parts. This film took such an exception from the historical record that it could only disappoint. <br /> <br /> My hypothesis (because I had not done research on the film) was that it was true. Midway through, I stopped the movie to watch it on IMDb. The rest of the film was a remarkably different experience. I was relieved that it was not right with the story because it was so difficult to believe a major part of the story. To appreciate this film, I had to recognize it as a fantasy, a story of "if it was like that". The film lacked this denial of honest responsibility. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me the most is the fictional direction of the 9th symphony. The very concept described in the film pushed my imagination to incredulity. I ended up doubting anything that was true to the story other than Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethoven. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the performance of Ed Harris - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and stand aside and that was about all and for that I give him a 3/10. <br /> <br /> Those who claim that this film is as good or better than Amadeus do not know either the composers live and only look for what this film really is, because in the end, it was a cheap novel of a story - pulp fiction.
