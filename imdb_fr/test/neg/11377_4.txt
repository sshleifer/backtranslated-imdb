I was hoping to like this film, to settle for a funny and crazy night. I love Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the premise seemed to me to be secretive enough to be entertaining. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found myself sleeping again and again. Judy Davis did a great performance, but had very little work with it. Juliette Lewis was fabulous as expected, but had very little to do. The plot was full of "twists" that were just ridiculous, and as often happens in movies like this, no one acted like a real human being. And personally, I thought Marcia Gay Harden was totally spooky. <br /> <br /> The movie also seemed to be rocking a black comedy with hints of prank to a complete farce with touches of black comedy. A reviewer notes here that other critics seem to want this movie to be something different, and have therefore decried it. All I can say is that I would have chosen that the movie be * something * and respect it. He feels that the director had grandiose ideas, but he was unable to achieve them. I give him a 4 out of 10.
