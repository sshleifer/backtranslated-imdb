I thought the movie was below normal. The acting was good but not great, the story was funny but did not come out that way. The director dropped the ball on this film. It was not James (Jim) or Tea. IMHO is the music that killed him. There's a scene where things go down and where Jonny Cash's music is heard - the man was so depressing (not funny) killed my mood. After that, the movie could not recover. The scene of the deportation involved a potentially amusing situation, a good, well organized acting - I even smiled but the music was not suited to the stage. The music prevented me from being part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I say that it had potential, but that it was badly done, I would even say that I rushed into the final production. Kind of reminder of the prequel of the exorcist: the beginning. The theatrical release was good, but after the viewing, the exorcist film: Dominion was much better. Same story just different director. Even should be done here.
