Please, if you are thinking of renting this movie, do not do it. If you plan to watch some downloaded clips, do not do it. If I had the choice, no one would even have to read this summary. <br /> <br /> The acting game, even though it was one of the highlights of the film, was always pathetic. The director was probably a sadist. The witty liners were what one would expect from a 7 year old highly paid anti-social room who eat paint pellets for breakfast. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that it tries to be a movie like "Evil Dead 2" (do not associate these 2 films) in the sense that it's so funny that it's funny. But he also tries to be funny at the same time, and fails so much, that your sense of humor is too handicapped to do anything, but triggers your nauseated reflex in an attempt to save himself. <br /> <I could go on for a lot more, detailing how awful it was, but I think it would take away my will to live just to keep thinking about it. If you need me, I will try to boil me to feel clean again ...
