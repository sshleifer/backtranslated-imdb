Not finding the right words is everyone's problem in this vaudeville type urban comedy. They do not know what to say and they do not know how to say it. That's why they embark on the potentially humiliating business of pre-arranged speed dating. Unfortunately, they all appear as cardboard characters rather than real people. The story follows a conventional structure in three acts: by getting to know the considerable cast in their sad singles life, the real dating circuit and a final stretch of romantic spillovers featuring some of the craziness of newly discovered couples. Because everything is so predictable, I would say that as a narrative, "Shoppen" is a failure. As a comedy, most of the time, it's too awkward to be really funny. Congratulations to Kathrin von Steinburg. She stands out from the crowd of soap operas as Miriam, rich and independent, apart. Super makeup on her too (Verena Wei√üert): A thick eye shadow meets a gloss for the lips, creating a smoldering and bohemian effect, but childish. Thanks also to Stefan Zinner for the Bavarian love machine and Tanja Schleiff for the nutritionist. They bypass the challenge of communication through the timeless body language of copulation.
