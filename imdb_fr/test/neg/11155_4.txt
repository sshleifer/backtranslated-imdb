I really do not know why I'm writing this. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me tell you this: <br /> <br /> When I finish watching movies, I like them. Then, over time, my opinion changes about the movie. it happened with End of Days. I loved it the first time I saw it. I thought it was fun. But a few weeks later, my opinion changed. So, to solve this problem, I watched it again at friends' homes. Well, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I am a logical person. If I see a logic hole in a movie, I try to ignore it. If I see two, I start to get upset. More than two and I left. End of Days pissed me off after my second reading. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie is a bit depressing. Everything is sad. Everything goes from Arnold to the colors of the film. But dark movies do not bother me, but something else does ... <br /> <br /> If Satan can regenerate his wounds, how can you kill him in his deadly form? If you shoot him, his skin will grow back. If you cut his head, a new one should come back. So, what's the use of trying to kill him? I'll tell you why: because it's a stupid film that has a recycled villain. This is not the devil my friends. It is a human being who reminds those villains of Bond who give all his plan to the hero. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's worth watching, but do not see it twice, because it's shit.
