In 1984, Karate Kid had charm, even if it was little more than a poor guy's Rocky. Alas, producer Jerry Weintraub did not understand that it was better to leave the story to the end, and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the definitive minimum of the franchise, but someone must have thought that the series still had potential. What other explanation could there be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid? <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. Following? Yes, Macchio is gone (at least he was smart enough to finally stop), and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!), Playing a troubled teenager (what else?) Named Julie Pierce. Now, the girl has family problems. She also has problems at school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). It turns out, however, that one of his students is actually a nice guy and that Julie falls in love with him. This causes him more problems than before, of course. Fortunately for her, she currently lives with Mr. Miyagi (Morita), an old friend of his grandfather who knows how to go after the bad guys. <br /> <br /> All these factors go up to seven shots, and this is just a summary of the generic plot - imagine what the detailed scenes should look like! From start to finish, The Next Karate Kid is a tired, flat and monotonous marathon of idiotic lines and montages. Fortunately, Swank has the likes of Boys Do not Cry and Million Dollar Baby to redeem this disaster, but why did Morita agree to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first film, and was very nice in the sequels, but has nothing to say here - even the awakening of the gag "wax, wax" is stillborn. As for Ironside, he's slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in the third part, but that's hardly surprising. <br /> <br /> Is the photo really so awful? Not exactly. There is a sequence that manages to get a strange beauty, but when the best part of the whole movie involves a group of Asian monks dancing when they hear pop music for the first time in their lives, this is not a recommendation see the rest.
