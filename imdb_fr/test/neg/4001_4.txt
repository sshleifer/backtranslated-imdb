Usually, I like these thrillers "Stranger Within". "Fatal Attraction", "Single White Female" and "Audition" are good examples. Well done, they can be very fun and worth an hour or two of shock and fright. Of course, the opposite may be true: poorly done, they can be tedious and stupid. "The hand that cradles the cradle" is one of these. <br /> <br /> Bartels, Claire (Annabella Sciorra) and Michael (Matt McCoy) welcome another member into their family. But busy, Claire is persuaded by Michael to hire a nanny. One day, a woman named Peyton Flanders (Rebecca DeMornay) introduces herself and because she looks perfect, she is hired by the Bartels. Of course, once it shows up, their idyllic life slowly crumbles ... <br /> <br /> This movie suffers from a plethora of problems, but the most important is the villain's behavior. Peyton is never credible. It depends in part on how she wrote and how she acted. The things she does that are supposed to make us angry are so artificial that they are laughable. De Mornay does not help much. She describes Peyton as two different people. Although it is true that she is supposed to be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies, De Mornay's performance creates a gap between the two facets of her character. <br /> <br /> The other actors are good, however. Annabella Sciorrra is great as Claire, an asthmatic woman. Sciorra is very natural in the role, but unfortunately, the script lets her down. Matt McCoy is almost invisible. However, Julianne Moore is delightful as Claire's friend, Marlene. Moore is a firecracker, but unfortunately, she only has five minutes left on the screen. <br /> <br /> Curtis Hanson is a good director, but you would not know him by looking at him. The film has some decent shocks, but it is badly paced and the climax, although generating tension, is actually quite laughable. That being said, he is working with a scenario that, at best, could charitably be described as pathetic. <br /> <br /> Believe me, when it comes to nannies, stick to Fran Drescher. This one should have gone to the trash directly to the video.
