I loved the movie Ocean's 11. <br /> <br /> Smart movie. The eleven characters played a crucial role in the robbery, as they each had their own specialized know-how necessary to draw the conclusion of the grand finale. <br /> <br /> What is Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I guess it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones but she was not really one of the 11 while she was trying to make them stumble and work against them all the movie ?? It was more like the story of the boring relationship between Brad and Zeta-Jones characters, with some excerpts of the original film projected just to draw audience on seats to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> With O-11, the gang was still one step ahead of Benoît (Garcia). They always managed to surpass it. What happened here? He catches them after a phone call and suddenly they are all upset? The whole film aims to collect the stolen money and the interest to be paid to Benoît for the theft they inflicted on him 3 years ago. So next film, they will develop courage and brains again and recover it for making them pay for the first holdup? Puh-lease ... <br /> <br /> This film could have been made with only Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 minutes of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene. <br /> <br /> Movie in slow motion, not the energy of the first. I have tried hard to love him and I am generally very easy to please but I am really disappointed. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! Twist - the whole movie does not have to be done because the real holdup was done before anything you've seen in the last 2 hours. <br /> <br /> END OF SPOILER. <br /> <br /> Wait until it's on TV or if you're a fan of the original 2001, do not look at it.
