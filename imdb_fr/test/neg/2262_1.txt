I am insulted and angry at the idea that a sequel to "Gone with the Wind" would have NEVER been undertaken. That said, I have no problem with the quality of the game or actors in this movie. The performers are talented people who have wasted their talents on this trash. The hype surrounding this book and this film proves to be a futile exercise. I think it will be one of Hollywood's lost movies. I do not believe that the beloved characters created by Margaret Mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. The film and the book should be among the worst ideas in the world of film publishing and filmmaking. The sad thing is that people have actually made money from these guts.
