Am I the only person who has seen and remembers Amadeus? Each scene of "Copy" has its counterpart in the Milos Forman, Amadeus - galloping cars with frantic strings, at the entrance of Anna through the dark corridor preceded by the man with the key, until the dialogue itself from the conclusion with Anna at the feet of Beethoven at the Salieri in front of the dying Mozart. No one else recalls the dialogue in this script: <br /> <br /> Salieri "Time?" Mozart "Common Time". ..... "We start with the ropes ..." and so he "copy". <br /> <br /> Do not forget Cynthia Nixon leaning against a doorframe, tears running down her face covered with freckles - same scene, just replace it with Beethoven's nephew. Even the scatological humor (pet jokes) is the same. We even have a cardinal followed by a plate of sweet biscuits reminiscent of Salieri in the banquet hall. Nobody remembers? !!!! <br /> <br /> And the scene where Anna cries to God "Why did you give me this gift?" ... Salieri said the same thing! <br /> <br /> And beyond all that we have a juvenile scenario with an opening exhibition that reads like the character identifications found in a children's story. "I am Mr. Beethoven, I am the composer ...." <br /> <br /> And after all, what is the goal of the bridge builder? Other than juxtaposing the technique against the artistic ... a comparison that is not developed at all - probably because it does not make sense, especially when it comes to Beethove who was a master of the technique. <br /> <br /> There is only one big scene - the game of the ninth. First, the music, which in itself makes you cry. But then there is the very erotic interaction of Anna, the copyist, who keeps time and Beethoven who directs, which surpasses the most explicit sexual intimacy. So intense, it's almost embarrassing. <br /> <br /> But, please, the rest of the film, where is the collective memory of the world? You have seen all this before ... and better!
