Carmen is a prostitute who seduces and robs soldiers of the Spanish army. she is without a doubt the best femme fatale of the moment. When a man resists his charming attentions, she decides to do everything to destroy him. In the end, he falls into his canvas and he will have to do everything he has ever hated just to be with Carmen. Despite the fact that Paz Vega is very beautiful, she does not seem to be a gypsy (like Carmen) and neither her actor's acting nor that of Sbaraglia are good. The story is very boring and, in most cases, it is very absurd, while looking sincere. in the same way, the scenarios and the special effects are not, but they are not acceptable, and too artificial for a historical film in the state. To sum up, boring and bad, with a very absurd development, there are many more interesting things to watch.
