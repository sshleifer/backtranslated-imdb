My girlfriend wanted to see that (lol is often the case) ... so I rented it. Then I saw how much this nomination was nominated for 10 Oscars. AWESOME! this should be good old drama. This film had a lot of potential ... the direction and the way everything was punctuated were very good. But once the movie was over, I could not help but wonder if this story was really worth filming. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was extremely annoying, I just could not tolerate her character. Warren Beatty was an excellent actor, but once again I had a hard time feeling sympathy for his character ... he's basically become an idiot, a gangster loser ... who had no place in "life" in the first place How could he join Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano anyway ??? This film has just left me with a bland but hurt feelings Well, what was the problem with this movie? "I just did not feel complete with Bugsy." Beatty's antics, while very effective, seemed too random and illogical, I suppose that's how Siegel was really ... but it was too much of that.There did not seem to be any real history here.Our basic evaluation would be <br /> <br /> "an insolent, playboy and sub-gangster performer falls in love with a loser of a woman, comes up with the idea of ​​"Las Vegas" .... but his unsuccessful attempt at the casino he built, as well as the fact of not worrying about money from his gang boss make him kill him. "What else is there?" I just did not see the big deal with that and it was a big disappointment, there should not be a lot of movies coming out in 1991, the way this was nominated for 10 Oscars is beyond me (although the two awards he won are justifiable) .1 / 4 stars.
