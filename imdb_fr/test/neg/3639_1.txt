Shopping, sunny skies, beaches, boarding school for wealthy teenagers and perfect endings. Welcome to the life of Zoey Brooks and her friends. Zoey Brooks is described by Jamie Lynn Spears, the self-proclaimed actress who became known as the younger sister of international pop star Britney Spears. With her beautiful blonde wig in the first season and an attempt to hide her monotonous accent, it is confirmed that Nickelodeon did attack dogs with nepotism. When Kristin Herrera, the actress who represented Dana Cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope was defeated as she was the only decent actress. The female cast is a complete shame, but the male cast has the potential for an adolescent media. If they continue to target Jamie Lynn Spears as an image of perfection, many people will have to lower their standards. Hopefully, they will soon discover that it is impossible to make a career out of nothing. Jamie Lynn Spears does not do anything to act, sing and do everything she tries to do to make this hellish spiral she calls a career. Nobody wonders why she is a self-proclaimed actress. Critics would certainly proclaim it as something other than that.
