1st viewed 30/04/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Musical at the Corny Waters with fun scenes and good roles, but it's not worth living. John Waters directed this 1950s musical parody with Johnny Depp playing the lead role. This film is very similar to what he did with the 60s parody entitled "Hairspray" but it is not as effective. Some tunes are catchy, some characters are interesting in their weird way, as in Waters, and the performances are good, though sometimes excessive. The scenario is similar to the movie "Grease", where there is a good band and a bad band. The naughty group guy, Cry Baby, wow is a good band girl. The good girl then joins the group of villains, but once Cry Baby hurts, she falls back into the group of good. This just puts in place the end where Cry Baby is trying to win her back. Now, an expected difference in Water's films is that the wrong group does not show up so badly all the time and that the right group acts as if it had a pole in place, you know what. I certainly saw that in Hairspray, too. The wacky and clumsy are not really fun in this movie, however, and it just leaves us feeling like the movie could have been a lot better. The main attraction of Johnny Depp's character is that he is able to run a tear on his cheek (so his namesake) at different times and drop women everywhere for him. This is overused and the result is that the movie is OK, but not so great.
