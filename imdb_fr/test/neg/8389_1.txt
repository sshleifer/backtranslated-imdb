This movie was so bad that it looked like a movie at home. In a scene, the camera tilts very slowly and gradually, then resets itself. The sound is crisp, and disappears from time to time. In another scene, the cameraman is just visible in a mirror. <br /> <br /> Then came the scene with the instructions to put a tent ... which, believe me, lasted for centuries and was completely irrelevant. to the plot. Most of the scenes dragged on with conversations that were not entirely relevant either. In my opinion, it was simply a matter of filling the film and making it longer. Even with these scenes, it was very short. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about it is the cut-off head that seemed pretty realistic.
