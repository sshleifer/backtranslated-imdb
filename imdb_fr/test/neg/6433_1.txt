"The war is in your blood," said Rambo at the beginning of the film, "do not fight it". Can you repeat that please? Does the screenwriter remove Mickey from Sly? It is impossible for a person with a primary education to miss the joke here. Still, Stallone utters it without irony. <br /> <br /> The same lack of humor applies to the film. Rambo IV is a stupid and silly actor who would have been funny without intention if it had not been an unbearable violence. A redneck fantasy of the lowest kind where villains are so naughty, it is not enough to kill them ?? you must dismember them with taste. Stallone does not shrink from any clich√© of blue collar to make himself understood. It's not enough for the bad guy to be sadistic about feeding pigs, throwing babies into the fire. He is also a homosexual pedophile. <br /> <br /> What's going on with IMDb? Is it taken over by the Rifle Society? How can this odious excuse justify such a high exploitation rate? I like a good action movie as much as the next man, but it's not an entertainment ?? it is the pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately denigrates the real tragedy of Myanmar. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly does not take his shirt. For that, I will give him a star ...
