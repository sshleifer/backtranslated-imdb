You must watch this movie! It's so bad that it's really good. <br /> <br /> You have your crazy but daring captain who, of course, has an affair with his former pilot, was once superb. And of course, the collision in flight occurs when the enemy of the captain and his rival are on the spot. You have your former vet from Vietnam who can not stand the pressure of another accident while flying or landing. Then you have your old crazy buddy from Army Air Corp. who drives the fighter plane and tries to cope well. I can not tell you what he's trying to do. The plane keeps going up and up and then you have your greedy and immoral business engineer and then you have your cold Ice Station, and then Lucky saves the bad guy from drowning so they can get off the plane! AND THAT DOES NOT END - THIS IS ALWAYS OK! You have to watch this. It's good! YOU'RE KIDDING! HAVE IT REALLY SHOWED THIS ON COMMERCIAL TELEVISION AND THEIR HOW ALREADY SHOWED ON A CABLE?
