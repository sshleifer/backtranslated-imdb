The 3 stars are for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Nothing else and no one else in this movie deserves even a little star. Okay, Amy Adams deserves a little smidgen, but the smidgenometer does not seem to work, so I'll stay with 3. Tom Hanks ... nothing. Julia Roberts ... nothing. Mike Nichols ... Do you see a trend? Aaron Sorkin ... OMG, not a chance. <br /> <br /> I could shout for several paragraphs about how Charlie Wilson's war ignores history, morality, legitimacy, etc., but I do not think such a speech can prevail over the dazzling fan of Aaron Sorkin. Beware. Spend your movie money elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Yet, if you're looking for a pithy comment, here's mine. You can put hot caramel sauce on a pile of garbage, but that does not change anything. Garbage is garbage, just like Charlie Wilson's war.
