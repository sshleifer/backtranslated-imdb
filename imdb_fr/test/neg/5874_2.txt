Clint Howard, brother of Ron more talented, plays in this horror horror comedy on a mental case that serves ice cream to children and kills people. Anxious to be a film of the variety "so bad that it is good", this film misses many points and must be considered as "so bad that it is ... well ... BAD". Whether it's the constant cinema, the movies, the stuffed cushions, or the horror-inducing sleep that made me feel bad about the movie, I do not know, all I know is that I hated the movie (and a guy who has a weakness for horror movies). Paul Norman chose to continue making movies in the porn industry before and after, his only film "mainstream". A wise choice like a horrible acting game, an absurd plot and a ridiculous dialogue is MUCH more acceptable if you see a porn star doing his thing. Curiously, this turkey has absolutely NO nudity (another reason not to be wrong) <br /> <br /> My note: D-
