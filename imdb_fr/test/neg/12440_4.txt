If you liked William Hickey in "Prizzi's Honor", he resurrects his character, just like Don Anthony in "Mob Boss". It is a satire "Godfather" very weak with some laughs. Stuart Whitman seems puzzled as to what he does in this schlock festival? Morgan Fairchild's performance is one of the film's best efforts, and that's not an encouraging sign. Eddie Deezen oscillates between the slapstick "Three Stooges" and a bad imitation of Woody Allen. Imperfectly flawed, "Mob Boss" is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes the comedy and the film drags while dragging car chases, weapons hidden in the bathroom of a restaurant and many other nonsense. - MERK
