My wife and I saw this at the theater on her first outing. <br /> <br /> There were only 3 couples there and we all went out at about the same time. <br /> <br /> It's the only movie I've ever been to. <br /> <br /> It was really painful to sit down. <br /> <br /> The theater actually stopped us on the way back and asked us if we wanted a refund. <br /> <br /> This has never happened before or since Pleae does not rent this rental. You will really regret it. I am really surprised by the summary of the vote. Maybe the personal taste is for something.
