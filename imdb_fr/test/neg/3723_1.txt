WARNING! SPOILER! This film is an absolute shit. It's not an entertainment. I do not have the words to describe the disgust I felt at the end. <br /> <br /> It's a bad film about the scum of society. Throughout the movie, I was waiting for it to get better. It does not have. Instead, it only got worse. <br /> <br /> When I see a film as bad as this one, I always try to find at least one good thing to say about it. In this case, this proved impossible. I do not have a good thing to say about it. How bad is it? Here's an example: Towards the end, Dan Akroyd chokes and kills Vincent D'Onofrio while Reeves and Diaz watch! It's not an entertainment!
