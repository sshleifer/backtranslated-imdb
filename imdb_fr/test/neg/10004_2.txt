A funny thing happened to me when I looked at "Mosquito": on one side, the hero is deaf-mute and the director is totally incapable of making us understand why he does what he does (mutilating dummies ... had, corpses) through his images. By cons, the English version at least is very badly doubled. So I found myself wishing there was both more AND less dialogue! This movie is stupid (funny how this guy has access to all the cemeteries and dullness of his city) and dark (where would we be in a 70's exploiter without our free lesbian scene?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how nice!) ... Miss that. (*)
