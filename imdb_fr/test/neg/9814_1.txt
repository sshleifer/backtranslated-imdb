I saw this film about 8 years ago, when it came out, and the only memories I have about it are: 1. It was horrible. 2. That, in one scene, Linnea Quigley applied tanning lotion on her arms and legs several times for about 15 minutes in a row (it seemed so long anyway). 3. A scene where a character receives a hammer hammer into his head. In this scene, when the hammer connects, the head breaks like glass. It's bad enough.
