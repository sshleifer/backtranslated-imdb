Why do you ask this man to pretend to have the truth about the existence of the Almighty? Well, his deductive logic, my friends, you see that I know that God exists because Satan exists, otherwise how would my poor eyes have been soiled on such a horrible film? Yes, there is no doubt about it, a cold Friday of 2006, Satan possessed me and forced me to watch this movie. What? You ask yourself; the devil makes small girls vomit and climbs to the ceilings, why would he waste his time making you watch this movie? My only conclusion to this question is that Satan thinks that watching Camp Fear is the worst form of lethal punishment, do not smash your eyes or make you speak in tongues, but make you sit idly through for an hour and a half of the most horrific of filming never made. . Can this film be as terrible as it says? Yes, my friend watching this movie is like being kicked about fifty million times, maybe more. But maybe I'm too hard, this movie has a few moments, the beginning for example, starts in a sorority house with a lot of girls with bare breasts; now, never being a sorority, I do not know if girls really do, but we can always pray. Now, after the end of the five-minute breasts and buttocks, there is a scene on the campus of a girls-only college; the girls themselves (about eight in all) follow an archeology class where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient mounds. The class teacher (who is apparently the only man in this girls' college) takes a handful of his nubile students, along with his girlfriend, to an isolated lake in the mountains, where they will discover ancient Indian artifacts; yes, yes, professor, we know how much you push. Now that's where the movie starts, the group of five, four girls, and a guy stop at a gas station for directions, but now a biker gang stops and harasses them for finally leave them alone and separate. Then they arrive at a "camping" made of four logs and some trees, then things start to turn terribly bad. First the teacher. and his girlfriend goes wandering away to spend time alone when one of the girls takes care of finding them, only to be captured by an unknown force. Continuing on the other two girls, the search for the missing girl begins when the bikers, plus a drunk man, come looking for them, their plan, to rape them and do them horrible things. The film continues with something about a druid who needs four virgins to sacrifice to save the world from some kind of aquatic monster before the year two thousand; but theirs is a hitch to this plan Mr. Druid, one of the girls is devirginized just before us, so go this plan. Now that I said there would be a mess, I'm going to ruin the end of the movie, the four girls get caught, drugged with a green sticky substance, then are ready to be sacrificed, after one of them between them be killed the remaining bikers and the prof. come and save them; they stand on a ledge where the rider who is not in the lead says, "I think I can do it!" only to jump and break the leg. The teacher. short in front of the guy and is subjugated, leaving only the biker, once in the spirit of rape, now repulsed by the giant druid of 6'3 "He first makes a pathetic attempt with a stick, then pulls a knife, The knife is like a lazer In a mouth of gold snakes, the beam is instantly lit and lights the druid instantly After that, they take the wounded with the aid of emergency stretcher and wonder if everything is really finished, but the bubble of the lake showing the monster is still alive.This is the film and it is my criticism, which, unfortunately, will not have been read by most eyes because it is the fifth criticism published for a The film has been out for fifteen years, but luckily Satan can only touch some of us, but not all of them.The judge would like to apologize sincerely to the poor girl from Circuit City, I'm going to borrow this movie: "I'm sorry, Sheila, please, do not hate me I'll let you watch that.
