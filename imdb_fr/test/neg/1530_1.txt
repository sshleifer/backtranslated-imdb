Not for the first time, I disagree with the majority opinion. Oz is a dreadful series, pretentious and voyeuristic. Manufacturers have their cake and eat it. Oz, Em City, etc. are used as ultra-gross signals indicating that the apparent grain is a complete fantasy. This allows viewers the most intellectual excuses to watch a theatrical nonsense on the soap opera seasoned with all that is bad for human beings. <br /> <br /> When you watch an episode, remember that even if the rough, violent, absurdly complicated face, an imaginary, unconvincing, sick drama unfolds before your very eyes, several hundred The poorest regions of the world have died of bad food or water. <br /> <br /> Oz is an exploitation drama at worst. It appeals to the lowest instincts, but claims to be serious and meaningful. He blows hot and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than a symphony of Mahler. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is relentlessly ugly and utilitarian. The freedoms taken with realities are stupid. Here is a nightclub with a dandy, arriving at Oz in his spooky adornment, completed by a cloudy corneal lens, creating a supply of drugs that no one has detected. Here is a murderous chimera that hurts about the overheated death of the universe, begging to be killed, but of course, being refused by the brute he approaches, she cuts her throat a little, improbably. <br /> <br /> The action is crazy with joy. at a rate fast enough that the weak-minded voyeurist always thinks about what will happen next, rather than the garbage just shown. Do not worry, betrayal, murder, sex scene will last one or two minutes. <br /> <br /> Finally, Oz is obviously pretentious. You do not have to feel embarrassed to be driven by his flow. You can watch it and tell you that producers, writers and actors do it all with a huge wink (or the same word except vowel change) to the public. <br /> <br /> Yes, you can be a vicious spectator and excuse yourself for reasons of intelligence, postmodernist skills, etc. of the Oz production team. They use the lowest common denominator while claiming to operate on a higher plane. <br /> <br /> Really, a despicable series. And every hour he spends, rewards his writers and actors, and generates advertising revenue for channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than look at something so ugly and useless, die a few hundred more children whose lives could have been saved by the dollars spent on this horrible, successful and much-loved series.
