Bruce Willis, as usual, does a great job. <br /> <br /> [warning: can be considered a "spoiler"] <br /> <br /> While my friend thought it was good, I looked at my watch all the time the movie asking me when it would finish. After watching movies as great as "The Patriot" and "Chicken Run", I'm really disappointed with Disney's "The Kid" movie. <br /> <br /> Willis plays an older man with a hard and realistic positive effect on people's images (he is an image consultant). An unknown kid introduces himself. Yes, it's him but younger, and even Lily Tomlin can see it. At this point, I think of a cross between an episode of "Quantum Leap" and a movie of bad weather. <br /> <br /> Kid and Willis are trying to understand why he is in this period. They discover him. They meet Willis when he gets older. It does not matter if Willis teleports them from one period to the next and they get together to begin never being explained in detail, how he acquired this knowledge, how he realized that he needed to do it, and so on. <Basically, it is a very tired, unoriginal and uninteresting plot that contains very good actors. The good news is that the actor "The Kid" is not nearly as boring as it is in the trailers on television.
