It is impossible to make a film based on a book such as "Brothers Karamzov" by F.M. Dostojevsky. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks is a great director, but the film is at a very low level. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie was the end. Well, think of the book. We finally have the "guilty" Dimitrij Karamazov. Then they sent him to Siberia. In the end, the famous epilogues of Dostojevsky, friends and family developing a plan to save him. But that's all ... and the film is now two steps further and shows us an illusion ending the flight of Dimitry and Gruschenka (I think). Morally, I'm sure Dostojevsky would finish the book with an open ending because he's not guilty (Smerdjakov is the real murderer) and he must be a free man. But on the other hand, he goes to his father's house to kill him, so he decided to commit the crime ... it's a moral dilemma and the next point is an open end ... well, for real It's just not completely open. <br /> <br /> William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov ... I'm sorry! -> NO !!! <br /> <br /> The other characters play in a good performance as we have to expect from such big actors ... Of course, a superb performance of Yul Breynner like Dimitrij. I think there are not many actors who can play this role in a better way. <br /> <br /> But as I said at the beginning: This book is unsuitable. It should never be a movie in two hours, it's impossible. I think there are longer movies, so maybe they could do the right thing ... But I just keep the opinion that this book can not be adapted. <br /> <br /> So - 3 points: <br /> <br /> One point for the great director Richard Brooks <br /> <br /> A point for a superb performance by Yul Brynner <br /> <br /> Finally: a point for one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostojevsky
