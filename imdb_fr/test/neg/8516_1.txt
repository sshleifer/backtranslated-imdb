I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I watched that show when she was on A & E a few years ago. The series was strange to say the least, but I gave it a chance because I loved these actresses. It must be one of the worst shows I have ever seen. I would not look at it anymore and I would certainly not waste money buying the video. The scenario of this TV version is ridiculous and just stupid! The "kicker" occurs when Ruth undergoes an operation on the bones of the leg. This kind of nonsense belongs to James Bond and Sci-Fi movies. If this version is true to the book, I will not check it in my local library! The American version came out a few years after seeing this original. To my surprise, the Americans have understood this time, because their version with Meryl Streep and Roseanne is played for laughs and is rather funny. When played to laugh, the scenario works.
