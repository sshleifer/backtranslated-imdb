I think that the speed, which is a direct copy of the Hollywood film Cellular (I did not look at this one), gives the impression of a very exciting test match the first four days but which ends with a draw at very boring spell. I watched this movie today on January 12, 2008 on rental VCDs. Its release date is October 19, 2007. But fortunately for me, I did not know much this movie before, except that it is a failure at the box office. So, in this situation, when I watch the film, I feel that this film could have been a very good film, but the director falls again into the trap of Bollywood traditions and lost a very good opportunity. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a Bhatt movie, it has to be copied elsewhere. But nowadays, it does not matter if I have not seen the original movie. I just found the main theme very similar to "Nick of Time" and "Badshah". The film shows Sanjay Suri an intelligence officer, but his wife thinks he is a leader. This brings back the memory of 'True-Lies'. The only new part was the use if the phone. But that too, I discovered it now, is from the movie Cellular. So when a film is made up of so many other films, its future is pretty clear. <br /> <br /> What I like about the film is its rhythm. As the name suggests, things go really fast and there is not much time to think between scenes. But this happens in the last 20 minutes of the movie in the traditional style of Dhishum dhishum of Bollywood. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is also very interesting. Three parallel stories, one after the other. One of the kidnappings of Urmila, the other Zayed trying to help Urmila, then the assassination plan of the Prime Minister. These three stories blend naturally as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> But the very ordinary acting and extra useless style killed the spirit of the film. Apart from Sanjay Suri, no other leaves no impression. This is even true for Urmila, who is still promising in RGV films. Because of this ordinary game, some scenes do not really convey the feelings sought by the director. For example. the scene at the end where Urmila leaves all hope and cuts the phone, should have had a positive impact. But instead, we just wait for the end of this scene. <br /> <br /> Besides playing, a useless love for the style demoralizes the film. Showing cool villains is good for Hollywood movies, not for Bollywood The background of London is also used to create style and the unintelligent advantage of this background is not seen. Especially in the end, all these dhishhum-dhishhum were absolutely useless. Perhaps the director feels that the pinnacle of Hindi films must have such fights. They look unrealistic, increase the length of the film and make sure that the audience leaves the theater before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> In the end, I find the film once watched. If it happens on TV or if you can rent it, it's OK. But again, make sure you have the remote and the front button on hand. The next time the movie is on TV, you can watch other channels safely.
