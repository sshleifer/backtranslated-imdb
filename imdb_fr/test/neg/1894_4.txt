Yes, this strange feature film was written by John Sayles. Shot in Toronto, this is another eighties report about the dangers of the urban jungle, where the police are scared to go and where the homeless and criminal classes are the only inhabitants. In this mix, we find the myth of Wild Thing, a young wild man raised by a lady of the sack after her parents were murdered by a dirty cop (Maury Chaykin) and Chopper, the local crime leader (Robert Davi). Incorporate local benefactors (priest Sean Hewitt and social worker Kathleen Quinlan), and you have a recipe for rather innocuous action sequences. Davi is the star among the actors, and the director of photography Rene Verzier does a very good job. Otherwise, this is a rather lumpen action photo that will not satisfy the action fans and will leave Sayles' admirers idle.
