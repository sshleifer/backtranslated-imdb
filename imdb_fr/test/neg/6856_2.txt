Blade is really the best way to describe this movie. He has a real mediocre storyline, a dialogue and uninteresting characters and he's missing almost everything else. <br /> <br /> There are too many characters and the problem is that you do not care. What is missing from the film is a good and clear main character. Instead, the film now has a bit of everything, it has a bit of a hero, a little bit of love and a bit of nasty stuff. I wish there were a few less Ghoulies, they are especially very boring in this film. <br /> <br /> The Ghoulies are supposed to be evil creatures, who murder for their pleasure. In this film, all they want is to drink beer and watch naked college girls. In addition, someone had the "brilliant" idea to let the Ghoulies be able to speak this time. It works really bad and annoying. The Ghoulie puppets have been definitely improved for this film. They have a more detailed appearance and are able to do more, but at the same time, they are much more false than those of the previous Ghoulies movies. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the purpose of this film was more comedy than horror this time. The film is like a lame 80s high school comedy (although this movie was released in 1991). His humor is really the worst and the lame of the film. It's so incredibly boring and just not funny at all. <br /> <br /> The story does not go anywhere with its story and the movie is just a big mess, which never seems to end. The Ghoulies plot line seems fundamentally unrelated to the other plot lines of the film, involving human characters. The film does not speak at all about the Ghoulies that terrorize a college, while the humans try to chase them and stop their ravages. No big surprise that this is the only movie written by Brent Olson for now. He just does not have any talent for that and I think he discovered it too and went back to the university himself. <br /> <br /> Even compared to the previous Ghoulies films; this movie is just terrible! <br /> <br /> 2/10
