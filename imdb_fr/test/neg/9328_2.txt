Well, after seeing "Get Started", I wondered why on earth they burned Schraders Version and made it poor. But now, after seeing "Dominion", I deeply understand this decision. Even if they do not have it much better. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie is really bad. Some good moments, but a really boring story and some major intrigues kill this movie. <br /> <br /> The story of the exorcist has a lot, and in a precedent you can rely on a lot and give references that the public will want to see. But there is so little in the film. The effects are really bad - not even the TV standard.
