"The best film of the 90s" "The Welsh train" .... Aye, that's it! I went in this movie with great expectations and everything was downhill. <br /> <br /> This film was supposed to be an archetypal film about the drug culture of the early 90s and would allow us to see everything inside this scene, and break the media's preconceptions. following the moral panic that followed the death of Leah Betts in 1995. Unfortunately, it is far from being long. <br /> <br /> Where Trainspotting was able to treat you as an adult and the potential problems with drugs, it provided us with a derisory account of the wonder of the drug and how it might please you. . know, as totally open your mind. Cue a little guff about Bill Hicks, and Howard Marks ad nausea. It's painfully bad sometimes. I mean, the scene at the end between Lulu and her aunt made me laugh out loud. Now, I may be cynical, but the way Jip is guiding us through this story is like listening to CELA Acid guy, whom you met at a party at home, who tells you that man "holds us back and that Acid released him from the tensions of modern society.

The words "handyman, master of nothing" come to mind. You can see where he gets his inspiration, especially in the narrative style of the main character Jip (who places the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera and describes what goes through his head during the The problem is that some speech on camera is painful to watch. It's mostly a lack of empathy for Jip, but they're so desperate to sound philosophical that they end up looking like your average dramatic project. The direction is good, and the intentions are good, but it lacks so much integrity that you start to wonder what the hype is about. <br /> <br /> That being said, not everything is bad. There are some really fun and entertaining moments. Moff is the highlight of the film for me. For an independent film, he has also attracted a large number of high-quality British actors / actresses, which may explain why the film has attracted such enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Best movie of the 90s? Not far, but if you're looking for a solid movie on Sunday night, then this could be your bag. Inevitably, the film is tainted by the hype surrounding it.
