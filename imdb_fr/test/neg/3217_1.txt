It is amazing that this talented actor, Chapa, has brought all these well-known stars into this lamentable, pathetic, silly and ridiculous film about a low-life gangster who looks white but is half-Mexican. The famous stars of this trash movie receive a scenario that seems composed by a young man of 16 years. I'm sure this film is the low point of the career of actors such as Dunaway, Wagner, Keach, Tilly and Busey who, I'm sure, are very embarrassed that they have ever appeared in this turkey of a movie. I doubt that many people have ever heard of Chapa and after this dreadful movie, I'm sure he'll be forgotten, as it should be.
