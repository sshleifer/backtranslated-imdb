It's a bad excuse for a movie. A black film directed by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First, let's forget the plot, a really simplistic version of a hard cynical cynic, transformed into a saint, by the love of a pretty blonde. Yechh. So what prevents him from despising him from loving him? With a group of guys, he helps prevent a child from drowning. They all swim in a water tower and try to survive when the water is siphoned off, blocking them. It's not really heroic, but it's suddenly hit. It's really painful to see Claude Rains trying to portray a black, hard-talking police officer who speaks loudly. A crooked grimace is his main rather pathetic game tool, with a roaring voice. Most of his energy seems to go to trying to hide the intelligence shining in all his other roles. I will never understand how he was able to talk about taking this job. Enjoy, if you can, for some vintage details, old cars and gas pumps, but do not expect a decent cinematic experience. It lost 1-1 / 12 hours of my life.
