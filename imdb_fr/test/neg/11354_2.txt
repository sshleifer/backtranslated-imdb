I was looking forward to that based on the reviews and the pretty good rating. It was a big disappointment. This does not stand up to contemporary zombie movies like Shaun of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Land of the Dead, etc. Horror movies sometimes take a while before you start, you have to create the characters, you feel some empathy, and so on. but even then, you have 45 minutes left to sit here before sniffing a corpse. Until then, it's like watching a bad show, nothing interests you or interests you. go watch this for the first time, you can honestly start watching after 45 minutes, you will not miss anything of the plot. When things move, everything is very mediocre. Some shots and make-ups are done well, others are very badly done, consistency is lacking here and there are really shocking continuity errors and some of the most woody actions I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> All this could be passable if you really thought that all this was happening in an airplane, but with gunfire, fire bombs dropped, no pilot in the cockpit during a violent storm, but the plane remains in the air. We are not all naive. <br /> <br /> Oh, and does it really take a whole minute to miss a fighter plane to hit a plane a few hundred yards away? I know it's a zombie movie and you have to stretch things, but this film and the other major flaws listed above have no credibility. A miss.
