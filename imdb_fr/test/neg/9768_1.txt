This movie is absolutely horrible! I thought because there were good actors like Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper and, of course, the famous Billy D. Williams. The film is long and drags with a documentary style showing Gabrielle Union, deceased in the film, talking about her family; which in fact is a confusing family because you never know who is who, and who is related to whom. I would not recommend this film to anyone, and I would like to take it back to where I got it. I went to sleep from time to time because of boredom. Do not waste your time or money on this movie. It could have been more true with more drama and less boredom.
