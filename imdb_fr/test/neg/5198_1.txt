Yes, dumb is the word for this actress. I know that many have mentioned her beauty, but this viewer found it empty and boring to look at with her bleached hair, lip gloss and less perfect body. Watch her move away in this pair of jeans, showing a rather wide butt. Her buttocks extend beyond her shoulders. What does that tell you? As for the main man, played by the superb Mark Humphrey, he was perfectly chosen. A charmer. However, he and Lancaster did not fit. She was out of place in front of this handsome guy. Good action by Susan Glover as a sister. Angela Galuppo had a small role and was well. But the director of the film, Philippe Gagnon, wasted too many images on Lancaster. After a while, you got tired of watching her and watching her use her talent to play. And what a woman slut she was. Snooping on her husband, him being rude and just a spoiled brat. Was happy to see her hit with the dart gun. I thought it might be the end of her. But alas, the script tells us the opposite. After torturing myself and watching this loser again, I always made the same criticisms. Lancaster is boring to watch. This time around her hair, people. His hair constantly in his face, constantly throwing back, became boring. I wonder about the reason for the writer, Alexandra Komisaruk, for whom a rich and handsome man like Philippe would embarrass himself even a bimbo like Allison. When there were so many attractive intelligent women, with class, to choose. He chooses this nothing. Is it the Rochester / Jane Eyre thing? Oh well, everything is a matter of taste, I suppose. This Sarah Lancaster is not my cup of tea.
