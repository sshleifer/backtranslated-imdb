This film does not know what it wants to be: does it make fun of action movies in general? Is it satirical? Is it supposed to be a black comedy? It's really one of the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Lori Petty is annoying. There, I said what everyone thinks. It's bad enough that she's such a terrible actress (Route 666, Bates Motel), but she's not even called a mediocre b-movie actress. His strident voice, strange mania, and poor comic timing punctuate this movie from beginning to end, until you just want to put your head in a vise and end the pain. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid that movie at all costs. You will be glad to have done it.
