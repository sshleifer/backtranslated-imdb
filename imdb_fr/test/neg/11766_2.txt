There are interesting articles here and on the likes and dislikes of Bruce Weber. Maybe if a professional publisher had prepared it for Biography, I would have felt more satisfied. Instead, I spent $ 8 at a film festival. For an autobiography, almost nothing is revealed about Bruce Weber, except that he likes to look at photographs, photograph interesting people, especially beautiful teenagers and listen to jazz. The director of "Crumb" would have made a much more interesting and coherent film.
