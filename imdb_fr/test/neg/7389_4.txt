A bad movie, but with a reel that deserves to be savored. For most movies, the jokes are bad, the songs are bad, even W.C. Fields is bad. Then there is a sequence with Bob Hope and his movie-ex; the dialogue is spiritual and the song (a version of "Thanks for the memories") light, cynical and lovely. Who parachuted for this piece? Still, it's worth the initial entry of 25 cents.
