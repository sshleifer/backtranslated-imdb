A stupid show in the vein of the rest of them with terrible music and a laugh that must come from I Love Lucy. I got rid of the TV because of shows like this one, but I resumed the first season in the big prizes for $ 3.00. Should buy the movie Van Damme instead. <br /> <br /> If I were a conspiracy theorist, who believed that a small group of people were working against real families and continued to invent this propaganda in order to undermine the family values ​​I would like to indicate this show, married with kids, Family Guy, etc., but I'm not. <br /> <br /> By the way, I'm not a Christian, I love the Simpsons and the Peep show. I watched two episodes and thought that if series like this are popular, who are they popular with? Then I remembered all the pictures of Walmart people circulating on the Web and I thought ah ah! It's no wonder our culture is a joke around the world when we're in prime time.
