Have you ever noticed how so many very bad movies attract as many as 10/10 votes? It's not really an enigma, but it's not really a movie. There are two ways to watch it in the Mail on Sunday. <br /> <br /> 1. It's free, so you can not complain too much. 2. It's free, so it can not be very good. <br /> <br /> My vote is number 2. The free DVD in Sunday newspapers is a recent trend and very good old movies have been offered. They are the ones who have been out for centuries and who have earned most of the money they will ever earn. So it's a bonus. This is the last stop for old movies, not the first for new ones. So you can guess how uncomfortable it is to miss out on TV and DVD rentals. <br /> <br /> Derek Jacobi is good like Dickens. Negative points are a longer list. Trying is not the same as succeeding for poor Vinnie and the other character of Jacobi's Tramp, it's chatty ham that has disappeared. The story is very weak. Dickens' story has nothing to do with the murders of the film and looks like another movie inserted into the script to make people believe it's a British Dan Brown without religion. Supporting actors are either there for the money (Vanessa Redgrave must be very difficult) or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers. It's also very, very long for what it is. <br /> <br /> Vinnie, taking Dickens' priceless story with him into the pocket of his jacket is good for some laughter, but that's all. Not funny and not very good even for free.
