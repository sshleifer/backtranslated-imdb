Yes, this movie features a girl named Jessica who says that everything is bad and that trees are also landing on people (well, she only causes a tree to fall once, but she says that everything is bad). This film is about a farmhouse that apparently rents rooms to people, but offers little other entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of a villain. Of course, they do not know until the owner of the farm helper opens the box containing the head. The head hypnotizes everyone to be able to reach Jessica and use her powers to find elements allowing her to search for her body. This film has a pretty interesting story, but it goes very badly here. Everyone in this movie will annoy you at least once.
