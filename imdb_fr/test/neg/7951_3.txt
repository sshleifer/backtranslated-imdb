Have you ever watched a movie when, after its conclusion, your left wondered what it was? Well, say hello to "Scream, Baby, Scream". It's not that the story is complex or something, but simply that it unfolds in three completely different modes ... 1. A fun movie about the drug of the 60's ... 2. A soap opera very overplayed ... and 3. a horror movie (with very little "scream" about). To my surprise, I discovered that it was written by one of my favorites, Larry Cohen. Well, I guess even the best ones have to learn by trial and error. <br /> <br /> Playing a bit like H.G. Lewis (only with lesser effects), this "bad" movie has its advantages. For most of its duration, there is a pretty cool jazz score to hear and some memorable scenes ... one of those where a group of kids decides to experiment with acid and take a long and enjoyable motorcycle ride to the zoo. The camera turns that the director uses to indicate that his hallucinatory state is simply delayed, but fun. Believe me when I tell you that there is no need to go out of the house to catch this one!
