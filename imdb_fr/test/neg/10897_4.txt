A young woman, Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander), and her boyfriend Jess (Joey Mendicino) are the targets of a deranged serial killer after stopping for a "comfort break" at a remote roadside rest stop. the road. <br /> <What could have been a chilling chiller actually in more competent hands turns out to be a confused and inconsiderate mess under the sloppy leadership of John Shiban (who also wrote the screenplay). There is a lot of juicy violence, a brief nuance of nudity and confident casting performances, but the silly script gives the viewer a lot of unanswered questions that one can not help but feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the film presents itself as a classic movie of "killer on the loose", but Shiban (an ex-scriptwriter for X-files) adds subtle supernatural elements that suggest that his goal was something else: a ghost story, the others ceasing to act as a vengeful spectrum focus to punish sinners. <br /> <br /> By reading the movie, looking at IMDb viewer theories, and looking at the extras on the DVD, some plot elements start to make a little more sense (though, even with the benefit of additional information, many questions remain unanswered). In my opinion, any film that requires as much investigation to be understood (only partially) is not particularly good.
