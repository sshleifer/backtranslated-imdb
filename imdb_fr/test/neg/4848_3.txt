I saw this film while I was in France and I must say that it baffled me. This is the story of a jewel thief and a young singer who are both in Morocco at the same time, meet and knit together. Quite simple? The problem is that this is the kind of movie that has an ambiguity in the timeline (the movie is not fully played in order) and in reality (what I just saw is it really happened , or was it a dream?). Given these parameters and the fact that the film was bilingual, it was really difficult to follow and I did not really know what was happening at the end. I imagine that some deep artistic types might understand this film better than me, and it may take more than one view to understand it.
