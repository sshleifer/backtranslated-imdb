This film obviously had good intentions. In the end, there is a dedication to a named Kellie who, as a spectator, can only assume that she has found herself in a situation similar to that described in the film. Maybe she made the "wrong" choice. This dedication is the ONLY redeeming quality of Love & Suicide. <br /> <br /> The film becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. Once the viewer is already pissed off, it's only about five minutes after the movie starts. I know the film was low budget and the shots were actually pretty good ... unfortunately, everything else was horrible. The actors 'game, the plot, the quality of the sound, the quality of the image ... the actors' game. I'm sorry but the acting is horrible. Beyond the horrible. It's as if the actors were trying to act like people. This is the only way I can think to describe it. As I watched, I really imagined the scenario with the direction of the scene in my mind. None of the movements were natural and none of the characters' reactions matched. In short: the timing is WAY off. The timing of the entire movie is very different. I'm not a director, so I know the limits of my knowledge, but I really think there has to be some way of passing on the time ... until they explain to me that graduation is not too far away, I had the impression that the first part of the film took place over a week ... a month at most. <br /> <br /> That said, it's a shame. This movie could have been really powerful with a bit of tweaking. All the moments of the movie in which we are supposed to feel something are obvious, but only because the configuration is obvious (which is a bad thing). The moving scenes are totally flat. For example, when Kaye's brother takes his hat and wears it on his, we should feel the understanding he has for her, the innocence and the protective nature of his brother's love ... way. There are so many other scenes like this (for example: ALL fight scenes) and all they do is remove the movie. All of this put together, Love & Suicide comes as a long, cheap and low-budget commercial advertisement.
