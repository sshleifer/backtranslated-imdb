I'm a fan of Ed Harris's work and I had a lot of expectations about this movie. Having such good actors as Harris and Von Sydow is always a big advantage for a director, but if the scenario is bad, what can you do? I really think that Needful Things is the worst film in Harris's filmography and that the implication in this film was a big mistake. Anyway, I've seen much worse movies in my life, but Needful Things has been a disappointment because of wasted acting talent. The story as a whole seems too incredible and factitious. I do not know if it's because of the book, because I have not read it. But if the scenario was so bad, I do not see the reason to film it. It may have been the commercial success of King's books, or the need for poor quality movies for the 90s VHS era. Whatever the reason, this movie was a very bad choice for all people involved.
