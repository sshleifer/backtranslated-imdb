(Some Spoilers) Dull as a thirsty slasher movie that has this homeless man upset Harry, Darwyn Swalve, murdering a realtor throughout the city of L.A because of the high prices they charge for their property. Looking like an extra of Clint Eastwood's "Spaghetti Western", Harry, who lives in abandoned houses eating dog food, is very upset when his squatter lifestyle is interrupted. This is what happens when a number of real estate agents have invaded his space to try to sell the houses he houses to their potential customers. <br /> <br /> Joseph Bottome plays the lead role in this low-cannon. Horror movie as host of radio shows, Dr. David Kelly, the attractive and popular host psychologist of the KDRX survival line. DR. Kelly is being sued by the family of one of her interlocutors, Tracy, who finally blew her brains while she was on the air with the doc who could do nothing to help her survive her ordeal . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Property killer discusses his adventures with Dr. Kelly on the air and the police try to get the doctor to get his phone number and address keeping it online, but refusing to enter so as not to damage its reputation by making potential callers do not call for fear of being monitored by the LADP. <br /> <br /> Kelly also has a hot and heavy affair with Adrienne Barbeau, real estate director and real estate agent, Lisa Grant, whose sales office is the main casualty in the film. Harry also gets the assassination of Barney Resnick, Barry Hope, who is threatening and scandalous in the real estate sector, who threatened to put Lisa out of service by any means possible, even if he was to kill her. <br /> <br /> Get Berny alone and pants down, Harry cuts his head while he is entertained by one of his clients, a whore, he leaves dead and hangs with the headless Barney . The film ends with Harry disturbed taking Lisa hostage and asking Dr. Kelly to try to come to his rescue before having Det. Shapiro (Robert Miano), resembling e who has not slept for a week, comes out of nowhere and breathes Harry's brains. Harry quickly comes back to life without the gay issue between his ears and is killed for the second time in the film by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the floor while a dozen members of the LAPD, M16 armed and ready, leave the scene. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie "Opean House" worked with laughable tension to almost nonexistent. Even the hot sex scenes between Dr. Kelly and Lisa did not save the movie because they were too few, only two and the sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a little too underexposed, with too little light and too much clothing in each of them. <br /> <br /> Harry the killer in the film was also a little comical to take seriously to try to make a point, to Dr. Kelly on the phone and in person, about the rents and prices of real estate in the country and how people like him find it almost impossible to find decent housing. You can understand Harry's concern for the high cost of living, but be very critical of him. on to correct it.
