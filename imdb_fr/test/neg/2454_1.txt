Without them we would only see Spielberg, the Farrelly brothers and movies based on old sitcoms. They are the risk takers. They reap the fruits of success and suffer failures. Max and Grace is most certainly a failure. Michael Parness deserves the credit for having made his first feature film which, he says, has led to bankruptcy. It may be better to stick to the scene if this film gives an indication of what to expect in the future. Even though everyone warned me, I still went to see Max and Grace, hoping to discover something they would not discover. It starts pretty well, a party for Max in his parents' house, filmed under dim light, the camera floating in interesting angles. As soon as we see that Max hanged himself, an obvious scam of Harold and Maude, everything happens as if nothing had happened. How could he do this unnoticed in the middle of a birthday party? Besides, how could two mentally challenged psychiatric patients decide to marry and do so with the blessing of all concerned? In the Q & A after the movie, David Krumholtz suggested that the whole story was the surreal dream of his character, Max. This story is so badly written that the comment was more like an excuse. The film does not seem to have been adrift, which is another reason to be so disappointed with the results. What is supposed to be funny is not but is offensively bad. The continuity is bad, the lighting is terrible and the effects seem cheap and forced. HBP was less than three hundred and was surprisingly full but I saw at least thirty or forty walkouts in the first half hour. At one point, Grace, played by Natasha Lyonne, laments her inability to die. I found myself thinking the same thing since I never go out before the credits. If Krumholtz really thinks it's "one of the best scripts" he's ever read, it seems he needs to catch up. A waste of talent and resources, this is the worst independent I've seen since Bubba-Ho-tep.
