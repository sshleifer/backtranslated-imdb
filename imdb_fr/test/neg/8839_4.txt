Lone Star Productions surely threw them in the 1930s, and "Star Packer" looks like one of the hottest ones. John Wayne is the American Marshal John Travers, investigating a thug nicknamed "The Shadow", responsible for stealing cattle, robberies, etc., and giving orders from behind the door of a false wall. Yakima Canutt is the faithful Indian acolyte of Travers, aptly named ... well, "Yak". <br /> <br /> From the beginning we discover that Matt Matlock (George Pre-Gabby Hayes), President of Cattlemens Union, is really The Shadow; the dead gift is when he offers to buy back the (supposed) half of his niece Anita at Matlock Ranch, since "it's not a place for a girl". As Anita, Verna Hillie does not have much to do in the movie, although in a comical moment, she has to use a six shooter to hit the butt of one of the bad guys during a night raid. <br /> There are some curiosities in the film - Wayne's character alternately rides a white horse and a black horse in the first half of the film. In what could have been a neat device, a recessed tree stump used by a henchman is located in the middle of the street. Finally, the film does not live up to its name because sheriff Travers never wears insignia in his film, that is to say, a starless packer without star. <br /> <br /> The horse pursues, the fleeting scenes of the scene, the stagecoach of the cliff (another curiosity, the horses come off the stage) are all pretty standard stuff. But John Wayne fans will want to see this one for the charisma he displayed at the beginning of his career. For those who are more critical, the white handkerchiefs worn around the forehead by the good guy can only mean that they all have headaches.
