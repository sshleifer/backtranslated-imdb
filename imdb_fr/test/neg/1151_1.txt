Let me start with one thing: anti-Semitism has been a serious problem in history, present in many societies and causing the death of millions of Jews. That said, the problem with this film is that it considers the United States - probably the most hospitable society of all time for Jews outside of Israel - as a place not very different from Nazi Germany. The film takes place in 1943 and tells the story of a man (William H. Macy) who is confused with a Jew after having started wearing glasses !. After that, a number of very nasty things happened to him (he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one, his neighbors have shunned him, finding themselves all in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's egotistical and penetrating novels, those who gave a bad name to liberalism.
