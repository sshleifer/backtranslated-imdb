OK, so I'm relaxing in my room when Mom knocks on the door. I open the door and what do I see in his hands? "SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH". I think it must be an old horror movie, because nowadays everyone can be stupid enough to name a movie after the hit movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp. But to my surprise, the film is at least two years older than the original. That alone should have prevented me from including it in the V.C.R. But no, I had to take a chance, I had to believe that this film could have a small ray of hope. I did not know that the rays were not visible. <br /> <br /> First, the story is so ridiculous that it is probably the case in some cities of countries. Second, the actors are more like real-life people who are surprised on the set when the director screams. Third, almost every film featuring the director is always awful. But what's fun is that it's another movie by Kevin Summerfield. I now rely on his film to bring me to the ground with bursts of laughter. <br /> <br /> Where do I start this film? I know, let's start with the jogger in the woods. The lighting in the camera was so bad that I concluded that the jogger was still and the cameraman was running. I like the way the woman stops eating a treat. I mean it's just about the darkness, or the light, that could be said with the camera lighting. And she stops running to eat a candy bar, I mean a CANDY BAR. So she ends up being the first victim for stupidity, and I'm already ready to break the tape, find the director, burn my hands. <br /> <br /> Then, coming out of nowhere, some guys like to try to fix a car that has probably been broken for a few years now. Then come the fake Mack 10 and a very real prostitute, who is part of our main group. <br /> <br /> Part of the film is about a group of kids who all have problems. And you have the choice to pick up trash in Sleepy Hollow Park or hang up forever. He sent into the woods with one of the teachers (Mr.E or AK Kevin Summfield) who is supposed to watch over them and make sure everything goes as it should. The funny thing is to see how the charters are underdeveloped. I mean what's with the fake Mack 10 guy and who's ever heard of Hacker trying to kill himself. And some how one of the students had an affair with the teacher, Mr. E, even before all that shit of community service was raised. Still, the school still thought it was a good idea to let him go. There is also a student named J who, in the film, tries to make annoyingly arise any attempt to make the audience jump, while it only adds to the cheapness of the film. The sound was so horrible in this movie. I mean, there was one when two guys fought, and the guy punched the other guy in the belly, and from TV appeared that sound effect that looks like someone striking a stale wooden box. It started horribly and ended dangerously stupid, even for my taste. I will say this however, the music in the background has made the scenes look tolerable enough. But not so tolerable. My conclusion is: if you want to leave another movie, Kevin Summfield takes "Sleepy Hollow High" seriously. <br /> <br /> PS, I'm still thinking of shooting myself to get rid of these images of the fake Mack. 10. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
