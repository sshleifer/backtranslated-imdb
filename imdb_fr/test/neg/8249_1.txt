Sappy. <br /> <br /> I liked the way they went to "Haaavaad baaa" to quote books and impress the ugliest girl. <br /> <br /> The janitor of my school is probably a genius too but is waiting to get this big job of construction. <br /> <br /> This is not a reason to try to cut a steak with that. "Do you like apples?" <br /> <br /> The guy nods or something. <br /> <br /> "How did you like DEM DEMES!" Wow, IT'S the genius. <br /> <br /> Duh, Minnie Driver would give her number to anyone. Robin Williams can not paint and keep the good books on the top shelf. And there is a teacher who always wears a priest's scarf for no reason.
