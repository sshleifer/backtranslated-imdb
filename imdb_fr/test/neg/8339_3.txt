When I saw this film, all I could think was: what a disaster! No, I'm not talking about the volcano, but the film itself. I have seen a lot of movies, but it's certainly one of the worst ever. I do not care if a volcano erupting under L.A.'s downtown is possible or not. Maybe not, but even if it could have been a good movie ... but that's certainly not the case and I'll explain why. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many lava flows on a medium volcano, but what I do know is that the volcano of this film makes Vesuvius, Mount Etna and Mount Pinatubo look like a small barbecue. I do not think there has ever been as much lava coming out of a volcano as what we see in this movie. I'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his film, but I really wonder why he spent it for the special effects and not for the script and the actors. I'm not saying that he should have hired a top-notch cast, but it's really the opposite of what I would call good acting. Their performances are so incredibly mediocre that the whole movie is even worse. <br /> <br /> And what's wrong with the scenario you're probably wondering. Well, can you tell me who had the idea to let people stand a few meters or even a few feet away from lava without getting burned or hiding for health? Or people who sink into the earth when the lava does not reach two feet high? <br /> <br /> I'm sure I would not be proud if I wrote such a screenplay, but apparently in Hollywood, writers worry about credibility as long as they make a lot of money! VERY good money !!! <br /> <br /> When you see the movie, you'll probably agree with me that it's one of Hollywood's worst disaster movies, it's not worth more than 3 / 10.
