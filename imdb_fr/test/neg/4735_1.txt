If you are a fan of one of two original franchises (Aliens & Predator ... duh ... and even if you liked or did not like the AVP movie in 06), you will hate this movie. Countless intrigues, pungent and incredible human characters, terrific special effects and even worse staging and fighting scenes make this movie one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLIER *** One of the hundred huge holes included the Pred / Alien hybrid from chest to total chest in seconds (he takes off during a killing on board the Predator ship and cleans a Preds ship even before the ship breaks the Earth) orbit.) AS IF. In the first AvP, we saw a Sr. Pred fighter ship landing three young hunters participating in a "earn a living" hunting party, and then seeing them pick up the miner's "honored body" that remained at the end of the film. Are we supposed to believe that the single-breasted hybrid killed all of these Sr. Hunters even before the ship broke into orbit? In addition, (and it was an extremely inexpensive production value on the director / producer's parts), jars and jars of agrossers magically appeared aboard the ship Pred, even though the temple complex and Queen Alien were destroyed in the movie AvP. These huge faces end up playing an uneven role in the movie ... of course. And how about all those big guys who become big aliens in a few days? What joke. Although there have been many more holes in the plot, I do not think IMB would appreciate that I fill their servers by writing them here. <br /> <br /> On the fluffy and incredible characters, well, where should I go boys and girls? Where to begin ... almost all this nonsense are clich√©s of people from other movies or TV series. The bad boy from the city who left to avoid jail but who comes just the day when everything is going to save the day ??? Where did I see that? Oh yes, last season on JERICHO !!! Then there's the town sheriff in his twenties (a former troublemaker himself) who was one of the cleverest friends. Where did we see that? Ah yes, JERICHO and Walking Tall! Then there is the generic soldier (WITHOUT RANK) returning from a generic war front that does not meet as a long-lost loved one and a hero at the airport or at the bus station, but at his own door by his daughter and her husband. . And who is this soldier? What did she do in the Army / Air Force / Marines / Navy / Coast Guard? We do not know because the film never tells us. But ... dunh, dunh, dunh ... she was a kind of soldier / aviator / Marine / sailor / sailor who knows how to drive a Stryker Infantry vehicle and ... as if by magic ... A HELICOPTER !!! This character is just a generic copy of every member of the "coming home" service ... except that she brings her daughter a pair of night vision goggles that cost SEVERAL Hundreds of dollars. These are things that soldiers must sign and do not just "bring home". UGH! <br /> <br /> Special effects and fight scenes are the furthest away from me. These are the things I liked the most in the first movie ... watch Preds and Aliens go! However, the way this was filmed showed that the action sequences were so dark and filmed so close that you could not know what was going on. You could not see who was doing what and what was going on while they were arguing. All in all, these hundreds of items will kill this franchise and this business. Nobody will worry anymore about seeing his favorite sci-fi movie monsters, and can only guess that the series will come down from here, as producers will not like to spend millions of extra dollars for a sequel.
