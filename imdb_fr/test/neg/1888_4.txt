This is proof that filmmakers and their financiers who treat their audience with contempt are not a new phenomenon, as it was the case in the 1940s and that House of Dracula is a good example. You might think that a film with Dracula, the werewolf and the Frankenstein monster, dictated by the producer, would dictate to the screenwriter to make all three appear in a scene. They had a chance with HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN then, when they had a second bite of the cherry, they blew it again with HOUSE OF Dracula. Losing a chance is a misfortune, losing two hints of cynical money making money <br /> <br /> It is obvious that producers are beyond solicitude. Larry Talbot reappears when he was shown to die in the previous movie, which sums up the cynicism of the franchise. It also shows how poor the scenario is and we are mistreated in terrible scenarios, as if Talbot's condition was cured by a particular type of plant that would soften his skull. I think the screenwriter Edward T Lowe might have softened his skull if it's the kind of thing he finds with the director <br /> <br /> Director Erie C Kenton can not improve the script and adds some keys of his own. For example, Talbot is surprised to see Dr. Edelmann seize an elevator on a cart, but casually watches Edelmann climb onto a wall and jump into the courtyard of the castle. One can not help thinking that Talbot's reaction plans were incorrectly reversed during the editing phase <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney Jnr is famous for his roles in horror films but did not have a lot of career outside of them. Maybe it's due to the fact that he's not a good actor and he's doing the worst type of acting here: being very wooden. This is not entirely his fault, however, because all the characters interact with a horrible tone and are rather in wood, partly because of the sad staging of Kenton. <br /> <br /> from 1935 and would have been a very sad note to complete. Ironically, Universal decided to shoot another film to end their film with a horror comedy starring Abbot and Costello.
