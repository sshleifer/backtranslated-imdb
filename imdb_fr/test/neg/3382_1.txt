Okay, so when one of my friends told me he was supposed to lead MM2 and MM3, I thought, uh, I need to go see Monster Man and see what it looks like, maybe I could have a role in it, but when I jumped It was inserted in my DVD player and I tried to smother the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad, bad I mean a bad comedy horribly annoying that big ass thinking that it was funny, not to mention the looooong that the director spent on this useless trip to the desert, I came to the conclusion that these guys did not have a clue what they were doing and had missed the boat from afar. The story had the potential to be somewhat different from the usual BS you see on the Blockbuster / Hollywood Video set up for sale by Lions Gate these days, but they have certainly ruined this one. Why spend so much time and effort filming bad acts and bad jokes, why not shorten the trip and add more intrigue to the movie. Myabe, the writing was so bad that we had to cut a big part of the film or maybe the director did not sufficiently film the horror and the gore, that it was necessary to find the filler to make the 84 usual minutes ???? All in all, and I'm easy here, maybe because one of my friends is the bald redneck of the bar scene who gets his crushed skull when he pursues the three men in the street, I'll give him the minus a star try, and the gore / kill scenes were not so bad, again, they tried. Too bad, Lions Gate could have created a new franchise from this idea, but without success. I do not recommend paying to rent it, you may be able to find a lite version of the movie from the hiker's stage. SHIT!
