I really tried to like this series, but I can not find any reason for anyone to like it. The scenarios are weak, the acting is weak and incredible. Each member of the cast appears to have been randomly selected from the street. And it seems to me that the whole series is just a way for Jamie Lynn Spears to go to the movies. Each episode shows Zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to go out with her. She is always perfect and no one is like that in real life. How can people understand a character who is only a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's role is right but she is not strong enough to play the lead role in a series. All fans of the series are just girls who do not know better. I'm sorry if you think my comments are too harsh, but if you can find a meaningful and profound moment in this series that is not heading quickly to a beach party - accept my opinions and find something interesting to watch.
