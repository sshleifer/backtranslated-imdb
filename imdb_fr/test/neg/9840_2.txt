"Nicodemus" is almost a copy of "Red" in the strange sense of the behaviors, but this episode focuses on other people in Clark Kent's unpredictable life. When a poisoned flower arrives in Smallville, Jonathan Kent is the first to suffer the effects. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it affects Jonathan, he becomes angry and violent. However, Clark manages to stop him from doing reckless things until his father finally faints. Okay. so far, so good. The next step is Lana. the episode was good so far, because the flower pushes her to try to seduce Clark. at the last moment, he refuses but the damage is already done. This episode causes false impressions and is not suitable for people under 20 due to its adult content. the first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect of the flower on Pete) was good, but the middle part that spoke about the alternative personality of Lana was not very provocative and it ruined what would have could be a brilliant episode. I give this episode two.
