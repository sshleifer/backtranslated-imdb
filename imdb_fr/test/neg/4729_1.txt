Against my best judgment, I saw this movie today, and god I would not like it. Terrible. The first AvP movie looks like a classic compared to that, it's SO bad. These guys actually make Paul WS Anderson look like a master storyteller. In fact, here is what an Alien and / or Predator movie would look like if it had been shot by Uwe Boll! In fact, this film offended me and Lord does not know what would happen if Ridley Scott or HR Giger were forced to watch this piece of shit. I do not understand how a fan of one or the other franchise could like this movie. <br /> <br /> In truth, I do not know where to begin. I mean, the first AvP was a shit, but at least a semi-interesting story and decor, and sometimes real tension. It was not taken too seriously and we could at least half enjoy it on a purely "leave your brain at home" basis. But this one, it seemed to me that the people who were behind thought to make the next masterpiece of horror. One after the other, a suspenseful artificial scene in a dark room or a corridor with scary music hit you in the head saying "be afraid now". As James Cameron said, we can not tell you to be afraid, you can only have your own senses. The guys who made this movie were obviously not paying attention, because they tried everything in the book to force you to be afraid rather than letting yourself reach that level. It's a clich√© for the nerds of the internet to say "My God, I was so bored of this movie and I wanted to leave", well that's exactly how I felt, even in the middle of action scenes. They took this film very seriously, which eliminated any possibility of enjoyment. Even the gag on the fact that governments do not lie to their people was played without irony. <br /> <br /> Regarding the characters, I knew that the human characters would be completely useless. filming but seriously if they are going to be on the screen, ask them at least something relevant to the story. I do not care about this guy being beaten by the boyfriend of his dream girl, I do not care about the mother who "her own daughter does not even know it, hey!" (a pair of night vision goggles for a gift? Give me a break!) or the liberated criminal who is just trying to make a good living and give the example to his brother, what a guy. Hell, even the obligatory moment of chick-in-panties was more artificial than usual. I have the impression that they expect the public to be so shocked by the end, and to see the children with the breasts overwhelmed, the pregnant women raped, etc., that that would make up for everything. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Then we go to the stars of the film and, again, we have very little to tell. The extraterrestrials were they well designed? I would not have a clue because you can never see these damn things. All you see is a really fishy mouth, head, tail, or outline that climbs up a wall, and barely enough to pretend that it's actually an alien before Mr. "I cut the video clips of Marilyn Manson and NIN, think I'm going to do the same thing here "The editor-in-chief goes for the slice tool. You'll also notice how action directors always tweak their movies at night and in the rain? Hmmmm. The Predator could have fought giant sea monkeys for all we knew! Yes, the Predator was more impressive this time and I thought some of the new weapons were cool, but that was about it. Also, since when does a Predator sound like a dinosaur from The Lost World? There were a few things that I liked a bit. One of them was the use of sound effects and music from the original movies (I also giggled a bit at "Get to the chopper!"), Although other references were stupid (the name of the main character being Dallas, give me a break). I also liked the visual effect of the predator's vision, as well as the appearance of the hybrid extraterrestrial (certainly superior to that of Resurrection). But in reality, these are the only positive things. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this film insane, useless, insulting and especially offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures. The fact that they left the door open for another day leaves me almost depressed. <br /> <br /> If they have any modesty, they will remove Dan O'Bannon, Ron Schusett and HR Giger from the credits of this movie. They did not do anything to deserve that.
