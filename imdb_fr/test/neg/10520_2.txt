A blatant scam of "Air Bud", this movie REALLY talks about parents too worried about parenting. All the weaknesses of the characters (for example, adult coaches who do not know the game) are taken to the extreme, so much so that they are totally incredible and are not funny. <br /> <br /> There is no semblance of reality here, friends, and you will not develop sympathy for NONE characters. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the beauty of the opposing team's (uniform) kits in the first game played by the dog. Perhaps chosen because the executive is expected to be near Arlington Heights, IL, home of Columbus Crew franchise player Brian McBride.
