I think Walter Pidgeon was very badly caught in this movie. Simply not credible in the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful and did a good job. No one else was memorable. <br /> <br /> I remember the television series derived from this movie when I was little. I even thought I had a plastic "Seaview" that would be submerged and was perfect for playing in the tub. Long ago. <br /> <br /> Regarding some of the criticisms I've read for this film: it's totally unfair to judge special effects or scientific knowledge from 4 decades ago by the yardstick current standards. The effects were OK for 1961. Not great, but OK. As for science, it was ridiculous even for 1961. There is no excuse. In addition, the submarine was terribly spacious. I understand that the navy has refused any help for this film, so perhaps the filmmakers have no idea. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie bores me. (And I'm a science fiction fan.) I can not recommend this one. Grade: D-
