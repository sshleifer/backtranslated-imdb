It is disturbing to see so many people award an outrageously high score to this movie. Some praise uses such twisted reasoning (and transparent agendas that betray a mere love of all that is in no way critical of the United States) that it addresses hysteria. <br /> <br /> Heaven's Gate is a bad movie, it's basically horrible. Endless scenes using elaborate plans that are useless, a muddy dialogue, a creepy narrative, no sense of any theme apart from excess ... <br /> <br /> The high score of this disaster is the product of revisionist history and temporary changes in perception. <br /> <br /> For some, watch Lawrence of Arabia before watching Heaven's Gate. You will see how this film is aimless and lost. The "problems" that he may have tried to solve are lost in a miasma. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with movies that are critical of the United States per se, but when a terrible movie receives such undeserved praise. only because of this element ... it is worth challenging. <br /> <br /> The film is worth the trip for two reasons; curiosity and edifying story for young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I saw it free at home, imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting through it ... for 4 hours!
