This movie is just another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, forced drama of the United States. The characters were all very weak, especially Goya, the unconscious, and the misinterpretation of Bardem, which only went in his classical interpretation, acting as a French ally. <br /> <br /> Just another chance lost to having spent money in a good movie. I guess it was not a low budget movie. Certainly not recommended. Maybe the director should ask if the film makes sense or not before wasting that money. Maybe they do not bother because they have profits before launching them to the movies. <br /> <br /> More hope in the cinema ...
