I do not mind the suites; sometimes they are better than the original. However, it is often best to leave original originals ... especially when you can not duplicate the distribution. One of the big reasons why "The Seven Magnificent" was so successful was the very popular cast. <br /> <br /> It's just the "Seven Beautiful", when only Yul Brynner is back among the members of this famous band in "The Seven Magnificent". With six of the seven guys missing and replaced by much less well-known actors, this quickly loses its appeal. In other words, with the exception of Brynner, these guys have no charisma! This looks like a championship sports team lining up all but one substitute. <br /> <br /> Brynner is good, again: fun to watch, fun to hear with his distinct voice, but the story, not just the rest of the crew is lame. This film should never have been done. In the original, we were concerned about the "seven;" here, we do not care.
