First, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director of all time, nor is Plan 9 Outer Space. Coleman Francis deserves this title. I present B, Glen or Glenda. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film consists of a surprisingly thoughtful exploration of cross-dressing, especially since it was made in 1953. The last 15 minutes of the film are also not so bad. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the film has no problems. Bela Lugosi was totally foreign to the intonation of odd lines. Poor Bela looked even though he was not sure what was happening sometimes. The acting was clearly wood, but not worse than a Universal B movie. The long sequence of dreams that made up the middle of the movie was totally bizarre. looks more like a deer-threatening stag movie than a dream sequence. The story of Alan / Ann, the original presumed object of the film, focuses on quality. <br /> <br /> No, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director of all time. He was able, at least for part of this film, to make a serious social statement. When Coleman Francis tried to do this in Night Train To Mundo Fine (aka Red Zone Cuba), it ended in chaos. Glen or Glenda is at least visible without Robot's help.
