Is there any reason to revive the characters 10 years after the fact when the only reason they were working for the first time was due to the actors who play them? <br /> <br /> Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz - or better still, who can replace them at great prices since most studios know that the suites do not bring the same turnover as original, so they are economical from the start. <br /> <br /> Where are the good movies going to play if powerful Hollywood studios can clutter up to 3,000 movie theaters on opening weekends with all the public can think of being carried away by the general public . <br /> <br /> Enough, enough people, this sequel must stop and the Hollywood people must begin to organize or distribute the much better foreign product that floats in limbo. <br /> <br /> Wake Hollywood, make sure people have woken up and do not buy it. just because it's new and brilliant. Give us the good things and send the rest in the shelves of the DVD, because we take the theaters once and for all !!!
