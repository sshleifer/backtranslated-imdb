Only in the world of audiovisual fiction in Hollywood can anyone, including FBI agents, be incredibly stupid. The good guys are stupid enough to take anything they are interested in, answer the phone, climb the stairs, all looking for a demolition expert looking for everyone. Oh yes, and then we get the Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN. He can be shot, even if he wears a vest, then collapse and then take over his stupid pursuers. All snapshots you can think of in the pending movies have been used. I only watched it because Yuki Amami is so HOT. Oh ,,,, but yes, it's good to see how much this FBI agent is morally superior, when she's pretty sure there's a bomb in an opera and it does not ring. 'alarm. Who writes these scripts ????????????
