This movie was totally tripette. Possible that it is actually a pollution. The subtle and tense atmosphere of the original remake is not to be seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar has nothing to do, even in her death row, but she remains the best performance of this movie, and her death is the best, even if she deserved a better death. This is the sign of a very bad writing and staging. I imagine she made this film to end her relationship with this film that runs. <br /> <br /> It's not scary. Not tight. Not funny. It really does not make sense. And as said above, Sarah Michelle Gellar gives the only reasonable performance of the entire cast.
