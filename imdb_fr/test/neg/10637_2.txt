When I first saw this movie at the cinema, I was so angry. This completely exploded in my opinion. I did not see it for a decade, then I decided what the heck, let's see. I watch all the movies from hell now to see where it went wrong. I guess it's with the sequel 5 that it's the first to implement it all "I'm in a dream, I see weird stuff, oh no what's going on, oh it's a dream, oh it's is not a dream, oh wait I see something spooky, oh it does not matter "These suites do not even require the opening of the box, or do not respect the rules of the first 4 films: if you saw a head of pin, you are pretty much completely fucked up and dead. The first 3 hellraisers stuck to this plot, which made it so scary at first. Nothing fantastic, nothing weird, the box opened when they came. Kirstey was the only one able to get out, first because of her uncle Frank. Then, because she had information on cenobites. This film at least tries to stick to all that, even if it was a bad story, it was still a little hell. No, I'm pretty sure Part 5 was the first to completely and totally destroy the Hellraiser series. Now, they do it again, and I do not even think I'm going to watch it. Oh, I'm kidding and I'll probably be disappointed ... again.
