After watching this movie, I did not want to get my money back. I wanted to recover my time. I wanted that hour and a half back in my life - it was the most astonishing and hideous torture to know that I had wasted precious minutes of my life on this mess. I am scarred for life, and since this "movie" has come into my life, I have trouble sleeping. I try to suppress the memories, really I am. . . but they make me want to burn things. <br /> <br />
