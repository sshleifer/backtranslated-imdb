First of all, I do not know if I was supposed to use my imagination in this film or if the director was trying to save money or a reduced budget! We're going .... <br /> <br /> Basically, there were so many years and gaps that I do not understand, it's as if the film jumped from 9 to 20 years to 30 years and so many gaps that make you ask questions how the hell did this happen? and why? I think it's a big flow. Forget the critics who are constantly complaining about the story, this film is not only history problems, it also has a lot of flaws. So, most people do not stop saying that watching movies, you will lose all cinematography, like rivers, deserts, etc. It is true that they are beautiful, that's why I waited for the release of BluRay 1080p. OKAY! beautiful scenes but what is the point of this? I turned off the movie after 1 hour and a half, I just lost interest. The movie continued to do exactly the same things by jumping for years (At least, Mr. Director put for example, after 2 years after 10 years!) I mean I could not watch the movie, I lost the understanding of what is happening! Anyway, I wish I could include spoilers, but when you decide to watch this movie, just ask yourself how did it happen? you will know what I mean! Do not watch this movie, it's a waste of time.
