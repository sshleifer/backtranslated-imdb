I saw this movie on a Saturday morning with a friend. The theater was about 70% full. <br /> <br /> Although there are some fun lines, it's more of a drama / suspense with a sprinkled humor. Robin Williams gives a decent performance, just like Laura Linney. As a fan of the Daily Show, Lewis Black is very good at this. Christopher Walken also gives a good performance. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly and the rest about thirty minutes, then the suspense sets in and starts to keep you a little nervous throughout the film. Suspense in a so-called comic film? I know that myself, like everyone else, was struggling a bit with that. A character was making a joke during the suspense sequence and you only heard one or two laughs at the theater. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, after filming the film, some applause took place. So, certainly, some people have enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I attributed to this film four out of ten, because I believe that the comic aspect does not work very well in a suspense / drama film and in the performances of the actors. , although not bad, were just decent. <br /> <br /> Again, this film is not what was announced.
