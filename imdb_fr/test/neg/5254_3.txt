We have shown this film in a club to show how much of classical literature can be turned into one of the most terrible films of all time. The mere fact that the bottom of the box proudly proclaimed that the plot would unfold in a "techno-futile" future should have been enough. I think this word describes the movie itself, because it did not matter what technology was used to save the movie, the effort was completely futile. Not to mention the fact that our club advisor told us he could not find a distributor for two years. <br /> <br /> This cinematic failure is littered with nerdy cliche dialogues that are worse than anxious teenage poetry. Beowulf's character changes mid-way in a way that is by no means credible, and every time he's in an action scene, he constantly turns around like a hyper gymnast. There is even, as they say, a "symbolic black" whose attempts at humor are completely misplaced. And, of course, the daughter of the Grendel outpost leader terrorizes is a total vixen. A fox whose breasts are exposed throughout the film. A fox who wants to fight the creature, but she never wears armor. And his favorite weapon is a small carving knife. And despite their desperate situation, she always dresses for dinner, in a dress with a transparent skirt that exposes her short underwear. There are some scenes that could be considered as basic pornography, and in the second scene, they even reuse pictures of the first. I thought Grendel's performance was bad enough, but then came the end of the film, which featured a CGI show that could be decent for the '80s, but totally ridiculous for a late-90s business. could continue, but you should all watch this movie for a totally laughable effect. <br /> <br /> The other members of the club and I managed to have fun watching this by taking inspiration from MST 3K and making fun of him. all along. I'm still shocked by the weapon of an extra: a perpetually rotating pizza cutter on a pole.
