Rocketship X-M should be viewed by serious moviegoers for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is one of the first - and rare - movies not to end up happy. The effect was probably deeper in America after the Second World War than today, but the sad end adds to the film's message. <br /> <br /> 2) It is also one of the first films to deal with space travel in a serious way, using space as a valuable framework for the theater. Despite the lack of scientific knowledge, the film alone is a spectacular prize. It is not so much a spatial drama as it is a drama unfolding in space. <br /> <br /> 3) The message of the antinuclear war is delivered in a serious way that is not lost in SFX involving large grasshoppers, humans, or animals. The effect of the Martian society on nuclear devastation is presented frankly and frankly. The fact that the survivors of the crash explosion land and, as such, are unable to preach the lesson learned on Mars adds an element of sadness to the tragic end. <br /> <br /> Sterno says to take a ride in Rocketship X-M.
