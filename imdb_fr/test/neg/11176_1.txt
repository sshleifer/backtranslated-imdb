I admit that Charlotte Lewis's provocative images of this movie fascinated me, as well as a commentary on IMDb's dedicated bulletin board, describing this picture as a "great underrated movie". And so, I had, with great difficulty, my own copy of "Dial Help". <br /> <br /> What a mess. <br /> <br /> Nothing but a bloody, bloody movie made cheaply with ridiculous premise that I will not even repeat, with several telegraphed sequences (for example, when we see Lewis feeding his fish with love, we immediately know what will happen to them later). Not even Lewis, with his beautiful raven hair, big bright brown eyes, fleshy, puffy lips and breathtaking silhouette, can not save this movie. Lewis fans would be better off with "Bare Essentials", "Sketch Artist" or even "Golden Child".
