First, I will give this movie a low score of 4 out of 10! It was nothing more than a dream movie. I felt very disappointed to watch this movie. I was led to tell people that there would be more drama and more facts about the real story on which it is based. Instead, I spent more than an hour looking at the average age breaking the law and drugging myself. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like a football factory, but with no real scenario and no good end. After watching the movie, I wondered, "What was this movie about?" If you like movies without a real storyline, who take a lot of drugs and swear, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> I'm a GREAT fan of movies for the mafia and gangsters, but this movie did not measure up. to the hype. I can see where the author was trying to go with the film but it never reached its destination. One of the worst British movies I have ever seen. If only the film had more than one script, it would make an excellent movie.
