I am a big fan of Shirley Temple. When I saw this film, it made me understand what a talented child is, Shirley. Ashley Rose Orr probably did the worst Shirley on screen. Imagine an 11-year-old playing at Shirley Temple from the age of 5. This is in itself a mistake. But bring her to imitate Shirley's voice? And his song is sad. The dance was good, I'll say that. As previous users have said, there were few dramatic scenes, nothing made the story interesting. Not even Amelia Earhart ... I would have liked to see more of the global phenomenon created by Shirley Temple. There was too much concentration on the Wizard of Oz, when in reality, Shirley was just considered for Dorothy. The film describes it as if it was the end of the world when it does not get the role. Shirley herself said she was happy that Judy Garland could play it. For me, the star of the show was the lady who played Gertrude Temple. Otherwise, stay away! For the great Shirley Temple films, watch Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.
