What could be wrong with a film that includes a group of Italians pretending to be Flordians and a vague thing-octopus-crustacean washing as devil-devil-fish-of-the-hell ? !!!!!!! /> Everything is wrong, I tell you! <br /> <br /> This is a very good episode of MST3K because the heckling is real, which without fail is easy to do since this film is a piece of junk with a lousy plot and boring. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for the MSTied version. 1/10 for the non-MSTied version. <br /> <br />
