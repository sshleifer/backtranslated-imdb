It's one of the stupidest movies of all time, not the most stupid mind, but one of the most stupid. This represents 96 1/2 minutes of sleep. Probably the worst film of Jim Varney. The last 30 seconds of the movie are the best and the funniest, but are not worth going through the whole movie. On the other hand, if you are an unconditional fan of Jim Varney / Ernest, then like me, you have to add this movie to your collection. There are brief and rare moments of humor, even if they are rare. The simple fact that this movie is so difficult to find makes it a collector's item and an indispensable asset for your ernest collection. I was lucky to find this movie online at a very good price a few years ago. I think I paid $ 1.99 plus shipping for that. And it was the only copy I could find anywhere. Even if it's a horrible film, it's always a must if you're a fan of Jim Varney and an Ernest film collector such as I. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film a 2 but it's only because I've never seen a 1 before;)
