The subspecies takes place in Romania, where two American students, Michele (Laura Mae Tate) and Lillian (Michelle McBride), study local folklore with the help of local friend Mara (Irina Movila). There, they rent rooms in a hotel and become curious mysterious ruins of a neighboring castle. It turns out that a powerful and evil vampire named Radu (Anders Hove) lives there and stole the bloodstone from his father, King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm). . Radu loves the three girls and starts drinking the blood of Mara & Lillian, meanwhile, Michele cracks for a guy named Stefan (Michael Watson) who happens to be Radu's brother. Michele and Stefan decide to team up to rid the world of evil Radu ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Ted Nicolaou, this movie seems to be very popular with genre fans and as long as it's not terrible , I will not do it. I did not call it that much, and I really could not see much enthusiasm. Subspecies is a rather slow film, not many things happen and even if it tries to stay close to some classic Vampire traditions, there's all this nonsense about a Bloodstone and some little monsters that grow the fingertips cut off Radu for some reason. The subspecies could have been a decent film, without the fact that it's dull, I do not really remember, good or bad. The character is fine, but some dialogues are stupid and there is a scene that bothered me at the beginning when the girls are at the ruins of the castle. They say they have to leave because it's getting dark but it's still clearly in the middle of the day. very clever. There is also a scene where one of the American girls finds a coffin in the attic of this hotel and does not seem so bothered by it. I'm not funny, but a guy whose house I stayed in had a coffin in his attic is very very worried if you know what I mean. I do not think I would ever want to look at it again, there is no real threat, the plot is weak that mixes classic vampire themes with stupid side intrigues and I am clearly insensitive to all of this. Not the worst movie of all time, but hardly the best either. <br /> <br /> The film looks good with beautiful places and local landscapes although you feel that the budget is small rather than looking for authenticity. There is not much gore apart from decapitation and a few broken fingertips. For no apparent reason, producers offer mid-sized stop-motion animated monsters that really do not do anything or that matter a lot to history. <br /> <br /> Filmed inexpensively by Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment production in Bucharest, Romania, the production values ​​are right and better than many of the group's productions later on. The acting is not great with a lot of actors performing below average performance while Angus Scrimm, usual, has a small cameo at the beginning. There is sometimes a little style here, with some scenes reminiscent of the original Nosferatu (1922), especially the piece showing the shadow of Radu coming down the stairs with his long claw that comes off. <br /> <br /> Subspecies is a film that seems to please many people for reasons that I do not see very well. I thought it was really average at best and rather boring. Bloodstone Tracking: Subspecies II (1993), Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994), Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998) & the spin-off film Vampire Journals (1997).
