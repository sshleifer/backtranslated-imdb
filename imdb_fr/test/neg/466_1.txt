I was really hoping to see that, because I still appreciated Paul Bettany's performances. I thought he was very good as Darwin and was doing his best given the terrible documents he had to work with. <br /> <br /> Darwin's book, The Origin of Species, was one of the most innovative, controversial and innovative. publications never, and yet you would never think it was based on this tedious film. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting. For example, Darwin's five-year trip to the Galapagos Islands is of almost no major importance, since it is from his wildlife research that he began to elaborate his theory of evolution. . It is only a long and dark domestic drama, where Darwin is portrayed as a somewhat spirited eccentric, seeing everywhere the vision of his dead daughter and receiving the cold shoulder of his emotionally constipated wife. The portrait of Emma Darwin by Jennifer Connelly is quite horrible and has little relation to the historical descriptions of the real Emma. There could have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth, emanating from Emma or the region's priest, played by Jeremy Northam (part of the missing wink talented actor) to counterbalance to Darwin's ideas, but this has not been taken up. <br /> <br /> The story was too centered on the endless cursed feeling that Darwin was feeling sorry for his daughter Annie, and too much time had been lost for Darwin to wonder whether or not to write his book. Finally, I was so bored that it was difficult to deal with it. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a bit like making a film about Picasso and spending two hours focusing on the fact that he was fighting with his girlfriend and did not care to say that he was an artist.
