I was so impressed by Tim Kincaid's MUTANT HUNT that I tried this one. It's the near future, post apocalypse of course. A nomadic fighter Neo (no, not only Neo!) Joins a group of similar-looking fighters to challenge The Dark One and his subordinate Valaria. Along the way, they meet mutants, crazy females, sewer worms, a big spider leg and clumsy robots. Oh my! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is not up to (or down) the level of HUNT. Penetrating into a painful 79 minutes (the box says 90), this is a cheap movie. The sets all have the elaborate design of a haunted carnival house and the costumes prove that in the near future, everyone will dress like John Travolta in the final dance number of STAYING ALIVE. The atomic wasteland is a combination of old buildings filled with rubble and Central Park. The headquarters of Dark One is named The Power Station and looks like a power station. The acting is universally bad except for Angelika Jager in the role of the wicked Valaria. Jager is a whole other level of bad. Very dear Cherman Acczent, she gives a performance so incredibly bad that she becomes the only reason to recommend this movie. She also delivers the only nudity of the film in the "pleasure room" section of the film. Ed French is supplying robot effects again, but they are not as elastic as his work in MUTANT HUNT.
