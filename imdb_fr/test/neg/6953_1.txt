The emergence of Quentin Tarantino and his dubious influence on characters such as Guy Ritchie may have triggered the wave of scary British gangster movies that we have bequeathed in recent years, but one of our most famous exports of actors only serves to perpetuate the cycle by lending its considerable name to the trash like that. I only wish he took a moment to think before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal gain that he admits he often uses. It stifles not only his talent, but perhaps the promise of future originality of British films. <br /> <br /> None of the characters in this film are friendly or even very realistic, and the dialogue consists of usual empty threats and colorful language. Caine does not put more effort into the material than he deserves. If it had been designed to look like a tragic fall of King Lear, it would have helped me a lot if I had worried about the ultimate fate of the directors, instead of just wishing they were bogged down. the quicksand of life and trained almost immediately. <br /> <br />
