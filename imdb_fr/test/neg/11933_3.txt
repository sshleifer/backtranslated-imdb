The series finally hits the bottom with this fourth ugly installment, which was (thank goodness) the last. None of the three sequels have done justice to the entertaining original, but this film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name "Magnificent Seven" and the catchy musical theme of Bernstein. The production values ​​resemble those of a televised film and the characters are undeniable and indistinguishable: in parts "II" and "III", you can not remember their names, you can not even remember their faces. Lee Van Cleef was an inappropriate choice for Chris's role, but no one could have replaced Yul Brynner in our mind anyway. Do not waste your time.
