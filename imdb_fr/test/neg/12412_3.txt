Ah, another movie with motorbikes, hell of angels and Steve A-Blade-o as a car driver not too cool. This film is not based on stories, but on many things to drink, pot smoking and many stupid acts. Steve's portrayal of a dying cat during his serenade "I love what I know" made me throw up for hours. Linda (rrrr) rides a bike with everyone! Fats did the best acting because he just grunted and made sounds. I also challenge you to try to understand what Banjo says. "You're screwing up with private actions." These are people who write scripts. <br /> <br /> I loved the end. What better place to have the highlight than a lighthouse! You must see this to hate it. <br /> <br /> DIE Throw, DIE !!!
