Really, the average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see that. <br /> <br /> The acting was average (maybe a little above average), camera use was average (actually below average) The picture was so unstable and the colors were granular and fuzzy.) The plot was good but moved so slowly and was not used. <br /> <br /> It could have been more if it did not work with turtle and we saw more in the background of the characters. <br /> <br /> We only see flashbacks here and there of Alice and the "bad" life in her house (her mother is a working-class woman trying to find herself for her and her girl.) We see a flashback from her when she was in high school and her friend tells her "tell your mother to make better meals" and "everyone says it's your mother." Yeah that's embarrassing but why would you want to escape? <br /> <br /> I could see for sure if her mother was drunk or someone was mistreating her, but nothing was wrong with her except she was embarrassed. Like immature! <br /> <br /> We do not even get a glimpse of the couple's life (except that they have been prostituting for a while and the woman, who has forgotten her name, abandoned her baby at age age 9.) It could have been so much more. Alice was reportedly abused by her drunk mother and went to Florida with her friend to become a prostitute. Or something like this other than the real plot of this film (ie) Alice, a girl whose home life probably affects 90% of the US population (WORKING CLASS) fleeing in Florida, then being distanced by turning into a prostitute. . <br /> <br /> I do not see why he won an award at Sundance (he had to face a really weak competition for winning this award.) <br /> <br /> Also For me, the Alice's accent in Boston / New England seemed forced. It did not seem authentic. (I should know, I was born and raised in Boston, but now I live in Georgia.) Not really worth your time, in my opinion.
