Where can I start with the mess that is Darkhunters? First, the screenplay is one of the worst ever on a movie or television screen and can only be described as a poorly judged Stephen King scam. At one point, the so-called dreaded dark hunter, Jack, claims that Carol, the girl who helps the man he is pursuing, is as annoying as a "pickle in a hamburger". I laugh if I did it - BUT I AM NOT! The fact that Carol originally had the power to see how people die is just as ridiculous. A cat gave it to her while she was holding him in a car accident that she had as a child. WHAT ???????? <br /> <br /> Secondly, for a horror movie, it makes no sense of tension or threat. This may not be helped by the fact that all the action takes place during the day in broad daylight. Not very atmospheric at all. <br /> <br /> Third, the acting is really awful, Pinion proves once again that he needs to speak in his mother tongue to be even more credible. Jeff Fahey is obviously autopilot, but how can he blame him for being a bad imitation of Humphry Bogart under the pseudonym Barlow (Marlowe-Barlow? We understand the joke, it's just not funny). The credit goes to Susan Paterno, an actress I was not aware of, she does her best with the dreadful role she has and shames other more experienced actors. <br /> <br /> explained how the human character can understand what Van Husen's character tells him. She obviously has a degree in crazy extraterrestrial languages. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, a moment is well done, the car accident involving Susan. The SFX are quite believable and if they had not had this ridiculous story, they would have been applauded. <br /> <br /> All I can say about darkhunters is that the British horror will never recover from its endless Collapse if films like this one continue to be made and shown. Avoid this movie as the plague, even if the plague would be much more frightening. <br /> <br /> Darkhunters 0/5 <br /> <br /> p.s. insinuations in other critics that the film remains too clever for some are honestly hilarious. It is a weak defense when some claim that "you did not like it because you did not understand it". The letters after my name ridicule me, not me.
