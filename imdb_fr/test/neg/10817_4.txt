Some scientists go to a cave for some reason and some kind of creature kills them. <br /> <br /> I usually present a more detailed scenario, but I did not pay much attention to it. All in all, it was boring and the only time you will be really attentive is during the action scenes, on which the director did a fantastic job. <br /> <br /> The acting is ok, but the characters are so boring and forgettable they blend into your mind. You will forget who lived and who died for two reasons: 1. The murders are boring 2. The characters are boring. <br /> <br /> The end might have been more shocking if I knew who was who. <Br /> <br /> Are you looking for a movie of creatures in the cave? Check out The Descent instead.
