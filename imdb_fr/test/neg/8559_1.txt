I spent the last 5 years in the entertainment industry and just recently, I found myself working for the company that made this film, which is a real shame because I love these people, I can not just do not believe that someone can do something so serious. like that? !!!! It was shit from every possible angle. From camera work to dialogue to role play, costumes, and production design, it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The actors in this film seemed to have been removed from a porn film shot in the San Fernando Valley and staged with an even less talented team. <br /> <br /> I simply can not. forget about the fact that I'm sitting on some of the best documents I've ever read and contacts in the industry that could help me make my dream a reality and have overcome all possible obstacles? However, the spectators of this movie show have no problem mounting it and sleep well after its release. <br /> <br /> Life, what a trip!
