AALCC informs us that 14-year-olds can be quite odious and vicious. For those who do not know, the film offers a public service. Otherwise, it's a lot of flashy videography with little or no reason to be. I will admit that the work of the camera is sometimes striking, but that it can also be madly complacent at other times. Actors occupy space and screen time, but do not consider themselves convincing human beings. I suppose the email that appears on the screen means you have to figure out which character has what nickname, but I just could not make enough difference to do it, and anyway, he did not care.
