The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man qualifies the film as comic. It's not really a comedy, but rather a dull independent film about a group of losers. Supposedly located in the 70s, little attention is paid to the details of the period, a discreet color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film (this may be the goal, but it does not add to the pleasure of watching movies.) The loser clique obviously likes to cross one place, bleachers. It seems that the packaging of the film as a comedy is intended to deceive people by asking them to rent or buy this film, which is a waste of time.
