"Graduation Day" - <br /> <br /> I bought this movie last week and I waited for a while to relax and watch some "good" gems from the 80s, I had this and "Xtro" look, never seen any of them. I just watched it and realized that my outdoor speakers were on too. I only imagine what my neighbors thought when "Felony" came to sing their 10-minute hit? I'm sure it was noisy and they thought I was weird, with that and the chainsaw is ringing and screaming for other movies. <br /> <br /> it was a nice movie under slasher, no suspense, no story, nice deaths, almost seemed amateurish, I usually like movies like this, but it's not did not click with me, now I'm going to watch "Xtro" for the first time and have a margarita! /> <br /> DJ Eric Austin TX
