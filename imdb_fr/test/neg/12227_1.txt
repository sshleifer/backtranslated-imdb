We arrived at the theater too late to see Rendition, which was our intention, and "The Comebacks" was the only movie that had not yet started. I had a little idea of ​​the quality of a movie after reading the short text at the counter. The theater was empty when we arrived and only two people came in before the movie started. <br /> <br /> The writers and directors have cast every imaginable sporting cliché on the audience without causing a single laugh, not a single one during the film. . Think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars that schools and fans spend every year on football and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or crazy. If you add Texas to the mix, you should offer the sporting version of "Little Miss Sunshine", not a big yawn. <br /> <br /> The first film that came to our mind when we left the theater was "Impossible to stop the music" In comparison, it was "Impossible to stop the music" without Bruce Jenner, Valerie Perrine or the people of the village. <br /> <br /> If the film had a thank you note, it was to see Matthew Lawrence grow up.
