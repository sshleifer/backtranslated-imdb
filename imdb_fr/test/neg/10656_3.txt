The story of a man's love for an innocent baby, he finds with a deformed face and on the other side of the world a shallow and egocentric "valley girl" who shares a date of birth with her and ends to make a big difference in both he lives. What a beautiful and beautiful story. But in this story, writing and / or directing and / or getting on a screen are so mediocre that they get as much joy as possible from the story. Linda Hamilton's character goes from understanding mother to wicked witch and returning faster than a fastball, and for what purpose? Conflict, conflict, conflict, at short notice. Katie (The California Girl) and her boyfriend, Katie's mother and everyone, including the poor lady at the airport check-in desk, Lin's adoptive father, who is the kindest man and the most considerate of all, as well as his wife and biological son constant conflict. I really wanted to live a comforting story, but the only thing that made me SMILE was the end of hate and fighting. There were too many unexplained or illogical events, many of which add nothing to the story. My wife and I kept looking at each other and wondering how such a good distribution and what should be a good story could be defeated.
