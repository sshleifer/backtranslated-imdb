it's the worst movie in the world. the only reason I gave him a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a "is this real?" sort of way. it was so old and budget ... they should not have been bothered. there was nudity and violence for the sheer pleasure of nudity and violence, and the effects were so severe that you would not believe it (think of ketchup as blood and cabbages as cut heads). do not rent that !!
