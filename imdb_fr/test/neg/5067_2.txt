This music is totally disconnected from the film, it appears from time to time in the form of Wagnerian bombardments and Lone Ranger pressed, if not nonexistent. The play of actors, apart from the two principles, is non-existent. It would have been an excellent student film. Russian soldiers are only role models trying to act. The constant interruptions with wow-explosive camera angles and monochrome clips of people were pretty irritating, but it's just a personal feeling. The scenario is no worse than the others, in fact no worse than most, completely ignoring logic, reason and reality. At least nobody walked for three minutes in front of a machine gun without being hit. The three high level villains were campy.
