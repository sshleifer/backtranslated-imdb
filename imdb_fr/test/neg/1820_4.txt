It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it's not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure film to my Alan Rickman film collection. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the talented Mr Rickman gets into these mediocre films? Judas Kiss has many wonderful actors, interesting plot and intriguing twists, but his strange visual errors and editing have ruined what could have been a great crime drama. Many scenes seem to lack vital information to explain the actions of the character: Why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses? Why was he suspicious of the detective he replaced? Honestly, I really could not tell if the director wanted Judas Kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campaign spoof. Otherwise, why would he throw a topless / alien / lesbian porn scene in the first two minutes (this little surprise certainly made me rush for the remote since my kids are playing nearby!)? Has he deliberately asked his two distinguished English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such awful accents from New Orleans? As Alan Freak, I admit that I always thought Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a kind of wrinkled and tired way, "take him home-and-down" Judas Kiss n It's not a good movie, but there are intriguing moments, but I do not recommend it unless you try to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.
