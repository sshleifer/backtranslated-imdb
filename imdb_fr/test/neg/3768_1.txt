Experimental filmmaker Nathaniel Dorsky said some movies are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog that goes down an alley, sniffing all the way. <br /> <br /> the film is. The structure is "Kurosawa started as a baby, then he became a child, then a young man, then a director, then he began to make" masterpieces ", then he aged, The End. " The word 'masterpiece' is widely used in this film to describe Kurosawa's production, without explaining * how his films are so good / so good. Just because the off-screen narrator who reads a script says that the film is a masterpiece, are we supposed to embrace his hindquarters and accept that a certain movie is one of the great works of art of the Twentieth century? And one more point. Paul Scofield's voice is used as Kurosawa's voice while reading excerpts from the director's memoir. He brings to the text Shakespearian shades in the shape of a pear ... but why him? If you were doing a documentary about Billie Holiday, would you use Dame Judi Densch as your voice?
