They give you the configuration and then bother you to death with a constant pursuit of the cat and the mouse. The main characters are involved in a constant impasse where they threaten each other every five minutes or less. And I'd like to see the police forces that would let one of their cops go after A. Garcia. It's as if a city policeman is coming out of prison Charlie Manson to go for a coffee. Get real!
