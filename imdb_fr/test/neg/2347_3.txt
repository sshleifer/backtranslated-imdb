"The Cellar" is an intolerably boring and child-friendly 80's cheese parade led by Kevin Tenney (creator of the much-loved "Witchboard" and "Night of the Demons") and featuring the incredibly talented Patrick Kilpatrick, supposedly portraying a guy with feelings. The pace is really slow, the plot seems far too familiar, the effects of monsters are anything but petrifying and the film opens and ends with a tedious narrative, which seems to have no connection with the subject of the film. The voice-over keeps talking about the wind and the creatures that support it, but damn it, there's no wind in the plot? Like many horror films from the 80s, "The Cellar" deals with cursed Indian landscapes and too real mythical monsters hidden in basements and quagmires. Mance Cashen and her family move into a house built on what was once the home of Native Americans, but the whites then came and turned the land into oil fields. Half of the script is lost to explaining the origin of the monster, but I can easily sum it up for you: a former Indian wizard has summoned the creature (who looks like an oversized paper mache rat) to annihilate the white people overflowing with his earth, but he buried it again because, and I quote, the SOB also kills the Indians. The extremely irritating son of Mance accidentally awakens the beast and naturally can not convince his parents of the big hungry rat in the cellar. The supposedly emotional family situation (Daddy constantly wants his son to love him) is very pathetic and redundant and the film badly needed more bloodshed; movie for children or not. The young hero (Chris Miller) is pretty annoying, but we've certainly seen some of the worst kid actors in the 80s. "The Cellar" is not really recommended, unless of course you're a fan of monster drawings and typical monsters from the 80's. The big rat-thing is really fun to see.
