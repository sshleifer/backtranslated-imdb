If you like The Three Stooges, you'll probably love this 17-minute short film. There were certainly some fun moments, but like all the work of the Stooges, it revolves around their particular style of crazy comedy, and I must admit that in a way, the Stooges have never really done it for me . Their slapstick always seemed more pissed off than funny, and even though it was obviously fake, their antics seemed always more likely to hurt than to make people laugh. In this short film, the slapstick revolves around attempts to find a wife to Shemp (who is a music teacher) because he has just inherited half a million dollars provided he gets married within 48 hours of the reading the will. One of his students is interested, but once the legacy is announced, there is suddenly a long line of potential brides, and a very good fight emerges between them. Stooges fans will appreciate. For me, it contains all the elements that drive me crazy. 4/10
