Wow, what an overrated film that turned out to be! It was supposed to be "an extremely suspenseful story of a mad killer holding a woman hostage and terrorizing her home." Well, I doubt that it terrified the public in the early 1950s and I know that today's audience would be asleep. <br /> <br /> "It gives chills in the back," proclaims the New York Times. No, the only thrill I feel is that anyone on the planet still believes in everything the New York Times prints about anything. </ P> in his house but the man. "Howard Wilton" (Robert Ryan) was actually harmless and friendly. In fact, it was one of the most beautiful roles Ryan has ever played! Yes, "Wilton" was crazy but he never hurt the woman and just wanted to trust a friend. <br /> <br /> The film even became boring after a while, with very little, except a lot of yakking. <br /> <br /> Be careful, my reader ..... it sucks.
