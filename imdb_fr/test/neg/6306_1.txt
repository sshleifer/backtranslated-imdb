Great Balls of Fire is the movie you show someone that you really, really hate. It is an absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by the henchmen of a foreign power to extract information from captured intelligence agents. I've already enjoyed some of Dennis Quaid's performances in the past, but he's totally beyond expectations in this movie. He does not cross the line so much, he jumps to the pole, then comes back to jump again and again. He struts and mugs as if he were on a journey with incredibly bad acid. It's one of those rare performances where you'd like to get into the movie and beat the man within an inch of his life for committing something so horrible. Did he desperately want to win a Golden Raspberry or another prize for his bad acting? That's the only conclusion I can make. Thanks Dennis, you gave us a bad performance for the ages. Where was the director to rule on this guy? <br /> <br /> The opposite end of the extreme is Winona Ryder, she's plastic characters and play plastic actors. I came across a criticism of her acting style that compared her to a wax mannequin. It was, of course, an insult to the parody of models all over the world, all of which could have brought more humanity to the role of Jerry's cousin / minor wife. This brings up the film's confusing message that it is acceptable to be 100% married to one's own cousin and to have a child with the union. I do not see what is "acceptable" about it, but it seems that Hollywood thinks the incest of minors is a daredevil. Talk about "family values". <br /> <br /> Another problem is the format. Is this a throwback to Lewis's life or a musical? I'm not talking about music, I'm talking about the really strange scene where Jerry goes to school, starts playing a melody and everybody starts to dance like it's a Broadway musical looking for a Tony. Fantasy and reality come together in a mix that does not work. But who really cares? I do not. And you should not either. You can not recover the minutes of life that you would lose with this movie. So do not waste your time, it's too precious for something so misguided and poor.
