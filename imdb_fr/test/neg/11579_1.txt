**** SPOILER ALERT **** My boyfriend, friends and I rented this movie as part of a marathon of very bad movies. We knew what we were involved in. But the lack of intrigue, direction and special effects really left us hoping for a passable battle scene between the two main characters ... the poorly rendered swimmer cobra and the super violent giant komodo (which devoured people like ice cream) ... we get there somehow, but had to be cut short because of budget or time constraints? Its redeeming quality is that it is ridiculously bad, with many salient details highlighted by other readers. I recommend this movie if you want to cut onions to make you cry.
