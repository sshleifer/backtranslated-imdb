It was a decent film for the first half. Too much cheap BOO! moments, but the tension goes up, the bad guys are scary and everything seems to be setting up well. The kids are not particularly deep but hey, it works for teenagers. <br /> <br /> Then it becomes ridiculous and makes too much effort - the "why in the world would it do that?" moments exceed the ability to suspend anyone's disbelief, twist involves too much ridiculous coincidence, and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize something meaningless in the film that goes nowhere and is quickly abandoned. There were bursts of laughter at the theater at times that were in no way supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> Excellent premise, but just badly written and that does not hold together. Some very beautiful shots, but they are hard to appreciate as you roll your eyes.
