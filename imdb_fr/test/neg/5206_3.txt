I liked the movie a bit, it's just that the characters run without really realizing their madness. As I said, poor goat. The goat was whining while the guy pretended to grind on it. I would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic (not the one with the goat though). Jane Ryall who played Celia only shot this movie. She was very naked. This crazy couple who killed and tortured many people found themselves in their rightful place. I almost forgot about the couple of gay transvestites who are also chosen to be sinners. If you like crazy things, then it's your movie. 3/10
