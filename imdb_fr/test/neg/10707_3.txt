... but I had to see how bad it could become. The plot was thin at first, but it was getting worse. A graduate student in genetic engineering uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a man, as a biological weapon used in the Second World War killed 97% of the world's male population. The surviving men are either high-priced gigolos in the alleys clubs, or crazy lunatics in the dilapidated stadiums who are trying to overthrow the "lesbian conspiracy". The whole process resembled the microwave of a big bowl of jello. Press a few buttons and you get a baby. Not only that, but it will age in mid-twenties in a month, and then begin to age normally (which is convenient). Finally, poor Adam gets bored with the isolated cabin in the woods where his creator had raised him and stole his car to "see the city". <br /> <br /> It starts 90 minutes of improbable lawsuits, convenient twists, and several secondary intrigues that we never see resolved. As Adam quickly learns, what men have survived are treated as outcasts / criminals because they are dangerous beasts that can not help their genetic predisposition to violence. Propaganda machines are in full swing, causing women to believe that all men are rapists and murderers. This led to lesbianism as a norm, to the fall of Christianity, to clone-only female reproduction and to world peace among other implicit results. All this seems unlikely since only about 30 years have passed since the war. Adam stumbles from bad to situation, while being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to really do much on his own. With the FBI in his footsteps, madams in search of fresh meat and its creator trying to win him back (for himself, it seems), he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all. In all, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I enjoyed the portrait of Veronica Cartwrights of the FBI director "Love to hate her", and Julie Bowen did not hurt as Hope the hetero 'closet' non geneticist more.
