Fortunately, a brief mystery about a telephone operator who turned out to be the kidnapped daughter of a railroad tycoon. This discovery led to an assassination attempt that Charlie Ruggles foiled the role of "crime deflector". Things go wrong for the dangerous when everyone is in the place of the title and another attempt is made for the lives of girls. Your pleasure with this movie will depend on your tolerance of Rugggles and its nonsense. Normally, I like Ruggles, but there was something in that role that rubbed me badly. In fact, I think that the fact that the mystery was not very good did not help, so there was nothing beyond the characters to watch you. yes, the final on the train was exciting, but it did not make up for everything that happened before. No need to search, but if you fall on it, try it.
