It was a quick comedy at work and the best German film of the year. So I tried, even though I've seen some of Dani Levy's movies - or at least some of them. <br /> <br /> I had what I expected: no comedy at all, unless you think that heart attacks are funny. It's a nice example of a screen-savvy screenplay, with intrigue and unlikely characters, loaded with clichés that might be true, but certainly not funny either. <br /> <br /> The most boring character is Zucker's wife, played by Hannelore Elsner. She must behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving. For example: She does not know anything about Judaism, but for reasons that are probably unknown herself, she has the idea of ​​playing the charade that she and her family are Jewish laws obeying Jews for the family of her husband, who really are. and the very orthodox and self-righteous variety. To complicate things a little, she invites them all to stay in her apartment because they arrive from Frankfurt to Berlin without booking their hotels in advance, which is not a 60-year-old businessman , nor even an adult German. would never do. This gives the viewer a lot of trouble swallowing, but still does not produce jokes. <br /> <br /> Zucker and his brother Samuel have not seen each other for forty years, but it turns out that his daughter - now a lesbian - and Samuel's son - now an Orthodox activist - were once lovers and he is the father of his daughter. Samuel's daughter - a nympho - attacks Zucker's gay son. Is this supposed to be a somewhat humorous parody of the incestuous Jewish tendencies? It's probably just a rash way to add a "love action turbulence" that every ball comedy needs. And of course, he does not succeed in producing jokes either. <br /> <br /> The praises for this film are purely political. Therefore, only people who like to watch movies supposed to be "politically important" will appreciate this one - even if "Alles auf Zucker!" Obviously, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> For everything else: do not look at it without the "Fast Forward" option. I really missed it.
