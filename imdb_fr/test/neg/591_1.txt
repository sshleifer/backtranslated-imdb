I did it and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I will never be able to find again. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have no idea what critics and fans see in this movie. And it's not because I can not appreciate "art". I like a good movie with deep messages, brilliant cinematography and excellent staging. <br /> <br /> This film is not part of it. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about this film is that it's so horribly slow, to the point of annoying its audience to death. On the other hand, the dialogue sequences run too fast and there is not enough room for the non-readers to know what's going on (my mother had pity on me and explained everything to me before looking at it). Would it have been deadly to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about it: (During this time) <br /> <br /> During the first two minutes, you are treated on a black screen without music, waiting for the movie begin. <br /> <br /> During the next minute and a half you will see several images of sunrises and savannah landscapes. As if the audience did not know how to set the scene unless you have seen the staging three or four times. <br /> <br /> The next eleven minutes are devoted to grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight again, blow things with a bone. Supposedly, they are prehistoric men whose evolution is influenced by the singing of the monolith. Not that you can tell if you have not read the book. <br /> <br /> * Finally * we enter space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly turning to the blue waltz of the Danube (a nice waltz fast tempo, as I understand it, but here is absolutely scary). We finally have an innocuous dialogue and a pretty cryptic presentation on the fact that the government does not let people land on the moon. We still have to ask for an additional fourteen minutes Blue Danube, rotating ships and impeccable camera towers with anti-gravity. <br /> <br /> Then comes four minutes of monitoring a ship on the surface of the moon and docking at a space station. We get a little more exposure in a counseling scene that follows. Then we are back outside walking at turtle pace on the moon. A second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with this horrible ringtone (I did not know it was a piece of music!). The monolith makes its little spectacle of light, then the plot advances. <br /> <br /> * Seven * minutes to watch the boat go to Jupiter. By then, my brain had become foamy. Could he move more slowly? It may be "realistic" to present it as such, but we still do not need to see five or six different shots of the same to capture the concept of "realism". Let me tell you about this "realism" thing; I applauded when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm sadistic and I like watching people die, but because after five minutes I was so bored by the sound of her breathing. I'm supposed to care about this character, feel when he dies! Instead, I found myself waiting for silence, no matter how it happened. <br /> <br /> Anyway, we now come to the most interesting part of the film, the part with HAL. Forget Dave, the protagonist of the wooden stick. The real star of the show is this nasty computer coldly impersonal, terribly ugly, pitilessly ruthless. He is great. And the sequence "Open the doors of the pod bay" is wonderful. But it's too short. And the director will not waste time. <br /> <br /> Four minutes for HAL. And dies he does. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence every minute, the voice getting lower and slower, singing "Daisy, Daisy", all with a constant whistle that becomes just as awkward as heavy breathing. <br /> <br /> Seven minutes of vibrant colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could feel my brain melt and flow from my ears! Seven minutes full of absolute absolutes, except for the psychedelic version of space travel, rigged by a guy, always with this chorus three times cursed! We had the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag him so long? Unless he wants LSD users to become psychotic and have flashbacks. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to explain the end, especially because I do not understand myself very well. Supposedly, he is in an alien research lab and they are teaching him deep, deep things as he looks at himself growing old, and then sending him back to earth as a kind of baby of cosmic heavenly space. None of this is seen in the film. As far as you know, this is just a sequence of images without purpose or plot. Much of the film was thus expressed. <br /> <br /> The first time I tried watching this movie, I gave up halfway through. The second time I suffered from this painful excuse for a movie was to help my sister time the footage to see how long it lasted. It's also boring. <br /> <br /> Call this shabby movie "art" if you wish. I would not want to see a more interesting "art" in the local museum. And I never submit to this kind of suffering again.
