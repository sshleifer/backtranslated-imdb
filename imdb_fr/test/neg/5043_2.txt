This movie is like porn with all the good parts removed. It's like all the porn stars who did not want to fulfill their obligations related to this horrible piece of banal and useless gargoyle abstinence. <br /> <br /> This is a useful film if you are in the mood to torture a loved one (or more loved). It is important that if you choose to use this film as a method of torture, install ear plugs and put a blindfold on your eyes so you do not go crazy. <br /> <br /> If I had the choice between this movie and the 700 Club ... I would choose Girls Gone Wild. <br /> <br /> Overall, better if you've been drinking. But only because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions.
