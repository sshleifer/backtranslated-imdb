The book is awesome. This is one of my favorite books. The film, on the other hand, is incredibly tasteless and bad! When I heard that Damon would play Ripley, I knew that this production was doomed to failure. But I did not expect it to be so serious. The actors go around and play very hard. With the exception of Law (and even if he is guilty of spectacular actor), all the actors here are almost amateurs. To speak Italian and move hair or hair should not be considered an act. Damon is a bad idea. It's way too hard for a character supposed to be a chameleon. Paltrow is forgettable and Hoffman plays yet another effeminate gooey character. Talk about converting to characters. <br /> <br /> What is really unforgivable in the script (written by the outmoded director) is that he completely renounces all the subtle details of the book and offers many, but none of them does not work. ! The addition of jazz music is totally FALSE! I think that Minghella's idea of ​​Italy in the late '50s and early' 60s is clouded by images of Chet Baker wandering the Italian countryside and spreading more and more. Yes, Minghella is a true visionary. The film bleeds so obvious. This idiotic scene where Ripley crosses the narrow street full of mirrors. Very laughable. Yes, we have the point !!! Each point or detail is one kilometer away, so much so that the film could give the public the false impression that they have psychic powers. We know, for example, that the character of Blanchett, introduced at the beginning of the film, will come back later, will only complicate things. And sometimes, the soundtrack is totally inappropriate. Capricious when it should not be. The film lasts too long and in all sorts of useless directions. There are too many boring characters populating the landscape (many who were not in the book). This movie is bad! Really bad! <br /> <br /> Apparently, Minghella's son told his father that Ripley's novel was his favorite. Mr. Minghella then proceeded to direct it as a favor to his son. Well, the director realized what he had set: Talented Mr. Ripley, with his aspirations Hitchcock, is a film strictly designed for 12 years!
