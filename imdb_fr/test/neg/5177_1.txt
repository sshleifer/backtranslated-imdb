Blame Guy Ritchie. The success of the late 90s Lock Stock and Two Smoking Smoking, a group of Ritchie and clich√©s, triggered a series of pitiful gangster movies whose genre has never really been recovered. Unfortunately, Rise of The Footsoldier - the true story of Carlton Leach of Essex in hard walnut - is not likely to reverse this trend. Despite a decent performance by Hartnett, the movie is a victim of East End's well-known stereotypes. They are either busy blowing someone's brain or kissing a lightly dressed blonde. <br /> <br /> From the dreaded football hooliganist of the '80s to a key figure in the criminal mob of the' 90s, Footsoldier tells of the rise of Leach ranks of thugs. Leaving the terraces for nightclubs, Leach becomes a bouncer where he is given carte blanche to put the shit on the ground. He enters here with notable gang leaders Pat Tate (Fairbrass) and Tony Tucker (Stone), and begins to realize that gang warfare is not what it is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> It's been fun to be deconstructed Julian Gilbey, writer-director, Jojin-the-Dots' ridiculous laughter, every sentence seeming to start with a "I'm going fackin"? or 'you fackin'? or, on occasion, 'So, I only made one' fackin ', usually concluded with a' mandatory caaaant '! The management, too, feels sadism, especially Gilbey's obvious joy in filming close-up violent scenes and, in the case of the bloody ending of the face shotgun, in triplicate. <br /> <br /> Gilbey's use of the classic gangster narrative from top to bottom is not what will make Footsoldier look like dark on the big screen. And it's not the fact that half-way through the movie, Leach is boringly mocking the events that led to the famous Tate and Tucker shoot. It's Gilbey's sickening appetite for the scattered violence that ruins the movie. Whether a brick in the face or an ax in the head during a perverse attack on a train, all this is unnecessarily prolonged. Footsoldier has not so much strength as to leave your feeling of being violated and especially, deprives you of two hours of your life, you will not come back ...
