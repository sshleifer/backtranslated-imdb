I watched the first episode and found it to be a very wooden performance. <br /> <br /> I watched the original from his debut on Big Girls Blouse until the last series on Channel Seven. Kath and Kim were an excellent documentary and most people have a good sense of humor. <br /> <br /> However, in this American version, I found it boring, Molly Shannon was too fashionable to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80's with her frizzy permanent . While the silhouette of Selma Blair is not as good as the one worn by the original Kimmy. I also found that Selma seemed to eat a lot of stomach, it is obviously a size (Australian) size 12 where Kim should be (Australian) size 16/18. <br /> <br /> Molly's Exchanges and It's obvious that Selma is so scripted and that there are breaks where there should not be breaks or breaks are a bit long, like someone suggested it, there could be a laughter track during these breaks. It's as if Molly and Shannon were not used to each other, there is no mother / daughter chemistry. <br /> <br /> Phil was fine, he looked eccentric around him like Kel. However, Craig was too handsome and not like the mild humble Brett of the Australian version. <br /> <br /> I found that looking was like looking at a very bad part. The acting was mostly wooden and the exaggeration of Selma's expressions lost all meaning after ten minutes. Especially his scenes of sulking. <br /> <br /> In summary, I find that this show is a waste of time, the scenario has obviously been muted for Americans, who, in their majority, prefer the original. If NBC wanted to show Kath and Kim why not pay producers the money to view the original. <br /> <br /> All I can add is Magda. You are an intelligent witness to not let the producers use your Sharon character.
