Agustus and Call did not really do anything? Why are they heroes, they have done nothing but go to places after the wicked are dead. What was the purpose of this show? I was very very disappointed. I was expecting more action, more history, and seeing Heros and Great Deed being born. Instead, I saw very little, it seemed to me that Agustus and Call were a parallel story for the great Indian chief. <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure the story is even very close. They did very little to show why Texans and Comanches fought. <br /> <br /> The only good side of this film is Zhan who played the role of Gus very well and who is a great actor. A lot of good story that could have been wasted. It was sad and I wish I had not watched it.
