A pretentious horror film that looks like a soap opera turned goth about a drug that sends you into a fantasy world where strange creatures are hiding. The film has good pictures but its strange mix of real things and things is not going anywhere. Worse still are the vague statements made in voiceover by one of the characters. This seems to herald a more serious, more meaningful movie, but I do not think they've even started on the serious or meaningful field, so trying to sell the meaning too much is ridiculous. There is not much to say, people talk, take drugs, have visions ... they talk about it more. It is not so bad as useless and dull. The sad is the sin here and the reason you want to avoid that.
