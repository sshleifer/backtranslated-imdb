I saw this movie in the cinema. I took classes at Second City Chicago and of course, the movie was very animated. It's a Woodward film about one of the Second City's Aboriginal sons. <br /> <br /> Everyone knew the story of Johns. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that the tradition did not show him particularly friendly towards women in improvisation or in comedy. <br /> <br /> But hey. the man led his life and he was deeply loved by the people who were in his world, and the tradition also says that he treated all his close friends with love and respect. <br /> <br /> This movie. Well. Forget the idea that poor Michael Chilklis (who is a very great actor) is in a really bad movie and that he is really just imitating the man. <br /> <br /> Forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of Belushi's work ... and all the SNL scenes never arrived as they are described in the movie . <br /> <br /> See the idea that half of the historical information in the film does not even follow Bob Woodwards is working. "Okay ... we're about to play with Belushi ... now, let's continue Woodward too ..." They also decided to go back to the principle of "It's a wonderful life" and turn it into "C" is a horrible life on Crack ". <br /> <br /> Is he a guardian angel or the devil? Is the pinball the devil's assistant electronic device ... how many different purposes can you add a movie to? It's one of those movies once it's over ... you look at the person you're with and, incredulously, you can say, "What was that ?!" In some circles, this film has become a classic a little cult. But for a good reason. <br /> <br /> It's a good cult classic that you sit around the screen and make fun of the screen (or throw away eye-catching liners) on the screen. A cult film is never good. And most people would never look at them in a serious context. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a classic of the late 80s smashed? Rent Wired. If you want to know more about John Belushi ... you can get more information about the walls of Second City Chicago than this movie.
