Bank thriller / thriller policeman, does that sound right? Chaos looks good: well framed, good production values, high quality action ... </ / unique merit of being both intelligent and unbelievably implausible in the "How we really got the money" mode and too complicated in the "who did and why" section at the same time ... <br /> < In addition, Ryan Philippe shouting is NOT, seriously, neither hard nor scary ... and it is especially not tough or scary when it hurts a lot. Honestly, his great brilliance is the only really fun scene in the whole movie. Must please him that he refused the role of Anakin Skywalker and that he does it now .... <br /> <br /> Stratham is normally good as hard, but silent and hard with a sense of humor who depreciates, but here the extra lines of relationship are so ridiculously bad that he even seems uncomfortable to say that some of the cliches are needed. Quieter seems best? <br /> <br /> Snipes is actually acceptable, but it's an extra nail in the coffin of a talented actor: he needs an acting role and not a hero of action . Maybe his business with his taxes will allow him to break this mold and the public and critics will let him vote by sympathy. It would be nice if he was not so often cataloged. </ P> <p> <br /> <br /> The lines that these guys say when they do not participate in the development of the plot and detective work can be summed up in one word .... pheeeuuuh. <br /> <br /> The film seems overwhelming and never freezes: I found it irritating for the first 45 minutes and the last tighter part was passable. It should have been / could have been good, but he just can not buy the awful lines, the overwhelming score and the general level of irritation associated with the level of plausibility. <br /> <br /> Overall, I almost did not get away with it: incredibly irritating, and Ryan ... please, please, get rid of goldilocks ....
