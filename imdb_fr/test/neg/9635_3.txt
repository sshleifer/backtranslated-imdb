This representation of children's popular film history is pathetic enough to watch. I know this is one of the first efforts in filmmaking, but this 15-minute image is unimaginative and badly shot. "The Great Train Flight" (1903), which I also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> We see the little long-haired Jack swapping a cow (2 men in a cow-suit) for a bean bean at a shopkeeper and later a kidney bean sprouting from where his mother got them throw in the yard (I guess poor Jack has reached the wrong guy). Jack dreams of a goose (actually, it looks like a chicken) and a golden egg. The next day he climbs the rod to heaven. <br /> <br /> There is no creative effort in this film. The stem looks like a rope with leaves on it, the giant is just a big bearded guy in a house with nothing abnormally big compared to Jack and the height of the movie where Jack escapes with the chicken and his golden egg is miserable while a drunk mannequin falls from the screenshot instead of the giant then the actor takes his place - rising to his feet in an exaggerated death dance, as in most early films. The stem in bean (rope covered with leaves) goes down from above and winds perfectly on the front of the giants. <br /> <br /> Look at something else.
