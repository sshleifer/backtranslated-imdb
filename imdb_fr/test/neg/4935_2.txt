Brain-on movie about two girls and guys they meet at an airport, taking the wrong shuttle at night and ending up in a world of trouble. The twists are totally, and I mean totally wasted, in a movie with a plot so incredibly stupid that it defies description. What is going on in a general sense is going well, I mean the idea that a guy kidnapping unattended girls for bad ends is a good one. The problem is that the details are so incredible that I would be shocked if you do not turn off the movie with total disbelief. Gee, a guy who is supposed to take you home does not go at all as you know, and you stay in the bus? From there, the situation gets worse. Think about all the bad choices and this film was designed by the characters, to the point of not being able to leave them any more. The annoying thing is that some twists might have worked if there had been something clever before, but there is almost no intelligence in this movie. Ok, maybe there is one, the end is smart. The end is the kind of thing that should scare you. it should be the "oh # $ * @ !!!!" moment and become a horror cinema classic. Instead, it just sits among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie. One of the most brainless movies of the year.
