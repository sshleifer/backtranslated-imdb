Basically, a road movie. Themes related to gays, transsexuals and other sexist behaviors are rather troubling, especially when the child is involved. You must give it to the costume designers. As for the actors, the only one I knew was Terence Stamp. I guess it was a very good performance, out of its normal range (or whoever). The film as a whole was shallow, just a vehicle for the intelligent, the joke bitch. Overall, I do not recommend this one.
