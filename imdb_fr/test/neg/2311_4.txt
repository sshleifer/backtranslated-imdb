The first comments of the users are very detailed for a very vague film. I am not saying that I do not agree, but this summary can be written in a few sentences. To get straight to the point, it's almost like watching the realization of a very bad amateur porn movie. There are some fun points in the movie, but with the kinds of things that happen every day in youth, it's a bit lame. The main actor of the film is a pompous idiot and the guys and girls in the movie are far too modest to be in a movie like this. Do not waste your money on this movie. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 1 was that they used at least one pretty attractive girl in the movie and at the end you had to see the almost complete frontal nudity of the girl, that's all, it's the only thing that counts is worth looking for. the end
