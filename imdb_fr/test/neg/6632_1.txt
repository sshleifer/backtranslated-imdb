It should not have been transformed into a movie. Everything was silly and I do not think I even laughed once. There were pieces that were ok I guess but that's about it. Many movies looked strikingly at many other movies that did a lot better. There were some famous actors / actresses in this movie but nobody did a good job, they just did not care. It's one of those movies that's trying to have a "cute" ending, but it was so stupid that it literally had no redemptive value. Carrot Top is probably the worst comedian of the moment. Indulge yourself and avoid this one! <br /> <br /> Final Decisions: <br /> <br /> Movies: NOOOOO! <br /> <br /> Purchase the DVD: absolutely not! <Br /> <br /> Location: Only if you have already seen ANYthing else and you have a free coupon, but even then, it's still not worth it.
