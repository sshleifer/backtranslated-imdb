Umberto Lenzi reaches new lows with this recycled basket. Janet Agren plays a woman looking for her missing sister. It turns out that the sister is part of a Jim Jones religious cult in New Guinea. She hires a scruffy guide played by Robert Kerman to help her get to the jungle worship grounds. It's another (!) Cannibal film, and I probably would have liked it if Lenzi had not added to this movie scenes from his superior, "The Man from Deep River". I mean, every cannibal scene is taken directly from this movie, which I suppose makes it as believable as Al Adamson. I felt scammed. *** SPOILER *** 1/2 star and it's for the dildo scene.
