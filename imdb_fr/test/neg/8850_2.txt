Would be promising if it was a student film. Never seems to know where he goes next, as if they decided each scene as the film was made. As a result, a lot of repetitions and a deadly rhythm. There is an absolutely confusing procedure whereby ghosts affect the people of this world: Internet, phone calls, computer experience, suspicious student, abandonment program, neglected behavior, red rooms, dark spots and suicides, then. Good luck to understand the connections, or when a character is still a ghost or simply acts in a strange way. The characters are barely sketched, which might be OK, but they are completely uninteresting. It is much too long and ends when he reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is absurd. The weakest moment: when "the boss" sits down to give inconsistent advice.
