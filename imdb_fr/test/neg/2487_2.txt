An alleged documentary that attempts to examine 1950s science fiction movies and their impact on America (and on this one). Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron are interviewed and narrated by Mark Hamill. <br /> <br /> Pretty terrible. The "information" provided is not new - for example - the Cold War and the threat of nuclear war have affected a whole generation of children. Well duh! They try to cover all sub-genres of science fiction movies of the 50s - bug movies, space movie invaders, and so on. That's fine, but they choose the most obvious movies and they are analyzed to death. already. It was cool to see clips from "Rocketship XM", "Destination Moon", "Forbidden Planet", "The Thing" and "The day the earth stopped", but all the filmmakers said was so incredibly obvious to any spectator that it is insulting. Even though it was less than an hour, I was bored deeply after 30 minutes. This gives a 2 for some clips, but nothing else.
