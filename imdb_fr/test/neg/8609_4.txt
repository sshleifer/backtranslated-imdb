I watched the world premiere of this on the Starz Action channel. They call it Vampires: The Turning. The plot was a little confusing. In the introduction, there is a voice over about an 800-year war, and I did not quite understand it. The film is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I do not think the movie specifies it). The couple argues and Meredith Monroe runs away and is kidnapped by a group of vampire bikers. The boyfriend finds a group of vampires who do not kill humans and engage in a battle against bikers. A human group of killers gets involved in one way or another and the final fight sequence takes place during a solar eclipse. This movie is not related to vampires or vampires: Los Muertos. Action puzzling but decent. Four stars out of 10
