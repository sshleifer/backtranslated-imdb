Maybe it seduced them in the '50s, but it's one of those films that do not age well. There is this predatory, serious and oppressed male worker atmosphere of a second-class television show from Rod Serling, "Playhouse". "The plot" is taken from the book, the troubled background of the character Cassevetes seems trapped and the interest aroused by love is unconvincing and without conviction. <br /> <br /> Sidney Portier gives a satisfying performance, but he was sure an annoying and haughty snot. If I had to work with this guy in a warehouse, I would probably also hit him with a grappling hook. Jack Warden is good because, as usual, he plays Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> Like 90% of films rated on IMDb (whether classic, mediocre or crapola), it is rated 7 points. -some-stars. It does not deserve that. Save your time
