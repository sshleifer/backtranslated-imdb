I did not think this movie was very good at all. Basically, they took a series of liners of various Shirley Temple films, put them together and played Orr as if Shirley Temple had played on the screen. "Oh my God!" has been said a number of times. If you know Shirley Temple's movies, you'll recognize several lines directly in his films. The problem is that Orr tells them in Shirley's daily life. In the end, we get a mix of recreated Shirley Temple movies, instead of a real glimpse of Shirley Temple's life. Save money by renting movies at Shirley Temple, it's much better than watching Orr try to recreate Shirley's acting style.
