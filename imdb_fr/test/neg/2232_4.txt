If considered an independent feature, I can not say it's too serious, but where I come from, this sequel and the original "Lady and the Tramp" do not agree! These are two completely different movies with different style, different vocal personalities, different stories and the only thing they share between them is the visual (for example, Jim Dear's townhouse, Darling, Lady and Tramp) and none of these. have changed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a continuity of years after the release of the original for such memorable songs as "Bella Notte" and "The Siamesse Cats Song", this sequel will not give you everything at all! Almost all the songs are a little pop and these good old characters like Jock and Trusty, Jim Dear, Darling and Aunt Sarah and her cats can be seen, but they seem to be somehow replaced by new characters, not to mention Peg n does not appear at all, whose voices are quite annoying. Even Lady and Tramp do not appear often enough and as for Scamp ?! He is so spoiled! And treat his father Tramp with a total lack of respect, then run away without any remorse, even after learning how much he was missing at home! And they called his adventure shamelessly adventure! I would say that Scott Wolf really took out the bad abusive boy of Scamp by sweeping the typical cute Disney animal. Even the old characters only make you furious. Trusty looks like Goofy sick in bed, Jock (Jeff-stupid-Bennett) - and his voice - do not sound Scottish or worthy of hearing! Zap him as far as possible to free our poor ears with his voice. As for silly dogs, stupid and feathery brain, exuberant !!!!!! Someone put them down !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> "Lady and the Tramp 2" It's not all bad if you do not already have a hard day, but I'm expecting a lot more charm from a sequel to a real classic - Scamp is chavvy, his girlfriend Angel too and his scenario is weak. Nevertheless, I think you should try it at least once because, as I said, there are many of the worst films in the world.
