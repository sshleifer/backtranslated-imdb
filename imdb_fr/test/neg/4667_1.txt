<br /> <br /> Before, I loved the Hollywood blockbusters of the 80s. They had icons like Arnie and Sly but I think the action movie in the 90s collapsed to new depths. I think the worst of them has been Armageddon. <br /> <br /> The plot takes place without shame and eliminates the worst shots as it seeks to excite viewers. The melodrama is so saccharine and awful that you really can not wait for Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Liv Tyler, who had acted admirably in several beautiful independent films directed by masters such as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, unfortunately decided to embark on the commercial movement. This film symbolizes the new Hollywood aesthetic: great special effects and valuable little dialogues or authentic melodrama. That's the norm these days and I'm starting to wonder if there's a Hollywood role for screenwriters. It seems that they only use hacks and committees to write easy scripts. The rest, they leave the technology. There is not one single element of great and deep human emotion in Armageddon. He just feels empty and bland. I can only think of one positive aspect of this movie, Liv Tyler's father, who did not even make an appearance in the film. Steven Tyler's group, Aerosmith, provides a theme song for the film - a ballad that really soars and at least a bit of heartbreaking when the end credits appear. <br /> <br /> I'm crying western civilization if people like it. predictable and cumbersome film. It means shallow depth, lethargy and a decline of the human intellect. I would even prefer to watch the eighth Friday on the 13th.
