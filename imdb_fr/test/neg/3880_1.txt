Rs.30 / - All I paid for rent for the DVD of the movie and believe me, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Bollywood filmmakers think it's funny to show fools. Well, it is not. Please grow. <br /> <br /> Here is a dialogue of the movie - 'AGAR TUM LADKEE KO IJJAT DOGE TO LADKEE TUMHE APNI IJJAT DEGI'. <br /> <br /> The plot is useless, criminals and police like chasing after fools. That's it. BHAGAM BHAG. <br /> <br /> Well he lived the title, I had to flee him. :) I went to Star Movies and I watched Home Alone 2 instead, and I had a good laugh.
