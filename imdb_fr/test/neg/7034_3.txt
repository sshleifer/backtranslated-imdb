I actually saw this movie in the cinema. At the time, I worked on a rotating basis and went for a morning on a hot summer day, when I could not sleep. The cinema was air conditioned. <br /> <br /> It was a multi-screen complex at the beginning and I was a little mistaken. I intended to doze through something else. But as things were going on, there would be no sleep. Shortly after the beginning of the bad movie, I was also bewildered by a group of housekeepers who came and used it as a social club. I was the only other person there, and the appeal of the film is that they usually expect the place to be empty and ask if their presence is bothering me. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour, the cleaners' conversation turned out to be more interesting than the entertainment for which I paid the price. <br /> <br /> This film has flowed. screen with the cheesiness of mayonnaise very stale. The kind that has few dark tufts, hairy, growing on the surface. I remember in particular that my senses were assailed by strident strings of music that sounded without warning and even less significance. The cleaners put a finger of anticipation by putting their fingers in their ears. <br /> <br /> It was a city bird that would live in sticks among a load of people from the bottom, putting them straight but at the same time taught a moral lesson or two herself. Like you do it. A kind of "voyage of discovery". There was a sententious mine on all the production. In particular, the leading actress had the irritating habit of viewing each unfaithful with a kind of intense beatific compassion, as if she herself were the holy protector of the thickies. <br /> <br /> And I think at one point she wrote a book. <br /> <br /> Well before the end, I was fascinated by one of the soft, breathless tails of the cleaner, which was a sexual irregularity. <br /> <br /> It is suspected that there is someone to sit quietly for two hours without thinking is a meditation. The best I can say is that I would not want to share their salad. <br /> <br /> I have never seen this movie announced on television, which surprises me. This is the type of bill that is being billed in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having a job. <br /> <br /> If you work shifts, make sure you are in the right theater. Or hope housekeepers.
