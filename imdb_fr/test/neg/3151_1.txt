Barney and Friends is probably the worst show I have ever seen for kids. It does not teach children anything, the songs are lame, it's not educational and the characters are just agitated. I'm not one to disagree with those who hate the show. Honestly, I saw more negative reviews than positive for this show. 75% of critics are negative and there are really mature people. This show does not contain any educational value or educational material suitable for any age. Other crappy intrigues, nerdy dialogues, horrible special effects and horrifying stories are all reasons why I do not like this show. In addition, it is said that you should eat junk food if you are sad and that strangers are your friends. To say that it is a "model of what preschool television should be", as Yale researchers Dorothy and Jerome Singer have said, is a load of shit. They do not know what they are talking about. I would never recommend Barney to anyone. The reason some children continue to cry or become addicted to junk is that this show is poisoning the minds of children all over the world. For people (parents / children) looking for a real pre-school material, go to Nick Jr. and watch "Super Why!" instead of. That's a lot better than this shit and Five TV had the courage to put it on "milkshake" but, luckily, he took it off. I urge everyone to stay as far as possible from this show. Parents, I urge you to keep your children as far as possible from this show. They will thank you later. <br /> <br /> ABSTRACT: Do not waste your time wasting your precious time with this stupid show. It's a garbage can. -10000000000000/10. Grade: Z. Avoid like the plague! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
