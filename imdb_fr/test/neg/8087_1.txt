Rare and propitious are the moments of the realization of a film where the grandeur is a determining monument for the rest of the industry which must be measured and plunge in this glorious moment. <br /> <br /> Some stories transcend their time. and aspire to the high peaks of a classic and the legend. Add to that the refined talents of a group of musicians who are at the top of their game. <br /> <br /> "Where did all the originality go?" It's here, like this story and its sashay through a plot and story that will not only educate, but will entertain even the most seasoned connoisseurs of Shakespearian / action / love story. <br /> I can not begin to imagine where writers have imagined this extraordinary story. Where do geniuses find this kind of inspiration? I now have hope for humanity, knowing that this type of talent still exists gives me hope that we will reach the stars and beyond, perhaps even at the gates of paradise. <br /> <br /> Me, like others before me, dreamed of greatness. Although I did not write this film, I saw it and because of the noble grandeur of this film, I feel that I was raised to a higher level of being, at one level higher spiritual wholeness. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that this kind of glory escapes most of us. What would become of our world if we could all reach this level of magnificence? We would probably be consumed by a white fire of super-nova glory as we evolve into trans-dimensional spiritual beings capable of an all-powerful creative power. <br /> <br /> The most important thing to know, with all your heart and the essence of your being, is that "Tomcats" has nothing to do with what I just talked about . "Tomcats" is the antithesis of everything I mentioned. It could very well destroy our world. Some critics evaluating a film on a star system, that is to say 1 to 5 stars, or even zero star, I will assign "Tomcats" a black hole. <br /> <br /> I'm willing to make a cash donation to a cause that will put an end to this kind of atrocities that, lately, seem to be making things happen at the box office. I am not even opposed to the use of nuclear weapons. It must stop. How much more can we take before extraterrestrials from space come down here and destroy our planet because we have so many stupid, vulgar, vulgar, unimaginative and degrading films springing from Hollywood? I will not even make this film worthy of the name by mentioning the name of someone who played or produced it. I will not even waste my time describing the story, since we have seen it a million times and all previous versions were at least a million times better. <br /> <br /> By the way, my head almost imploded during this movie, but with supreme selfless effort and a lot of luck, I survived to warn the public. You were warned.
