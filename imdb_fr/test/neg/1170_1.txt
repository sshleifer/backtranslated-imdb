The title says it all - Ed Gein, the butcher of Plainfield. <br /> <br /> This is not an action-packed zapped slasher movie designed for teens who consume a lot of energy drinks. This would suit a well-established genre, such as some people find entertaining, something like "Halloween" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". <br /> <br /> It's dark, slow, filled with chopped corpses, and quietly badly. There are few shock cuts, no shots from the monster's point of view, no strong electronic score. I do not know who he is for - ghouls, maybe. <br /> <br /> Under the credits, we already see pictures of skulls, hung carcasses, skins draped over the back of chairs, that sort of thing. And they are sufficiently revolting so that I believe that this film would better catch up with the beginning of the Grand Guignol. <br /> <br /> Alas, this is not the case. The acting is uniformly terrible, as in a high school play. The script does its best to sink under vulgarity. Ed Gein, who has killed only two middle-aged women and perhaps his brother, is pursuing a bloody and screaming young woman in the Woodland of Weir, wearing only a modern bra and bikini, rather than vintage underwear. Gein also decapitates a night watchman, which he has never done historically. <br /> <br /> The direction? You could do a better job. In the first few minutes, officers discovered an abandoned car with splashes of blood on the windshield. There is nobody. The handsome young deputy sheriff addresses his boss and suggests they look for the victim, who may still be in the neighborhood and alive. The sheriff, devoid of any motivation, shouts to him: "Now, YOU CAN FORGET I do not want you to leave in half!" It should only be a professional exchange of views. Why did the director so upset the sheriff? Characters of all kinds listen to radio shows or records that broadcast old jazzy pop songs, such as Louis Armstrong's "Is not Misbehaving". What is it - rural WISCONSIN in the 1950s? And the characters insist on music that would appeal to Cotton Club customers in Harlem in the 1930s, or to New York intellectuals like Woody Allen. Nope. The radio would play "Wheel of Fortune" by Kitty Kallen or Theresa Brewer or, probably, Lefty Frizell. Not that the dysfunction between music and events adds to our understanding of what is happening under the images. A person involved in production just loves the old jazzy pop songs, that's all. <br /> <br /> Of course you can not do more on a budget, but you can be light years away from this butchery. See "Ed Gein" with Steven Railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this madman and his penchant for corpses, as well as on a budget that could not have exceeded it much. <br /> These comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the film. That's about all I could get. If anyone finds that this tale is well executed and fascinating in any way, he should try to better understand his tastes. It's under mine - and I consider myself pretty deformed.
