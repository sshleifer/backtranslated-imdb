... why watch a television series (presented as a comedy) in which none of the characters are sympathetic or even interesting. I can see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the steering errors and unpleasant surprises he put in "A foot in the grave", etc. I admit that the scenario has done a little more effort than most others. on British television at the moment. But really ... who cares about these people? They are cold in the eyes. <br /> <br /> Another poster mentions the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend kissing. That's when I turned off this program and never go back. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is interesting to note that the posters that did not like this series are all British, while the ones that praise it are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC aired this series, it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone. <br /> <br /> P.P.S. Good news for those who loved it! There will be a second series in the fall of 2007 - but without the men's lead. Looks like the BBC has decided to make it a more conventional sitcom of 30 minutes.
