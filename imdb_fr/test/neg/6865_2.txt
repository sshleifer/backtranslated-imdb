I can not believe I'm wasting my time with a comment - but this movie is strangely bad. If 20 different directors are filming different parts of the film without having any idea of ​​the scenario filmed by the other directors, that's about the result I expected. <br /> <br /> I also think that some of the scenes have been stuck in the mess - things do not always seem to progress in order. The film says that we should already know about half of the characters. <br /> <br /> And Steve Guttenberg tries to make Robin Williams's manic comedy in this film. Ewww. And the idea of ​​putting a former prisoner in charge of a group of children just does not seem realistic today.
