History professor, Ms. Tingle, seems to have been well received by student Leigh Ann Watson, who is keen to secure a scholarship in writing. She gets another low note from Tingle, which does not help. When one of his classmates, Luke, steals the paper from the last history exam and puts it in his bag, Mrs. Tingle finds it. She threatens the three that she will go to see the director about it, but he is not available. So, before she reports it the next morning. Leigh, her friend Jo Lynn and Scott go to her house that night and try to convince her not to tell the director. However, because of Tingle's stubbornness, they turned to drastic measures to prevent this outing. <br /> <br /> I was not a fan when I saw it for the first time, and after another viewing, I'm still not one. . Writer Kevin Williamson was on a roll after writing contemporary horror movies for teenagers; "Scream (1996)", "I know what you did last summer (1997)", "Scream 2 (1997)" and "The Faculty (1998)". It was about success (do not forget Dawson's Creek TV show), but this project would be the last bump. The difference there, compared to this entry, is that it was something other than writing the screenplay, it was also making its debut. The strange thing though, was that I found his direction to be executed with skill, but the equipment he had stormed was tasteless and tired. He seemed to be caught playing both a black comedy and a direct thriller, without freezing it. The scenario is cluttered with lively and continuous gags, trivial stretching and whimsical references to other films, but the problem is that it is too diluted with so many artificial developments and disturbing moral currents. The fractured scenario had to be more powerful and powerful because it is a small-scale production that gives the impression of watching a show on stage because of its mostly confined platters. He tries to play mind games with the characters, but these moments are only there to serve the poor progress of the story in a puddle of stupidity and foolishness. The end of the film takes the cake. Williamson's refined management is good, but more pedestrian, so it lacks suspense and the pace, even with its tense environment, can really work. You finally feel it after halfway and it shows how minor the story is. The performances are quite bearable, although without the elegant and icy portrayal of Helen Mirren's manipulative prowess like Mrs. Tingle and a floating Marisa Coughlan, we would have faced Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is modest in his role as a loafer and Molly Ringwald has a lesser role. The soundtrack contains enough energy, but I found it terribly overloaded and formless in its choices. <br /> <br /> Visible to the air, but mechanical in every sense of the word.
