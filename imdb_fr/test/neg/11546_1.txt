This film claims to show the attempt of a middle class family to understand what "is going on" in America in the late 1960s. Their trip to a rock festival is as far as their old refurbished bus gets. Without exception, the characters are superficial stereotypes. <br /> <br /> If you want to know which well-established Hollywood actors were desperately looking for a paycheck at that time, look at the credits. Sal Mineo, I had forgotten how far his career had slipped! Thank God, his career bounced back before his untimely death. <br /> <br /> The writers of this turkey on television were without intelligence. Apart from making grass, their ideas about the "hippie movement" were laughable.
