It must be the worst movie I have ever seen. The part where they lose their daughter? with harmony poltergeist scam? just push it on the edge stupidly. I watched it during the show, so there were always scenes of soft-core cheese porn. I must say that it made me laugh. The 3D effects of the 80s were very out of place. Includes an invisible cat and a rotating vortex. Wow, I wonder if people who have done this really feel fulfilled in life. The actress who plays the woman looks familiar but fears anyway. His cries could be used as an instrument of torture in hell for more than retired Nazis. Anyway, thank you showtime for the super-bad horror movie. I will always enjoy the time I have watched the biggest size of time and money I have ever seen.
