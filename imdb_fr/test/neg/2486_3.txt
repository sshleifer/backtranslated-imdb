* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This film is sometimes subtitled "The eternal life". This often refers to the final scene, but more precisely describes how this once-estimable series is dead and buried after this clumsy and illogical sending. <br /> <br /> a TV show "about this film, which can be endearing in places Some fans will feel like initiates while they like to select all cameo appearances The co-author, co-producer Tom Fontana and his friends are copying the events with friends and favorites from other shows, as well as real Baltimore characters. <br /> <br /> This result adds to the performance of virtually every film in the world. members of the TV show broadcast in various series, your old favorites as well as others not preferred later. <br /> <br /> There has always been a showdown between the executive producer concerned with quality , Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against NBC's budget-minded executives, who simply wanted a police procedure as foolish as that of "Nash Bridges" which regularly beat "Homicide" in the ratings The pressure was felt when the show bounced between a fascinating realism that transcended its form and a sordid sensationalism that depressed it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for this film, Fontana, co-writers Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac simply threw in the towel. They took the most ridiculous story of the series, surmounted it with an unlikely new plot and unsuccessfully from the artistic point of view, and entrusted the burden of bringing all the disorder to one of the weakest members of distribution. <br /> <br /> In short, a little time has passed since the last episode of the series. The former head of the homicide unit in Baltimore, Yaphet Kotto as Lieutenant Al Giardello, is now a candidate for Mayor Kurt Schmoke, and Schmoke himself makes an appearance. But this promising beginning immediately and improbably takes a tragic turn. <br /> <br /> The author now turns to Giancarlo Esposito as Giardello's son. Handsome man who did a good job elsewhere, Esposito was one of the pretty faces imported late to animate so-called television series. But the question for the viewers was always this: is Mike uncomfortable as a son of Gee or is Esposito uncomfortable in this role? <br /> <br /> To be fair, Esposito does not have the chance to play the main story without interruption. This is because the writers chose this moment to revive another scenario that sprang from the intelligence of the loyal voters of the series. <br /> <br /> An apparent popular streaming video was promoted and then appeared to be on the Internet. After a few red blows, the detectives arrested a repulsive suspect. But Zaljko Ivanek's harassed and overburdened Deputy Attorney General forgot to file his motions on time and the suspect was released and later murdered. <br /> <br /> Summarize it: he forgot to classify the documents because they were not the most sensational case of his career, because the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the whole of the Maryland legislature, the Attorney General of the United States, NBC, Court TV, the BBC, the AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, the Washington Post, the New York Times, the LA Times, Time Magazine, the Times of London, The Economist, the Johannesburg Mail and Guardian, L'Osservatore Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, L'Equipe and Computer World did not call every 10 minutes to inquire about the state of affairs. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the former group of detectives and associates returns to Baltimore to help. There is a whole range of talents on display. Unfortunately, given the lack of dialogue to offer, some of them are simply visible. <br /> <br /> Two of the most powerful actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are criminally underutilized, while Jon Seda is wasting his time and Michael Michelle could be better spent on commercials. The writers seem to be doing a satire, presenting Jason Priestley as the last detective of the genre. On the other hand, they give Michelle Forbes a very touching, easy-going scene. <br /> <br /> There is another devious casting, with the real lieutenant Gary D'Addario, the center of the book that gave rise to the show, playing another detective. The guests come from other shows, such as Whitney Allen, who plays the role of "Miss Sally", a children's show spoiled by the inmates of Fontana's "Oz" movie. Dina Napoli from WBAL TV presents herself. <br /> <br /> However, even entertaining, these guests can be embarrassing. Ed Begley Jr. is making a real difference in his brief appearance, interpreting Dr. Victor Ehrlich of "St. Elsewhere" of Fontana. He is still a living character and slips into a hospitable context. You will remember then that St. Elegius had not become a fantasy autistic boy? <br /> <br /> The most useful cameo reflects the synergy of the company. This film was shot when Court TV bought the rights to the series. Helen Lucaitis, who had interviewed the Homicide team and later appeared on "Oz", had made a legal contribution. The televised correspondent effectively summarizes the information, that is, the plot points for the retarded. <br /> <br /> Although she is so thin that she disappears by turning, Lucaitis also manages a little physical comedy with Esposito. . He shows more juice in his scenes with Lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues. These two people might have had to do a spin-off. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the cream of the cast goes to the top. Although they are struggling with a losing scenario, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor have overcome it. Their performances remind viewers of what has allowed Homicide, for long periods, to become the best live show and one of the best TV productions of all time. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch the best professionals do their job; it's just too bad that this movie does not give them more luck. Hard-core fans may want to see this movie, but you can do without it.
