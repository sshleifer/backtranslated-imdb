The early voice-over, which looks like "The Wind", could be an intriguing film, but as the story unfolded, I knew the situation was down. The main things that blew into this movie were the terrible bad acting roles of all the main characters (with the exception of a few scenes involving the inner turmoil of Mic), the lack of character development and the total absence Intrigue - What did writers think? <br /> <br /> Michael Mongillo has won two "Horror / Science Fiction" awards for "The Wind". HUH? What was so scary about this movie? NOTHING! Aside from the video plans of resident evil 2, the rest was more like a "thriller on TV" - it would not even need to be edited. If you want a much better movie about "killing with friends", rent "Shallow Grave" instead. <br /> <br /> "The Wind" * / *****
