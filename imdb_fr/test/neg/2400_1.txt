The filmmakers neglected to link the points - that is, the sequence of events and choices that drove Charlie Wilson and the anti-Soviet Mujahideen to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden, and then to 9/11. The filmmakers have of course neglected to tell us the story - why were the Soviets in Afghanistan? reinforced the hand of the anti-Western forces and was an important factor contributing to the disorder in which we find ourselves today (9/11, terrorist networks, a protracted land war in Afghanistan, etc.). Because these consequences are not specified, the film leaves the viewer sympathetic to Mr. Wilson (look at his latest projects on the Internet) instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the West as a whole.
