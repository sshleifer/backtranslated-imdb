My brother was working in a movie theater when I saw this movie. I saw it for free and always went out. I saw a lot of movies in my time but it was the worst. When people ask me what is the worst film I have ever seen, I mention this film in less than a second. This film is bad because it goes from one lame scenario to another, it encourages stereotypes about blacks who are disgusting and the flow is awful. If you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time, study this film. Okay, this movie is not good "bad" but terrible. If you're like one of those people watching horrible movies for fun, like me, you will not even get through this very short film. Please, for God's sake, destroy all copies of this film.
