The seven collaborations between director Joseph von Sternberg and star Marlene Dietrich were so different in appearance and tone and so different from what was happening at the time, they seemed to be a separate subgenre. Like all genres, they have their absolute masterpieces, as well as their absolute turkeys. It's time to send Blonde Venus back to the farm. <br /> <br /> After the alluring successes, The Blue Angel, Morocco and Shanghai Express, in which Miss Dietrich set her screen image as a cabaret-singer-prostitute, at Paramount decided it was time for Marlene to play a mother. There is nothing wrong with that in itself; as an actress, she was up to it. It's just that nothing else about the format has changed. It's like The Blue Angel plus a child. The story of a woman dragging her child on her gloomy escapades is a good base for a tragic tragedy, but that's not the way it's played out. Dietrich's journey is presented as a kind of adventure, using his intelligence and accomplices to stay ahead of the law. This is not a brazen example of pre-code libertarianism? It's oddly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Although we can accept that Marlene is a crazy mom, we absolutely can not buy Sternberg as a director of warmth and emotion. Despite being one of the few pictures for which he also took credit, Sternberg simply can not understand the story. The film's emotional fallout is supposed to be the family's eventual reunion, but even at the beginning, it is not established as something worth repeating. As usual, Sternberg's interiors are dressed and shot to look like brothels or insane asylums. The Faradays house is actually a terrifying and dismal environment, and it's a marvel that little Johnny does not wet the bed and does not ask to sleep with the light on. <br /> <br /> But as those who know Dietrich / Sternberg know it is intended to give Dietrich a fabulous appearance and, in this respect, at least Blonde Venus is a success. Marlene is introduced at the exit of a forest pond in a bright and shimmering close-up, and even when she is reduced to cowards, the camera still loves her. The same can not be said of the rest of the cast, which Sternberg tended to regard as a moving landscape. The normally friendly Herbert Marshall is here reduced to a gloomy grunt hidden in the shadows. Even the sweet and lively Cary Grant becomes just a boring background task and does not seem interesting enough to allow Dietrich to run away. <br /> <br /> The only highlight moments of Blonde Venus are Marlene's singing and dancing routines, especially the acclaimed Hot Voodoo number where she parodies her surrealistic stage character as she comes out of a gorilla outfit. But even these have the impression of having been cut and glued from a different film. Fans of Sternberg can greet him as another masterpiece, as they usually do, but for the average bettor, it's a huge disappointment. Audiences at the time did not let it go as they had, and that was the beginning of the end for Marlene's glory. A year later, there would be a new queen at Paramount ?? Mae West.
