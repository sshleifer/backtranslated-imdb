For those of you who do not remember movies - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ - this came out in '79 (I think the time has gone so naturally that Nunzio thought that he could just start again and tell him he wrote it - yes, no!). <br /> <br /> The action in this film is too heavy - the "tough guys" are waving their shoulders forward to give the impression that they are bigger than they really are, the "hero" seems to have a passion for snorting, and rolling eyes in a silly look to express his anguish / anger at celluloid eyes. <br /> There is a kind of racial message here, from the Sicilian point of view (beware, this is the 3rd generation on the whole line ... the original "wogs" arrived in OZ after the war and during my childhood - yeah, I'm an Australian, so the "wogg -iness" has been diluted a lot - they even sound like real Australians - not a flicker of "dago accent" anywhere (there, there is another slang for you, Nun!) <br /> <br /> Maori with sunnies (sunglasses) at 4am - you have to be cold to be blinded to the sun in the middle of the night and it looks like Redfern ... this is the tedious end of this film, Nunzio tried to copy the flavor of the Warriors, but left too many holes in the story.What about coincidences? <br /> <br /> warriors had a gang of baseball players wielding bats, made up in white, chasing the heroes to a station and fighting them - A gang of Nunzios is being pursued drunk in the station by a stick gang wielding guys wearing whitish masks. The warriors were falsely accused of killing / murdering another gang member - the Nunzios gang is wrongly accused of raping the sister of the great Maori gang leader. Warriors are lured into a room by a group of girls who attack them - a crowd of Nunzios wants to crash into friends, populated by, yes, a group of girls - the Warriors have too many copies to keep about right here. <br /> <br /> I am saddened by the fact that people do not want to see other OZ projects because of these guts - what about Mad Max - Commander and Master of the World? Not all movies are made by actors who are so bad, they have to finance their own movies. <br /> <br /> Regarding the other actors in this series, they seem to be inspired by "The Nun" because they are all equally bad - do not bother with this movie! I can not get my money back - so keep yours!
