I got this little piece of scuzz on the VideoAsia DVD "Tales of Voodoo". Although voodoo is supposed to integrate, I have no idea. Indeed, anyway, I would not generally connect the voodoo to Indonesia (let alone WIP). <br /> <br /> I know and love WIP movies. I saw most of them. So I could not resist this little-known gem of the description on the cover. <br /> <br /> It's terrible. You can not have a WIP movie if women keep their clothes (even in the shower!). Although this is a nod to the kind of exploitation, WIP without nudity is like a Big Mac without beef. <br /> <br /> As my gym teacher said, overall, I'd rather be at the disco ....
