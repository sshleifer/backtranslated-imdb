The fourth theatrical release (that of National Lampoon that bears his name) resembles a classic comedy. A complete mistake and a sad attempt to capitalize on a formerly proud franchise. Painfully disappointing and unassailable ... even for a TV movie! The character of Cousin Eddie has become less and less fun, from the original holidays when it was fresh and unique, until the Christmas holidays when he started to wear a little thin, at Vegas Vacation where he was actually annoying to see appear on the screen (but, in all fairness, there were LOTS of things that were boring to see on the screen in this movie!). But this attempt to move the character to the status of leader is, to say the least, regrettable. The vacation movies themselves had a horrible death in Las Vegas, and this hope to revive even the thinnest wire of the series for television was totally wrong. Chevy Chase and Company put together a great trilogy at the time of its heyday; now let's just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace. (A small note of interest: the first Audrey Griswold - Dana Barron, the first of four actresses to play the role, including Juliette Lewis - returns to the role 20 years later! It remains only to ask .. . WHY? )
