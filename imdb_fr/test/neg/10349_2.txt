I tried to watch it twice, but I did not manage to survive either episode. For me, it's basically just not funny. I can say where I'm supposed to laugh, but I can not. I have never seen the original, so I do not compare. I also like comedies, including original comedies such as Married ... with Children and Family Guy, but this series just does not allow me. The jokes are lame and flat, and the acting is especially annoying. Advertisements gave an interesting aspect, but this is not the case. They try too much to be different and force the humor. This style does not usually work very well. I do not think this show ends the season. Of course, I can be wrong.
