Title: Dracula AD 1972 <br /> <br /> Director: Alan Gibson <br /> <br /> Performer: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Stephanie Beacham <br /> <br /> Criticism: Sometimes, movies can to be the time capsules that carry you at some point. In this case ... our time capsule is Hammers Dracula AD 1972 which takes us back to a time in which Austin Powers would have felt like home. <br /> <br /> The story of this group of children (were not a gang! were a group!) who like to spend time in a coffee shop called "The Cavern". One day, Johnny Alucard (hmm, weird family name ... wait ... it sends Dracula backwards!), A new member of the group offers the group a new way to get started. He offers them a night of black mass and black magic. To which they also say "of course why not, it could be fun!" Then, in no time, they find themselves resurrecting Count Dracula from his ashes. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a swing party at some rich doofuses of the house. He does not know people at his party, yet they are all partying all night at his place. Drugging, kissing and dancing on the tables. The filmmakers have ensured that this sequence is completely engulfed by what young people consider cool at this time. Everyone says words like "exit" and "groovy" and finishes a lot of sentences saying "all that jazz". So yes, it's pretty obvious that it's the 70's. To top it off, there's a band that sounds like "Jefferson Airplane" ... I mean you'll be drowning in all the things of the 70's And as I watched this, I wondered, "How on earth is Dracula wearing his black cloak and getting up to fit in with all this?" And that's exactly what's happening. Old Dracula does not feel right in the middle of the party, rock and roll and drugs. Most of the scenes in the film are excellent .... but unfortunately, the music they decided to add to the procedure is not appropriate at all and completely avoids the mood. There will be something horrible or scary on the screen. Suddenly, a series of powerful trumpets and congos will begin to beat and you will be completely eliminated from the horror element. That's what completely destroyed the atmosphere of this film. <br /> <br /> But all in all, apart from all the distracting music of the 70s (an illness that the satanic rites of Dracula also suffered), the film was pretty good. But I will mention this. The story was just a re-hash of what we had seen before in Taste Dracula's Blood. In fact, the story is almost identical. Let's see ... a young boy inherits the ring and ashes of Draculas ... check. He then decides to bring Dracula back to life with the help of people who do not know what they are doing. Black Mass to bring Dracula back to a desecrated church ... check. The list of similarities goes on and on. So this movie is not very original if you ask me. <br /> <br /> There are a few things that make this movie interesting. For example, the fact that the film is a time capsule in London in the early 70s makes the film entertaining. I kept laughing and laughing every time someone spoke in 70's jargon. I could not believe that some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove! It made the film fun for me, but we are here to scare, to see Drac kill some virgins and take revenge on Van Helsing's house. Have we had that? Well yeah. Some good sequences are presented to satisfy the hammer lovers of the old school. First of all, there is the Black Mass sequence which was above all satanic! They mention the name of many demons and a lot of blood has been shed. This sequence was great but it was disturbed by the music in its most crucial moment. Then there is the real resurrection of Draculas which, I admit, was brilliant from a visual point of view. A certain mist comes out of Draculas' grave and slowly but surely, the silhouette and the face of Christopher Lees emerge from the fog. Nice shot! I liked it! We have a Cushing and Lee clash at the end. And I could not help laughing at some point when Dracula threw a piece of furniture in the air. I laugh because he did it in every movie since Horror of Dracula. It is this tradition of Hammer where the characters begin to throw candles and chairs. And I think these are not their most exciting things to show, so a villain throws a candle stick at our hero. Oh well, any demonstration, Draculas' disappearance into this one is very similar to that of all the other Draculas Hammer that preceded it, the vampire goes out and we move on to a series of frames up what remains only ashes. <br /> <br /> All in all, a Dracula Hammer movie funny fun. It's trapped in the '70s, and while it's a fun watch (and not as dreadful as Dracula's satanic rites), it still does not freeze well with the Dracula universe. we were waiting for Hammer. /> Rating 3 1/2 out of 5
