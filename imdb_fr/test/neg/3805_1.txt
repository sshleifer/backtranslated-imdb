Stuck in bed with the flu and too hard to get up to find the remote, I watched this abomination from beginning to end (how many people can say that, and for those who can, what's your excuse?). My God, has there ever been, NEVER had such a disorder published by a big studio? There is not a second of real tension in a so-called "thriller"; the script is inept and ridiculous; the sets seem to be remnants of a low budget television movie; and casting ... WHAT DO THEY THINK? !!! Sally Field is without a doubt the worst and most embarrassing performance of all Academy Award winners. Her nasal irritating behavior and stupid, perky behavior in what is supposed to be a life-threatening situation are really asinine. It's a marvel that she did not use all her future earnings to buy and destroy every footprint of this turkey. Michael Caine, who constantly pontificates on the art of playing on the screen - even leading master classes for future thespians - should be eliminated and shot (preferably by one of Telly Savalas' henchmen) . Angela Cartwright, an actress I like (and whose name does not even appear in the opening credits, poor soul), is 10 years too old for her role and her horrible yellow prom dress must rhyme to haunt her nightmares until 'until today. Karl Malden and Shirley Knight are crazy - they hope they have raised a big salary to appease their involvement. The whole film is a series of bad scenes, but the one that is particularly close to my mind is the explosion that causes the "ceiling" (if the deck of a ship upside down can be called such) collapsing and a load of empty cartons falling through! Ooh, how scary! Really, really, terrible.
