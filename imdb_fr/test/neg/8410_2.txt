With his few surreal touches, LWHTRB works like a mediocre horror, but as a major sequel to the original, he wades miserably. <br /> <br /> Things start a little promising during the opening credits of the TV movie. We see and hear several interesting images and sounds: the baby's black cradle with the stunning cross overhanging it; the kitchen knife that Rosemary brought into Castevette's apartment and fell in shock (the utensil is shown coming out of the hardwood floor); and the void of Bramford himself, without a tenant or furniture (voiceovers can be heard here in the dialogue of the previous movie). The Easter egg hunt in which the titular child participates (eggs and baskets are also black) is also interesting. Once the story begins, she does not really "roll" ... And what becomes of Rosemary when she gets on the driverless bus and is taken to God-knows-where? <br /> <br /> Patty Duke (a poor substitute for Mia Farrow), Ray Milland and Tina Louise (in the role of Southwestern Whore raising the child, "Adrian / Andrew") at the head of this cast almost star, with Ruth Gordon taking over her role of "Minnie". <br /> <br /> Although it is not a total failure, this sequel should have been published as a book first, so maybe we could all have been a little better informed ... and not left totally in the dark. A fairly recent sequel to the novel "Son of Rosemary" (1999?) Is the legitimate sequel to Ira Levin himself. <br /> <br />
