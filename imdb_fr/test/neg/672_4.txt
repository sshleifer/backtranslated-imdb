Leon Shamroy's CinemaScope color cinematography is quite remarkable here, thanks to its use of colorful filters for various scenes. The Alfred Newmann score must be the most sensual and seductive score ever produced by Hollywood. It's a shame that it is no longer available on CD. The actors, however, are never up to the task. The accents are so varied, from the submissive Britons of Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature, that it seems to be a true hodgepodge without central vision. Tommy Rettig is American. Interim styles range from stilt zombies. Only Ustinov, as an accomplice one-eyed servant, steals the show - what it is to steal. The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of worshiping the one God, Ra - persecuted by the authorities, have interesting points. But when the plot of the film fades, all that remains is the haunting music and visuals.
