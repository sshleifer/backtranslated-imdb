It may sound strange, but I only saw the first film (The New Emperor's Groove, Yaddayadda) a week ago and only because of an episode of the TV show. I love Kuzco, but Kronk is not that bad either. Anyway, I finally decided to watch the second movie, just to be able to see it. I was hoping it would be as good as the first, but ... I'm sorry to say that, but the more the humor became American, the more I yawned. I agreed with Kuzco when he started crying when he saw all the nonsense pictures. <br /> <br /> Still, younger kids and probably veterans will also like this movie in small pieces (if they like the old school that moralize Disney), but I just had expectations that were really a slightly higher than they should have been. Kronk is a charming character, having good heart and stupid, but it's Pasha and Kuzco in dredge that woke me up at the end of the film. (I will ignore Rudy ... as much as possible). <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a great movie, but it's not my style and, as they say, you always have to be true to your rhythm.
