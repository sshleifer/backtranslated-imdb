Good actors, good director, well played, well directed but ... Where is the film? Did they have a script or did they improvise everything? At least it's a short film (only 80 minutes, credits included). Nothing seems to happen in this movie, nothing at all. Some small drug traffickers caught in small problems, but you'll never know what's going on, or even what they're talking about in certain movie sequences. Tons of "f ***" and "motherf *****", but nothing else ... <br /> <br /> For those who love Abel Ferrara's films like The Funeral, "A Christmas will be a big disappointment, as it was for me." What was he thinking, did he really think it was a good movie, and if he did not, then why did he he done?
