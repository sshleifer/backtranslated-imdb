One night, this monstrous channel was broadcast on an independent channel known for the projection of extravagant films. Although we tried to extinguish it, we watched it all the way, hoping to see a semblance of redemptive value. Alas, there was none. Absolutely nothing. The quality of the film was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; the editing was ridiculous. Again, there were few precious things to save. After a few minutes of narration by Cameron Mitchell's doctor about a patient, the viewer is not tortured by any intrigue, any pathetic writing, a terribly terrible game, a total lack of cohesion and continuity. The rotten cherry on top of this stale clutter was the most horrible "special effects" and "make-up" that ever disgraced the screen, even for television. The main character stumbles into his role in a dimestore rubber mask and a pair of dishwasher gloves that appear to have been dipped in glue and rolled into beads. Perhaps the mediocre quality of the lighting and the quality of the film's gag tried to hide how thin the composition was in the tenth. One can only hope that at least a deliberate decision was made during this desperately amateurish video. Seriously, a handful of three-year-olds could have produced a better project. In the end, poor Mr. Mitchell comes back (how desperately he was looking for money!) And told nonsense supposed to link this pile of shit and the AIDS epidemic. Please, spare yourself and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting during this time. It was so bad that even the Mystery Science Theater 3000 could not have saved it.
