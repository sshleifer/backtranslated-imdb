Normally, remakes do not bother me. There are some very good, BUT this one is a whore! Considering that it was almost a scene for stage, there was a good story and good actors. Van Sant copied Al's direction almost perfectly, and that added some color (I'm not one of those who think it should be black and white to be classic). It should have been at least a mediocre film ... but it was pee-pee caa-caa! I do not understand how it could have been so badly messed up. If you have to watch it, look at it as a curiosity, but I would advise you not to disturb you.
