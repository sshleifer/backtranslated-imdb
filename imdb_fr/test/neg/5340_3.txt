Well, it's a quick monogram of the dreaded era of the 1940s, when the poverty class studios staged a lot of horror films almost unimaginable ... so I was expecting the worst. <br /> <br /> The story is about a doctor who works to restore the life of the dead by using a room filled with non-utilitarian electrical devices that gush nicely. There is a dog's heart hanging under a bell and trembling, which, we are told, proves that his method is perfect. <br /> <br /> A brief discussion of the metaphysical implications and the mention of an important point in the plot preceding the inevitable death of a young man who is resuscitated in a somewhat dramatic sequence - not dramatic even with Sparks. The important point of the plot is that a convicted murderer is being executed at midnight, which turns out to be exactly the moment when the young man is revived. It is not surprising that the young man is very different after his experience; seemingly amnesic and with a strange desire to visit the places of the underworld and to get acquainted with some gangsters ... <br /> <br /> It's hard to explain why all this is not completely untouchable, but can it is enough to say that it is slightly interesting and contains several murders and some interesting characters. Towards the end, he even begins to move with a bit of real tension and a downright Hitchcockian confrontation. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I must warn you of a very, very bad end. A tagged on useless, the pain in the ass ends. Once the plot is solved pretty effectively ... <br /> <br /> You know the kind of thing ... Everything is just a dream. Never happened.
