Companions of Giallo-fanatics: Beware and / or proceed with caution? because this film is not exactly what it seems to be. It certainly looks like a Giallo, with its juicy VHS cover (showing a naked girl with big breasts and a big bloody knife), its rhythmic title and the names of two veteran Italian actors in the cast (John Phillip and Fernando Rey), but c an erotic thriller without big conspiracy. The version I watched is reportedly severely censored ?? with a duration of just 77 minutes ?? but there is still a serious lack of suspense, character development and especially sadistic carnage (and typically Giallo). "Eyes Behind the Wall" can be briefly summarized as a gathering of a group of evil characters and detailed description of their sexuality issues. Nevertheless, it is an interesting effort, as screenwriter / director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) has clearly tried to do something special, but the end result is unsatisfactory and unfortunately tamed. Inspired by Hitchcock's "back window", the main character is a frustrated, elderly wheelchair writer. His much younger lover and himself have their sexual feet spying on the only tenant on the other side of the road. The renter, respectively, likes to perform gymnastic exercises around the house while being naked and clearly has bisexual desires. A guy in a wheelchair sends his wife and they have sex. Then there is also Ottavio, the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. Are there any normal characters in the story? Well, no, of course not! The film has a sinister atmosphere, a dark soundtrack and cool photographs, but it never ends, so it's just sex and sex without meaning. At the end of the story, there is a really weird twist / revelation, but it happens too late and too haphazard to improve the overall quality. Not recommended for Italian horror / cult movie fans, but analyzing characters in the manner of Freud may be good for psychology students.
