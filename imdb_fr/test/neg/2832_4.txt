As a big fan of Brian Yuzna and most of the movies he was involved in, I assumed I would appreciate Progeny. I did not do it, even if in a certain way, there are moments. However, if you expect something of the caliber of the company or beyond ReAnimator, you may be in shock. In a way, it looks like society, being the story of an apparently ordinary world with a horrible supernatural belly ... but that's where everything ends. <br /> <br /> I do not cover Yuzna when I say the fault does not really lie, a wrong direction is a bad direction, but the direction is good. What makes the film stumble is the scenario and the acting of the actors. Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) wrote a clever scenario, but it does not really fit Yuzna's staging style. itself. This case makes the movie pretty awkward as it is, but worse. <br /> <br /> If the film had been shot with great actors, the film would probably have held its own. Unfortunately, it is very far from the case. The actors play is wooden, shocking even for a low-budget function B. Arnold Vosloo, who has had an unexplainable success and has been incredibly successful, wrecks every accursed line with precision accuracy, achieving one of the worst performances I've known in a long time. The man manages to transform each line of thoughtful dialogue into a kind of striking line that you will drunk to your friends the next time you go to the pub. Hey Bob! GOOD GOD, I'm going MAD! WHAT IS ... COME ON ME! NOOOO! In fact, I can try it myself next weekend. The last minute addition of Brad Dourif, a veteran of the genre (and personal favorite), instead of enriching the film as it should, seems to give the film to Dourif in an ultimate effort to prevent Vosloo from stopping playing. Hamming, but frankly, Dourif seems deeply uncomfortable (possibly waiting for the next bad actor assault) next to Vosloo, and even an eccentric ride from him fails to resurrect the movie. <br /> <br /> If the game was better, this movie would have been good. It could have been pretty nice, but the lack of character makes the film a soulless affair, and gives the horror the effect of being tasteless and tasteless instead of being an organic part of the movie. Extraterrestrial scenes of torture and rape seemed to me a bit difficult to bear, but the fact that the characters were so wanting made them uncomfortable and unpleasant, leaving an unpleasant taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> If you really like science fiction and do not have a problem with bad acting, pedestrian stimulation and really nasty and nasty rape scenes, Progeny will probably your cup of tea. But since I do it, I will probably never look at it again. Once was enough. On the plus side, it's the only science fiction movie Yuzna ever bothered to do, so he was not really that happy.
