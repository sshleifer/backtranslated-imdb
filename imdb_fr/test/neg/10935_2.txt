Surprising that something like this can find its way to be watched by the public. I knew it was from Uwe Boll, and I found that in a price basket in a shop for $ 2 (still quite steep given the above), but a morbid curiosity led me to see that , and: <br /> 1). I'm pretty sure it's a rip-off of Seven, Silence of the Lambs and American Psycho, all in one, with dialogues that may have been written by pre-teens. <br /> 2). Casper Van Dien plays the main character and he is so absolutely weird and terrifying that anyone can KNOW that he must be the crazy serial killer. <br /> <br /> 3). Jennifer Rubin plays the "good cop" who invites a serial killer into her apartment for a homemade dinner, and what does she get for her problem? I will let you guess. <br /> <br /> 4). Michael Par√© plays the role of a cop "intense", which leads a VW Bug with a new style, that is to say with a siren. A bug VW ... that will scare criminals when they see it coming. <br /> <br /> 5). Van Dien breaks up with her fiance, but she still has a "non-fiancee" party, with "not a wedding cake". Imagine everyone's surprise when he shows up (he was of course invited) and they are all shot at. <br /> <br /> 6). In fact, it should have been No. 1, really. The killer in this is known as "the monkey maker". This is without a doubt the name of the most stupid murderer that anyone could find in a million years. We can assume that this has something to do with the saying "do not see harm, do not listen, do not talk about evil", with monkeys. It is also possible that the monkeys had something to do with the script. <br /> <br /> 7). Oh yes, and there is a club that Van Dien visits at the beginning of the movie. There is bad disco music, really bad, and a wire cage with links, gang members fighting one another with a baseball bat? That's what it looked like. And of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg, the really cool things (?!) Unfold in the basement, where a questionable "actor" persuades a woman to sign a confession before being shot on it, I suppose, a snuff film? I'm not sure it fits the rest of the movie, and Boll probably was not, so if he did not worry, I would not worry. <br /> <br /> An incredible piece of movie -assurance that will make you feel like you're watching something from a parallel universe. A parallel universe that is a bit like ours, but where things are just far enough away from where they do not look good. You have entered "The Boll Zone". Leave as soon as possible and do not look back. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
