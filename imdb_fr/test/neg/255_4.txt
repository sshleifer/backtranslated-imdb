I'm not confident about FOLLOWING, Christopher Nolan's first film. Part of me admires it for $ 6,000 but a part of me hates it for being too art house. In many ways, it reminds me of the cult movie PI, a movie I did not like, and I can not understand the script of a man who wants to be a writer who follows people. Would not it be more logical for someone who wants to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write? <br /> <br /> Oh well, I guess NEXT gives independent filmmakers hope that just because they made a $ 6,000 budget-free film, over two thousand BDIM members will vote for and more than five hundred members will comment, but you wonder if this film would be so well considered if it was not realized by the director of MEMENTO?
