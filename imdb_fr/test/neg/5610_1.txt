If only the writer / producer / "star" had any idea of ​​the limits of his role, and how it is perceived on the screen (wearing glasses and an opening on the side are not enough to give you the Gawky and offbeat air if your face and teeth were carved by various health professionals to conform to American ideals of generic symmetry without characters, mistakenly perceived as a beauty in this obsolutely superficial society), he would have chosen John Heder as a main character instead of trying to shoot a Good-Will-Hunt and create a vehicle to present his ... his ... well, himself. <br /> <br /> The excellent support cast (God knows they must have a hard time accepting this) is wasted a dying perpetual struggle to convincingly react to a main character unable to deliver even the line the simpler with proper intonation, and believe me, there is no shortage of simple lines to choose from, because the dialogue seems to have been composed by a period of five years. -old. Ah, wait ... it's the same person who claims to be a writer and pretends to be an actor. It is rare that I do not see a film to the end, but this ejaculation was irremediable from the beginning and showed no sign of improvement after the first hour. Excrement.
