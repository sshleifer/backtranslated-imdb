If Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch were not such talented actors, this movie would probably be even worse than it really is. The story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is interesting and worth exploring.However, on the negative side, the plot becomes more and more exaggerated as the story progresses and that the musical choices are more and more bizarre, so that in the end I found myself laughing when I know that the director wanted me to cry.
