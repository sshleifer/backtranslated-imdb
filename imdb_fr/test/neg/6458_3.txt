The role of Buddy Ackerman is not surprising for Kevin Spacey. He played the version of this character several times, better movies. This is a chance, because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which Buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all the other characters in this useless little joke. The scenario leaves little time for the development of the plot or character, resembling a porn film in a hurry to get to the "good stuff". The difference is that, in this case, the "good things" are not people who like themselves, but who inflict pain, which makes it an appropriate viewing for young adults. observe people having sex and I guess there is nothing wrong with "swimming with sharks" if you want to watch people suffer physical, emotional and psychological torture. But if you're looking for an incisive satire, interesting characters or anything else that even tries to engage more than your most vile passions, you should probably go elsewhere.
