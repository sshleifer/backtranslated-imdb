Wild Rebels is fun at the same time, but also frustrating because of the good elements, or at least the achievable elements, of the story. This is a race car driver (Steve Alaimo) who mingles with a group of bikers called Satan's Angels, who hang around a lot until they decide to rob a bank. Meanwhile, Alaimo is also recruited by the cops to tell them what the angels are doing and where they are going to fly. It's not even that the movie is really "old-fashioned", although of course it contains the incredibly crude and stupid music of the film (from the band on stage in a scene at Alaimo "performing" if you could call it that drek that, to the normal generic score). <br /> <br /> It's just that the filmmaker does not take any more precautions to put a little more logic, direction and better actors for the roles. As such, I did not have a great aversion for the film, unlike the Hellcats, but it almost left me a little indifferent. What might seem unpredictable is only stupid things like the name of the city of Florida ("Citrusville" ho-ho). Thus, its status as Mystery Science Theater 3000 has not completely disappeared. The comment is good on the film, even if once or twice I almost wanted to hear what the characters on the screen were saying in case it would have value. Wild Rebels might be more of a good time if you have a six pack and low expectations, but as it is, I will not look at it anymore.
