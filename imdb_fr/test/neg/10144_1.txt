This show is for people with an IQ below 80. The show's jokes are so lame. If you're on a desert island and you have nothing to do, you'll be better than looking at that trash ... You'll hate their accent, their behavior and all the stupid jokes and jokes they're trying to execute. it really pisses me off to see that the viewers gave 6.77 Reba for their vote ... Of course, I knew there were people with an IQ below 80 but what I did not know was that there are so many! So, if you are reading this, people, I hope you can never download or buy that peace of waste ... I know this is not the place for him, but I want to recommend a good best mini-series 'Scrubs'
