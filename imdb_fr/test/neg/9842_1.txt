This film is terrible. Not only is the story incredible, but the situations in which the characters have put themselves are so ridiculous that they are no longer shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, star of Broadway's The Secret Garden, decided it would be a milestone in her career. The idea is interesting, two girls who reach adulthood very quickly. But sex is not even exciting. The movie is silly, the story is silly, the performances are silly, and the whole concept, while interesting, falls flat. I'm sure all 14-year-old girls meet guys after they have had their first period and tried to throw their panties in the bathroom. Better luck next time guys. My ladder * Scale T *
