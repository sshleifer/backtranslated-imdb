There is nothing particularly unique or interesting in this series of low-budget science fiction movies. Regardless of its pedigree origin (the film is loosely based on a Leo Tolstoy novel), the plot and general themes of this film are by no means remarkable or original, science is at best weak, and unfortunately the film involves convincing action sequences. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a manned space flight to Mars. Although the main plot never becomes reality before the landing of the ship, most of the most interesting scenes take place en route. Unfortunately, as soon as our interplanetary travelers touch the ground, their previously interesting interpersonal relationships, their speculations on cosmology and the meaning of life, and all that is interesting about the film, give way to an inconsistent plot about the revolutionaries martians, environmental problems and not deceptive webs of deception. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film's production is also not remarkable. It is passable. And most of the actors are, albeit slow, OK. Cameron Mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a nice character. I guess the best quality of this film, from my point of view, is its sense of fashion. Martians have very nice outfits! If this film made sense, it could have been a lot more interesting. Never mind.
