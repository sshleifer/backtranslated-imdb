How is it in our day, people are still stupid enough to think that other idiotic stuff is smart? Maybe silly people like to look at things that make them intelligent. Such as 'The war at home'. 'Cuss, it's even dumber than the beasts watching it. There are no jokes, only half-jokes and light jokes that do not even warrant a small inside smile. The acting game is your typical, not very subtle, silly type of sitcom. And why oh why did this shit replace the arrested development? You have to give it to Fox. They know they need stupid shows to attract all stupid viewers. You see, the reason why Arrested Development was not very popular was because he was so smart. It was so smart that stupid people felt bad about being so stupid. And of course, if a silly person meets a smart person, that silly person will hate the smart person. Most of the time, anyway. Either that, or try to make fun of the smart person. If you like this series and if you are a stupid person, I really can not understand what it must be to not have eyes and open minds. I can not imagine what it must be to be stupid and crazy drones, influenced by every little thing. Basically, people who laugh with a laughter track are parrots. Trained, obedient and brainless parrots. Maybe I should not insult the parrots by comparing them to you. You know who you are. (If I look like a bastar * in this review, it's because I'm so annoyed that AD is canceled.)
