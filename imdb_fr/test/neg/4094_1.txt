I hated this movie. In simple terms, this movie is so bad that I almost do not want to look at it and never mention it again. But on the other hand, I can not resist a good denigration. And if there is one thing that Evan Almighty does for the public, it is that he brings out the best criticism. <br /> <br /> The film (a sequel to the much more funny, Bruce Almighty) begins by reintroducing the audience to Evan. Baxter, a simple character at best in the original movie. It is true. This movie does not show either Jim Carrey or Jennifer Anisten. Not even a little apparition. You know your movie is bad when the guy who agreed to do Ace Venture: When Nature Calls will not even have a role to play. But one way or another, they manage to keep Morgan Freeman as God. Well seated in the almost empty theater, bored by the lack of comedy, I could not help wondering how much money it took to secure Freeman to this film. Then it struck me an hour ago It's just a disposable role that takes 20 minutes in a 100 minute movie. God appears right between the scenes to tell Evan to build the ark. Of course, I know that Morgan Freeman will not be watching this movie in a year and will not judge him as good as his roles in The Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby, but it's easy money. <br /> <br /> Where was I? Oh yes, the plot. Sometimes it's so hard to stay focused on the plot when you realize you've thought more about the plot than the scriptwriter. Be that as it may, Evan (Steve Carell) has apparently left his news presenter post for a congressional position. Yeah ... without transition between the two. He never turns to his wife and says, "I think I want to be a member of Congress." This happens in the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with the big transition. As a member of Congress, he must join a bill proposed by the character of John Goodman when, suddenly, God seems to ask Evan to build an ark. No "Hey, how are you doing, what's the weather like?" bit. Just "I want you to build an ark." Proof of bad writing: Evan determines that God gives him clues to build an ark after noticing that a fan was waving a sign saying Genesis 6:14 as he passed his son watching a televised baseball game. <br /> <br /> This is basically the plot of Evan Almighty. There are some cast members who do their best to create comedies, but they do not do very well because they only have a little time on the screen. This is just your base in the family of mills that builds an arch movie. Oh, and there is also this obligatory scene where a father has to cancel his hiking projects with his children and his wife because he is busy working. They leave disappointed but they understand, like all the other times in the film, that it happened. I wish I'd love to see the youngest child turn to his father and kick him in the chin and say, "You're a bastard for canceling your plans with us. turn to me now. " There is also this drama that you expect from the father with his family when they realize (the woman, in fact ... the three children have no problem helping Dad to build an ark) that he went crazy and that he claims that God wants him to build a big boat. But do not worry. His family decides to stay with him. Oops, I just spoiled the drama. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this film is that there is hardly any good comedy. I know that the decision was taken to consider this film as a PG movie to elicit more reaction from the public, but I do not think I'm a minority when I think family humor is more than just men being kicked nonsense. take a dump. Maybe I'm wrong and that's where the quality of family humor has been reduced. And if so, please bring me more adult comedies so I do not have to worry about that shit anymore (unplanned word game). <br /> <br /> The end is extra. Suddenly, the film takes a dramatic turn filled with computer graphics that makes me shudder to think that it is a terrible mess in computer graphics. I bet it was expensive too. Finally, after all these expectations, we are told why God wanted Evan to build an ark. And my boy, oh my boy, I hated the reason why. I will spare the details, but it was like watching or reading a murder mystery and making the killer turn out to be the person who walked behind the main character for a second and had no lines. <br /> <br /> Oh and then there is a nice touch at the very end. The song "I'm going to make you sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" plays on the credits and we are then subjected to the "dance" of the cast. I do not understand. They spend 100 minutes without success making a comedy, then they finish with a thriller. I swear I was not so scared to watch Steve Carell dance since ... well, never. That's it for you guys. Evan Almighty is the scariest movie of all time. <br /> <br /> In the end, I thought it was a messy experience. I'm puzzled by all the talented actors (Carell, Freeman and Goodman) who appear in this evening alongside Lauren Graham, the wife of Gilmore Girls who has not yet proven to me that she can get out of a bag. paper. But most of all, I am surprised by my desire to stay seated throughout the film without going out. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out ****
