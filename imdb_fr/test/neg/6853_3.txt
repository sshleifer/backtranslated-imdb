I've never been disappointed by a Kurosawa movie, but it's probably the first one. "Doppelganger" is the worst I've seen from this director. <br /> <br /> Tartan Films announces this: "The most scary movie of Kiyoshi Kurosawa to date". What? The most frightening film of Kurosawa is undoubtedly "Kairo". And if you think it's horror, you're surprised. It can not be classified as horror or thriller. It's a drama, and a very bad one. Many scenes that are supposed to be shocking turned out to be funny, and the plot is really confusing. And since it's Kurosawa, the pace is slow. But it is so slow that you will lose interest in forty minutes and want to do something else. What irritated me the most is the use of CGI. Now, CGI, if used properly, can be really cool. But if done with little care ... It can be a disaster. I think it describes a scene that uses very little CGI. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can give to "Dopppelganger" is that she plays really well. Koji Yakusho gives an excellent performance, with the rest of the cast. But that's about all ... <br /> <br /> Please, do yourself a favor and go watch "Kairo" or "Ko-Rei" if you want to be scared. It's a bad, bad attempt at an intelligent drama. Which is smart, but ... Well, he misses a lot. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for the acting game.
