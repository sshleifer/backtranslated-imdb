What can we say about that? Really one of the most distressing experiences of my life. Your brain will try to stop as part of a primordial impulse of self-preservation. I was shocked by the experience of watching this "movie" and it took me a good two hours to fully recover. This film now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the infernal trinity of horror movies. I certainly do not speak of this distinction in a good way. I mean that in a terrible way. A terrible way. <br /> <br /> This film has no characteristics that redeems. Everything is appalling. Artless Camera-Work presents us with the ugliest frame that we can imagine, namely a lot of corn, a lot of mud. The story is more than stupid. The script is ?? Was there a script? The villain is extremely scary and wears yellow rubber boots. The children are annoying. The main man is without charisma. And he has the audacity to continue for 100 minutes. With no merit at any level, it is tantamount to torture. Normally, such a statement would be an exaggeration intended to produce a comic effect. Not in this case. I will even say it ?? it's torture. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was in a state of paralysis. It was brief luckily. But once restored, I decided to watch the featurette 'Making Of'. I had to understand. Perhaps there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity. Was it an elaborate joke? I watched the first 2 minutes of making "Making Of" and discovered that the screenwriter / director was, to say the least, somewhat misplaced. I also discovered that because I had taken the time to watch the first two minutes of Dark Harvest 2's "Making Of" featurette, I was an idiot. Not a pleasant journey of self-discovery. Life is zero. <br /> <br /> Very discouraged.
