Not to be confused with the parody of Michael Ritchie's 1975 beauty parade, this "smile" is an unfortunate example of these good intentions opening the way to hell. <br /> <br /> The film parallels two stories: an impoverished Chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a deformed orphan named Ling (Yi Ding), and the Malibu family created by a TV show performer "Gidget Get Birth Control". Katie (Mika Booram, the third Olsen twin) plays a spoiled, self-centered and remote student. His teacher (Sean Astin) paves the way for a school trip to China to show students how to work with malformed children. <br /> <br /> The film uses deformity as a means of suspense in treating Ling as Frankenstein's monster. Kramer continually masks his deformity through hats, hoods and camera placement. This approach exploits the quality of unusual spectacle inherent in the material. She may be uncomfortable with how society sees her and Kramer's answer is to cover her up to the big revelation. Why disturb your audience with such annoyance? We see her face briefly at the end and a few minutes before closing, snapshots of her credit after the surgery reveal a swan under the tip of her hip. It is not enough to give the girl a reason to live; What is imperative is that Ling is just as popular and as popular as Katie. <br /> <br /> Funding for the film comes from a trust created by the late Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They imagined a legacy of quality family films. Give me "Son of Paleface" every day.
