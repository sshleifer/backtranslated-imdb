I saw this film for the first time on a Saturday morning when I was very young. I thought it was cool and I thought about it often. Well, I finally reworked it on DVD. It was always fun but in a different way. It must be ranked among the craziest and most animated 1950s science fiction movies in the world. It seemed filled with images of military archives. The dialogue is open and the effects are raw. There is a line of dialogue that has put me on the back burner. The line that Jeff Morrow says on the beach with the baby. Rent it if you need a movie to watch with a group of drunk friends. It's a classic.
