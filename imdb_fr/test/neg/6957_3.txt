First of all, this movie leaves you in limbo humor. You do not know what to feel. So you do not feel bad for the character of Caines when his son is murdered (which is actually mainly due to a bad edition). The script was too bland. None of these situations matter when you look at them. The soundtrack, or the lack of soundtrack (if there was one was not even enough to remember), did not help at all. The only good surprise of this film was the performance of Andy Serkis. It was on a par with or better than Caine's. The story would probably have been better if Serkis had killed him. Because frankly, you do not feel any form of redemption in the climax. Just a feeling of lack of feeling, if you feel me. Basically, this film is massively missing. Leaving the public alienated throughout the whole thing.
