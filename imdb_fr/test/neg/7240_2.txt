The Salena incident is by far the best film by Dustin Rikert, the director - who does not say much. In his previous films (and I use the term "movies" loosely), the director takes ideas from Hollywood blockbusters and marginalizes them severely. The Salena incident is no different. The film is basically Con Air Aliens encounter made with the appearance of your average film school production. The film is riddled with fuzzy shots and special effects that would struggle to compete with most high school computer animation courses. For example, almost every explosion on the screen is the same effect of fire as the screen. <br /> <br /> The weak effects and the value of the production are only compromised by an imperfect conspiracy and a heated dialogue. In one sentence, the story is linked as an exhibition of overused Hollywood clich√©s. The film begins with the worst Alien CGI ship ever built, and a team of armies investigating. Then, a prison transport bus, carrying the worst of the worst in the state, is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde friends armed with silicon implants. The prisoners escape and run into the town of Salena where they meet extraterrestrials who ... SHOCK ... have escaped from an extraterrestrial prison transport carrying the worst of the worst of the galaxy. Prisoners and their captive police armed with firearms and sad puns must fight aliens and flee the city before the International Space Alliance lifts their eyes. * Bombs the city into oblivion. <br /> <br /> The only real real Pleasant parts of the film are when the actors (who are clearly undermined by the script) have the freedom to improvise and also when they fight the smallest alien creatures in a burst shots. Apart from that, the movie is really worth nobody's time, let alone the plastic that makes up the DVD. How was it terrible? Let's just say the Defense Secretary is about 90 years old, works in a room that looks like the high-tech real estate office of the 1950s and wears a Looney Tunes tie. Yes, if it was not clear enough before, THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PENTAGON IS TAKING A TIE WITH BUNNY BUGS AND THE ROAD TRACK. The film basically culminates (HAHAHahhaaa did I say culminates ...) with the last remaining soldier in the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team that is blazing a path away from the vicious extraterrestrials --- who for some strange reason leads them directly to the alien ship? yes ... <br /> <br /> The film has a heart, but it is assaulted by a horrible direction and a camera work even worse. Someone badly needs to hit the DP and tell him that cinematography is not limited to repetitive and stagnant shots at the chest. This film is not worth being praised (if it succeeds one day), because it is not as horribly bad as the last films of the director, which reduces laughter, but the cinema is far from to be watched.
