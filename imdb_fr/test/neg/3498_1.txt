This film was offensively on PC, predictable and clich√©. I could not imagine a film that better illustrates Hollywood's myopic and narcissistic preaching today. If you have not seen this, do not worry about watching it. If you have any, be brave and tell people how bad it is. My wife, a full minority, was offended by the inherent and endless racist message of the film. This film has nothing to do with the real world and does not have much to add to the discussion of racism in this country. Instead, it's the kind of sensational and cheap shit that is presented as a deep and stimulating thought. What kind of bubble do you have to live to think it's awesome?
