This film tells the story of a young girl who is going to live with her rich cousins, falls in love with one of her cousins ​​and refuses the advance of an amoral pretender who disturbs the family. After seeing the 1999 version and reading the book, I decided to look at the old version. I thought it was true to Fanny's character in the book, but it was also a boring character. The character of Fanny played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was dull; she often seemed about to faint. I did not like Robert Bourbage playing Henry Crawford either. I could not imagine him interested in Fanny or his cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood who played Mary Crawford was fine, but the wig she was wearing was so ugly. I lost interest in her role and continued to watch her wig. I was expecting him to let go of his head. I could also see a lock of her real hair under the wig.
