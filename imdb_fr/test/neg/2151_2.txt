I do not know if it's just a shabby film or whether he should make fun of a western "B". The screenplay was average, but filming, editing, and acting were simply bad. In addition, the background music was annoying, too loud and non-stop. Many times you could not distinguish the dialogue from the background music. I'm part of the SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) and I shoot in the Old West, and many actors are members of this group, that's why I bought it. If you are not interested in this group of people or this sport, it is very likely that you would not even have that little interest to help you with the movie. The game of even veteran actors (especially Stella Stevens) left much to be desired as well.
