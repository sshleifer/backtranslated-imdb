As a child, this film scared me green. As an adult, I could not help laughing. <br /> <br /> I did not have the pleasure of watching this movie via MST3K. I caught him on a late Saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters and there was more to do outside than picking up autumn leaves. I thought it had to be better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The film contains very good elements; a mystic who divulges water, a beatnik painter, a couple of ranch fools, a history buff and a "diabolical wind". Uh ... I mean ... evil head. An evil head which, as soon as the systematic hypnotism of each of the presents is completed, will seek its perverse body. <br /> <br /> The whole story unfolds in a perverse "ranch" that apparently does not grow crops or graze evil livestock. <br /> <br /> As all that is said by their resident mystic is "perverse", either you roll horribly your eyes, or you laugh until your sides split, depending on your mood. Me? I laughed until tears ran down my face. <br /> <br /> I remembered this movie as one of those who really scared me as a child. But some kids are scared of Santa Claus too ... no? Anyway ... if you are in the horror camp of the 50s, then it's definitely a movie not to be missed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good story, this movie has that. It is the extreme dramaturgy and the sheer innocence of the times that make it so horrible. The acting was just bad, but there were still good elements. Maybe it deserves a remake ...? <br /> <br /> He notes a 4.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
