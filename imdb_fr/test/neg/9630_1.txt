There is no saving grace in this dreadful, theatrical and boring repetition of sleep that evokes "The Ransom of the Red Chief"! <br /> <br /> Although there are big stars in this film, the acting is almost always terrible. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, normally a laid-back type of guy, takes on a forced emotion. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed is so exaggerated that she is laughable. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielson is unfortunately bad and terrible. <br /> <br /> The son is a little brat so repulsive that I found myself rooting for the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The only decent performance of this hodgepodge is the relatively minor role of the butler. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too tough with the actors, after all, they just read the lines that were given to them in the script. Ah, the scenario, this piece of artificial dreck that would pull on the strings of your heart but only turns your stomach.
