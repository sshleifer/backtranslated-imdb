Well ........ how and where can I begin to describe this total nonsense? Imagine the morality of a western western Hollywood, add a sumptuous part of the soap opera's most banal narrative and try to trick children into believing it's cool by pretending to be "contemporary". This film contains packages and has absolutely no substance. <br /> <br /> It begins with a promise ... of young men dreaming of becoming rock stars and engaging in the kind of excessive worship of heroes that everyone can make fun of. After that, everything goes down ..... faster than a bobsleigh without brakes. The scene of the first show with Steel Dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of "cin√© kitsch" I've seen for a long time. The singer appears on stage for his debut and falls on a staircase ..... will he get up and sing ??? ...... or will he stay on the ground without singing ...... who cares now ?? The situation is getting worse, but I do not want to be bored by remembering all its unsustainable details. If you look at it after this exam, it's your fault!
