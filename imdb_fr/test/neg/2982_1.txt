People at ABC forgot to do their biographical research ... so many scenes were just wrong! The actor playing JPII was very rigid, there was no personality. It is very obvious that this film was at the bottom of the totem programming survey, the move is so small budget. The script is terrible. Conversations like "You have to follow the rules" "No, people are starving." Lame. In addition, the film jumped like crazy from one event to another in order to get it back in two hours. Terrible! A better use of your time would be to watch a PBS documentary on JPII. In addition, CBS has produced a mini-series on JPII that is far superior to ABC. JPII was a wonderful man, and it bothered me to think that my grandchildren could get hold of this movie on ABC and that CELA was really what it was!
