I took 2:37 at AFI Fest in Los Angeles. It's a very well-done first film (although the DV format is starting to appear in outdoor scenes), and I'm sure he has good intentions to show us the "dark side" of high school - in others terms, all sides of high school. But the filmmaker does not have the talent to write or stage the promises of the film. There are several characters, but none of them is more than what the plot asks them. There is no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of "I am a troubled teenager X, I have a problem with Y". The perceived roles of men and women in this story are extremely troublesome. <br /> <br /> Let's start with men. You have the kid Stoner who is gay, the jock who is also gay, the boy who rapes his sister and Mr. Peepants. As the stereotype requires, all homosexual men must be sexually dissatisfied and violent towards women and themselves. Of course (or abnormally as the stereotype would suggest), the two gay male characters are striking women, Peepants and themselves. That would suit me perfectly if the stereotypes were reversed or if the characters transcended them. Yet none of them has happened and that's all there is in the stories of these characters. <br /> <br /> Next, the ladies. A young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife, another is the pregnant wife of the brother raping her sister, and there is the girl who kills herself (I will come back to this later). Again, I do not think filmmakers are required to be politically correct (I would not have any more work if they were), but I think this is only justified if the character or the story is more detailed. If this archetype was used to reveal something about a character other than "I am a teenager and life is nil", I would be happy as a clam. But nothing new is revealed! Nothing is subverted, modified or sublimated. <br /> <br /> Finally, the girl who kills herself. It's a blunt and extremely sloppy story. We are supposed to stay 5 minutes in front of a girl who kills herself violently and we have seen for perhaps 30 seconds throughout the film? We followed all these other stories for an hour and a half, and now we are invited to torture ourselves for a character who is not part of the story? It's cheap, exploitative and neglected. Despite the millions of crappy independent movies that preceded that, you have to WIN something like this. You can not just buy it on credit. So, this suicide happens, we get summaries of characters that go the same way nowhere else, and the film ends. What did I learn? I already knew that high school was bad - I was there, doing that. I already knew that people had stereotypical views about gay men and young women. I already knew that children with disabilities were laughed at. <br /> <br /> What else, then? Smoke, mirrors and beautiful views of the leaves. Oh, and the meanest deus ex machina I've seen in a long time.
