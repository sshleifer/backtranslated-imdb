About the movie itself, there are a lot of comments. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say something about the German version, which I saw recently on TV. He is severely cut. From 103 to 76 minutes! It is usual that the bloodiest scenes are cut for German television. I understand the reasons for that, but this movie was something else. They not only cut "shots", they cut entire sequences, sparing only glimpses. Like: "We must attack them" - a 5-second explosion in the camp - the protagonist runs away. <br /> <br /> When the onslaught on the island begins, it is even more possible to follow scenario. All cuts create something that looks like a series of erratic and disconnected scenes that no longer make sense. <br /> <br /> I could not bear to watch the end after spending 60 minutes at this nonsense. <Br/> <br /> I think I would have given the original 7/10. The German version is worth only 1/10 <br /> <br /> Get it on DVD (and check the execution time first) or forget it.
