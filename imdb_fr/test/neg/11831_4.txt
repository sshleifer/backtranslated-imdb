This is a semi-fictional memory of an "international man" who has witnessed various political upheavals over the last 30 years. <br /> <br /> I was hoping this film would offer a unique insight into politics and war. I also hoped it would touch and touch. However, I was disappointed by this movie. "Chico" seemed fragmentary, the main character, Ricardo, staying in a country for 10 to 20 minutes. As expected, no detailed scenario could be developed within this time frame. The excuses for moving to another place were often superficially explained. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in different countries.
