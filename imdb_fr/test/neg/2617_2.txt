Retro Puppet Master is complete and disappointing. In particular, the puppets look stupid and crappy. The acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid. .Retro Puppet Master is rated PG-13, the first puppet master to be rated PG-13. The film does not contain any horror or suspense. The fact that this movie was a Puppet Master movie shocks the spirit, Because this deposit does not see this movie, do not rent it and do not even watch it on TV, because this movie is obsolete, not violent, and completely crap. As a fan of Puppet Master, I am disappointed ... seriously.
