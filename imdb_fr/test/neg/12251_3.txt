Your idol will fool you in this movie. Stephen Nichols is misinterpreted as a young German student always bends under the orders of his father, although the actor is visibly in his forties. This makes her relationship (a collection of scenes of copulation in short) with a very young girl, even more disturbing. The character has no dimension and the representation of the war serves only as a backdrop to this porn wannabe. Nichols, who is one of the best television actors during the day, shows no passion for what should be the main interest of this film: watch him make love again and again with this girl. It's like watching two animals go there. If you're a fan of this actor's talent in other projects, do not rent it, you'll never see it the same way. If, on the contrary, you want to see Stephen Nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera, you may like it: Stephen will show you his bare buttocks, a lot of work on the language, his groaning range, Character who is obviously also motivated by the sex only by wanting to do personal things in front of the camera. He may have found it weird but I did not do it - a big disappointment!
