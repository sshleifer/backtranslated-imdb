I love B movies, but I like to be aware from the beginning that I'm watching one. I can not believe anyone can spoil a movie about aliens and predators. <br /> <br /> Extraterrestrials and Predators are great. This film made a big joke. The creators did not take this film seriously. I am deeply disappointed by the way Strauss's comics treated this film. They made fun of incredible characters. It's as if they were trying to be serious at first, then their writers broke down and gave up. Almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were awful and were NOT extraterrestrials or predators. I am so ridiculously sad that no one takes Alien and Predators seriously. These characters are icons of American pop culture and the creators of this film showed no respect for the original films. They should not have the right to take advantage of the names of previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves.
