An elite American military team that includes of course two beautiful women and a guy who does not understand teamwork, a lot of bats, terrorists and a team of Spetznaz who acts like a gang that can not shoot right - all thrown together in a scrambled plot with a mediocre game. This one has nothing special. The characters are not convincing. Even the setting, which offers great possibilities, looks like something coming out of central rural Pennsylvania and not to an exotic boreal forest in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> Bats are certainly ferocious. They can even take a man and fly with him for a few meters (harpy?) Or cut his arm. You see the Delta force surrounded by hundreds of bats with a guy who shoots them with assault rifles and pistols and then drops to the ground. It would be like trying to shoot skeet with a rifle at a distance of 3 feet. Totally helpless. The dialogue is incredibly unrealistic, with jokes between boys and girls and flirts in the middle of tense moments of the mission. One of the team members is struck by a mine and the first on the scene looks sadly at his body, stunned, not even bothering to shelter or protect the area. In fact, AFTER the rest of the group appears, it explains how the area is landscaped like a minefield - thanks for the heads-up bub. <br /> <br /> If you want a contrast in how a horror movie involving a small military group can be done well with a budget post, Outpost. Harvest is not the movie you want to see. In fact, I think I'll give it a two instead of three if I can spend the second half. This seems unlikely at this stage.
