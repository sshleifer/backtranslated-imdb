This movie was * good * relatively during the early parts of it. <br /> <br /> We have a story from 3 points of view. So let's find some clues and complete the story. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait ... none of that matters, because the FBI guys are the bad guys! Although it was a big turn ... it was almost a terrible turn. I immediately downgraded the film from 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10 to 15 minutes of it. <br /> <br /> Does not someone else see why this turn is so serious? Yes, it's a good shock. But it's bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the time and the previous twenty minutes. There is no connection with the killers. <br /> <br /> The killers are in pretty much every 5 minutes of this movie (as killers) and the two FBI agents are only 15 minutes an hour and twenty previous. <BR /> <br /> We get it ... surveillance ... Oh, the killers are voyeurs. WHAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE, because they were only described as psychopaths. And the hour of twenty minutes of surveillance that we look at the three floors goes through the window because everyone died in five minutes. <br /> <br /> All this makes the end even more ridiculous. Oh, they killed a group of FBI agents at the beginning ... what FBI agents are sleeping together? All in the same room. To be found and murdered by amateurs and imitated by people who do not know anything about being FBI agents? A cop 3 feet away can apparently not touch either one with a standard police gun that can fire several times. I hate movies that try to make you think it might be true when they make absurd jumps they think they believe. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that the movie ends about 10-15 minutes after their revelation. the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere ...
