People! is a "comedy" about a man whose parents beg him to kill him because they become senile and want to be put away from their misery. Many times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind, saving them from death at the last minute and losing a part of his body every time. The film seems to hate its main character, which makes it even more painful to watch. There is also the usual interest and the foreseeable end. <br /> <br /> This film is also the first time I see Tom Selleck without a mustache and I remember his lip I feel slightly smooth. But that could have been fair because of the terrible premise and poor execution of the film.
