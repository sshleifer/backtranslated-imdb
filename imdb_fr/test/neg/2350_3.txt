First, let me explain. This film is a real trash, but although it is a real trash, it is a trash better than it could have been. It could have been a big loss, but it's not ... <br /> <br /> What this movie did not have was such scary moments, a good game of actor and a good scenario. It was not very fun either. But the film had cool music, fantastic places and hot girls. It also works very well as a parody Dracula. (hope this has been said so, although I do not really think so) <br /> <br /> The story focuses on three girls in Transylvania, waking an old vampire, who terrorizes and then kills the girls a to one . Sound familiar? Yes, so! <br /> <br /> After reading it, you may think that I should have given it a better vote. The reason I do not do it is because I almost fell asleep at times ...
