It was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from one place to another - and the "thief" was obvious. It was a poor man (not to mention high school) "Less than zero". I would like to transmit this film because it has very little to add. There are so many unresolved issues, but it does not matter, but the questioning of exactly what is happening is terrible. The voiceover is necessary because the film does not work alone. Avoid this movie and look at something else about the rich teenage anguish. I'm sure there are many more to watch. Do not waste your time on it.
