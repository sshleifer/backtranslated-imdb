Oh, well I thought it should be a good action, but it was not. Although Jeff Speakman is a star, there is nothing to watch. Only two fights for almost an hour and a half, yak. ​​A lot of talk and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it. The plot is clear from the beginning. If you want action, do not rent this movie.
