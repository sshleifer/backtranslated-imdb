One thing I noticed about British horror movies of the 1970s is that they do not resist repeated viewing. THEATER OF BLOOD is an example, as are all these Amicus anthology films. Add THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR to the list <br /> <br /> Much of the drama of this film revolves around the constitution of a plot revelation at the end. Once you know what the revelation is, it becomes a rather flat film. It opens with a pretty good hook but after that we are treated with long boring sequences of two old ladies making small discussions. Correct me if I'm wrong, but how many people watch a horror movie expecting two old ladies to talk to each other? The anti-smoking position is the only interest found in THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR. Some people have mentioned that it was an anti-war or anti-military film, but look well and you will see that every time a squaddie lights up for a flush of fly, he is killed. Rather strange considering attitudes towards smoking was not as hysterical as today
