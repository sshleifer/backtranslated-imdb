When I borrowed this movie, I did not expect a high quality performance, but it was just sad. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were so incredibly bad that you could not get into this movie if you tried. Nothing like seeing a child announce things like "Oh no, my father is invisible!" or "I wonder what does it do?" in the same monotonous tone that one could announce traffic announcements on the radio with. There are some good actors, but they are wasted in small parts. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, although it would be pretty easy to guess, since there are not too many real-life scenario changes. Many holes too. For example, the father is invisible and the inventor determines what part is needed to make it visible again. So the boy will steal the coin from an electronics store. Could not he just ask his father for money? <br /> <br /> This appears in the comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was rather silly, as the invisible father undresses while being invisible. and then almost reappearing naked at a meeting, or walking around with your head covered at all times. It's funny at first, but it's getting old. <br /> <br /> 2/5, because it's viewable, and it's one of those movies that are funny in their own way ... like the monotonous recitation of lines.
