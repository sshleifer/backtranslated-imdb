It is painfully obvious that the people who made this "movie" have never seen parodies as brilliant as "The Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots". This film is terrible, as are the actors. They could not play even if it happened to them in the face, as I wanted while watching this pile of garbage. <br /> <br /> The movie is stupid and contains no humor. I'm sure I could make a better movie with my friends. For me, it's amazing that a movie can fail so much. Not a single smart or fun line. No trace of intelligence behind her. It's a pathetic film and I would like to meet the person who really loves this movie. Yuck!
