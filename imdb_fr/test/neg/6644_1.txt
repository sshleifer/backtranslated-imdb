To this day, I have never seen Elizabeth Shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. Neandertal badly acted, poorly planned and racial, it took place in a Chicago where every Black has apparently lived in a club of blues. . SPOILER AHEAD. . . . . .. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: His "blues" solo was even more painful to watch than his clueless play and the intro - "Nobody leaves without singing the blues" - was as silly as a post . The children that his character was babysitting were unbearable and well before the end of the film, I wanted something awful happening to them all. <br /> <br /> I must say, however, that there is something special about this film; It takes a lot for a movie to offend me, but that piece of simmering tripe did what Chopper, the Phantom Menace and Catwoman could not - make me sick in the stomach.
