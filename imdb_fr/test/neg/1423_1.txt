Jerry Lewis was slightly funny when he did not write his own material and had a good director like Frank Tashlin. When he started writing and making his own films, the little talent he possessed was overshadowed by his selfishness. Whenever his films failed (and rightly so) on the American market (they were making money in France), Lewis always accused everyone and everything but himself; For example, he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that he was, according to Lewis, released on a double bill with the feature film "Deep Throat". If anyone had to complain about this situation, it should have been the producers of Deep Throat. It's an absolutely silly "comedy" about the richest man in the world (Lewis) who is refused for military service during the Second World War and decides to equip a special "squad" to go to Germany and capture Hitler himself. In addition to the many faults in this film (the scenario is insane, the "direction" of Lewis is non-existent, the film has the look of a cheap home movie), Lewis apparently thought that surrounding himself with non-talent The Borscht Belt comics like Jan Murray and Sidney Miller were a good idea. he must have thought they would be so bad that they would make him look good. He was half right. they are embarrassing, but they are worse off than they are. For a "comedy", Lewis's character is sullen, angry and invading; the way he accumulates abuse of his subordinates makes one wonder why they would ever follow a fool of intimidation like this one on a dangerous mission like capturing Hitler. The fact that this film takes money is staggering. It's by far the worst Jerry Lewis film I've ever seen - I've heard that "Slapstick" was even more pathetic, but I can not bring myself to see if it's true or not - and it's is to be avoided at all costs. all possible costs.
