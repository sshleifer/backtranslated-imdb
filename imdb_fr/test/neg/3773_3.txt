Such a waste. John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserved better than that. For starters, JT was terribly misplaced in the lead here. The role called someone who could convince to be a broken anti-hero, someone who might seem haunted and defeated. Billy Bob Thornton could have done the trick, or even Al Pacino, but JT is too much alive and seems to have too much fun. In addition, someone who crossed the factory within the boundaries of the character of JT would surely have suffered physical effects? The character presented to the audience seemed to start as tight as possible for the Oakland Raiders. Scarlett behaved a little better in terms of roles. Where was the pain and conflict of what would surely have been a troubling development? And as far as "the plot" is concerned ... well, none of that makes sense. The characters jump from one state of mind to another seemingly without cause - and certainly without explanation. The rhythm of the film also leaves something to be desired, namely the rhythm. It's a very slow movie, I have nothing against slow movies, as long as they're heading somewhere. The pace only picks up towards the end, when it goes from a slow race to a frantic race to gather as many tired shots as possible. In this he succeeds - the only thing missing is something involving a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this one purely for the performance of Gabriel Macht - he was the only member of the cast who was a) well presented and b) able to convince in his role. In the end, a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a few hours.
