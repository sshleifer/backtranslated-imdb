This small budget independent film redefines the word "blah". What will surprise the most is that this word can actually be found in the dictionary, defined as follows: "absurdity ... without interest, dull, lifeless". The movie redefines the word because I should add to these four words: "shit PC", "pretentious on a pathetic level" and "useless". <br /> <br /> The film tries so much to be "hip" and "in touch" with the contemporary behavior and the "thought" of beautiful people who fight for the je-ne-sais-quoi (think they ?). There is almost no conspiracy, although there is one. The most phonetic and politically correct thing about this is how a white woman is a good friend with a young black stallion, the black street saxophone player who has a penchant for so wise advice and advice, and the big black psychic. Is not it nice how races can get along after all? ... Ahhhh ... In the end, the woman reads "poetry", which is nothing more than one of her dull "expensive diary" entries. She receives a standing ovation (!!!), even if, in real life, her listeners would probably have fallen asleep in a deep sleep. But this movie has little to do with real life, even though it's supposed to happen. In real life, her reading of "poetry" would have been ovationate if it had made sense to include juicy and sexual details. "And then I rubbed her huge penis against my pink little impatient and moist vagina ..." Worse, the main actress has a dozen scenes in which she bathes or fucks with someone, but they never the meaning of showing her breasts, which was clearly the only thing left to save this mess. <br /> <br /> Black and blonde, separated by a meter in height, connect: they look like a cheap variant of Rodman and Madonna (as if the latter two were not already a combination enough cheap). Nicole Eggert, mentioned by Howard Stern in her book "Miss America", is the blonde. Stern writes to Eggert that she has removed her implants. However, I believe that when they removed her implants, they also mistakenly sucked most of the meat into her flesh and muscles because she looks hungry here. <br /> <br /> The sax player in a scene develops as an angel wings; he looks like Al Roker announcing cakes from the kitchen of angels.
