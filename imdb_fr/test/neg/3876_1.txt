I'm not sure this film could ever match the first, even if it featured the original seven (though four were killed). He just does not have spark and chemistry. All the actors seem tired and seem to act as if they were looking for their paycheck. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see how Yul Brynner is "gorgeous" in the original movie but steep and unconvincing in this sequel. Yet when he played in Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s, his character (in the same black pants, shirt and black hat) evoked the same mystery and presence as Chris Adams of the 1960 film. <br /> There is nothing in this 1966 film to make it worth watching, even on cable.
