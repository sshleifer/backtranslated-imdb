Other commentators have described the film as "classic SciFi from the 1950s", thanks to the intelligent use of archive footage and documentaries, as well as intelligent character interaction. <br /> <br /> Nothing is further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's classic SciFi from the 1950s ... but SciFi from the 1950s at its worst blindly stupid. <br /> <br /> Consider that the first prey of the Mantis is a radar station shown first in flight and then on the ground. .. but the station is (seen from the sky) like on a mountain, with snow on one side and dark semi-cleared ground on the other side, but when investigators (on the ground) visit the site, it suddenly lies flat, plain uniformly white, miles from the nearest mountain. <br /> <br /> Also consider the ridiculous pseudo-scientific babble of the highly recommended expert who examines a huge claw. "Well, we know one thing ... it can not come from an animal, because every known species of animal has a skeleton, even reptiles and birds have bones." He goes on to say that some creatures ... snails, molluscs and crustaceans, insects ... have no bone skeleton. Excuse me? Let's define "animal" here. Not even in the 50s, no one over six could consider this man as an expert in biology, since he clearly did not know what an "animal" was, nor could he name several large categories of animals lacking bone skeletons. (sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, mollusks, arthropods, gastropods, sponges, arachnids, echinoderms ... you get the idea.) The characters are cardboard, types of 2D figurines ... scientists, scientists, lovers Sidekick, big bad monsters. Nothing here shows a sense of creativity. No pulse, no signs of life. <br /> <br /> There are no spiritual dialogues, special effects are ridiculous even for their time, and archival images are used with reckless disregard for continuity. It's a film B that beats to its peak, with a production team that clearly could not bother to try, even reluctantly. <br /> <br /> Use it sparingly, as a sleeping pill or punishment for small children who are easily offended by bad science.
