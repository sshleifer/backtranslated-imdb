In this film, there is a cowardly plot of a man (Bardem) who wants to get financing for his construction business and at the same time marries a woman he does not like (Maria de Medieros with wide-eyed eyes). He has a passionate relationship with his first and true love and ends up being entangled in his own romantic canvas. He never abandons his act of juggling until the three main characters meet face to face. The film gives a boring result, with a lot of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reactions in the film are absurd, inconsistent and of course, too stupid. None of the characters are credible, which makes the movie a bit boring. Anyway, the acting is surprisingly good for such a bad movie, which makes it a bit interesting, but if you can, look at another movie, please!
