I saw the movie after checking its rating on IMDb. At the time it was 8.0 and I thought, "Wow, it must be a good move". I thought badly. The beginning of the film is actually what the plot promises, but then it descends exponentially under its basement. I think that without Richie Nix's character, it could have gone well - even if it's the reason why the narrative is going on. The character is too extreme for my taste and hard to bear. In addition, the journey of the main character from the beginning of the story to its "climax" at the end is partly irrelevant and could easily be omitted - the alternative is that I simply did not understand the movie . <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that it's "easy to watch", and that I had no problem watching the entire movie, when it finished, I was a little impressed by the end. Overall, rather mediocre.
