I saw this short film on Ridley Scott's movie DVD, The Duellists. Before the movie, Scott did not show the movie, he just started. <br /> <br /> Boy and a Bike is not an example of Ridley Scott's other work, he has no resemblance. The film shows a boy, played by Tony Scott, on a bicycle. Guess what? It's pretty all that happens. The boy walks around, talking again and again with useless and confusing dialogue. The film was shot in black and white, and since it was directed by Ridley Scott, I was expecting a nice cinematography or striking scenery. Instead, I was treated with nothing. This film is not even good for a first effort. However, I recommend any Ridley Scott fan to check it at least once.
