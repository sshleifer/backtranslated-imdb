This film is beyond the horrible to avoid at any cost! I want my time and 20 minutes !!! <br /> <br /> Not funny at all, you can watch this movie without laughing or even smiling once. Swear out loudspeakers like a waterfall, each becoming more boring last and not contributing to comedy OR conspiracy (general comedy - not this movie in general!). <br /> <br /> In summary, it's a lame - a $ 5 film, sweetened - typified - "Out Cold" - but enormously horrible. The film focuses on two groups of the city Poories and Richies (where is it obviously silly?), Where the two opposing argue for snowboarding. (The story is very similar to that of a 4-year-old child in bed without all the swearing and stupid jokes) <br /> <br /> FILM - 1/10 - because you can not assign more scores low
