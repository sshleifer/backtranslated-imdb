I had not heard much about this movie, so I went to see it. I realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world. And even these people would think that the film has advanced too slowly. <br /> <br /> When the film opens, you see Nicole Kidman go to a nudist camp. Whoa. Shock. This scene, the dialouge, were all superb. And then the film tumbled. <br /> <br /> While respecting the vision that the filmmaker must have, this film is void. It was too slow, too predictable and did not move enough. Robert Downey Jr. is great, as usual, but this movie is not good enough to stay there. He tries to be shocking and unnatural, but does not use the talents of all the actors. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money, even the sex scenes were boring.
