I was interested in this film since it was quoted as "Worst Film Ever" in an entry devoted to 1950s science-fiction cinema in a British periodical of the early 1980s entitled "The Movie" (either by the way, the Leonard Maltin Film Guide). attributed to BOMB the unenviable rating). When he was released on DVD last year, I was interested in buying the "Cult Camp Classics" box in which he was included (with QUEEN OF EXTER SPACE [1958] and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH [1959]); However, since I had just acquired QUEEN on DVD-R, I was right about the idea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I stumbled upon the movie on DivX - but the impression was not extracted from the Warners DVD (which is said to offer a surprisingly pleasant transfer) but rather a muddy TV draw ... even if the detail is lost (that is, it was like watching the movie in sepia rather than black and white). -White!). Anyway, to get to the bottom of things: I must admit that, in a way, I was disappointed that the film did not turn out to be the laugh-I had anticipated since all this time (Maltin calls it "hilariously horrible"); In fact, I found it very attractive - and luckily short, it lasted a little over an hour. Certain undeniably fun elements remain, however, for example when the old nurse begins to scream at the sight of the 50-foot woman and when the sheriff's deputy almost crushes his chief and the main butler in his enthusiasm for the idea of ​​helping him . in such an unusual case. The special effects also did not seem to me to be "some of the funniest" (again from Maltin) in a movie - although they are certainly embarrassing! <br /> <br /> OK, so the idea that an alien (human-sized, gigantic-sized, dressed in caveman's rags, and radioactive to boot!) comes to Earth in a large spaceship in the shape of a ball (!) and apparently after the heroine's favorite necklace is a total nonsense - and its almost transparent appearance does not serve it at all ... but, in reality, it's human history which holds our attention (relatively speaking). The character of this accomplice husband is not very interesting, but his two women are: Allison Hayes, a rich but tenacious alcoholic, and an ambitious vixenish girlfriend, Yvette Vickers. The faithful servant of Hayes (already mentioned), two policemen (one of them, as noted elsewhere, are kind) and as many doctors (one of whom is called Dr. Cushing [!] And another a specialist who called when Hayes started to get fat after being exposed to radiation). <br /> <br /> Of course, the film could be seen as the reverse feminine version of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957). it would not be fair to compare the two, because the Jack Arnold / Richard Matheson classic is much more psychological / intellectual; In fact, Hayes does not seem to care too much about her "condition" and takes the opportunity to teach her husband a lesson! However, its unleashing - exaggerated in the movie posters of the time - is rather picturesque (especially considering that this has only happened for about ten minutes); When we do not show her the damage done by her huge but extremely unconvincing hand (especially when she raises the puppet supposed to be her husband!), She is mostly seen walking in long distance and almost from behind (with her even unequal size compared to buildings it goes through) !! Nevertheless, the disappearance of Hayes by electrocution (when she knocks in an electric cable) is carried out with competence. <br /> <br /> Finally, I followed with his 1993 televised remake with Daryl Hannah as a titular creature - whom I praised specifically for this purpose.
