I tried to like this movie. I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as Brad's Big Brain on Pulp Fiction. But I did not care at all about the characters. Kevin Spacey is an idiot throughout the movie and he even discovered horrible things that happened to him, I did not like him. Especially the end - which made me hate him even more. It was like watching a bad car wreck. Spacey played the sting well (he does all right), but other than that, I do not recommend it.
