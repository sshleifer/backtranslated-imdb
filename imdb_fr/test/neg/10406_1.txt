And of course I did not see it! <br /> <br /> But watching the cast and seeing that Doug Masters came back from the dead, I know now to avoid that like the plague! I hate when Hollywood, producers, screenwriters, directors or all the above, think the public is stupid not to catch any continuity errors. Doug Masters, who is supposed to be dead, is a big giant, is not it? <br /> <br /> And I can not believe that someone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would come back for such a thing. <Br /> <br /> Did Jason Gedrick really decline that? Well, I hate to say it, but even if he took over the role, he would have always had the same error of continuity. I bet (if he really refused), he must have been incredulous to see that his character died in the second film. <br /> <br /> I will probably take it by accident during a late night show on a channel, but no way will rent or buy the DVD!
