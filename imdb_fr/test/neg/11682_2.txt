Hmmm, not a patch on the original Shaw Brothers. The fights are average and seem very clumsy. The story is about a 70s Kung Fu movie, confusing and stupid. Stupid vocals for women, lined with chic English accents for men. I turned it off early and I like martial arts movies. Get the original, it's so much better than this average movie, do not be fooled, I bought the wrong movie what I wanted, it was the Shaw brothers movie. I just started commenting, I only do martial arts and foreign movies, this is just the beginning of my film collection, I personally own most of the modern martial arts movies. I hope you do not waste time watching this one, it is reserved for hardcore fans of Kung Fu 70s.
