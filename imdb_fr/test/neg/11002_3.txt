The Fanglys is located in a small Texan town called Layton on the eve of Halloween, because the townspeople treat it as the second coming of Christ or something of the sort. I mean Halloween is not that important, is it? Be that as it may, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) was called to another murder while Ned, a boy from the area, associated with producer John William Galt, discovered a body in the woods of the area. Could it be Lady Fang (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teens, who knows? As a fun guy, he's Mark (director and producer Robert Harvey) convinced his wife Kelly (Laurie Reeves) to go to a graveyard that his friend Steven (Josh Gobin) had found the night before for a party. Halloween. The idea of ​​spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to Kelly and she accepts, with Steven and a girl he has picked up, Camille (Natalie Woods), and their boyfriend Jerry (Tim Boswell) that they have settled for a fun evening, and as much as you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery. However, they quickly discover that the legend of the Fang Lady is far from the literary story that many tell ... <br /> <br /> Edited, executive product, written and directed by Christopher Abram The Fanglys is a nice attempt of dirt a horror movie. The scenario is very predictable, boring and offers no entertainment value, in good hands and with a decent budget. Fanglys could have been an effective horror movie, but that's not the case. The film is moving at a good pace but the on-screen action is so weak that it does not matter, I do not really know what to say except that The Fanglys is a very bad movie and I can not see. anyone who derives pleasure from it. The dialogue is basic, the characters are clichés and lifeless, while overall, the film seems much longer than the 90 minutes of film. There are some humorous attempts at humor that do not sit well alongside the horror elements and what did this delay keep in this cage? I imagine that the budget did not allow the filmmakers to show it. Oh, if you want to know what happens to Jerry in the end, you will also have to look beyond the end credits when the truth will be revealed, assuming you can actually go that far, of course (believe me, he must do something). <br /> <br /> Director Abram does nothing special. Abram thinks that bathing scenes in the neon light are elegant, I can tell him that this is not the case when your movie is supposed to unfold in the woods. There is no atmosphere, fear, tension, excitement or any of the elements that make a good horror movie. Forget the decent gore, there is a little when someone eats the skin of an arm and a fork stuck in someone's throat. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the Fanglys had a filming budget of $ 2,837, making it one of the most economic movies ever had a commercial release, & to be brutally honest it shows. What about the retarded guy and his fake teeth that look ridiculous? The terrible special effects, the cinematography of the camcorder and the terrible acting of each of the actors involved make it even more difficult to go unnoticed. <br /> <br /> The Fanglys is a shit straight to the video, it does not have any redemptive features whatsoever and its IMDb user rating is quite justified, it's one of those films that, in half an hour, I examined the clock and wished that the thing ends.
