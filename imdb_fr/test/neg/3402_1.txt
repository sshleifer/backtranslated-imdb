Basically, it was obviously promotional material for the film produced by the same director, which is even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen, so avoid it at all costs. <Br /> <br /> As for this documentary, it is entertaining; entertaining and obviously misleading! Most "historical" sequences are more likely unrelated historical sequences of events that have been sadly copied and pasted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it otherwise would have been. There is no doubt that Waverly is a rather interesting place, rich in its own fascinating history, but the making of a documentary intended to commercialize the locality and the associated production are, in the absence of more precise words, frighteningly useless. <br /> <br /> And yes, I have lived all my life in Kentucky and have visited the place many times. Waverly Hills deserves respect; and this lame documentary is not respectful.
