Ridiculous infamous advertisement of Bad Cooper. Includes Pepsi, Dell, etc. cameos <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing deserves to be saved here. Donald Sutherland, the score, the transitions of scenes, etc., are particularly painful. An embarrassing production. <br /> <br /> Hi, they should pay you the viewing of it.
