All the critics of this film are quite valid! It's pretty boring and filled with all kinds of useless ridiculous things. A couple exchanging nods on their "good larva". An average shot of a desk while the phone rings until someone finally comes in, sits down and responds at a slow pace. Quadruple-takes or more when people look at things. Solitary banjo tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. Telling a joke to a wild beast about a big mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed his babies, supplemented by many big mouth expressions (which are needed for the low hitting line). The sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread, which becomes unpleasant for thirsty when it comes to people burned in a fire. Many seemingly archival records of animals, birds, insects and spiders in the woods. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a forest fire, then at least a few decades later, the same woods are killed by an ax. Obviously, the murderer was not too happy with the ax that he stole and kills others with other weapons or his bare hand. <br /> <br /> If it is true that the movie in the version available at the output The original video tape is cut off. Maybe if a lot of footage has been cut, she deserves a new look at DVD. Otherwise, it's just not very interesting and would probably hurt the patience of the most hardcore outdoor fans.
