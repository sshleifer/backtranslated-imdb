It is clear that this would have potential in more competent hands, but considering the record of Uwe Boll, it would have been surprising that this farce had any merit. <br /> <br /> The first 5 minutes are from the classic madness of monster movies - Even the terrible one-liners delivered by GI Joe-type soldiers have the feeling of being kidnapped from another adventure in the same kind. <br /> <br /> You will do yourself a favor if you leave the movie at that time. . You have already passed all the strengths and you have saved yourself the trouble of getting through some of the worst players in recent history. <br /> <br /> Then enter the absolute talent for waste. The main man has the same charisma that you will find in a garden slug. <br /> <br /> There is a bit clumsy artificial romance - it seems so unacceptable that you can only speculate why this scene was imagined in the first place. Normally, the genre uses interludes of romance and nudity to inject a little humanity and sympathy into characters cut from cardboard - here it turns against all the cylinders. <br /> <br /> The effects are bad and the action is incredibly boring. Where other classics are original and imaginative in the face of budget constraints - here it looks like everything has been spent on catering. <br /> <br /> There is actually no feature that redeems here - not even the "it's so bad that it's almost good" applies. It's just bad and the wrong way. <br /> <br /> Our hero questions the starlet about the night they spent together and how they would classify it. She gives him 2 out of 10. I give the whole thing 1 (I would have chosen 0 if it had been possible). <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this dribble, there is a lot of movie shit out there, which goes beyond this ridiculous ridicule in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Oh, and finally, the movie has virtually nothing to do with the popular Far Cry game (at best, it's extremely loose on it). <br /> <br /> Horrible, go ahead!
