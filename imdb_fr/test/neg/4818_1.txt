A native of New Orleans, I can say that almost everything in this film, from the atrocious dialect of the N'Awlins to the very creative "manipulation" of the geography of Crescent City, is horrible. Here's another of those Hollywood movies that decide to stereotype New Orleans as follows: 1. A city full of French-sounding idiots 2. A city full of people who sound like they're coming home from home summer of Blanche Dubois 3 A city of drunkards, where Mardi Gras is daily 4. A city of deep mystery, where almost everyone practices or is a victim of voodoo (I admit that we are perhaps a city of drunkards, although each day is NOT Mardi Gras). "The Big Easy" is one of the worst movies on New Orleans. I would not recommend it to anyone.
