There were only two reasons for me to see this movie. First, Stellan Skarsgard and Marisa Tomei (who are both good actors) were there and I had nothing better to do. Seeing the movie, I immediately thought of something better to do: sleep! This film is a total waste of time. This is a standard movie of former cop. The ex-copper is the best that ever existed, but it was fired. He continues to do things alone to the disgust of his old friends and he saves the day. All the big surprises (not !!!). Go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try this one. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
