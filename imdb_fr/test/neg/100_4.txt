I could not wait to see this movie. Actors trustworthy, interesting plot. Good atmosphere then ????? IF you are going to try something that is meant to summarize the meaning of life. First. Know it. Okay, I did not expect the directors or writers to really know the meaning, but I thought maybe they'd offered crumbs to peck and treats to add gas to the fire . they almost did. Things I did not have. A woman wandering in dark places and isolated car parks, away from the consequences. Great riddles that have fallen by the wayside. The promise of the knowledge that it contained by the alleged criminal origin. I had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense. I understood and I can let myself go to the lyrics on crazy and found the crucial role of Adrian Paul, then penetrating ????? Basically, the story and the script were good up to a point and it was the last 10 minutes or so. What? Short of ideas! What a shame that this film must have let us down so badly. It may not mean the meaning, and I really did not expect the writers to understand it, but I was hoping for an intellectual, if not spiritual, ride, and I ran into an obstacle.
