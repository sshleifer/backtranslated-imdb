Thomas Edison may have done a lot of great inventions, but WTF, that's it! I'm sorry but this movie is just horrible. The plot is that this elephant is working at some point and gets electrocuted. The picture quality looked like someone who used it for toilet paper. I thought the first Charlie Chaplin movies were terrible. Okay Thomas Edison may have been an inventor, but why did he shoot this film? He could have filmed a baby being fed and it would have been better. People might say that I am hard at once, but would you like something like this from what I said? Edison may have made the light bulb, but why did he make this film in particular? Well, I might look like a complete hole, but look at this on Youtube, and then you'll see that abomination. I still can not believe that this movie is completely horrible. The worst short film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10
