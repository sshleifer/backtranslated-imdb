The 2002 version of "The Time Machine" is only the latest in a series of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that are falling flat, despite extravagant special effects. <br /> <br /> What a bland story, insipid and unimaginative, without imagination. Why so completely rewrite such a great classic of science fiction? Are today's moviegoers too hip for H.G. Wells to write much as is? 1960's George Pal's version told a much more engaging story, even with cumbersome low-budget effects, Eloi at the beach, and Morlocks that looked like Smurfs on steroids. <br /> <br /> The 2002 version had to include HG Wells turning in his grave: <br /> <br /> 1. The idea that the temporal traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and imprisoned in a temporal paradox is an old cliche of science fiction. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena ?!) that made the 1960 version so endearing. This gives an unfortunate and distracting tone that makes the whole movie painful. If Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant, he or his friend Einstein would have understood the dilemma of temporal paradox. do not have it on him 800 000 years in the future ?? of a Morlock no less, Doh !! What's wrong with the trip in time just for fun, adventure and curiosity - as evidenced by the 1960 version? <br /> <br /> 2. If you saw the first movie, you would realize what Pearce was doing with the time machine when you first watched it. George Pal's film carefully explains the whole strange notion of "travel" through a 4th dimension. <br /> <br /> 3. The director makes every effort to make the character of Pearce look awesome, an old stereotype of scientist. In the 1960 version, Rod Taylor was also a bit of a mess (at least around Weena), but managed to be playful, playful and charming. <br /> <br /> 4. Among the key themes of the 60's version - abandoned in the remake - is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Exploding the moon to destroy humanity is useless - and does not do much for science initiation. For more than 4 billion years, the Moon has suffered much more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. Yes, science fiction needs an artistic license, but it's just stupid and meaningless. <br /> <br /> 5. Destroying the time machine is stupid. Apparently, our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Exploding the machine to kill Morlocks is a kind of "machina ex machina". Disappointing, Pearce never returns in the 1800s to tell his story to his incredulous friends, a key part of Wells' story with irony the week, the time that goes goes into the distant future and back. <br /> <br /> 6. Running Morlocks during the day totally ruins the spooky and macabre portrait of H.G. Wells as dark creatures of the night. A true film opportunity lost. In addition, Wells described Eloi as fragile and childish. Those guys in the movie looked like they could fight Morlocks, if they were not that big. 24 / <br /> 7. The only intelligent Morlock ?? a sort of discolored Star Wars Evil Emperor - had potential, but is so lame and aloof that he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home ?! Boy, what a dramatic climax! In the book, the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it and fight to keep it. <br /> <br /> 8. The awkward ball hologram of the NY Public Library is too much. This illuminates the idea of ​​human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply included "talking rings" that offered a dark and gloomy eulogy to humanity. A derailed evolution is a serious matter. <br /> <br /> It is sad to note that the wonderful effects of this film can never compensate the artificial lassure of a script. Save the price of a ticket and popcorn and rent the DVD when it comes out (soon, without a doubt), at least you can advance quickly in dull parts, just like our time traveler.
