Well, I must say that I own this movie and that I only like the end. The film is boring and slow but the final fight is so funny. Let's just say that if the fake bird did not attack the main villain, this movie would be a 0 out of 10. This bird makes it a 3. If you're really bored or want something awful looking to praise this and fast forward at the final battle.
