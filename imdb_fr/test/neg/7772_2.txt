Lazy writing, acting and directing lead us to a Canadian production TV movie called HUSH in 2005, not to be confused with about eight other films of the same name. Tori Spelling and her doctor husband move from San Francisco to his little hometown, where they meet his old friend, who decides that she still loves him. She gets pregnant with Tori's baby (does not ask) and starts overthrowing anyone who might get in her way as she plans to regain her old flame. The actors who play the old friend and the doctor are not worth mentioning because they act more flat than flat. Tori is not much better, but at least she must be intrigue-centered before the conclusion reaches a very lame and all too familiar conclusion. Look rather THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE.
