At least if you're a fanatic of Disney (well, the variety who loves his real action movies as well as his animated movies), if you're a kid, if you're a child of heart almost to the point you realize to you're an adult, if you absolutely love all movies featuring animals, especially when doing tricks, or if you're not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is a bit pleasant to watch . I am a fanatic of Disney. I liked this movie and I will watch it again. <br /> <br /> But he has a lot of problems. The main flaw comes from a combination of too many characters, too many intriguing threads, and enough time to support them all. In the space of 82 minutes, adults get married, teenagers fall in love and try not to be embarrassing, a teen contest for love and jealousy, preteen girls playing spy games, dogs lovers, dogs playing football, dogs having puppies, manipulative parents who will do anything for their children to win, children teach them a lesson, housekeeper dilemmas and crooks who prepare and execute elaborate intrigues. I'm probably forgetting something, but there are 10 major conspiracy issues to deal with, with less than 10 minutes per thread to process them, and presumably they form a coherent whole that is not too complicated - it's a game child. movie, after all - and it's also humorous and comforting. Unsurprisingly, director Bill Bannerman, in his first completely responsible lap (he has a lot of experience in the second unit), was not quite up to the task. I'm sure the fact that there were at least three writers involved and probably dictating the producers also did not help. <br /> <br /> The end result is that Air Bud: World Pup is extremely hectic. Events happen with little justification, and worse, often with little explanation. People understand and do things primarily because they need them - and quickly - so that everything can happen where it takes in less than 90 minutes. From one cup to the next, the time may be about six months. We have adults who seem to be mentally handicapped and children who intuitively understand what a dog thinks and rush into an unexpected action. Some of the threads should simply be deleted, because it is difficult to engage in the film when as soon as you are introduced to an idea, it has already passed to you. <br /> <br /> the fact that one of the sons is essentially a scam of One Hundred One Dalmatians (1961), less a character of Cruella De Vil. And another problem is that, considering the way the film went up, I have to assume that the dog, Air Bud, probably could not do much with the football. Unlike the first two movies, a dog practicing a sport is almost an afterthought here, and when we see it, it's very fast; From time to time, these extracts even seem to be assisted by a computer animation. <br /> <br /> Yet for someone like me, Air Bud: World Pup has a cheesy charm. The scenario and the performances often oscillate between ridiculous, hokey and a little cliche. I tend to like this combination. This makes the film a little predictable and subtly bizarre. And sometimes, as the end, when the film completely abandons consistency and becomes essentially an advertisement for the US football team, Air Bud: World Pup is so heroic that you can not help but love it.
