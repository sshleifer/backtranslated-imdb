This strange little film begins with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a Catholic school that has no friends and gets beaten every day. He likes to wear dresses and his obese mother, Angela, who is a seamstress, does not think his son likes anything. Angela complains to Mother Superior (Kathy Bates), but she is ignored. When they enter their car, they are harassed by the other children and are bombarded with eggs. Bruno's father, Dino (Gary Sinise), divorced Angela. He is totally disgusted by the fact that his son is a wet chicken and practically denies him. Bruno meets a new student at school, Shawniqua (Kiami Davael), free spirit and who dresses as Annie Oakley with hooded guns. Angela has a heart attack and Bruno's grandmother intervenes to take care of him when Dino refuses. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very hard and unfriendly look on all the characters involved. Angela has a lot to do with the fact that Bruno wears dresses because she practically encourages him. When his mother said it, Dino had learned that he was a wet chicken because he loved opera and now refuses to help Bruno when he needs it. The Catholic school at which Bruno attends is very unruly and all the children run and even call Shawniqua the word "N". Once Shirley MacLaine enters the movie, she moves and turns more towards the family (so to speak). **** ALERT SPOILER **** The end after the bee to spell is incredibly artificial and "feel good". Bruno's hugs and cheers as the journalists follow him and take his picture for their papers. All the while, Shirley MacLaine behaves like the "big old guy" who makes fun of everyone. There is one thing about the MacLaine character in the movie that no one mentions in these comments and it has to do with the masculine nature of her. I think Helen's character could be a lesbian! She is very strong and strong. At one point in the film, she shares a whiskey shot with Bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time. I do not remember anyone in the movie who mentioned who her husband was or if she had ever been married! That's why I think his character could be gay. Many other good actors also appear in the film. Joey Lauren Adams, Jennifer Tilly, Brett Butler, Gwen Verdon and Lainie Kazan would all have had to take a closer look at the script before signing. I guess when they heard that MacLaine was running, it would be an honor to be part of it. It is very difficult to feel remorse or an understanding of the characters and the subject is probably impossible for most people. The actors are not bad, but what exactly did MacLaine aim for? Tolerance towards a young boy who wants to wear dresses and freedom of expression? We understood it in the first 10 minutes, the rest of the time I tried not to go back.
