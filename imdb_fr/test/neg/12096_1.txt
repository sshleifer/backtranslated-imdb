It may be the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen more than 300 movies in my life. The only brilliant task seems to be to judge the anatomical feats of the female members of the casting. After watching this film, it is suggested not to use heavy machinery or drive for at least 24 hours. We also recommend a bottle of Valium so that you do not feel bad for the lost 100 minutes of your life. The plot is not original, the dialogue is unbearable and even the weapons seem subnormal. Do yourself a favor and go to your local Blockbuster to burn all the copies of this horrible movie.
