It's a poorly written and misdirected short film, pure and simple. What is interesting and that makes me look, to a certain extent, is the value of production. Shot in video, it seems that the scenario and the direction are bad, one would think that it would also have a horrible production value. This is what the viewer expects when he watches a terrible film and is shot in video. BUT Not in this case, they spent money and it shows. It does not interest me to see what will happen next, just to see it! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst movie I've ever seen, which looked like a big budget for Hollywood, even though it was shot in video format. <br /> <br /> Instead of spending the amount of money they had to spend on a rather impressive set, it would have been more enjoyable to see a better-executed story in a good direction. But again, how can we expect new filmmakers to do this when even Hollywood will not do it?
