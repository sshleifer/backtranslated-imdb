I saw this during a drive-in at the age of 9. All I can remember are some scenes (those where the main character, She is chased by a masked man) and scared. Seeing him now, my opinions have changed. It is a pathetic "horror" film on an ophanage led by Gloria Grahame (sad) and dealing with a girl without talent, Elle, who is sent after his mother, the tramp of the city, was beaten to dead with a hammer (graphic). The film has teenagers (actually actors in their twenties) beaten, tortured, killed, hungry, attacked with pieces of meat, raped, etc. The brutal hammer murder is the opening scene, then things get worse. There is nothing to recommend about this shit. The plot is stupid, the whole dialogue is bad and the acting ... the less we say, the better. How did this disease manage with a GP rating (now PG)? He would get an R now. No value. One last thing ... a really repulsive ending suggests incest!
