This movie is not one of those movies so bad that you are pissed off and upset because it seems so crazy and yet it's not funny. It's just that there is nothing interesting in this film. There are no real fun jokes, you just watch for 80 minutes, then you turn it off. I bought this very economical DVD and I am happy because it is not worth much. It's not even one of those movies that's so bad that you can watch it with friends when you get drunk and laugh. I did not hate it as I hate some movies, but it's rather boring and it's not worth it to invest at any time. <br /> <br /> The only people who voted 10 on the votes of this movie have to be connected in some way because I can not imagine anyone who really loves this movie other than the little kids who pass the time
