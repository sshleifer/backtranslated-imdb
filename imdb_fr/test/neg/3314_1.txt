It is good that these three young directors produced films with good production values ​​and a correct acting game. There is good work here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they suffer from what affects a lot the modern gay cinema; recycled parcels, too familiar devices (I've seen the "pool" so many times in gay movies) and derisory scripts. The most egregious of all is "Dorothy" whose absurd postulate is that a cute young guy will have a hard time getting fucked in New York City due to a shortage of identifiable gay guys and nearby shorts play like little ones sticky business after school. Not much imagination in their writing or execution; Basically, they follow a point-by-point convention, shooting / reaction / shooting master that gets terribly dull after about five minutes. Todd Haynes, Sadie Benning and the late Marlon Riggs, the late Marlon Riggs, give hope to queer cinema, but not here. These films are incredibly average, singularly white and their values ​​embody a gay middle-class sensitivity. That's probably why they play so well in gay movie festivals.
