In case your dear readers have never heard of, this movie was the main inspiration of last year's Samuel Man Jackson-Eugene Levy clunker, The Man. This 80s comedy of action and comedy combines Billy Crystal, the Cameroonian and the late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer, Gregory Hines, with witty cops who do not respect the rules. That's about the extent of the movie. The interest is a bit stung by the delivery of the line of Hines which looks strangely like that of Will Smith and the now more famous actors cameos like Joe Pantoliano of Memento and Jimmy Smits of "NYPD Blue". My favorite scene is, I do not know, the car chase on the tracks, I guess. Basically, I consider this film as a major asset in the demolition of action movies. Well, this and Lethal Weapon 4 ... and Rush Hour 2 ... and The Man ...
