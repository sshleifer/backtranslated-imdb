First, the title has no relevance to the film. It all started with a good development, but became annoying when he could not tell his girlfriend what had happened to her. Even his attempt to inform the police failed, which only added to the value of the embarrassment. There were too many pregnant breaks in the movie that seemed more like a charge than anything worth it. The plot never revealed who committed this crime, although a good conspiracy would have allowed the disclosure. The end was nothing short of "hey we've run out of budget, let's stop it here NOW !!" ... If I had written a novel that ended that way, I'd be better. TRASH TRASH TRASH !!
