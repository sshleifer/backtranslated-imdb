It's a strange film. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but is filled with sexual insinuations. The premise is rather absurd, not just the idea of ​​shrunken heads of three dead kids battling crime, but the same thing said that kids fighting a bunch of beefy old guys are a bit far-fetched, but then again, parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority to keep children in the ranks. <br /> <br /> The cast is good, Meg Foster plays a very lean leader, with the handsome AJ Damato as the leader of the bullies. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst play the role of young lovers, although for a comedian actress of his talent, Leigh Allyn Baker is notoriously lost in this film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is unusual, but I do not think it's enough to compensate for poor quality and awkward performance. The landscape is rather dull and the "special effects" rather dark. Sit down, unless you're in the mood.
