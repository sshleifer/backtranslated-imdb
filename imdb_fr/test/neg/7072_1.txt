OK, fans, it's released on DVD. But the only reason to look at this is 1) to say you did it (because of its notoriety), or 2) if you're a fan of Bill Paxton. I'm not a hardcore fan of BP, but it was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from turning it off pure boredom. It's a shame, because it could have been a good movie with a script work and if it had been made by someone intelligent (and with a cast led by someone other than Judd Nelson, totally false and without talent). Of course, it's disgusting, but it's BAD, and not in a good way. If after reading all the comments on how this film is strangely revolting and dirty dystopian, you are always interested, do yourself a favor and see rather GOOD dystopian filthy and strange. John Waters' films, David Lynch, Peter Jackson's "Braindead", Henenlotter's "Basket Case", etc. all come to mind. There is a lot better there.
