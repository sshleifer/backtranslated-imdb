When I saw the movie trailers, it sounded like a good romantic comedy. I was expecting a slight mellow pleasure. Instead, I got bored and a little depressed. <br /> <br /> Honestly, there was no chemistry between the protagonists, and the film had little, if anything, funny about it. The little girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought they might have used someone younger in the role. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film was filled with long dull silences or swelling of opera music. I am not against the opera, but I would have preferred that they spend this time to make us know the characters, all stiff and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed with this movie. Throughout the time I was watching, I thought how much better it could have been.
