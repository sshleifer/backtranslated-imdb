It's such a shitty movie that I have no idea how it got on the shelves, they had to pay the movie store to put it there, seriously! The story makes absolutely no sense, unless you consume very heavy drugs, you absolutely must be on something to watch all this junk, so you would not worry about what was on TV almost in the coma. The writing seems to have been done by a child of 5 years and the acting is worse than the theater. The hideous special effects they were trying to make look so stupid, what did they spend $ 5 to make the whole movie, it looks like it! Oh my God, this scene with the old woman who has an 80s hairstyle and naughty girls in rubber suits, my friends and I laughed a lot. Did anyone really think it was a good idea to make a movie? I find that hard to believe!
