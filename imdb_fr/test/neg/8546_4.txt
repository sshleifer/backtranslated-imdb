A multimillionaire marries a female doctor. He has not worked for a day and is dedicated to his job. He sees it every day. Something must give. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Henry Fonda, finally decides to do something with his life. He becomes a salesman in a department store, but is quickly dismissed because the poorest need this work. In the meantime, Dr. Helen Hunt, (Barbara Stanwyck) has given up her practice? What is there to do? <br /> <br /> Kirk (Fonda) buys a bankrupt hospital and both must now be happy to help others while making a living. <br /> <br /> What is written here? When annoyed by her husband, Dr. Hunt said, "You acted like a gestapo." This is supposed to be a comedy. Bullshit. <br /> <br /> A very boring and tedious film. Very few things here.
