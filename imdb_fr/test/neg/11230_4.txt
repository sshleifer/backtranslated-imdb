Ken Russell made this strange (not very) erotic thriller and if I did not know that I would have staked my life on the director, Brian DePalma. Absolutely everything in CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma, from hectic cinematography too enlightened to the domestic scenario that turns into a plot, to the title shouting "Depalma, DePalma, Depalma" <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, since Brian DePalma is more and more perceived as a poor man, Hitchcock over the years, Russell should have tried to imitate his own style. Of course, an erotic thriller in the style of TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would have been weird with a capital B, but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience. The stories of prostitutes who led a dangerous double life and were harassed by a religious maniac were commonplace in the 1980s video market. Oh and Anthony Perkins play the same role he has played in almost every movie that he made it in the 1980s. Yawning <br /> <br /> The controversy that this has caused is the only thing that really matters in CRIMES OF PASSION. I guess the studio was happiest to hear this because no ads are bad, but as for the controversial sex scenes ... What controversial sex scenes? There is no and the only controversy I can think of is that of China Blue dominating a policeman on guard with a baton. Needless to say, he did not come slowly HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
