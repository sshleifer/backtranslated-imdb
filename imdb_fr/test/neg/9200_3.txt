I really enjoyed the movie. It was really cheesy at times. (They destroy the bad guy with a hair dryer - but where are they hooked?) This is a unique film, and I enjoyed the cast of actors Courtney Draper and Tamara Hope. I also liked Fanuel a lot (as you write ...) as Megan's charecter because she called him dweeb. In addition to the acting, the "going back" and demonstrating what happened from the point of view of Ariel, then Megan, were quite interesting. I saw him twice and I would see him again
