I saw for the first time a poster announcing this film on a street in Helsinki, Finland, in June 2000. What caught my attention is the proud proclamation informing all readers that the film, although itself French , had been "banned in France". When I got home in New York, I discovered that one of the city's "Art House" theaters was screening the film. That's why (with my Finnish fiancee) decided to see what all this fuss was about. We have already done it. <br /> <br /> From the comments read here, and the critics I knew were violent and sexually explicit. Not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions, I went out of my mind to see what had disturbed the sensitivity of our Gallic cousins. Presumably, as everyone who reads this story knows, the story tells the story of two women embarking on a criminal and murderous adventure in France (the film is subtitled in English). The resemblance with "Thelma and Louise" however ends with this; sex is exceptionally graphic (and hearty) just like violence (a lot of trampling to death, a lot of blood and other organic matter splashing after the impact of a bullet). <br /> At the intellectual level, one could say that the very essence of the film is the relationship between sex and violence (as evidenced by the only sex these women know: a small prostitute, and the other has won the money from time to time in pornographic films.When they have the upper hand on their sexual situation, when they react to crime and murder, they react with the same violence and the same brutality they know. and understand themselves, but it is important to note that the victims of their ravages are not only scary men who are interested in scary sex (there are many) but innocent bystanders, a woman at an ATM , for example, too. <br /> <br /> I do not really understand why repeated shots of "porn movies" were all that was necessary (except to describe the physical contact as being cruel, without passion and degrading) and implacable gore It has become rather tedious after the first violent spasms. with rude and rude people and equally unpleasant circumstances. From a certain point of view, the life of French subclasses is explored and it is rather dark. a travel diary for France is certainly not, it is perhaps for this reason that the French have banned it. <br /> <br />
