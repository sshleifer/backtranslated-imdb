I should have realized that any set of two videos sold for only $ 6 would be bad. I even read the reviews before watching this movie, and it still has not influenced me. I loved the book and I knew it could not be as bad as people have said. <br /> <br /> Yeah, that's the case. <br /> <br /> A patchwork of movies, videos and what appears to be archival footage together make a three hour tour of a chapter in James A. Michener's epic novel. Well, the period covered was a chapter, but I do not remember many situations that actually occur in the book. The packaging of my copy of the film gives Maria Conchita Alonso a place of choice, even if it turns out that it is only in a scene. On the second cassette. <br /> <br /> We must congratulate the actors for having played their role well, despite a complicated and overloaded scenario. However, they must be insulted for accepting the roles at the start.
