I had this film in the library and I saw that there were a lot of actors that I like (John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc.), so I got it and I I watched it. I was expecting Cleese to play an important role since his first billing. I was surprised to find that he had about five minutes on the screen, as well as everyone I liked. This film is incredibly useless, the characters are nothing, the plot is non-existent and the end is one of the worst I know. There were some fun parties, but that's about it. Stay away from this film if you want to avoid saying "What?" and "Huh?", a lot. And if you do not want to waste your time. Ignore people who say it's a very funny movie ... it's not. Stay away at all costs ... please.
