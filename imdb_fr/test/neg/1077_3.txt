"The Italian Job" is a caper movie made with numbers. On the back of each snapshot of capers, it does not rise to a particular height and will be a bottom note of film towards the end of the month. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that "The Italian Job" has no imagination. at all. I saw everything before and I did better then. The role play is perfect, cinematography is quite acceptable, but this film contains nothing new. <br /> <br /> Let's cut the clichés: <br /> <br /> - figure of the criminal father "old school" and his protégé <br /> <br /> - another member of a gang jealous of protected <br /> <br /> - a double cross <br /> <br /> - only the bad guys use guns while the well-intentioned criminals do not have to <br /> <br /> - the good criminals always make fun of bad guys <br /> <br /> And these are the first fifteen minutes or so. Everything is so predictable. Even burglary and car chase scenes, which are supposed to be the highlight of the movie, seem pretty ordinary. This is especially true since they appeared in movie trailers, so I already knew what to look for. <br /> <br /> For me, a caper movie only works if it has an element of realism - perhaps, just maybe it could be removed without relying on two ex machina moments or "just because". Some parts of "The Italian Job" throw it all out of the window, computers doing things that computers can not do, the good guys do not hit anyone driving (especially down the stairs) and no police car at the street explosions, minis driving or even a helicopter flying at low altitude. It must be a sacred city for these things not to value an answer. <br /> <br /> The acting is passable, and the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) is at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is too skillful as a hero, while Charlize Theron is pretty much the only actor to play a role. Donald Sutherland is a class number as always and shows the shortcomings of Wahlberg every moment they are together. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a rather uninteresting film. Given the ratings of IMDb, it's the girls who really like this movie, which I understand a bit, but there are such films of toads better, even the wave of the recent "Ocean's Eleven" surpasses the non-event "Italian work". <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> To conclude, take a moment to think about what will happen to Norton's character. Are we supposed to encourage the good ones to have caused his disappearance, especially since it would seem to be long and painful? He did not deserve that, simulating the creep he was. <br /> <br /> *** END OF THE SPOILER ***
