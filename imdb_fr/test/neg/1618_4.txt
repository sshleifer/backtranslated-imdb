Thanks to silly horror movies like "Troll" and the incredible atrocious cult favorite "Troll 2", it has become almost impossible to take movies seriously with kobolds, gnomes and various other types of little green hacks. . Recently, I watched the movie "Do not be afraid of the dark," designed for television in the 1970s, which is basically a rather terrifying and serious movie about little goblin monsters, but I still could not help but to think back on the creatures at the laugh-inducing potato head dressed in garbage bags that were crazy in "Troll 2". The same thing happened to me now. As much as I tried to go into "Inhabited" with a clear state of mind, I unconsciously continued to compare the so-called scary and threatening garden fairies to the badly carved Nilbog Goblins! Yet, even without all the prejudices, "Inhabited" is a horror movie that is both entertaining and entertaining, though unmistakable. It's a cheesy, sweet and politically correct pastiche of the family drama and mythology of Northern Europe. The annoying and deadly creatures of this film are not your ordinary goblins; These are "The Huldre": nasty little Norwegian demons who live in hiding and try to drive happy families out of their homes by influencing the youngest children. It goes beyond the Russell family as they move into their dilapidated dream house in a small isolated town. MILF actress and girlfriend Megan Gallagher's blonde and chubby babe starts to behave strangely every time she spends time in the lovely playhouse at the back of the garden. She claims that her friends are fairies, and even if the sinister handyman warns of strange events in the past, Gina's parents simply think that the girl is struggling to adapt to her new neighborhood. . When she keeps talking about fairies, they set up an appointment with the famous psychologist Dr. Werner, while "The Huldre" slowly leaves her botanical shelter. Not much special to mention here. The pace is acceptable and attempts to create a suspense are rather cute. You understand that this is a family-friendly horror movie, so no bloody murder sequence is shown here. Heck, even the corpse of the family cat is kept on the screen. This is the umpteenth absurd horror film in which Malcolm McDowell appears and almost always depicts an unreliable, greedy and egocentric figure of authority.
