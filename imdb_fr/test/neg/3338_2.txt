I'm used to being patient with movies because I usually find that it's usually worth it. But some works take boredom to new levels and enter the field of provocation ... "Last year in Marienbad" comes to mind. "Pola X" is not either "Last year in Marienbad". I can count on one hand the number of films I have abandoned over the years. "Pola X" became a member of this August group. In my defense, I think I made a valiant effort to hold my ground hoping things would turn around. However, I finally threw the towel a little less than 90 minutes - quite respectable under the circumstances. "Pola X" does not keep the promise of Carax's earlier work. After a hiatus of 10 years, it must have been really bitter for him. Melville is still turning in his grave!
