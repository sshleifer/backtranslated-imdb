How is it terrible? Let me count the following ways: 1) This is a bait and substitute film that starts with a UFO investigation and then turns into high-pressure sales work for the UFO. Christianity. Let's go there! If the writers of this film were so attached to their message, why disguise it? This annoys non-believers and pushes the gatekeepers in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good argument! If the characters in this movie asked me to go to church with them, I would run like hell in the opposite direction. They are scary! 3) The acting game is terrible. They all behave as if they figured in an educational film about the label at work. 4) Cinematography is bad. Wait, actually it's not even so good. 5) Script bad, bad, bad. Any dialogue, no action. Like a tennis match, they come and go between close-ups "speaking head". 6) Direction ... which direction? Oh, there must have been a director somewhere. I challenge you to find where. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I have positive comments about this movie. The editing seemed professional, but could not change anything. A good editing of bad material is a bad movie. The opening theme was really very good! Very scary and UFO-ish. Too bad the film does not affect UFOs. <br /> <br /> If you can not say it already, here is the bottom line. I lost my money watching this movie, and it made me angry. If they had not disguised the content of this film, I could say it was my fault.
