Horrible, frightful, terrible. The actors are bad, the music is ridiculous and the filming pathetic. I rented the DVD and had to force myself to watch it until the end. <br /> <br /> My advice: read the book, it's much better and you will not have to bear all these silly images and Catherine has ridiculous dreams. <br /> <br /> I think I have never watched such a bad movie.
