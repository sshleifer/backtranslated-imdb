Ahem .. I think I'll be the only one to say it but yes, I was a little bored during the movie. Not to say that it's a bad movie, it's actually a very good attempt to portray the deepest emotions - dilemma, heartache, love, especially since it's the beginning of the director (read somewhere, is -this true?). I felt that something was wrong, maybe it's just me, I'm not attracted enough by the characters to immerse myself in their world. It's a simple story about ordinary people, ordinary lives. Through simple and brief dialogues, the director tries to tell the story of a simple man, and how to handle the news of his illness by laughing every time. Oh, his laugh was pretty cute at first, but little by little, it comes to me, a roar so deep for a sweet man! I must say that I did not feel the impact that most readers felt. In fact, I was more attracted to trivial scenarios like spitting watermelon seeds with her sister, which clearly shows that they are comfortable with each other, back for another plan - it's a bit melancholy, the thoughtful gesture of writing the procedures for his father - hmm but it's predictable .. Do not get me wrong on the fact that I'm a lover of action, independent movies are my cup Some tea! I may have very high expectations after watching many deep films with stronger images. Some Asian movies to watch: <br /> <br /> Tony Takitani (portrays solitude) Wayward Cloud (1 dialogue only) My sassy girl (I like that!) 4.30 (loneliness too) 15 (gangsters live in a local environment) Before sunrise and before sunset (just mention these movies even if they are not Asian movies, fans will understand!)
