Ghost Story offers an interesting scenario of feminist vengeance, long-time actors, colorful flashbacks with cute younger counterparts of older men. A scary staccato music announcing the coming horrors, the atmospheric winter climate of New England and an excellent charismatic actress in the leading role. Ghost Story could have been much more effective in black and white and to eliminate some of the darkest special effects, as well as to present a more convincing scenario (we should not ask why the two acolytes of trailer-parkish are in the scenario .)) The main disadvantage of the film is Craig Wassan (definitely separated at the birth of Bill Maher), which is maybe editing or just bad game, totally ineffective. He seems to be "specializing" in wide-eyed, wide-mouthed reaction shots; not a lot of personality here. The revelation however is Alice Krige, with a pale, enigmatic, terrifying face beneath the placid exterior. However, her Eva Galli is scary even before having met her fate; I mean, a young woman who says things like "I'd like to grab you a bite" or "Dance with me, little toad!" is not already in the land of the living. Ghost Story would have been much better in a low-key mode, Val Lewton. Excessive special effects reduce the cooling factor completely.
