The credits at the end read "ALL directed by Shigeru Izumiya". This is a good way of saying it, because it seems that films from several projects have been assembled in one way or another, barely trying to do everything in a coherent way. It sounded more like one of those music videos marketed as feature films to take advantage of these video commercials, but here we have the marketable music and the missing live performances, except for one scene, which might as well be marketed as as a commercial. a weird video clip in Japan. It does not matter. <br /> <br /> It does not make sense. Visually, it's not too special either, although it has its strong moments (for example, the female creature with the "death powder" that is attached to a bed base and a little morphing everywhere!) And she certainly has an industrial feeling. to that. Usually I would call the dilettantish effects, but what this film offers in this respect is disconcerting more than anything. Do you remember these cheap video effects of 70s and 80s music videos, which give them a look as dated as an image in an image flying over the screen? There are many of these kinds of effects in this, and for no apparent reason. The most stupid apparent effort is in the form of a collage of images. The images look like album covers. It does not matter. <br /> <br /> I do not know what's going on with the subtitles of the version I saw. The Chinese (or what are these hieroglyphs) sometimes appear when nothing is said and the English often appear without the Chinese. English submarines talk a lot about life without death (is it possible?) And a bodiless spirit, which provides what comes closest to an understandable conflict between the characters in this film. One guy (a science guy) says that life without flesh is death, while another guy (a metamorphosis) who claims that his mind is beyond his body now that he has received the " death powder "blown to his face and that he now knows the secrets of the flesh and all the rest; the metamorphosed guy is visibly disturbed by the claim of the scientific guy. It does not matter. <br /> <br /> Erm, The End - All Written by Perception of Ambiguity
