Casper Van Dien ... what can I say? I appreciate the guy! His films bring them a certain talent that does not come from the director or the producer, but from him! Recycled plots ... check. The scams of better movies ... check. Wood acting ... check. It's not that Van Dien is a bad actor (he was effective in the Hollywood movie as Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow), but he was not really offered a scenario worthy of his talents; and yes, he has an acting talent other than being a feast for the eyes. This film offers a glimpse of what Van Dien can offer but is entangled in its production. The script can be better developed (see Oliver Stone's U-Turn). The staging can be better used (see From Dusk Til Dawn by Robert Rodriguez). The PD could have made the desert more exotic (see Faster Pussycat Faster Kill of Faster, Russ Meyer!). This script is weak because it is something we have seen before and double / triple crosses are expected. The direction is weak because it offers nothing new and telegraphs many weak script moments. The cinematography sometimes gives a nice flavor of the autumn desert, but at other times, it does not take advantage of the scorching light and the starting sequence is horrible blueberry blue. <br /> Now, let's move on to acting. .. Van Dien shows grace and charisma to his Jake. He does not become too methodical or too campy in his role. A good balance, especially since the rest of the cast seems too distracted as to how it should play in this film (bad scenario or bad direction ... you give your opinion). The only other person who deserves to be mentioned is Bryan Brown's villain, who provides the only real credit for playing in this movie ... the aspiring actors forget to try to learn to play in a green screen, d 'try to learn to play in a horrible scenario and take notes on Bryan Brown in this movie. He adds extra depth to his role and is a nice counterpart to Van Dien's character. Jake always seems to have a head start or control of any situation, be it out of his control. The femme fatale is weak (it's a black desert after all) and is another nail in the coffin of this film (you decide ... the script or the direction). The character of Rosalita should have been propelled into the film instead of being rejected later to give way to the real femme fatale. So watch the movie for Van Dien and Brown; and for fun, try to jump a stone through the holes of the plot in the movie.
