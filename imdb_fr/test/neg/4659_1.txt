This "schlock-buster" should carry a health warning from the government. If you play it on your DVD player, you're in serious danger of opening a gap in the space-time continuum and disappearing without a trace - this movie is so bad. <br /> <br /> The fact that The Movie Was So Successful is a testament to the real state of hopelessness of modern Hollywood cinema and the continued commissioning of "lowest common denominator" movies - although I really fear to think of the "lowest common denominators" that this film actually has <br /> <br /> I think that Hollywood was conducting a kind of trial to prove that this film was made and projected! I can imagine the board meetings at the studio ... "It's how hard a film can be to produce - and ALWAYS make a lot of money!! God, I did not know that we could go that bad ... Woooo hooooo !! "<br /> <br /> The only worse movies I can think of (and believe me, it's close) are Die Another Day (the franchise RIP the Bond as I knew it) and Independence Day! <br /> <br /> AVOID - AVOID - AVOID !!!!
