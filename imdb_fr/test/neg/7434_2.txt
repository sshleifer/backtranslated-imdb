It * should * have been an incredibly funny movie ... but it's falling flat on the face. (Actually, I stopped watching him half-way, which I rarely do ...) - Bill Murray plays Jack Corcoran, a second-rate motivational speaker who bequeathed an elephant to his father (who he presumed to have died before his birth); he then has a week to cross the country to heavy pachyderm. His adventures on the way are at best only slightly amusing. Janeane Garofalo's considerable comedy talent is largely unexploited. Anita Gillette is impressive in her small role as Jack's mother (who has a lot to explain), and Pat Hingle stands out as a former circus partner of Jack's father. - Maybe the second half of the movie was better than the first, but I can not believe it ...
