STAR STARTING: ***** Unmissable **** Very good *** Okay ** You could go out for a meal instead * avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> The history of incumbent Adam (Mark O'Halloran) and Paul (Tom Murphy), two heroin addicts in the slums of Dublin and their daily amblings about their insignificant lives in search of the next cure that will make their day. Along the way, they try to come to terms with their immediate family and friends, whom they have managed to drop and destroy over the years. <br /> <br /> I know that many Irish people like to drink, but it seems that some people have problems with heroin, also by the looks of this film. I know there is a small drug problem there, as in many parts of the world. Therefore, another humorous interpretation of the subject is not totally unexpected. <br /> <br /> I do not do it. Remember the last Irish movie I saw (the movie was shot in a style that distinguishes it from the movies I saw recently!). And, judging from that, I'm obviously not as enlightened as possible by their humor. . The film is rather funny in some places, but it's obviously another comedy that does not shy away from laughter. The scene in which the mentally handicapped boy is stolen from the bottom of an alley is certainly true of what a pair of junkies could do to feed, but it is quite despicable and I'm not sure it was designed with black humor anyway, but it certainly did not put a smile on my face! This is also a stark contrast to their previous actions where they were seen showing their sweet side that swings a baby back and forth. In light of this, some might find the end sad, others would consider it a mere dessert. <br /> <br /> Overall, I simply failed to see the purpose of the film. I did not see any motivation in the "story" told. It just seems to work without really involving the audience. Unlike Trainspotting (which dealt with similar topics!), It was an unsuccessful effort for most that threatened to doze off despite a very short race time of 83 minutes. Really not nicer than following two real-life junkies for a day. **
