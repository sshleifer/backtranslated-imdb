Why do I hate it? Let me list ways: <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Mary Pickford, but a 32 year old woman playing a 12 year old boy is just stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a fight scene in which children throw bricks against each other and we find it funny --- and it lasts 15 minutes <br /> <br /> Strange like none of the children was wounded at a distance <br /> <br /> The title cards contain a lot of racist and ethnic remarks <br /> <br /> For a "family" film, the fighting was REALLY too much violent (I loved it when Pickford hit him with a little boy!) and the humor was just stupid <br /> <br /> Seriously, after 40 minutes, I gave up and turned it off. The insults, the racism and the little children who were throwing bricks against each other happened to me. In addition, there was no plot that I could see. The only thing worth seeing in this movie is William Haines, who was one of the leading men of the silent era. <br /> <br /> Just painful. To avoid.
