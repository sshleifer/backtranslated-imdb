But at least, this film deserved what it deserved - to be sent to the Satellite of Love to be ridiculed by Mike, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot of Pearl Forrester on "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" "Soultaker" is one of those lost and forgotten movies that are so terrible that you'll be guaranteed nightmares or depression later in life. Even if the film is not so old, it is a type of movie very forgotten. If it had never been the clever spirit of "Mystery Science Theater 3000", the film would not seem to have been filmed either, but it would not be very nice for moviegoers. <br /> <br /> In real life: this movie is really bad. In the Satellite of Love: this film is excellent!
