It's another one of those movies that I knew I'd hate, but that ended up not being as bad as you'd expect. <br /> <br /> It contains a lot of things to do and even the DVD menu is shocked full of women's chest. The first scenes of the movie have a lot of sex and nudity and I began to think that there would be no story exploiting nudity to make money with a popular film of 8MM. <br /> <br /> As I continued to watch, there was just more sex and nudity and main characters that I did not care at all, but then the story began to unfold and I started to see the point, and it was a little better. <Br /> <br /> This is a man whose fiancee is the daughter of an ambasador and all have a promising future until nude photos of a threesome sex appear and that blackmail prevails. The man and his fiance must now get to the bottom of things to know who sent the photos and how to silence them. <br /> <br /> The film has nothing to do with Part 1 at first, it does not even have everything related to 8MM, it's a sex video, so I can see the similarities, however small they are. <br /> <br /> The acting is neither good nor bad, they are only plays that do not play anyone. make. The value of film production is in the middle of the road and its pure drama yawns. <br /> <br /> I really liked taking the train to get to the bottom of the motivations of the singers. I was expecting answers, which is more than I could say for the first one I consider to be garbage. This film also has some twists that are always welcome. <br /> <br /> It's not great, and the startup is very slow, but in the end, it entertains. I was not on the edge of my seat and I will not tell my friends that this is a must, but if you watch a lot of movies and always look for something new, it may entertain you for 90 minutes. minutes.
