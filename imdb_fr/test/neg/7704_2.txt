This film plays like a crazy episode of "Where Are They Now", or "Behind The Music" of VH1. In the first half of the film (which depicts his "glory days"), Abbie Hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a kind of crazy rock star. You know the genre; The singer's main singer, the handsome boy, who has not written any music, has no idea, but gets all the glory for nothing and free girls. Therefore, he takes his success for granted, abuses it and eventually destroys it with himself. Indeed, Hoffman's glory days came to an abrupt halt when he was arrested for trafficking cocaine without bail before hiding. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film deals with this hidden time. We see Hoffman as a pathetic whiner who constantly blames everyone, whoever but himself for his loss. Finally, times pass it completely; and he can never tackle that. How sad. THE END. End of generics and OH NO! We learn that Abbie Hoffman finally committed suicide in 1989. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this is not the image that the filmmakers had intended for Hoffman for the making of this film. Given that Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt were involved, I'm sure they wanted this film to be a tribute to the life of a man who was after all an icon of the anti-war movement of the left. In this, they have failed miserably. The film portrays Abbie Hoffman as a silly caricature. We are never told what motivates him. How did he get to his views? How did he manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation? How did he organize such a vast movement? Why, at the height of his glory, was he involved in the cocaine trade? Why? Who knows, and since filmmakers do not seem to do it, who cares?
