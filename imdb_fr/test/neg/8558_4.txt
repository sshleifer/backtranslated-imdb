LORD PROTECTOR is a child's dish, but for whose children? Obviously filmed for TV or STV, this amateur journalist KRULL has several basic characters - a magician, an assassin, a warrior, a scientist - on the trail of one or the other thing in order to defeat the Dark Forces on the point of going wild. planet. Poorly written, interpreted and staged in Californian locations such as municipal parks and a ranch, LORD PROTECTOR has nothing to recommend to her, not even as a waste of time. Jay Underwood is the only actor to have a "name" and most people, especially the target audience of five-year-olds, will probably not remember him as a Disney award as old as NOT QUITE HUMAN . An unnamed actor who plays a magician in an ill-fitting silver wig plays at least with a tongue firmly anchored in the cheek, while those around him act as if they were in a production of KING LEAR, performed as part of a dinner theater. I was hoping for at least a decent action or a sequence of special effects. Alas, the action sequences are pathetically staged and the few special effects are those old painted cartoon gags that we used to see in the fantastic movies of the 1950s and 1960s, like Bert Gordon's THE MAGIC SWORD . Filmmakers have planned a sequel that, fortunately, never came. Often, such cheap back-lot productions in Hollywood use a combination of legitimate and pornographic actors. I've been busy for the seemingly endless length of the movie, trying to figure out which one was in this one. I was not very lucky.
