I watched this cooking show several times before I wanted to pull my hair. Just a question ..... Who can not cook a simple meal in 30 minutes when all you need is on hand, already packed, sometimes pre-chopped and you have very little to do in share cut some green vegetables. In addition, almost all cooking shows on TV last 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all their preparation work (with the exception of Sandra Lee) during their show. Oh and yes .... they make full meals too. <br /> <br /> I like the comment of the one who hated the comment "EVOO". Add "DE-LISH" to my list of stupid tag words. <br /> <br /> Then you have the obvious: a strong, gregarious woman who is really her best audience. She laughs at her own lame comments, mugs too often for the camera, because she wants to convince us that she is as good as the thought. <br /> <br /> NO she is not "the cutest thing". She is a 40-year-old woman who is not DE-LISH.
