I received it for my birthday in a gift box under the name of Broke Skull. Well, after watching one on the DVD and being pleasantly surprised, I added this sucker inside. It was worse than expected, and I was not expecting much. This film is basically a complicated story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with the crowd, and other bullshit. There were some interesting ideas in this that were never followed. Now everyone said there was a lot of blood, can anyone tell me if? I saw a bad effect on the crushed head, brain tissue (or something like that ...) and blood from the penis twice. I must say that the part where the guy had his man bitten by the hood made me feel uncomfortable, it was the only good thing about this movie. And this gay sex scene has been added for no reason. The game in this movie was atrocious, really, it exploded. This Asian chick was annoying, then the annoying Mexican boyfriend who has just been killed. I say that if you get this in a box, it's fine, but do not spend money on it.
