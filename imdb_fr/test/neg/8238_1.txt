I took this film and was horrified to discover that this film is based on the rape of a little girl whose parents are knowingly taking their daughter. My first thoughts were that I have never been more ashamed to be an Indian as well as a Hindu. I found this film terribly appalling. Please do not waste your time. As for the music, there are at most two horrible songs and the film used is cheap. Beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope I have clarified how disgusting this film is. Yes, it can highlight how perverse people in power, especially in religion, can be, but sitting and watching nearly two hours of this movie can unleash almost everyone. If you're ready for a good Indian movie, watch something from director Mira Nair.
