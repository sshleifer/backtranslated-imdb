Was Norman Wisdom's last star vehicle different from his previous releases? He updates his milquetoast, subject to accidents, a Swinging Sixties product! The end result is a worried and sometimes embarrassing comedy that mixes the typical star's slap (and sentimentality) with a softer sexuality and even softer satire. the plot is about a traveling executive for a banking conference that falls under the spell of Sally Geeson, a teenager (who is not afraid to get involved with him, but does not take their relationship very seriously either); Sarah Atkinson appears as Geeson's friend who warns Norman of his capriciousness. <br /> <br /> The film is nowhere near as bad as Leonard Maltin's BOMB note would have been and, if at all, interesting for his mid-life crisis treatment (resembling well some respects to Hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979] - both, by the way, I just watched); Towards the end, Norman even tries to bring his wife back to his new way of thinking! The Pretty Things seem to play several good tunes themselves in a disco and Norm sings the catchy title himself!
