Creating a comedy is like walking a tightrope thin enough. It works or not. Grandma's Boy is one of those movies that do not work. There may be some very entertaining roles, but for the most part, it's a terribly unusual comedy drawn from the usual supporting characters in Adam Sandler's films (without Sandler himself, he's just one producer). <br /> <br /> Alex (Allen Covert) is a game tester. He is 35 years old and is the best tester and player in the world of work at his workplace, also full of children. He ended up getting his flat and his belongings for not having paid the bills (his roommate had just spent rent on Philipino's prostitutes and not paying the landlord). Desperate, he settles with his grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond) and his two roommates. <br /> <br /> This is the basic plot of the film, with subplots about a new girl named Samantha. (Linda Cardelli, unrecognizable from her time as a Velma in Scooby Doo) trying to get the testers to complete a new game as fast as possible, a robotic game creating the prodigy JP (Joel Moore) who works with Alex and wears a lot of the same clothes as Neo in The Matrix, and of course all kinds of jokes about sex and drugs. That's it. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film, besides the fact that the real conflict in the movie occurs and resolves in the last fifteen minutes of the film, is that it's just not funny. It's totally boring, and only very funny. Nothing really happens at all. No emotion, no real sense of direction and a ton of intense cursing. You may find yourself laughing at some amusing jokes that the actors say, but otherwise sit in total annoyance, wishing you were not even bothered by the movie. How this film was green and how Fox thought he was making money will always be a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> There is no value of entertainment that results. None of the actors perform well, they act like idiots for the camera and hope for the best. The comedy Stoner has already been made several times and sometimes works (Harold and Kumar go to the White Castle and Dazed and Confused come to mind). Here, it makes the movie even less funny than it already is. The random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of naked breasts does not make the film better either. <br /> <br /> Aside from some funny characters, this movie should simply be missed. It's not very funny, the whole plot is stupid, it's boring, and it's just a horrible movie. Avoid him like the plague. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
