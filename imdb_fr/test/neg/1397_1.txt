I thought "puppets making phone calls" was pretty weak, but I do not think Carlos Mencia's show is called comic. His main goal is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable by using the word "bean" as many times as he can. I have never felt obliged to write a review on IMDb, but I really hope that this show will never be renewed or rebroadcast. <br /> <br /> Mencia is trying to be the next Dave Chapel, and perhaps he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fix those problems. This goes without saying in the wake of the Chapel intro (group of blues against mariachi band). However, Mencia has an absolutely * no * attitude and does not delve into the ideas about Hispanic culture enough to allow her to embark on a creative goal each time. Instead, he sticks to a few nicknames barely shocking to his Latino compatriots and makes "jokes" about immigration. From time to time, he takes advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else, like the cultures of the Middle East. These jokes consist mainly of reiterating every joke or stereotype created against culture, and perhaps incredibly old subjects (like September 11th), in a watered-down style, while he makes fun of himself to conceal the style of the public. . I think he's too scared to offend anyone, so the viewer feels uncomfortable. He also beats jokes to death. If you've ever seen "Why the f *** is this new?" you'll know what I'm talking about It's funny at first, but he keeps walking around and becomes an obvious captain at some point. <br /> <br /> It's a train wreck that's just painful to watch.
