Without a doubt, one of the most racist movies I've ever seen, with prejudices directed against Hayden Panettiere who is moving to a tough downtown school. She is constantly called "white girl" and other insults based on her color. First, would it be allowed if a black girl was the target of all abuse? and second, stereotypes about ethnic children from poor neighborhood schools are also a shame. The apparent desire of writers to show that they were "connected" has also spread to the fact that the downtown school wins the contest of cheerleaders, not by talent, but by intimidating their white opponents !! these accents of the film have removed from the expected direction of a light comedy and safe for a family audience in a vehicle that has no merit. Hayden Panettiere has star quality, but I would be surprised if the rest of the class goes much further. In short, a film without charm that was a waste of time.
