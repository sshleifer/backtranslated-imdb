Cowardly and cynical, `The Hospital 'represents the nadir of Paddy Chayefsky's special celebration of status quo disguised as satire. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the selfish director Arthur Hiller, this ridiculous scenario acquires an ugly appearance. , rhythmic presentation it deserves. <br /> <br /> Only a superb performance by George C. Scott, in the kind of petty role he was born to play, prevents "The Hospital" from being a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Scott's performance is doing a disservice to viewers. His magnetism prevents them from watching when they could turn off their VCR and clean the closets, watch the clouds or watch Baywatch reruns. <br /> <br /> Certainly, anyone who emotionally throws into emotion the device of modern medicine apparently gone will feel deceived by the poor result, where Chayefsky reveals that the system works very well, so stop your actions. <br /> <br /> While the first half of this film provides an entertaining dark comedy, it all turns out to be a red clutter. Before that becomes clear, however, Chayefsky gives some good words to Scott as his substitute, a middle-class white man. <br /> <br /> Bitter, alcoholic, helpless, Dr. Herbert Bock, of Scott, has alienated those who know him best and he has the bile to continue to alienate them. In Chayefsky's worldview, all of this makes Bock a magnet for a hippie chick half his age. <br /> <br /> Playing a collection of adjectives, Diana with long hair, long legs, no throat and almost no bust Rigg struggles in the role of "the girl". Great Britain is misinterpreted as a free spirit from the Southwest, but any other actress would also fight. Like the rest of a good lost cast, Rigg can not overcome a scenario that is not interested in any character except Bock or a philosophy beyond banality. <br /> <br /> For George C. Scott fans, this is another star trick to watch. For black comedy fans, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. For someone else, do not worry.
