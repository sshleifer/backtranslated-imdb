Ignore the extreme votes on "House of Wax", this is by no means a "1" or a "10". I will try to help those who would like to see "House of Wax" or those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated. The trailer gives this film a very promising aspect, what the trailers are supposed to do. There is one thing for sure with the trailers: if the producers can not concoct a minute of interesting elements for the making of a trailer, it is almost certain that the film is a crazy party. But a good trailer only tells you a few things about the movie are good, it does not give you a clear idea of ​​the whole thing. Here, a little research can be useful. Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than her Canadian compatriot Sarah Polley or Rose McGowen) was performed by <br /> <br /> and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as Jaume, in his first feature film. These are not good signs, but if you're like me, you ignore them and go see the work of the decorator Grace Walken, responsible for the look of "Ghost Ship". Once again, Walken's work is worth seeing, so much so that it appears that 90% of the film's $ 30 million budget went to design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she has to undergo throughout the film (cut fingers, lips stuck, lips stuck, bound and dangling in gooey stuff). By-by-bye, Cuthbert seems much heavier than she was in "The Girl Next Door", about a big hole in the major weight problem. <br /> <br /> Which means that they had almost nothing left. pay the rest of the cast and the team. And judging by what was on the screen, it might actually be true. It seems that all the others have given their time to get their first credit of actor or team. Unfortunately, whether it is experience or jealousy about the disparity in pay, the contributions of all these inexperienced / incompetent volunteers are less than zero. <br /> <br /> Steven Window's PD experience was about as bad as you would probably want. In collaboration with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert "Pearl Harbor" here), they manage to take away most of the added value of the production design group. Instead of lingering and showing the scenery, Window filmed this film with poor lighting and jerky camera work. Negran aggravated the problem with a senseless number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD-type camera and a fast cut are what you use to mask a cheap and poor quality production design; not necessary when the strength of the film lies in its expensive and detailed decorations. <br /> <br /> Chan Hayes directed the screenplay and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as a writer, with the exception of the title and use of wax figures there There is absolutely no similarity. A saving grace is that the film is not taken seriously as a horror film and is mostly parodic (insert "Van Helsing" here). Murders are played for laughter, too extreme to be scary or even scary for anyone over the age of six. The audience was particularly disappointed when a certain heiress of a high-ranking hotel was combed by a steel bar, while his previous half-baked striptease was the only really scary thing about the movie. Another highlight of the comedy was when Cuthbert put his finger in a rack and had it cut by the bad guy. <br /> <br /> The good scenes take place in the Trudy Wax House, a wax factory that has closed sugar mill, Siamese twins and a lot of roadkill (in which Cuthbert is going to bathe). All this is supposed to happen somewhere in the rural parts of Florida although, from the point of view of the hills, it certainly looks like Paul Hogan's country (watch out, watch the location, the gulf coast is not known for its hilly terrain). The scenario was apparently intended to play the link (bad pun) between the two pairs of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production, most of the dialogue on this subject was interrupted. Since what remains of the twin connection is meaningless and goes nowhere, you wonder why it was not so reduced to reduce the boredom factor. <br /> <br /> What is particularly sad is that the producers do not have brains to recognize mid-production that they had the ingredients for a classic horror of the first order, even with the existing distribution. What was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a city of wax. As it is a photographic medium, modern film is intrinsically naturalistic, almost without exception, inclined to create an illusion of reality. Here, they had a ready-made opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting, the city creates by far an illusion of reality but is revealed as a highly stylized wax making. Of course, they should have found a visionary director and a DP to make the project a success, but everything else was already in place for that to happen.
