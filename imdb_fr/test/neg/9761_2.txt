Do not be trapped because the principle of this film is good. It's, but that's not a good movie, that's it. <br /> <br /> The comedies require a well-honed script and masterful direction. Unfortunately, this poorly executed film has neither of them. Leconte, a good director in other genres, does not give in his comic farces (the series Bronzes is another example). <br /> <br /> The timing of the comedy is terrible. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some are re-chopped from other movies. Others sit as if they give you time to laugh. The plot has disordered subplots (the allergic girl, the lesbian co-owner) and does not develop or envelop the viewer. It's not funny and it does not believe for a second. <br /> <br /> Compare this to any comedy by Billy Wilder (Some like it hot, A Foreign Afair, etc.) or Leconte's compatriot, Francis Veber, a true GENIE of French comedy ( Cons Dinner, The Closet, The Fills, The Goat, The Great Blonde, etc.) and you'll see the difference in their tight scenarios, their comic acting and timing, joke leading to the next one. <br /> <br /> Watching My Best Friend Twice would be a cruel and unusual punishment, not a good sign for a comedy.
