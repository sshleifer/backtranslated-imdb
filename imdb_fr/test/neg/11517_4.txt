When I saw this film three years ago, I thought it embodied many traits that are found in Singaporean house art: slow, with minimal intrigue and dialogue, depending on the composition of the film to make it work. <Br /> <br /> Meanwhile, among local filmmakers, the inability to appreciate "Be With Me" is like photographing "Citizen Kane" or one of Ozu's latest movies. I do not know how "Be With Me" reached such peaks in Singapore's cinematographic consciousness, but I always thought Khoo's "The 12-story" movie was a better movie, even if it was not does not have such a good director of photography as Adrian Tan. , Khoo DP for "Be With Me". "12 floors" has a story that concerns most Singaporeans and bites too, something that the naive melancholy of "Be With Me" does not have. <br /> <br /> "Be With Me" is basically a trio just nested with stories, brought together in a film by Khoo and his scriptwriter, Wong Kim Hoh. This is a security guard who falls in love with a girl he can not see far away; two girls in a horoerotic relationship; and the story of Teresa Chan, deaf and blind. <br /> <br /> "Be With Me" is very well filmed by Tan, using a Varicam camera. The compositions of the film are masterful. The film, almost completely silent, has almost no dialogue. The characters move, not realistically, but almost as if they were models directed by a director, looking almost always on the screen and emotional: loneliness or sadness. Unfortunately, the characters do not act against each other. This kind of film has already been seen many times: in the films of Tsai Ming-liang, in "4:30" of Khoo's protégé, Royston Tan, and elsewhere. Unfortunately, its ultra-slow (essentially less intrigue) and the use of a lento piano soundtrack just do not please me. <br /> <br /> Criticism "Be With Me" almost seems to deny the inspiring story behind it. Teresa Chan, blind and deaf, who still leads a fulfilling life, but I'm afraid this movie does not do much for me. I am ready to applaud Chan's resolute and courageous march and Tan's striking cinematography, but for a better interpretation of the same subject with more meat (without the other two tedious and annoying secondary intrigues), try "The Country of Silence" from Werner Herzog and the darkness "(1971).
