I'm glad it's the last of the Universal Mummy movies of the '40s. The films were all of varying quality and this film was certainly one of the smallest. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is a very slow film, in which there is basically nothing interesting or exciting. It might have been better if the mom had made her debut earlier in the movie. Instead, the film once again takes its first 20 minutes to explain what happened in previous mummy movies, again using archive footage from that time, "The Mummy" from 1932 , to which this film is the fourth following film. 1932 Mum story. The film never knows how to find the right rhythm and, even if it lasts just over an hour, it still looks a bit like a trail. <br /> <br /> It does not help either that the film has a rather simplistic story and in fact very uninteresting. The film also feels pretty ragged. The first and second half of the movie do not really connect and they seemed to be two separate movies. <br /> <br /> At least Lon Chaney Jr. is still in the movie. He takes again the role of the mummy Kharis, for the third time. Too bad he has a screen time as limited this time. It is unfortunately very uninteresting to do, which is also a considerable waste of the character of the mummy itself. The film is even more filled with dozens of silly actors who play with stupid accents. It seemed so pointless to me that most characters have to speak with such an accent, which can be quite distracting and boring at times. <br /> <br /> Mummy films that deserve the least to be seen. <br /> <br /> 4/10
