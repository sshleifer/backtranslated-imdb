Why Lori Petty was cast as a tank girl, I'll never know. His acting performance is lack-luster. His voice is hoarse. It is almost impossible for me to express in words how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There are several "modern-pop" references in the film, which I found very strange since the film was supposed to unfold far into the future. It would not have been difficult either to make this premise interesting. A better writing would have helped the charges. <br /> <br /> Naomi Watts makes her appearance as a techno-geek with gentle manners. I think they probably should have changed roles. <br /> <br /> I'll never know why anyone would like this movie unless you're a fan of Petty. <br /> <br /> Try not to see this movie. Total loss of time.
