Randy Bowers (John Wayne) arrives at the Half Way House at the right time to take a break and discovers a bunch of corpses inside, among which a man he was supposed to convey a message to - Ed Rogers, owner of the establishment . He is observed by the deceased's niece, Sally (Alberta Vaughn), from behind a hidden room, where she was not observed during the carnage. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" was directed by Harry Fraser. He uses a filming technique here as in other of his films, where he quickly moves from one place to another, usually involving a horse rider. It's pretty well done and seems quite innovative in these Lone Star Westerns of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The pre-Gabby George Hayes is present, without whiskers, and this is the first time I consider it like a bad guy. . In fact, it took a few scenes to realize that it was a dual role: first as a hunchbacked businessman "Matt the Mute", communicating in pencil and on paper, then becoming Marvin Black, leader of a group of outlaws. Black's gang was responsible for the killings at Half Way House, with the purpose of forcing Sally to sell to Matt / Marvin. Yakima Canutt is another essential player, Spike, a black henchman. Interestingly, Yakima portrayed a villain named Sam Black in another issue of Fraser / Wayne entitled "Neath the Arizona Skies". <br /> <br /> There is quite a bit of riding on the horseback between Black Gang and the Sheriff's Post, as John Wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys. In the end, he saved the situation by protecting Sally Rogers' thirty thousand dollars, to the detriment of the destruction of Half Way House, where he swapped sticks of dynamite for loot in a safe. Greedy Marvin Black tries to open it with his six-shot shooter, and the explosion puts an end to the evil for the bad guy. In his best attitude "Aw shucks", John Wayne falls in love with the pretty Sally Rogers and, unfortunately, Randy does not go up alone!
