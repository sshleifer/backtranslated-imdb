A group of tourists ran aground on Snake Island after an unfortunate accident with their boat. They have to spend the night and as you probably guess, it's not Snake Island, because it's so much fun to say - it's a story of people disappearing one by one because of the great population of snakes, that's what happens with these poor dumb souls. It's a very boring and typical film with tons of off-screen snake attacks and mediocre performances by NOBODY actors. The only somewhat amusing scene was an absolutely useless and forced striptease scene, which nothing could see in a PG13 film, people. If you like movies about snakes, check out SSSSSSS, but do not torture yourself with this shit.
