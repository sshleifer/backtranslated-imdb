Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor of all time, he is undoubtedly also on the lists of others when it comes to big actors. He even managed to get a good Irish accent in Decent Ordinary Criminal. But Kevin Spacey, as head of the mafia? Or even a burglar? I'm not sure he can go that far. For me, the film had no meaning and some parts of the story did not seem to me to be resolved. <br /> <br /> I know again that the IMDb will make me write ten more lines. But I'm not sure what I could say about this film because I'm still trying to understand it. Silly, is not it? But I'm pretty sure that more than a number of IMDb users of you have been in the same situation as me, where you just want to say a line or two about a movie, but now you have to do ten lines? Wow, that should do it. : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
