This film is a juxtaposition of characters of super bad bikers, badly connected, but without real scenario. Some scenes are well filmed. If they took the same cast and the same crew and made a movie called Gent, who was the coolest character in the film and had an interesting and ongoing story, maybe it might be decent. In the meantime, get ready for a series of hard character intros that just cycle through the desert all day and cause problems while staying under the sun, keeping their clothes and hair perfect and never having to search. a house or money, etc. There was a kind of background story about past characters, various people who were killed and a treasure that was probably supposed to be the plot.
