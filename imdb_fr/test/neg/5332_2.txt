This film is bad as we all knew it. Most of the time, I love the bad comedy of the dustbin of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s (without any play on words). I list Ski Schools, Career Opportunities, Hot Shots, Summer School and many more at this time. It even includes the classic yet forgotten comedy of Dean Cameron (also instructor of Section 8 of the ski school and Party Maniac for Summer School). But this movie is just to slow down. It takes almost 30 minutes to get there and we have to sit in a useless dialogue between the ghost ghosts of the Sheen boys (E & C). And yes, I can hear the bloggers dying to put me in the trash with "obviously, you do not look 2 men and a half.) Well, Charlie was not at the level where he is now during this movie ... not that it deserves to be watched now Charlie only shines when his co-stars support him and that Emilio is no more than a surprisingly overused bra offering little help.In fact, this film was written by Emilio and it comes out .It has no real end (go to Emilio, even the One ski school 2 writers ended an end.) No idea of ​​how the problems are solved, no hot babes, no curses to alleviate the bad plot, the characters, the acting ... I am now tired of this tirade ... and watch the movies I listed above.You will enjoy them a lot more.
