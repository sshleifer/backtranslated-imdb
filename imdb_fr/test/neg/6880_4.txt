I would not say it's a good movie. In fact, it could even be bad. <br /> <br /> BUT there are at least two good reasons to continue watching this film: these are the performances of AGNES BRUCKNER. (Eden) and JONATHAN JACKSON (Eric) both offer strong performances. <br /> <br /> They are much better than the rest of the actors who are very bad, especially MEAGAN GOODE (Cousin Skeeter). <br /> <br /> JEWELRY PHILIPS has been excellent in the drama "HAVOC," the children of the suburbs go to the hood ", but here it is far from embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The HISTORY is pretty decent although nothing special, BUT it would have been much better since it happens in LOUSIANNA that one of the children has actually incorporated a southern accent, but not (!). <br /> <br /> Especially in a movie where "the monster" is so deeply linked to Lousianna's folkloric tradition, with voodoo, and it's just stupid not to include that accent in the characters. <br /> <br /> The only one "It's rapper METHOD MAN, he plays Turner and puts a very good accent in his few scenes.I mean, if a rapper is able to do it, then why could not the" professional "actors do not do the same? Mister Tical aka Meth is very nice in his very very small role Who knows if the stallion Ticallion would be a cop Even if it's only on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a pretty stupid Slasher movie but pretty nice, but if BRUCKNER and JACKSON were as bad as the rest of the young cast, it could have been really bad Fortunately, they are good as usual. <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10, OK BUT there are hundreds of best slasher movies out there.
