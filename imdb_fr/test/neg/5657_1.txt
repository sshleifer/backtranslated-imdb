First of all, I would like to say that I am a teenager, so all of this is marketed to me, and I can say without fear that iCarly's programming is very mediocre and the fact that it is accepted by both gender puzzles me. It contains some of the worst comedy attempts I've ever seen, with mediocre acting. The supposed humor in the series is based on repeating someone's replies with poor sarcasm, poor sarcasm, saying bad interlocutors, and well, you get the picture. In addition, I must mention that I always look Spongebob, for which I know I will have a negative reaction, but it is a quality programming with some frankly funny moments, unless you forget something that iCarly misses; MIND. The show is about a young girl, Carly, who is organizing a web show with her friends, which is definitely a nicer version of the Internet. That's good, but the show is just ... well, not funny at all, as previously stated. If this is where the children's programs came today, the parents, show them something that is really funny; Spongebob or Rocco's modern life would work. <br /> <br /> In addition, compared to his show brother, Drake & Josh, it's terrible, which was supposed. Seriously, please look at something worthwhile. Even for a children's show, it's poor.
