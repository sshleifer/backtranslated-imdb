They say that David Duchovny took six days to write the screenplay for this film. It seems almost correct. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the worst films I've ever seen and I've seen Gigli. It's not as bad as Gigli, but it's like saying that Saddam Hussein was not as bad as Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Tom Warshaw lives in France with his French wife and 13-year-old son. He claimed to be French all this time. He reveals to his wife that he is actually American. For some reason, this is a shocking revelation for her, despite the fact that she has always commented on her husband's American accent. Moreover, their son - remember that he was born in France and never knew that his father was American - speaks perfect American English without a hint of French accent. This is just one of the many mysteries of this film. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is a flashback on Tommy's youth in New York in the 1970s, while he explains to his wife why he has to hide in France. His best friend in youth was Pappas, a retarded adult played terribly by Robin Williams. I guess Duchovny thinks that "delayed" is someone who is just a little silly, because Pappas is sometimes very slow, while other times, he just becomes Robin Williams. Yes, Williams is interested in his tired improvised bull although he is supposed to play a slow character. <br /> <br /> Tommy's mother, played by Duchovny's wife, Tea Leoni, is a distraught nurse on the recent death of her husband. Leoni does a good job, but she smokes a lot and shouts to Tommy for things that do not seem to be too important. The script did not give him much work. Tommy also befriends a jailed lady (whom he calls "lady") who offers him advice through the window of his prison (this house of detention is called "House of D" for short, hence the title). Tommy does not hesitate to shout his personal problems aloud in a street in the city so that this incarcerated offender can offer him advice, and he does so many times without care. <br /> <br /> I do not want to bore you with the complete movie summary, but the plot holes abound in this film that tries far too much to be touching, but that ends up like, well, nobody . Really bad. Really bad. Towards the end of this train wreck, the scenario becomes more and more memorable and ends with a lamentably ugly end. <br /> <br /> Critics have torn "House of D" and rightly so. I can not believe that some people really like this movie. It's a painful film to watch and I felt weak then - no emotion, but how terrible it was.
