No serious spoilers, but some very minor ones. <br /> <br /> "Acacia", a Korean contribution to the ever popular Asian horror wave, is about a husband and wife who decide to get along a bit and decide to adopt a child. The child, who is used to observing the dead tree in the family garden, eventually disappears when the couple finally has a child and this tree seems to blame the family itself. <br /> <br /> And that's about it. The film is moving at a brisk pace, recording more than 100 minutes with an 80-minute film. It's basically a skinny family drama with a scary tree, and there's very little scaring, just tree shots with weird whispers of murmur. However, the idea that the tree is the mother of the child is quite original, but it does not exploit its full potential. This sort of "Acacia" separates much of the new wave to which it belongs: movies like Ju-On and Ring tend to do the opposite, and the ideas bland until they turn red in the face. <br /> <br /> The film begins to go towards the end; However, the realization of the child's destiny and the actions of the parent not only lessen the previous curiosity of the story, but reveal themselves with such an edition of machine gun that it is difficult to assimilate all at once. The final sequence is definitely scary, but it seems too late. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film does not look too much like a Ring, but with the "film renaissance" that Korea is currently By the way, I could not help but think that this movie might have been to be so much more.
