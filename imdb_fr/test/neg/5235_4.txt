After the lush and inspiring aerial shot in the opening of the film, it slipped into the most complete boredom and a tonal note until the end. <br /> <br /> Where do I start, I will start with the characters. I really appreciated them in the book. Here, they were all one-dimensional types and fools who had either "Victim" or "Asshole" written on the front from the start. I can not understand how the owner of the store, Lealand Gaunt, did not understand. This film lacks thrills, suspense and, in a way, yes. , entertaining values. It lasts too long and does not yield much. Why introduce too many boring types of type should-die fast and forget half of them halfway through? In the book, virtually everyone who entered the store had a sinister destiny. Here, apart from one of the only decent scenes that translate the novel well (the fight between Wilma and Nettie), was disappointing and did not have many balls. I'm sorry, but after that, an off-screen death, a boring shot, quarrels and some explosions just did not do it to me. The brutality and wickedness of the book was sorely lacking. The explosion of the church scene was so extreme and poorly executed that suddenly the whole town was in a fight? It made no sense, and the characters that were not suddenly introduced suddenly, who are these people, and why should I care? <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere and none of the scenes had momentum. I thought Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedeila were good actors, but the film does not give them enough substance to make me feel bad about it. Amanda Plummer was credible but too pathetic to be really nice (in the novel, she was a sad and depressing character), here it was a note a little too much. J.T. Walsh was fun, but the role was far from interesting or layered. Too predictable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was too chic for the material she supported. He stood out like a sore thumb. Easy there buddy, easy. I would have supposed that something a little less theatrical would have worked. <br /> <br /> I admit that the gore he managed to get was good enough, I guess, the director seemed to remember a lot of times though. If you want to make a film that reaches 2 hours, make sure you have more than this disaster of an adaptation of one of the king's best novels. <br /> <br /> I often found myself laughing at the scenes were supposed to be taken seriously (Ed Harris's speech at the end, or the character of Hugh Priest in general), and were bored and were mostly uninterested. Personally, the director should have done much more with this story, his approach is too tame and hides behind a cinematography too clear to be considered a decent film. The film looks good, but not the look that I think this story deserved. I mean, this guy has barred ALASKA, it's not a good sign. <br /> <br /> I would rather just read the book, as you would too, as if it were a lot more entertaining, than the development of layered characters, macabre violence and chaos, a sense of naughty humor and a lot more radiant. This is a clogged version, which does not have much to offer. <br /> <br /> ** on ****
