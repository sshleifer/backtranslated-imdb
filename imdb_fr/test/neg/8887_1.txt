The chupacabra, according to this fake documentary, is a mysterious creature that kills and eats Hispanic goats in Latin America and Mexico for years. We crossed the border to South Texas, and a cryptozoologist cute and fearless (no, I did not dial), go to an isolated ranch to find one. . His uncle <br /> <br /> was killed by the creature and granular video sequences of the monster <br /> <br /> exist. She takes a black with a firearm and two cameramen <br /> (for a cover easy to change) and they go hunting for chupacabras. Ten minutes after the beginning of the film, they find it. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the film, the documentary team is attacking by the bloodthirsty monster and exchanging dialogues. At a <br /> <br /> point, the team meets a couple of silly witches who drive them <br /> <br /> to the nest of chupacabra ... for $ 100. If only the FBI knew that <br /> <br /> cheaply, Tex-Mex witches could be bought as informers. <br /> <br /> Whole decades of legendary legends could be brightened up with a <br /> <br /> blank check. <br /> <br /> In the end, after the bloody death of characters do not chine, a chupacabra is captured, killed and autopsied <br /> <br />. The sole purpose of the autopsy scene is to highlight the makeup department's efforts in such a cheap film. <br /> <br /> The film is shot in video, just like "BWP". cameramers <br /> <br /> never load their cassettes and do not recharge their batteries <br /> <br /> for the camera. The main actress here is awful. The beauty of the average "BWP" <br /> lies in its use of improvisation during production. <br /> <br /> Here, all the lines are written and delivered as a record <br /> <br /> A repeated Christmas show. <br /> <br /> The film is also tinged with racism. The only African American <br /> <br /> here is a cannon shot. At some point, the team members <br /> <br /> enter an abandoned house, they find a trio of illegal immigrants who <br /> <br /> ask them comically if they belong to the INS. Chortle, chortle. <br /> <br /> The monster himself is a guy in a rubber suit, and nothing more. For <br /> <br /> such a heavy and clumsy beast, he is able to sneak on <br /> <br /> the players quite calmly, if they are idiotically stuck <br /> in a cage giant as bait, or does not seem to be able to launch its only vehicle <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The gore is macabre, but when it is surrounded by this kind of <br /> <br /> > stupidity, it loses all its effectiveness. I do not know if it was filmed <br /> <br /> before or after "BWP", but I can honestly say that this is the worst movie ever <br /> <br /> made in South Texas on a mythical beast. Pray <br /> <br /> that there are no sequels, I will launch a letter campaign for <br /> <br /> Troma. <br /> <br /> This is noted (R) for his physical strength violence, gun violence, strong <br /> <br /> bloody and profanity. <br /> <br />
