I totally agree that the reenactments kill what might otherwise be a big show. I admit that I had seen 1 or 2 episodes last season and that I did not know at all that it had been reproduced. But when I caught an episode recently, he suddenly jumped on BIG TIME and I lost interest immediately. Then I noticed the warning early before an episode that followed. Did anyone follow the series closely enough to tell me, did they "play" and reconstitute parts more artificially deliberately, or did I simply not noticed before? I'm usually good enough to detect such things, but the recent episode was so artificial that I almost stumbled. Now I have no interest in watching and I have completely given up. It really has no real value if everything is written and acted. And at least lately, it seems VERY poorly written and misinterpreted. The comment above that says who cares if they are all reenactments, I do it. Without visual truth, this is just a bunch of "you know what happened, once this guy" heresay. It's better information to read in a book.
