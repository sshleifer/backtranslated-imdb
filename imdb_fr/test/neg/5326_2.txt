One of the most stupid movies in the history of cinema. Wait, I repeat that - this film can not be included in any category related to "cinema"; it belongs to categories like "waste", dung or similar categories. Ironically, there is even about two garbagemen. The film is titled "Men At Work", a light police comedy starring the Estevez brothers (Sheen) of 1990. Leaving aside the frantic and implausible plot, the bad actions, the bad dialogues, the stunts and the geniuses poorly executed, continuity errors and high rates of unnamed actors never to be seen again, overall it was still a very bad movie (basically, I mean). This is the kind of movie that could be good for one thing: you can watch it about 200 times, learn all the replicas, and repeat it in a fun way, repeating them in public with your * lost * friends, thus securing your status as the biggest dork of your tenth class. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I submitted a forum entry for IMDb (along with this bad review) to the IMDb web page of the movie, if only because I spotted a a silly little punk musical joke that no one else has ever noticed (about the Butthole Surfer statue). I do not quite understand why I should * lose * my time submitting what looks like a trivial note, whereas what I really want to do is blow up Emilio's acting career (no, wait, he's done it himself, thank you, man!) I'm so glad I've * lost * time on this subject, not real money. Besides, can I have maybe at least a tenth of their budget? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could have made two or three much better movies with what they had spent blowing up cars, carefully placing bimbos in bikinis in the background and beating useless extras (henchmen) in a dangerous suit. I would mention Emilio's writing credit, but it would be an exaggeration to call this scenario "writing" - it sounds more like pencil-drawn cartoons. And Charlie Sheen, if you're reading this, I guess Mr.A.W. must have been made during the part of your career in which you were a snotty Hollywood bitch lover who had not grown up yet. (Oops, I'm sorry, I guess part of your life is not over yet.) Get back fast, you're a "half-man." Such a promising talent, if * lost * look, that's it again this word.)
