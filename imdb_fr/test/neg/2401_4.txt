When the American film industry tries to take a critical look at its own government, it makes sure everything is fine, even when it's bad. The film does one thing well, it shows perfectly what is wrong with American politics. The motto seems to be f ** k with anyone to get things done !!! Mix a member of the US Congress, a CIA agent, a Jew and an Arab ... just to fuck the Ruskies. Thanks to the United States for giving us Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The disappointment of the film has just blurred the tracks: to use images of unarmed Afghan children and stories of Soviet atrocities and then a blatant attempt to suggest a link between them and the reasoning behind American help. All sensible people know why the $ 1,000,000 was collected ... not the dying Afghan children, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> As usual, serious problems are hidden in the bullshit dialogue. "That's it, you're very crazy," Hoffmam sings at the end, missing only the American flag in the background and the stupid military solutes. The movies can not help but leave behind a sense of American pride and joy at seeing how we (the Americans) have saved the world ... once again. Even the last 5 minutes of the movie can not save him. We try to stop renting ourselves and to wake up to the fact that this is another American F **. <br /> <br /> The acting and editing was good though.
