It's not a good movie. Clear and simple. Take out the hardcore sex scenes and you'll get a mediocre plot, an average acting game (at best), a painful direction and a monotonous dialogue. Add the cause and you'll get a mediocre plot, an average acting game, a penetrating direction, a dull dialogue, with hardcore porn pampering. The problem is that porn is nothing special either. So it's not a good movie, nor a good porn. He fails on both counts. They can say that women made this film and that they intended to do it with and so on. But it does not matter, the end result is what matters, and here we have a mediocre movie with sex thrown shock value to try to make you waste your time watching it. One of those movies where you'd rather have the time you spent watching it.
