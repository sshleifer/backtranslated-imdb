I saw this for sale - NEW - at my local store for $ 6 and said "Hey!" An action movie with this guy from Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon, directed by the one who made Enter the Dragon - and it's is not expensive! " So I bought it. Oops! It may be the worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen a few. <br /> <br /> Do you know how intentionally campers movies, like Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive, are AWESOME? You know how supposedly serious movies that have become so terrible that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again, like Lionheart (an old Van Damme movie) or John Carpenter's Vampires, are pretty cool? This film, Ironheart, manages to be neither of those. I do not know what the filmmakers thought, but it seems that this film was shot without time to shoot, without budget, without scenario to tell. (While I'm on the score note, I must point out that Bolo Yeung has NO SONGS in this movie - the only reason he gets his first bill on the box is the fact that he's the only actor in the movie you'll ever recognize (unless you're a fan of Jackie Chan, in which case you'll recognize the villain - and you'll want to call him Giancarlo!). <br /> <br /> What's also sad, is that this film is of '92. At that time, T2: the day of the judgment had arrived, so you know that the era of the 80's was over ... but not quite. After that, you'll think that Chuck Norris movies from the 80s, high school comedies, and Jason / Freddy's suites were works of pure genius. <br /> <br /> What you need to know: <br /> <br /> 1) No one in this movie can act for beans. Closer to you, Richard Norton is rather looking for rich and arrogant people, and Bolo Yeung seems rather ... and arrogant. All the rest is appalling. <br /> <br /> 2) The martial arts scenes are forgotten - many cases of white guys with a lot of muscles take off their shirt, scream, run to Britton Lee, get kicked by Britton Lee, be hit by Britton Lee, then fall. Even the final confrontation against Bolo is disappointing, and as creative as the design of my running socks (and just as stinky). <br /> <br /> 3) The rest of the action is pathetic too: the guns look as if they came from the toy department at K-Mart, and in fact, they shoot with the sound of a shotgun. When someone is shot, he bounces a little, then stays still with red-brown liquid stains on his clothes. Britton Lee was apparently shot in the side, but you do not see it at all, then later in the day, you see the wound ... I had paper cuts that were worse than that! <br /> <br /> 4) Of course, then the girl grooms the wound, then they kiss, then you know they are in bed talking after sex. Huh? What? The credible development of love interest, as well as any character development, are completely neglected in this film. Do not forget that Bruce Lee's characters did not need to sleep with someone to be cool? <br /> <br /> 5) The car chase is by far the worst I have ever seen. Looks like the director was sitting on the sidewalk with a camera held in his hand while the two cars were sneaking on the road doing, oh I do not know, about 30 miles an hour? Do not try this at home, kids, these people are professionals! Hah! <br /> <br /> 6) Very bad writing. Here is a scene for you: Lee is followed, so the girl follows the disciples to "warn" Lee, but his car is too slow. So as she catches up, Lee and the bad guys are out of their car and there is a shooting going on. Lee killed two bad guys, but the third is shooting at Lee when the girl is running around Lee, so the villain runs away. (Huh?) Then the girl's car stalls and she can not start it. She tells Lee that she is involved now and is accompanying her. He points out that they can not leave his car there, because the villains will trace it to him. She somehow convinces him that he should decide how to solve this problem - so he pulls on the fuel tank and detonates his car. (And remember that later in the night, they had sex.) Huh?!? <br /> <br /> 7) If you look more closely, in more than half of the photos of the discotheque, the dancers are very out of sync. the music. The dancers are also too coordinated with each other (apparently, in the 80s, all the people in the dance clubs took dance classes). There is a girl in the DJ booth with a microphone, but she never does anything but dance. Bouncers say to people who are fighting to "take outside" - without moving their lips. In one scene, the only bouncers that Lee and Stevo pass are right at the entrance, but they turn their backs! Also, apparently, if you are a major character in the movie, you can get right to the point. <br /> <br /> 8) Lee notices the first time he is followed, but he does not. Do not notice the second time - even if it's the same guy in the same car. The girl, however, notices. The bad guys are followed twice, but they never notice him. <br /> <br /> 9) Lee fears that the bad guys will find her in the girl's car, even though they've seen him go twice. The girl then decides to leave her child at work, in the care of a friend, while she is sleeping with Lee. Do not learn to become a parent with this movie! <br /> <br /> You can not imagine any more blame for the moment ... you have the idea ... Ironheart is so bad that it's not even funny, it's SAD.
