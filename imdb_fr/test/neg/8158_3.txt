I was expecting to see a more exploited movie style, but unfortunately it turned out that it was just a poorly designed, low-budget action movie that just did not have the talent for that. The story tells the story of a very beautiful woman, Teri Marshall (Heather Thomas), whose boyfriend, Rick (Jeffrey Combs) works for a secret agency. He invented a bulletproof motorcycle that can fire lasers and rockets. She also wears a helmet. as well as. The head of the Bosarian agency (Martin Landau) signed a $ 5 million deal to sell it and sent two thugs to rent to kill Rick and Teri and recover the bike. A big blond thug named Rolf (Dar Robinson) and his partner Hanna (Dawn Wildsmith) manage to kill Rick but Teri survives. At home, she discovers a videotape left by Rick, describing his invention and helping Teri decide what to do next. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Teri is pursued by several agents. She gets caught and tortured but does not talk about where a piece of the bike is needed, but she gets help from a federal agent named Waters (Martine Beswick), where they end up using the bike. for a bloody shootout. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Fred Olen Ray who made his career making very low-budget exploitation films, but he made a big mistake by omitting the exploitation aspect. and try to make an action movie. Apart from a quick shower scene at first, there is no nudity and the usual titillation that viewers are used to seeing in a movie Ray can not be found. I do not think anyone expected Thomas to undress, but she does not wear sexy outfit. It did not stop me from looking at her in those tight jeans and admiring her almost perfect, but Ray really bluffed her in that case. As in all his films, the cast is fun to watch and many familiar faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr, Michael Reagan and Russ Tamblyn. Stuntman Dar Robinson died shortly after its creation. This is his last acting job and the film is dedicated to him. You have to wonder why Landau would waste time with such junk, but I was interested in casting Combs in a very rare romantic role. Is Thomas good in this movie? We do not care! I think she showed that she could have become a popular starlet of the movie "B" if she wanted to, but that never happened. Ray makes everyone lose all the time with this effort, even though the cast is fun to watch, but he has omitted the elements that make him a good filmmaker.
