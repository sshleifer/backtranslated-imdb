I do not know which Chasidik movement was this movie? I saw this film a year ago. Am I an orthodox woman living in an Orthodox Chasidic? community And I can tell you that this film offended me, it's so far from reality, it's scary! The director could at least hire a rabbi Chasidik for a brief consultation, before making a "realistic" film about the ultra-Orthodox! For example Meening Davening (morning prayers)! Or a Jewish wedding, or a custom of Mikveh (ritual bath). <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with technical inaccuracies..but they are not the ones that bothered me. This is the spiritual side. The Orthodox are described next to the Taliban. The woman is helpless, while men are the ultimate rulers! Please, no one can force a Jewish girl to go to Chuppa against her will! We, Orthodox, also live in the respect of the law (Halacha), which clearly states the responsibilities of the man towards his wife. No beat and no rape, more! do not put a hand on the woman's head while she is taking a ritual bath, the idea is to immerse the whole body at the same time! The director was clearly trying to hit the ultra-Orthodox! But could he do it at least in a more pleasant and educated way? <br /> <br /> Love story? Cute! But not credible. The dialogues are long and boring. The end is completely nil.For all this drama, I hoped at least a beautiful end, I felt deserved to do it! Obviously, someone was trying to make a soothing film on the conscience for less observant Jews, or for non-Jews, maybe .. (look at these fundamentalists, they are so mean and so bad ...) and they successful! In short, hoping to have a good European film (Kane level), but rather an unbearable tradition, unrealistic and misleading. I mean, today we live in a time of free will like never before. Everyone has the right to choose. Malka chose a rock singer.Rivka made her choice.Meir did her own. Many people from non-observant backgrounds choose Orthodox Judaism these days. Because, in this crazy world, religion could be a beautiful bridge!
