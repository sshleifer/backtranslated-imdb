"Blame it on Rio" is a romantic comedy of the 80s, with more than one eye full of sex throughout its 101-minute autonomy. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns two middle-aged men in crisis, one of which is sorting out his divorce, the other dealing with the possibility of this same perspective. Both good friends, they decide to take a vacation in the exotic Rio de Janeiro, each with a girl by their side. Complications arise when one of them mingles with the girl of the other. <br /> <br /> The potential riot of a story is quite amusing and has some good lines, but it never really gets hilarious, as it could have been. Any attempt to deal seriously with the moral problem does not work either, and perhaps the director Donen should have stayed true to the humor of the situation. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie, but what really spoils everything is the terrible Michelle Johnson performance like the little naughty temptress Jennifer. Although she uses her body wisely, it's the only thing she has. Michelle's actress prowess leaves a lot to be desired. No wonder we did not see it in anything else. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 7, 1994 - Video
