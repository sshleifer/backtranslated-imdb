Before winning an international success with The Silence of the Lambs, the director Jonathan Demme has made his weapons in original comedies. It was one of them and, like many American Academy Award-winning comedies, she has a good concept, she is well paced, she has very good performances, a complicated romance. but it's just not very funny. Pfeiffer is a popular widow who moves to the city's backstaters after the murder of her husband (Baldwin). The crime leader who killed him (Stockwell) loves Pfeiffer, his wife (Reuhl) is furious and to complicate things, Pfeiffer also cracks for the cop who follows her. All this should have made one minute laugh. Pfeiffer, wearing a big wig, is excellent as the widow, just as the hyperactive Ruehl and Modine are good as well as the good cop. But the screenplay is simply devoid of any hyphens, wit, humor or lines of force, of the verbal or physical type that this type of film requires. The result is that it gives the best of smiles rather than gaffaws. It is full of charm, but lacks humor.
