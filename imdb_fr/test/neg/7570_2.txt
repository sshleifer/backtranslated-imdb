It must be one of the most terribly scripted movies I have ever seen. This is essentially a remake of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953), but with your puppet monster resembling a standard snake instead of an elegant Ray Harryhausen creation. Combine the plot of this classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of The Creeping Terror and get an idea of ​​what this movie looks like. <br /> <br /> The film is dubbed, although by the original actors (I think that the film was initially dubbed in Italian for the public of this country, then rebroadcast for an exit in the United States), this which gives a weird look to the movie. the action on the screen, even if the actors' lips move correctly. <br /> <br /> Poor Ray Milland ... he is certainly very far from The Lost Weekend or Dial M for Murder or one of the number of excellent movies in which he was. Add it to his other sci-fi stories (Panic in the Year Zero, X The Man with X-Ray Eyes) and you'll see a good actor fall into a Boris Karloff syndrome ... stuck in doing very bad horror movies in foreign countries just for work.
