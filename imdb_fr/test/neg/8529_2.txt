My Take: Another lame horror movie with predictable scaring tactics and a derivative plot. <br /> <br /> Spirits move. The walls crack. Something is wrong in the basement. These, along with several other horror film clippings, haunt the walls of another house in the country, THE MESSENGERS, produced by Sam Raimi, a lame pastiche of the most predictable panic tactics launched on wildly recycled land ( and sometimes, even worse) horror movies of the past. <br /> <br /> When the Solomon family moves to an old farm in South Dakota, father (Dylan McDermott) tries again to reconnect with the family, especially with his former drunk daughter Jessica (the underestimated Kristen Stewart), in the campaign more subtle than their home in Chicago. The horror ensues when Jessica begins to receive small surprise visits from the poltergeists of the house. Thinking it was a teenager who cried wolf, her parents do not believe her. How could they? The real horror in THE MESSENGERS is waiting for what horror movie it will be wild next. Will it be a flock of angry crows who want more than the family's harvests (a direct rip off of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, THE BIRDS)? Will it be the haunted house with a history dating back to THE AMITYVILLE HORROR or POLTERGEIST? Or will it be grotesque ghosts taken from your recent, familiar horrors such as THE RING and THE GRUDGE? Heck, the movie even manages to rip off a scene or two of some really bad horror movies like AMITYVILLE 3-D and the mediocre COLD CREEK MANOR. Maybe all the Pang Brothers really wanted to do was a B-level horror movie, but should it be so bad? Could not they scam the best? Avoid it. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of 5.
