What I hate the most about this trash is the arrogant attitude of filmmakers and network leaders who blame nonsense on the public because they really think that the audience is so stupid, so unworthy, so insipid that he deserves this kind of cons. There is an inherent entertainment to see disaster movies and with the magic of today's CGI effects, artists have powerful tools to explore what was previously denied them. With this pace, we sat down to watch chaos and destruction. Well, guess what, the only chaos we saw was in the commercials touting the episode next Wednesday. What a desappointment! But wait, there was even a bigger one. The script itself was the biggest disaster! And then there was the direction and flabby play of all the people involved in this turkey. But we knew it before, right ?! We knew that the effects alone were not part of the entertainment activities, but yet, the channel, which accepted Okayed this TV movie, did not care about that because their mantra is the eternal line "never underestimate the stupidity public". These guys have to live by that motto, and I'm so sick of it. No wonder the public has abandoned the American drama en masse and has presented its camp in reality. at least in these programs, no one is trying to make people believe something different from what they are: intellectual pornography. Well, category 6 is worse than that, because it assumes to be different and "original". Yes, it was a disaster movie, but disasters are not what they announced!
