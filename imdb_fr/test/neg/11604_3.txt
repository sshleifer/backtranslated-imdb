Alfred Hitchcock did this comedy about the illegal marriage in 1941, but his heart does not seem to be there. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couple who discover that they have never been legally married and spend the movie bickering to find true love. It does not have a lot of reputation and it's easy to see why. The jokes are familiar with the best movies but here they do not gel. And the tracks are not charismatic. Lombard's performance is cut off and starchy and it's doubly sad to think she died a year later. Robert Montgomery seems to know that he is in the ear of a sow and tries to make it into a silk handbag without much success. The best performance comes from Gene Raymond as "other man" (he has a beautiful stuffed scene). It's one of the very, very bad Hitchcock movies.
