Spend your time otherwise, even the housework is better than this movie. The jokes are not funny, the amusing rhymes of Dr. Seus are not there. A very ugly way to lose a night. My children aged 4 to 16 laughed a little at first. The youngest ones got fed up and went to play Barbies, while the older ones went to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and did the dishes. So I finished it alone. It was the worst movie "kids" that I saw. If you want to watch a fun movie for kids, watch Shrek 2, this movie is fun for kids and their parents. AVOID THIS FILM. It's not funny, it's not cute, the cat's makeup is pretty much all positive and it shows on the label of the disc.
