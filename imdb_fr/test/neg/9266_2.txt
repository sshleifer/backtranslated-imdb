My grandfather gave me this DVD. With friends like these. The blanket looked scary enough for me to look at it. What a bloody mistake. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film follows three people in a bus and involves friends. <br /> <br /> The first is about a guy who buys a car talking to him. The second is about a guy who wakes up to find a clone of cassarole in his fridge. And the third is about a woman who is dating online, but it turns out he has a robotic arm. <br /> <br /> The DVD rated this movie at 18, but even a 5-year-old can watch it without being lost or entertained. The film must be ranked 12 for small scares and the bloody big word. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is total shit, do not approach it.
