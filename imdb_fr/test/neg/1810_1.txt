The book on which this movie is based has little action to start. So, the idea of ​​turning it into a film anyway seems like a totally casual idea, essentially guaranteeing a failure. <br /> <br /> The bulk of the book is about the mental journey of a young sailor named Marlow who worked in the darkness of the Congo and in all people - I feel that the screenwriter has massively failed to capture the essence of Marlow's travels. He totally missed the biggest problem of light compared to darkness. This is the point in the book and when it does not translate in the film, there is only 100 minutes of boredom and monotony. <br /> <br /> This being the case, the question is asked: why would we make a film? An even better question could then be asked: who would want to look at it? It's a chore to watch. If it had not contributed to a grade in my English class, I would not have even considered watching the movie. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Heart of Darkness is stripped of all its insight and meaning when taken from the pages of the book. The news is a torment to read about twenty pages or so, but we think afterwards that it's a pretty decent book. The film is like a shot in the dark without any chance in the world to hit its target. <br /> <br /> How can a book dealing only with mental processes and achievements of darkness be described physically and visually? I have the impression that it is impossible to show thoughts precisely. In addition, I feel that the difference in time between the book and the film creates major points that do not seem to add up. The novel Heart of Darkness was published in 1902, while the film version of Heart of Darkness dates from 1993. The 91 years between the two could partly explain the apparently different nature of the grounds. The news seems to have much more difficult conditions, and the film does not describe the prehistoric atmosphere of the Congo. The Congo, in the film, just seems to be another place, not the dark and inhuman place that the book describes in this setting. I think that removes another major element that really contributes to the news. <br /> <br /> Two of the biggest aspects of the plot missing in the film, the lack of decency found in the book Heart of Darkness. left. When the light / dark controversy is the main theme, not including it in the film gives the impression that the entire movie will be incredibly useless - and it is. It is boring, uninteresting and a considerable waste of time. There is no reason to look at it. The book is stripped of any meaning it has. If it's necessary, for whatever reason, read the book. Avoid the movie at all costs.
