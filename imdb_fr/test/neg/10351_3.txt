It's not too bad, but in the end, it misses the quality of the Australian series. <br /> <br /> The jokes are rare, the actors are attractive (they should not be), the filmmakers think too much about the cinematography (it must look like a home video) and a serious version of Kath and Kim ... that's stupid. <br /> <br /> It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim are supposed to be two round, middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear silly clothes. There is no "Look at me Kimmy!" jokes. Kim's big friend is not fat and she's not even stupid. She is a chick stereotyped black / latino. <br /> <br /> It's just not as stupid and funny as the Australian series. It does not compare. Nothing is the same. I admit that this show is sometimes quite funny, but it looks nothing like the Australian series. I was looking forward to an American version of a bogan family. They missed. It's supposed to be REALLY stupid and hilarious, but the actors do not pretend to be stupid! For me, this is just a typical American TV show. It's disappointing if you want it to be something like the Australian show. <br /> <br /> 2 stars because it's an OKAY show, but nothing looks like it should be.
