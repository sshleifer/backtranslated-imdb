I watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and it was probably one of the most boring and funny movies I've ever had the misfortune to see. First, Matthew Modine is a terrible actor and has ruined most of the film. In addition, the plot is too stupid. The only reason we checked in this movie was Alec Baldwin, and his character was eliminated pretty quickly. Unless you are a fan of Michelle Phiffer, you should probably avoid this movie like the plague. Many people do not rent this movie enough, but I just can not understand what people think is great about it. If it's supposed to be the dark humor that makes this movie so great, then I guess anything can be considered comedy nowadays.
