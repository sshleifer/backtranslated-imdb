Horrible Script, which has apparently been directed by ... nobody? The Marines can not fend off the monster with machine guns, but they recoil when a 15-year-old girl, karate, hits him in the face a few times. It's supposed to be a luxury liner, but the chic dining room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital. It appears that they rented a high school for the summer and took out chairs and other objects to decorate the ensemble. At the end of the shoot, they are pulled from the water and boarded a boat and within 3 seconds they are apparently about two miles from the ship as it sinks. How are films like this one made? I guess anyone can be in a movie these days. Aaron James, NYC
