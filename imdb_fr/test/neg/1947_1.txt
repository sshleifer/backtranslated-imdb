It's really bad, the characters were bland, the story was boring and there is no sex scene. Moreover, the drama is missing, the conflict is minimal, which makes it extremely slow. Nothing happens in this movie, you would expect a sex scene, but they just have a kiss. The plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife and a stranger they take high. The couple invites the stranger to stay with them because he is homeless. At this point, you expect the stranger to have sex with his wife, right? No, they kiss each other and that's all. In addition, this movie contains no action, no comedy, no drama and no suspense. This makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script !!!!
