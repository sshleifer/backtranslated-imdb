Reading the book, I once again felt attracted to Castle Rock (Needful Things being the last part of the Rock trilogy) and the plot was a variant of the narrative like "the demon comes to a small redneck village" that King likes to tell. The characters have all been lovingly described and this has made a good psychological and bloody horror. The film, on the other hand, is awful. No more character interactions and clever plot, replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but lacking in every respect. If you have not read the book, enjoy it, otherwise avoid it at all costs, as in most of King's movies.
