I love exotic science fiction / fantasy movies, but this one was very rude to watch. Suggestions and images of child abuse, mutilated bodies (alive or dead), other macabre scenes, scenes of intrigue, boring drama made it an unfortunate experience. The basic idea of ​​penetrating the mind of another person is not even new The episode Limits was better to explore this idea I gave it 4/10 because some special effects were good.
