OK, the only reason I watched this movie is because Krista Allen is there. Since I admit to watching Days of our lives ... I know her as Billie. Oh, of course, there may be a reason to watch this movie ... it would be the soft porn box. They seem to excel at that. And little else. I hope anyone who rents / buys this movie only rent it for the sex scene. Because if they bought / rented for something else, say Quality TV, they could die of a heart attack. This film involves little imagination. Although I laugh at his stupidity, and maybe I'll buy it myself, I'm just a fool. Rent before buying on this one. 2 out of 10. (note, I have not yet given 1 star to a movie.) The sensual scene is alone and rose a 1. If there was not a 1 in the pot and I want a refund if it was not.
