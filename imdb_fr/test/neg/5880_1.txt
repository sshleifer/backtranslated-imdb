I saw the * star * of this movie on The Daily Show, and I thought I could connect (the movie was created on Comedy Central, then went to the theater). Oh Vey! <br /> <br /> It makes "Shakes the Clown" look like "Citizen Kane"! Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. Not a laugh, not even a smile. This film will make your face appear as pimples and your eyes will burst like the last survivors of "Raiders". I can not even think of a worse movie, either "Manos" or "Ishtar". At the call of the Pythons, run away, run away! Why did anyone give the go-ahead unless they use their own money? The horror is that there is not a good line, not a good joke and only a bad thing ... the making of this movie. hilarious. As it is, I need a new pancreas to vomit so hard. Cursed anyone who is involved in this parody.
