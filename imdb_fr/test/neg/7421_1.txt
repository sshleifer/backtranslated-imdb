Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) takes a group of people to a mountain to help find his missing daughter (Erica Durance). What they do not know is that she was killed by a sasquatch (Taras Kostyuk) and she is still there ... waiting for them. <br /> <br /> It was late at night when I inserted this in my DVD player. I really wish I could go back in time and stop. Most people will tell you that movies like "House of the Dead" or "SI.C.K: Serial Insain Clown Killers" will be the movies you'd never want to see. False. This will be the case. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of shit, but it's the only shit that haunts me. How I would like to never watch this! The acting is not so bad. It's just writing and staging, rhythm and everything! I'm actually a fan of Sasquatch movies. But not this one. <br /> <br /> Please, listen to my warning. Do not look at that!
