This is another extraterrestrial imitation that is not very good. Replace the outer space with the South African desert, add the same ingredients, a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape, have them hunt down the same story of a very ordinary film trying to simulate a classic movie. A group of miners and scientists search for missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert, cleared of all flesh. Their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilization while they are hunted down by the monster. The African region is quite pretty but that's basically all that this film has for it. There was a vain attempt to create tension, but I found that it did not really work and made the film rather boring. The creature did not show up much and when that happened, it did not really feel horror. A scene where someone had the flesh torn off his arm, but that was essentially the case. In conclusion, I found this film as exciting as watching it dry with paint. I give this movie 4/10 and it's only because of its interesting location that is not enough on its own to save this movie
