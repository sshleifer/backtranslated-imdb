I watched the unrated version of this film and as a person who has studied Speck's life and crimes closely, I must say that this film is both a false but ambitious vision of the true story . By capturing the real horror of Speck and the murders, this movie commits the following factual errors. 1. Speck did not inject drugs at the scene of the crime, as described in the film. In fact, he was mainly an alcoholic and a pillbox who rarely took drugs with a syringe. 2. The Asian nurse who survived the Speck massacre did not crawl up the stairs and under the couch in the living room, as the movie shows. It would have been impossible. In real life, she hid under a bed while Speck methodically eliminated her 8 victims. 3. The film describes Speck as violent and brutal with women as soon as he meets them. Not true. In fact, Speck was initially calm and gentle, reassuring women that he was not going to hurt them. That's how he managed to tie each of them. 4. The real Richard Speck was not the deep thinker that the film describes him. FBI profiler Robert Ressler interviewed Speck in the 1980s and said Speck did not only know why he committed the killings, but did not want to know why or why. Speck was known for his sub-average intelligence and not for the philosopher king who narrates this film. If the story was not so tragic and horrible, the voiceover would be laughable. All in all, Doug Cole's performance is sufficiently threatening and cold-blooded, although I do not think the real Speck has been so advanced in its violence. No doubt he was a very violent man when he was under the influence, but he was also known to be a clever rogue who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them. Beverly Ann Sotelo's performance as a surviving nurse is the best of the film. She is a very good actress. If you're crazy, do not see this movie. It's very graphic and disturbing.
