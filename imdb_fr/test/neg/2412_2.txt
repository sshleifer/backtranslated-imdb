The only asset of this film is the artwork on the promotion poster of H. R. Geiger. The anti-nuclear protesters who all looked like punk-rockers of the late 1970s and somehow became non-violent (with the exception of their leader, "Splatter") occupy the cities. The fraternity boys come down on the punkers to do some violence on them and turn them into victims. A bad action and a bad plot then descend on the real victim, you, the spectator. I gave him a "2" because some sexual scenes give him at least a potential MST3K. <br /> <br />
