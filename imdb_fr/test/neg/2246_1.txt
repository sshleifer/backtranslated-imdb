Hooray for the title spelling mistakes! After reading reviews and thinking, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this film was a waste. This film lost her as one of those Rare Tarantino fans. I wish this film was nitrate-based, and that all the copies are perfectly stacked under a fan of Tarantino smoking chain. The literally useless violence, the intrigues, the table-itis without drama of Tarantino and the development of the absent characters made of it a deeply painful and glorified montage. <br /> <br /> What was the acting game? And how much was it just because I was too busy reading the subtitles? I watch my part of anime fansubbed, and congratulations for the attempt of authenticity, but it was exaggerated for a film in English. With glaring historical inadequacies, constant reading has killed what was in acting. <br /> <br /> Why pay money for a narrator who will have absolutely no connection with any of the characters, plot, themes, sets or anything involved in the film? When the film needs these original explanations, it lets guess the dirt that follows. <br /> <br /> Historical Research - While it was sprinkled with interesting factiods, used appropriate costumes and props for the soldiers, this film stretched the truth beyond belief, even for historical fiction. Congratulations to Mata Hari's reference, although using it as a prefiguration was a little too much. Mata Hari was executed by firing squad, and not suffocated in an isolated room. It ruined the meaning of the reference. <br /> <br /> Other critics mention more than half a dozen tributes to other artists in the first 15 minutes. Seen the public, all these references and others have been completely lost for those who would like to see this movie and all those who would appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I do not really know when he will start a scene. , finish it and what needs to be included. In a movie promoted as an action movie, why did it take almost 20 minutes to install some kind of testosterone? <br /> <br /> What I believe to be the message was banal. The idea of ​​rats and how we act against them of a primal nature, and "who is the rat?" were at best clichés, but at worst unrealized. The mention of US camps for Japanese and German Americans would have added legitimacy to this issue on the moral ground. Literally, all the characters of the movie having obtained a role of speech were taken in their own legend. Is this the world Tarantino lives in? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not pay to see this one. I regret not having bothered to watch it, even with well-meaning hosts. There was a rich base of ideas to develop, but none were realized.
