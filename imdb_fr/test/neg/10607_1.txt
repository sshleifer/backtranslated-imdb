Pure shit, a decent cinematography ... I liked some colors. Apart from that, it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Boring, lifeless, I have never been interested in any of the characters. I continued to wait for a real plot to form and the film to take the pace. Nothing has ever happened! I think they spent too much time working on the hair and the wardrobe that they had forgotten that a film was in progress.
