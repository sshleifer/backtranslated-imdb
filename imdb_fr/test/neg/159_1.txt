This film fails on all fronts. For starters, he is pretentious, strives to be "significant" and fails miserably. The scenario was extremely banal, nobody ever said anything interesting. It was impossible to worry about one of the characters. Knightly was a waste of time in itself while Sienna Miller was a waste of time. The word about the soldier who went to war was a cliché even before the movie Atonement uses it. The use of the Second World War as a backdrop was in itself a cliché: bombs, shelter in subway stations, etc., used to import a much needed drama. Why did anyone think for a moment that this film was worth doing is beyond my comprehension. It was again a case of "give the costumes an authentic appearance, no matter the story, the script or the acting!"
