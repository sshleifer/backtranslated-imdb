A fastidiously gloomy cinematographic waffle. I could not believe how bad this movie was. I just watched it because of the many people who talked about it on this site. Was I watching the same movie? The entire episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that has happened in Garps' past has affected his future (or anyone else's) and nobody has been affected by their past. I think it was Socrates who said about theater that if a scene can be removed from a play without effect, it should not be there. Obviously, the director did not know this rule and therefore stuffed his "work" scene after scene. Even the plane that crashed into the house was unexpected, it was not a surprise, but it was unexpected! <br /> <br /> It should be mentioned that at the time of writing this article (December 1, 2002), even though people say it's one of their favorite movies, no one has taken worth adding a memorable quote. The reason is that there is simply not one. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time looking at this, just watch a chain of boards.
