"Threat" is not funny. He tries - too hard. but rarely brings a smile. There is no acting, just flying. One of the main characters wears a stupid grin on his face throughout the movie. There is no doubt that the less talented Wayans brothers played, wrote and produced the film and were totally blind to their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> Threat consists of a series of non-funny skits, a joke. You can see the hit line for miles, but you have to wait for everything to happen. No zippy one-liners or catchy dialogue here. Just one scene after another preparing for the joke. The jokes themselves are juvenile. Loc Dog (the one who has the perma-grimace) speaks to a beautiful woman - but then she has ... bad breath, then she takes her nose and then, wait for her (remember that you must always watt) she fart ! How is this funny? It may seem funny to 10-year-old boys because they will not have heard the jokes as often. Alternatively, if you like to watch drunken or stoned movies, you can follow and even find it fun. The challenge will be drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the film without fainting.
