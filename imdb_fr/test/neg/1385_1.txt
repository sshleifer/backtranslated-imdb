That's right, I can not watch Comedy Central anymore because I can not stand watching the repeated commercials on this show. I'll tell you the truth, it's a dreadful series, not because I'm shocked, but because Carlos Mencia is one of the worst humorists I've ever seen. I prefer to watch Carrot Top make an impression of George Bush than to watch this hack without skill. And to believe that he is called the greatest. Even if he did not steal the jokes, it is always bad to tell them, it is offbeat and without originality. I remember that in a joke, he said, "Why are whites going camping, pretending to be poor for a week?" Now, what is it supposed to mean? That all whites are rich? Another one I did not understand was when he did a skit about Price is Right and said to a fat guy, "You should know how much a fridge costs, you're fat" and the Big looked sad. . But what does that mean? What "fat people" are still looking for refrigerators? These are just the two examples I saw in his ads. God knows what his show looks like. <br /> <br /> This show falls in the likes of Epic Movie and Date Movie ..
