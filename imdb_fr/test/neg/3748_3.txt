First of all, if you want to make a good movie, do not put all your exposure in the last 10 minutes. The viewer should remain perplexed for nearly two hours, but Margo's father will explain everything to him very late in the film. To make matters worse, the screenwriter decided that it was not enough to solve the fundamental mystery, but added a totally useless murder of which we knew nothing (involving Alex's father!). <br /> <br /> There are serious motivation problems with the characters too. The choices of Margo's father do not seem to make sense once the film is finished. Why did not he just kill Philippe's father and finish? Instead, we invent a complicated plot to obscure the truth, but which guarantees that everyone will be physically in danger for years (including the completely innocent photographer, who is murdered by the thugs of Philip's father ). Although Alex is a doctor (who is thought brilliant enough), he chooses to flee the police, during which he puts not only his life in danger, but also those he leads in an unpleasant heap on the highway. Why did Margo's friend hold on to keeping her promise to Margo, once all that shit hits the fan for Alex? And should we think that Margo's father would rather kill himself than go to jail? And his wife? Did he consider his wishes? These are some of the main problems. <br /> <br /> Then there are some unpleasant details, like: why was his father there the night of his fictitious death? How could he get his hands on the body of the junkie in such a short time and get it back quickly to bury it with the other two? Alex's friend, Bruno, seems too eager to be part of the chaos in which he and his friends have to kill Alex, despite his apparent debt to Alex for saving his son's life. What would be the purpose of Margo's photos? They do not involve Philippe at all. And why would Margo have the safe key handy that night to her potential captors? Have I forgotten other things? Probably. My minor irritations include the fact that although Alex is a doctor, he smokes like a demon. What makes his marathon even more impressive. Moreover, when he is in the convertible with his lawyer, none of them wears his seatbelt. How bright could they be?
