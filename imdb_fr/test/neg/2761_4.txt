I read a lot of books in my short life but this is by far the worst !!! I just finished reading this trash worthless and when I finished it, I threw it across the room! I hated it and let me explain the reasons! 1.The soldier dies. Why would the author kill the soldier ?! Why could not she keep him alive like a good love story writer ?! I applaud Patty deeply for trying to hold the eyes of this FBI agent. <br /> <br /> 2.Ruth gets fired. Ruth (the black housekeeper) gets fired and for no apparent reason too! She tried to comfort Patty, then her father, SOB, sent her away for no good reason! Ruth, Anton and Patty were the only bright spots in the book. Oh and grandparents too! 3. The perm. Yes. The perm. Now, perhaps you think why the perm would annoy you? Well here is why. Patty's mother asks the girl if she wants to get her hair done. Patty says no, but the mother calls Mrs. Reeves (the awful hairdresser) and tells her to give Patty a perm. Why on the green earth of God would she do that? Why would a mother ask her daughter if she wants a permanent only for her to get a permanent anyway! Mom still claims that Patty has a say while she has no say !!! She should receive the "Worst Mother of the Year Award" for everything she has given to Patty. Thank God, Ruth cut off the perm! 4. Discrimination, Racisem and Prejudious. I hate discrimination in this book. They use the word * beep too much. Yes. I know that at that time the blacks were free but basically had no rights, but go! Why teach this word to today's children! It just teaches them to discriminate against people. Not only blacks have been discriminated against, but the Chinese too. In the book, people refer to Mr.Lee (a Chinese) as "The * beep." It's really despicable and the last but not the least ... Jews and Nazis I hate the city for spitting a little girl What was so much she is a 12 year old girl can really like a 22 year old girl.Go it's not "Lolita". And "Lolita" It's a good book, not a piece of dirt! I am surprised that this film is not considered "dirty" as "Lolita". <br /> <br /> 5. Patty goes to a recovery center, the rebuffs are reserved for thieves and murderers and not to innocent 12 year olds The teacher or whatever it was called Patty was an ungrateful and spoiled kid Patty should have a community service or something like that She did not do anything wrong She just helped a friend. <br /> <br /> 6. Favortisem Parents played favoritism with their children Patty, their eldest daughter is clearly the least favored, while Sharon, the five-year-old, is their favorite daughter. The father says he wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood but clearly forgets his other daughter. <br /> <br /> 7. The dad. I hated him! He was so mean that Patty might as well have Hitler as his father. Her father beats her for no apparent reason and the way he talks to her in the end will make you so angry that you'll be trapped thinking that "Patty would be better treated in a concentration camp". <br /> <br /> Well that's it for you guys. 7 reasons why I hate this book. Instead of reading this book, read "Anne Frank's Diaries" or something else because I warn you, it's very depressing and it will really make you angry! The only reason he gets 4 stars is Anton, Patty, Ruth and the grandparents!
