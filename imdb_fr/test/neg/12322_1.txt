Well, the glimpses looked funny and I do not usually go to the movies on the night of the opening night, especially with my kids, because ...... you never know. This is a film that will not please children or adults because the jokes are too perverse for children and fall flat for adult entertainment. I was really embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year olds and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells. Essentially, what is happening here is a total twist of Dr. Seuss' classic. He adds a devilish and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for his money. If it was a secondary plot, it might have worked, but it is actually the major plot in the whole film and "the cat" plays a bigger role in exposing the neighbor to the mother for whom he is really. Follow my advice, read the book and transmit the film.
