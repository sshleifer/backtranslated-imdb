The title suggests to viewers that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better under the influence, but it's not good at all. A 15-minute sequence with Jack Black playing one of his songs beautifully and making a trip on acid while venturing through the woods does not save the film at all. All the actors in this movie did better things, except the main girls, I could not think of any movie where I had seen them before. I hate making movies, but I also hate not being able to find something decent in the movies. The film is sad, not very funny and had such potential with its awesome casting. If it was redone and written on it, it could be great. If you want a good looking movie, watch Grandma's Boy, or Half Baked or Dazed and Confused, but it's not a movie to watch.
