It's a pretty simplistic novel. A girl finds a boy, a girl loves a boy, a girl loses a boy, a girl finds a boy. Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe, offering a wonderfully varied dramatic / romantic performance that deserves an Oscar. The special effects of aerial combat are also interesting. <br /> <br /> Moore embodies a French woman whose mother entrusted her field to a British air squadron during the First World War. She is the "daughter of the regiment", loved as a little sister. In this mix comes a replacement for a leaflet shot, Gary Cooper. At first, they hate each other, then they love each other, then the whole squadron is sent on a suicide mission. Cooper comes back but hangs in the village and a Red Cross unit pulls him out Moore searches for him, tells him at the hospital that he's dead, then walks the streets until he's calling for a window of the hospital and they are together. <br /> <br /> It's a nice little novel, but little more than that. Recommended for Ms. Moore and Mr. Cooper fans
