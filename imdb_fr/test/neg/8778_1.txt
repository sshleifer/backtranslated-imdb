There are so many problems with this movie that it's hard to pick a few. Let's start with stupid and boring songs. Like "Ride Little Cowboy" that tends to accentuate the urban look of Klinton Spilsbury. The idiotic cowboy kiddie songs played in the background during the film undermined the credibility of the story. <br /> <br /> I had seen the hype that preceded the release of this film and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed various TV shows and his voice was very soft and sweet. His body language was not exactly what people remembered from fans of Clayton Moore and the television series Lone Ranger. Spilsbury did not help things by acting like a diva and talking about Clayton Moore after the producers got an injunction barring Moore from appearing at conventions and other events as an original Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore was not even allowed to sign as "Clayton Moore, the Lone Ranger". He could only sign "The Masked Man". The film's incredible negative publicity for the film was only reinforced by the irritating attitude of Spilsbury, who soon told reporters that Clayton Moore would soon be forgotten when the movie came out! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even after the movie was a total fiasco, the company owning The Lone Ranger refused to lift the injunction against Clayton Moore, and he was never allowed to sign anything except "The Masked Man" and he could not put his black mask to any public appearance. Between the personality of Spilsbury's diva and the negative publicity that the film had, it certainly did not help to make a good impression on the audience. Worse still, a few weeks before the film's final release, it was announced that Spilsbury's voice in the film had been surpassed by James Keech because the producers thought that Spilsbury did not look very convincing as coworkers. boy. The ridicule and derision that this news brought to the talk shows and comedies of that time put the last nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> But Merle Haggard told her story in the film. Apparently, the producers were hoping that the macho image of Haggard (one of the outlaws of country music) would add credibility to Spilsbury as a Lone Ranger. Merle Haggard's narration was just another annoyance the audience was facing. Sometimes, Haggard rhymes with his narration, and it sounds like a weird children's movie. Combine the narration that rhymes with the songs of "Ride Little Cowboy" and any credibility that Spilsbury could have found would be destroyed by Haggard and the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Tonto was played by Michael Horse and, as others have pointed out, Horse had a lot more personality than Spilsbury. In fact, perhaps because of Spilsbury's supposedly combative stance during filming, it seems that Horse had much more time for dialogue and time on the screen than anyone could have expected from Tonto. Tonto supports and is often the leader instead of the Lone Ranger. I was expecting (or hoping) that Billy Jack would make an appearance as Tonto's brother (that would have greatly improved the movie). Horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury, but he says more and offers better scenes. Perhaps it was a case where Horse stole the show at Spilsbury. However, as the film was so miserable, Horse did not have much recognition. Unlike Spilsbury, Horse has had a very productive career in the film industry. <br /> <br /> The last negative point of this film is perhaps the powder blue suit of The Lone Ranger. The material chosen for Spilsbury was a powderier blue than what Clayton Moore normally wore in appearances. This choice of color for outfit makes Spilsbury more effeminate in her role. The cartoon version showed that The Lone Ranger also wore a red shirt and black pants, and this alternative outfit could have given Spilsbury a more convincing appearance than The Lone Ranger. . They all seem to be working on a TV episode and nobody seemed very convincing. Even the villain, Cavendish lost his advantage because of his entourage. Overall, I'm sorry for Spilsbury. Not only did he have a terrible acting job, but it is obvious that the production and advertising were horrible and sabotaged any chance of the poor guy. Although he was an excellent replacement for Clayton Moore, I doubt that the film went well due to other factors. In the current state of things, this film is funny and sad.
