My mother and I went to see this film because my brother served in the US Peace Corps in the same area where he is. Halfway through the film, I decided that, given his inability to measure up to what he claims to accomplish, the title is pretentious. The subject he was discussing could have been an excellent documentary, but because of his poor performance, he gave me far less information on the subject than I had hoped to become. I agree with laura-jane from Canada ("Powerful message but lack of concentration"). I also agree with the user who commented that the filmmaker's nonsense style was the opposite of Michael Moore's, but I do not think he presents divergent points of view and invites the viewer to decide himself. I agree with a user's comment that "a lesson is better learned when we draw our conclusions ourselves"; However, our conclusions can only be ill-founded if we have little relevant information to draw them. <br /> <br /> The main points of the documentary seemed to be that 1) Africans who live near Lake Victoria are very poor and suffer a lot. 2) The introduction of perch in Lake Victoria, inflicted by Europeans, has ruined its ecosystem. 3) The communities around Lake Victoria are financially dependent on the boom economy. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about the film is that it tried to link the average population outlook in sub-Saharan Africa, which, unfortunately, is an anomaly among the films and that he has tried to portray poverty as the result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal and inevitable phenomenon. I liked the irony he captured in the massive amount of fish leaving the country facing starvation. I appreciated the fact that the US team assigned to the region is not in contact with the population. Like almost all documentaries whose titles do not contain the word "women", this film does not succeed in portraying women's voices - the majority of interviews conducted in interviews are those of men. <br /> <br /> I may need to watch the movie a second time to understand some of the key points that have escaped me, but I have failed to detect Sauper's theory of the relationship between the introduction of perch into Lake Victoria and unfair living conditions for Africans living near the lake. Also, I could be wrong, but I'm struck by the fact that Sauper could improve his maintenance skills. Not only did the questions he asked and the answers he included seem arbitrary, but he seemed to have a real talent for making interviewees clumsy and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The most convincing evolution of the film is the suggestion. that boom exports have the effect of disguising the import of weapons and that the real economy facing Tanzanians is war, not fishing. Unfortunately, Sauper avoids in depth exposing the idea (or at least prolonging the interview with the journalist who seemed to know what he was talking about the import of weapons) and the cops with an approach " to decide oneself ". . <br /> <br /> If Darwin's nightmare was supposed to dispel the myth that the first global exploitation of the Third World gives them "a chance to live better", it does not succeed at all. If it was intended to show how the arms manufacturing industry in the United States and Europe is the source of many armed conflicts around the world, it has not done a good job. If it was meant to describe what drives people to prostitution, it did not do a good job. If it was intended to highlight the UK's inability to fulfill its mission, it did not do a good job. If it was supposed to say that the meager incomes that Tanzanians earn with the boom are not worth the human cost of tinkering with Mother Nature to create a profitable product, it has not worked well. If it meant that Tanzania would be better if the Europeans never came, it did not.
