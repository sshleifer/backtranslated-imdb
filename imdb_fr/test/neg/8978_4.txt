Although it was Hunter S. Thompson's first documentary, I saw that it was at best an average, despite the participation of huge stars such as Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey and a few others. It dropped me and yet it was still a bit interesting. Some of the old Fear and Loathing clips in Las Vegas and Where the Buffalo Roam kept me watching. It's not very good, especially because of the old guys who walk around and all fans already know. I still think they were treating her because she could have been at least half compressed. If you're still a fan, you'll love everything about the hunter. Best regards
