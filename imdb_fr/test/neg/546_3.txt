The version of "Enchanted April" of 1935 manages to be both tedious and tedious. It's hard to show the transformative magic of Italy shooting in a studio with stereotypical Italian behavior. The transformation of the four foreigners fleeing London is instant in the situation from the first day to a week later. Rather than expanding, the scenario activates a switch and the characters <br /> <br /> are different. <br /> <br /> Husbands are pretty boring in flashbacks without turning around, even though their presence does not drive the four women back to their shell and / or hostilities. <br /> <br /> Jessie Ralph has a lot of fun (moving instead of <br /> completely dismantling the landscape) and Katharine Alexander has a moving charm out of her husband's shadow <br /> <br /> > (and away from his hideous buzz). Ann Harding is <br /> <br /> not remarkable here (the production code being applied). She had an appropriate line <br /> in a previous movie (before the Code), "When Ladies Meet": "You're worth not <br /> <br /> a minute of an hour of anxiety one or the other of us has given you ", but in" April enchanted "can only seem hurt, darken and proclaim fidelity to the lost husband.
