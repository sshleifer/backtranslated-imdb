I do not know how you can give good ratings to this movie. I did not praise it, thinking it was the next big horror movie, the next big horror parody or the next big, low-budget horror parody. Obviously, this is not intended to scare, but a fatal mistake with the production has completely undermined the joy of the viewing experience. The sound editing was horrible. I had to work on controlling the volume of the entire movie. You can imagine how difficult it is to get into something - even a low-budget parody - when you increase or decrease the volume or if you try to anticipate the next time. The regular dialogue is very weak and all the cries, noises, etc. are very strong. We are not talking about switching between 5 and 7 on the volume control, finding a happy medium at 6 o'clock. We are talking about switching between 2 and 9 on the volume where it is almost impossible to leave the volume alone. Again, this film may be a good example of what it's supposed to be, but you'll spend so much time adjusting your volume control that you'll never have the chance to appreciate it.
