Another production of Lo Wei that completely ruins the talents of a young Jackie Chan, To Kill With Intrigue is a strange mix of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action and old-fashioned kung-fu fights, quite boring despite several moments Surrealist WTF and a lot of ridiculously bad dialogues. <br /> <br /> In order to protect his pregnant girlfriend, Chin Chin, from Killer Bees, a band of ruthless killers who are about to attack his home, Cao Lei (Jackie Chan) claims to be a man without heart, chasing her and saving her from danger. <br /> <br /> During the attack, Cao's relatives are all killed, but he remains relatively unscathed by the gang, whose leader is wearing a scar. -faced woman, seems to have the hots for him. Cao then goes in search of Chin Chin, whom he has trusted to his close friend Chu Chuk. <br /> <br /> During his quest to regain his true love, Cao befriends the head of a courier company whose valuable cargo was stolen by 'Bloody Rain' clan leader . Finally, after being wounded in a fight against members of the evil clan (a fun scene with lots of stupid weapons), then found cured by the scar-faced slayer (who shows his love by burning his face!), Cao finally learns that he is an ugly character judge: his friend, Chu Chuk, is none other than the power-hungry tribal leader of the "Bloody Rain" clan, who plans to marry Chin Chin himself. <br /> <br /> Stop the fierce battle, Cao being hit in the face several times before smothering his traitorous ex-friend with a scarf to death. <br /> <br /> Even Chan fans will find it a chore to stay alone, only the final fight succeeds in highlighting some of the incredible acrobatic abilities of the star. Fans of the strange Asianism could discover the spooky appearance of the Killer Bees at the beginning of the film (with a character inexplicably asking for his hand cut!), Or the moment when three men cross a window to attack our hero, but, for the most, this movie will have a very limited appeal.
