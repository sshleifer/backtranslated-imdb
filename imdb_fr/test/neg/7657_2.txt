This movie has more blunders than any other movie I've seen in my life. The special effects are damn terrible. For example, towards the end, when the Concorde falls after the cargo door has torn, the thing turns like a toy. The special effects of Airport (1970) are much better than this shit. In addition, the strength of a Concorde that opens up to altitude and speed would have the effect of reversing the situation. (That is, if it would even open at all) But the film has its good sides. Especially when it ends. It's also nerdy. For example. The thing lands on a loose snowbank, if it succeeds, it will break into a million pieces. Overall, 2 out of 10. Instant. Great laugh movie.
