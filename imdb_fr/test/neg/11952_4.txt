This film had all the potential and the qualities of a good feeling, a beautiful love story ... the casting is perfect, the visuals work, the original works, the characters work ... but the story goes from one chess movement to the next in the most predictable way ... No character in the film has depth or depth explained by the director. All we know about the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones is that she is obsessed with her world ... no one is allowed to enter and no one defies him ... that is obvious ... but the remaining characters all have their own dimension that Aaron Eckhart's character had so much more to offer in the story, but was not allowed. The character of Abigail Breslin is so easy to understand that her performance is somewhat predictable and bogus ... in the end everything returns to the world of turbulence Catherine Zeta-Jones, which will never please the public .... honestly its turbulent world is nothing more than a representation of a selfish, selfish and spoiled lady, to whom most people would not have much time or sympathy for the real world. The director needed to make her a hero and never does ... Finally, it is the character of Eckhart who wins because he wins. <br /> <br /> Not an ugly movie, just a film that could have been much better with more depth of personalities allowed to be explained and exposed. <br /> <br /> Cheers
