I'm sorry to rain on everyone's parade. Some information about me: I like and I know Asian cinema a lot, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. I'm new to South Korean cinema, but if it's the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I'm not at all narrow-minded to appreciate foreign films and that I do not fit the stereotypical "stupid American" stereotype. . . Well, not perfectly. <br /> <br /> I can not believe this praise being praised. It's a disgusting movie * and * ridiculous. Hammy, everything is badly done and exaggerated, like for example to implore the attention of the spectator without education. Terrible camera, with an emphasis on meaningless close-ups derived from MTV's aesthetics. <br /> <br /> The plot is more holed than a gigantic piece of Swiss cheese. No one expects a thriller to be 100% realistic and, for the sake of entertainment, I would be happy to turn a blind eye to inappropriate little details. But, excuse me, what's going on here that can bear even a cursory examination? This story of incredibly complex and contrived revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story that can be read in a line at the supermarket. (You do not want to ruin your "pleasure", if that's the word, so let's not go into the details of the plot.) The fighting scenes are violent, unbelievable, downright stupid (the main "hero" fighting dozens and dozens of two opponents at the same time, after training ONLY when he was imprisoned, hitting a wall!) The really "exceptional" features of this film are two in number: sex sordid and incestuous (brother on sister and father on daughter, well, we've been evolving since Oedipus, are not we?) and graphic violence. The cut parts of the body - hands, teeth, tongues - as well as the industrial quantities of blood shed (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this film to be made?) Have no function / aesthetic motivation. <br /> <br /> A feast for the S & M inclined, certainly, but even for them, a feast without merit or subtlety. Heavily, even Mel Gibson's recent and much discussed work on an almost similar theme was NOT that bad. <br /> <br /> The press invariably good press this pretentious, exaggerated, oversized piece of free gore from Korean shores, gets marks I wonder what's going on. I do not consider myself the ultimate paragon of taste and I am often willing to accept the fact that a film that I did not appreciate may be better than what I could perceive. However, I have no qualms about calling this one as I see it: bad, bad, bad. No redeeming quality. My 2c? Find something better to do with your time.
