I would hate anyone who watches this movie "inspired by a true story" and draws conclusions about the actual event. Few things that went well were eclipsed by things that just were not true. Ed Gein never dragged anyone behind a car, never met anyone at the cemetery and killed him, no evidence that he returned body parts to the cemetery. The things he did were pretty awful, why try to make things worse? <br /> <br /> This film ranks among my 10 worst eye fatigue losses. "In the light of the moon" is a much better film on the subject, it is more factual and the game of actors is superior to this one.
