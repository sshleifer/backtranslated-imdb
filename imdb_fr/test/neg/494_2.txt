I do not know any silly rock'n'roll clich√© that is not used in this movie. Ouffcourz, the rock-listing life is just sex drugs and parties and tons of dummies trying to ride with you. Tell it to stupid young boys. Filmmakers seemed to have read the stories of Guns'n'Roses or Motley Crue too much. I have seen the daily life of the usual rock bands and this film has nothing to do with reality. If you have enough success, your life is turned. This means that you are mainly on a bus and are trying to sleep. Dors. Because you have to be fresh, sober and clean at night. After the concert, you have a little time to free yourself from your enthusiasm. Then you have a little time to have fun. But it's not a luxury or a dream. Artistically this film was nil. Stupid characters and silly dialogues. The end of the movie was funny - the main character left the heavy metal band to form a grunge band! Yes, what morality. Real 90s.
