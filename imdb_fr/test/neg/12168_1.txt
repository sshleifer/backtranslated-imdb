Please - if you have not tried to go through this trash and plan to watch this series / mini-series - do yourself a favor and find something else to do. Floss your teeth, start learning to play the cello, beat your dog - whatever you choose will be time spent better than watching this junk. This is not a bad film that can make you laugh a few laughs - it just sucks. Just boring from start to finish. <br /> <br /> And for animal lovers who find that my comment above is insensitive - if your dog could talk, he would beg to be beaten rather than suffer while watching this mess.
