It's a really stupid job to make a mistake - about as bad as Hepburn playing a Chinese in DRAGON SEED. The main role Hepburn plays is a combination of Granny Beverly Hillbillies and a faith healer! This movie is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart did not play at the hill, he was just surrounded by them. And the dialogue sounds like he's coming straight from a gang of Li'l Abner! The problems do not really end with the scandalous casting, because the plot is completely confused and "love story" could make your head hurt. For nothing, WHATSOEVER, married to Robert Young falls in love with this lynx Ozark. Is it his beautiful personality who has won his heart? I doubt it, since the film gets its name from the fiery "Spitfire" and she really seemed to like fighting and bickering! Was it his feminine charms? In the absence of makeup and clothing that seemed to have been designed by Ma Kettle, I doubt that this is also the case. To top it off, in the end, Ralph Bellamy has also cracked for her, though, again, that really makes no sense. <br /> <br /> So here we have two people falling into the city. for a non-feminine darling beast played by Mrs. Hepburn - now THIS is the recipe for a good movie!
