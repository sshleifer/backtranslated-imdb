There are many mysteries in life. For example: Why did people other than Carrot Top agree to appear in this film? Why did someone distribute this film? Why did someone pay to see him? I guess none of these issues will be solved, but one thing I'm sure is, this film is one of the worst ever made with such a large budget. It would already be bad, but the addition of "humor" by Carrot Top makes the situation even worse. The only entertainment you can get from this movie is to burn it, destroy it or destroy it in a fun way. If you had to rank it from all the movies ever made, it would be just between "Problem Child" and "Biodome". Said Nuff.
