What an embarrassment ... That does not do justice to the original with the terrible game of everyone in this film, Hitchcock must turn in his grave. The scene where Marion is killed in the shower is so inefficient and unoriginal. The only advantage is that they used the same music and it's so obvious that kills her in the shower. I rate this movie 3/10
