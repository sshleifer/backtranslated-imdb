This movie is really bad, trying to create scientific explanations for zombies always ends up undermining the credibility of the film's story. There is so much that I could report about the movie that I could almost write a book about how bad the movie is. For example, there were about fifty people on the plane, they killed a hundred and they kept coming, apparently the "virus" gave liver complications because everyone had yellow eyes, the virus also made people roar like lions or something like that. regenerates only the tissue because it also gives a superhuman strength, without forgetting that this virus spoils people's hair. It is also important to note that if you shoot someone with a gun (this probably only happens in airplanes), that person is sent back into the air. Remember, if you escort a prisoner on a plane and you lose it, always look in the drawers and closets the size of a bottle, you'll never know where these bastards will hide. And if, by chance, you can land a zombie-filled plane against a mountain and survive (this happens all the time), after seeing dozens of people get killed, get away from the plane, watch the sun rise. sun and make jokes about the dating of the flight. attendant. :)
