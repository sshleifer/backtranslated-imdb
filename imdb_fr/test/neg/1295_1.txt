Avoid this movie. If you wait for "The Poseidon Adventure" (1972), you may not encounter anything more than a case of "bends". This film offers nothing more than two long years of complete and extremely long trouble. <br /> <br /> The actors of the distribution behave as if they were angry at the irritation of a bath of water overflowing on a bed of petunias of an insignificant. The scenario is totally unrealistic and the film does not even have the feel of a disaster movie. In fact, everything about this movie is bad, with the exception of Tom Courtenay. It is regrettable that an actor of such quality has been swept away by a deluge of false statements to appear in such a relaxation. When this film was shot, Poseidon had to turn, in his waterfall, in an ocean of shame. And, Shelley Winters will be resurrected from the dead (directly from Poseidon) to haunt anyone who dares to see this pathetic movie. I rate this movie 1 out of 10, but it really deserves a zero. This film will make you want to avoid or turn completely against the water. And that will leave a bad taste in the mouth. It may even make you want to see "Jaws" (1975), and become friends with a big white guy.
