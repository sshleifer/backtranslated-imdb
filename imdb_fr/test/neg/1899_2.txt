What a frustrating film. A small southern town is full of opportunities to explore the intricacies of interpersonal relationships and dark undergrowth hidden beneath placid surfaces, as anyone who has read something of Carson McCullers already knows. That does not do any of that. Instead, writers have opted for cutesy flickers, cheap hot fuzzies and banal melodrama. The thing looks like a movie made for television and was made without distinction, but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this content interesting. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating aspect, though, is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and attractive players in this cast, all trying to make the most of things and do what they can with that - well, there is no other word to say - drivel. A tragic waste of talent, especially that of the great Stockard Channing.
