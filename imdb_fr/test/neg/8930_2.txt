Steven Seagal is back! Here with his third film released this year. Of course, as a punctual fan who has become increasingly discontented, I can say that it is not surprising that it is quite lame. First, the film made the headlines because of apparent production problems from Seagal. He arrived late on the set, changed the screenplay, the team, etc., and usually caused problems for the director, Don E. Faun Leroy (his lack of talent was already his problem!). This also happens in their second collaboration, the upcoming Mercenary, which promises to be as bad as this trash. It also marks a major turning point in Seagal's career as this film is the first of its kind to really extract the short film. There was a little in Ticker but this movie takes the biscuit. They borrow excerpts from The Order (a film by Van Damme, the biggest rival of Seagals in digital TV movies!) No Code of Conduct, Undisputed, as well as a complete action sequence of the very famous Peter Weller, star of the vehicle Top Of The World. Interestingly, the car chase stolen from the Weller epic about 10 years ago, and ironically probably cheaper than this trash, is by far the best action scene in the film. I was quite shocked when Dolph Lundgren had a brief stint in the world of action video, which he happily escaped. Seagal is however the market leader in the DTV action, with Van Damme and Snipes, his main rivals. Seagal still manages to sell movies and for the life of me, I do not know how. The fans must surely get tired of this horror, aspiring to a return to the likes of Above The Law. The story here is totally lame. In fact, the film has so many holes to make it hard not to think about it. For example, at the end of a movie, there is a little girl that Seagal apparently knows in an orphanage to whom he gives a necklace. Why I do not know but we never see it at all in the rest of the film, nor do we hear it speak. Seagal has a girlfriend in this film that at the beginning of the film is with a psychic and she becomes haunted by visions, which at the end of the film are never explained and do not mean anything. The film is so ridiculously stuck by a series of insignificant problems that it becomes a migraine. It is by far the most stupid film of Seagal! Seagal himself is as wooden as ever, but to his credit, he has not been doubled in this one, as far as I know. Seagal, however, feels the need to speak as if he were a gangsta rapper, making me eager to see the days when he would put on his Brooklyn / Italian-American accent in his early classic films. He also has a painfully funny double act with Treach, who I suppose is a rapper. It's funny how the producers seem to think that Seagal's combo and the hip-hop star seem to be working, because his team with DMX in Exit Wounds was his most successful film since Under Siege. Obviously, if no one has heard of the rapper, it will not work. It's an action movie however and the action itself has to be judged. Unfortunately, the action that does not come from the NU Image Back catalog is strictly routine. There are some small fight scenes with a classic Seagal aikido, but when 90% is played by its stunt doubler, which really has a hard work in this movie, it does not really impress much. There are also standard fights with guns that really have only beautiful, bloody, violent squibbages. All in all, it's a painfully boring experience and, once again, I'm bound to make the same verdict: Seagal lost it! I constantly ask the question of several years: "Why do people still watch his films?" This is a very good question, but the sad bastard I am still watching his films in the illusory hope of doing something good again. The odds are slim, unlike the ever-increasing size of Seagal. * 1/2
