Ok, with this film, there are a number of ingredients at work: <br /> <br /> Start by filling up on hillbilly truckers - good boys who have the secret desire to do themselves justice . Second put in diabolical hillbilly cops controlled by a high outlaw in Texas. Third put in karate combat trucker played by Chuck Norris. Fourth put in a silly teenager like Norris's nephew captured by devilish hillbilly cops. Fifth show of Chuck Norris fighting in slow motion. <br /> <br /> Now, mix everything and what do you have? <br /> <br /> You guessed it ... a very mediocre film!
