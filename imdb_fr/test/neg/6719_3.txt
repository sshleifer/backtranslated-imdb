this movie just does not work. The action scenes have been shot to look stylish, but have a neglected appearance. Seagal is barely fighting and many of his scenes are shot from behind (if you watch some scenes, it's not even him, but a lighter stunt doubler of 100 lbs), the film revolves around BAD!
