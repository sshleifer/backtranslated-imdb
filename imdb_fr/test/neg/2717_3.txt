I am easily happy. I like bad movies. I like movies featuring pretty young women dressed in small amounts of clothing. <br /> <br /> This film gives a bad reputation to all the above. Yes, you know that what you get is neither great art nor anything like that. But, even for the type of movie that it is, Beach Babes From Beyond is not very good. Some people gave him 10. I can only assume that these are people who have had organs allow the rational suppression of rational thinking. <br /> <br /> It's not very good. It's just not very good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 only for reasons of) novelty value for famous parents and Burt Ward and b) some girls are cute. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, did I tell you it was not very good?
