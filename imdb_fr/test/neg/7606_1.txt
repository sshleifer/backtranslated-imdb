I made the mistake of watching "Dark Star" (1974) late at night, many years ago. It was one of the stupidest movies I have ever watched: <br /> <br /> 1. Bad game. <br /> <br /> 2. Bad writing. <br /> <br /> 3. Scientifically stupid plot. (Destroying an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or will only make things worse: instead of having a single, large, easily avoidable object, you'll have thousands of smaller but equally lethal objects and more difficult to follow.) 4. Totally unrealistic characters. A beach ball painted like an alien? Screenwriters must have used too many drugs. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the majority of actors who played in "Dark Star" have never done anything else. Among those who did something else, the majority never acted after Dark Star. Therefore, having Dark Star on his actor's resume was a death star for his acting career!
