Final Draft - A screenwriter (James Van Der Beek) locks himself in his apartment and succumbs to psychosis to try to write a horror screenplay. Not a terrible premise, but the execution is awful. It sounds like first-year management and writing, and it probably is. The director jumps hell out of everything. It's supposed to be disorienting. What is annoying? So much so that small pieces of film are incoherent. Writing is predictable and does not use most of the ideas on offer (bag of oranges). It's like they ran out of time and got together for the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This film is not staggering "oh my god it's so bad it's good" it's bad. It's boring and irritates you long after. James Van Der Beek is not a terrible actor and keeps the ship just above the water. But it is too normal for the kind of psychosis that the film tries to propose. He is simply a retired guy who one day sees people and hallucinates, then decides to act slightly disturbed. The cause follows the effect. Maybe there is something in the water. Now, Darryn Lucio, who plays his "friend", is a terrible actor. He shares the likeness of Chris O'Donald and is even more annoying, a superhuman feat. <br /> <br /> The film's atmosphere is good (dark gray and dark), but that's the only thing the film does. it does not mean anything. This film wants to be Jacob's Ladder or The Machinist. It's not even the secret window. It's the girl in class who decides to become Gothic. <br /> <br /> It's not terribly terrible, but its stupidity will hurt you. I have already thought more about this criticism than the filmmakers have done. <br /> <br /> D
