Title of the film - Pie <br /> <br /> Date of the exam - 26/05/02 <br /> <br /> Year of the film - 2001 <br /> <br /> Stars - Dominique Swain, Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips (barely), Melanie Griffith (barely) <br /> <br /> NeCRo rating - 4 out of 10 skulls <br /> <br /> May contain spoilers <br /> <br /> Plot <br /> <br /> An "excluded" Dominique Swain wants to be part of the group "in". She then abandons her true friends and joins them ........ a lot of boring discussions with the rich happen. I think I had what I wanted in the fact that Dominique was fine, but the rest of the cast, maybe Brad Renfro was bad or at least not interesting or friendly at all. I know some might say that others are good because they made me hate them ... believe me ... I like unknown characters, but this group can not be loved because they can not be convincing bad people. <br /> <It seems that the only other people I receive this are barely equal, namely Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but the limited time available to them was acceptable. Melanie may have spoken 2 lines, but at least Bijou had a good character, though small. <br /> <br /> Violence and Gore <br /> <br /> My mind was constantly attacked by a horrible dialogue and very very boring characters. it's enough violence !! ok there was one who was clubbing with a rock that was ok. <br /> <br /> T & A nudity factor <br /> <br /> hahaha, they could not even add nudity to help spice up this movie, probably because no one would want to support their body for this shit. If they want to expose themselves, they should do it in a movie where they will remember their character and not for "oh hey I heard she undresses in this one". <br /> <br /> Overview of the film (critical) <br /> <br /> ok ok I know that I am proud to be the person who loves the most, if not almost all the films, or at least there is good. Well, this movie is one of the few for which I really struggled to find something that is worth it. The problem with this film is that it is so annoying. I already have a deep hatred for the attitudes of the rich rich in snobbishness and that did not help me either. All this film really represents is just a group of rich people sitting around acting depressed and stupid. I can not emphasize enough the inconvenience factor. This film tries to come back on the proven plot of the group "in group", which can usually be done without problem. <br /> <br /> Why can not I take a picture of the film or jacket? Well, I felt that this movie did not deserve this fame, so I decided to put a picture of why I rented it, and that's why Dominique Swain is the reason. Yes, I, too, was courted by her in Lolita and I thought she was so good that I decided from there to watch her in every movie in which she plays. At least I keep my promises and yes, I have seen the majority of his films, minus a few hard to find. She herself is a great actress and I would actively defend her, but she chose some of the most unpleasant films. This film and Smokers are both in the same boat, but at least the smokers had a good idea of ​​history. and even real good scenes. <br /> <br /> The DVD box also tries to make you believe that this movie also has stars by placing the names of Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips at the front of the box. If there is one thing that has escaped me, it's a movie that sticks the names of the stars on a box to make you think "wow he has ____ I wonder how good ___ is in this one that I I saw ___ in this movie and thought it was great! "There are only 10 minutes left between the two big names in the movie. Bijou actually had a role that meant something. Melanie, on the other hand, has only two lines on ... I must say that I do not like Mélanie very much, but it is a question of ethics and not of actress. <br /> <br /> Of all this mess that props must send back to Brad Renfro for having made a good performance with Dominique. Brad may be a very messy child in real life, but at least he can act. So the only reason this movie has skulls is because I got what I really wanted, namely Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro. I also had the pleasure of seeing the underrated actress Bijou Phillips make me even more like her. So, even though I was pissed off all this time, I still had some good points, even though it was quite difficult this time. <br /> <br /> I recommend you to see ONLY if you have seen Lolita and know how good Dominique is. or if you are an offbeat fan of Brad or Bijou. The fans of Uber Melanie will be deeply depressed. Also, if you're a fan of shitty movies like me, do not assume it's a guilty pleasure, because you'll feel guilty, for the money spent on buying or renting. <br /> Some movies are "so bad they are good" as the saying goes. What they forgot to add was "so bad they are good (to pass)." <br /> <br /> NeCRo
