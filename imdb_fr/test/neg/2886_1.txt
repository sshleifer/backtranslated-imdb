A man builds a hotel with a partner. He discovers that the hotel is overinsured. Things are getting worse. This film has a very large number of scenes. They must have been put together in someone's sleep. He jumps from one place to another. It does not stay focused on anything for a very long time. The end begins on Christmas morning with a fire in a hotel. It then goes to a night scene of the fire, then to the day. The sound track of the DVD is horrible. It takes a fair plot and turns to the worst movie I have in the scene for a long time.
