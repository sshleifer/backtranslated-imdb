This film had a good premise to start. Suspense, slashers, a secret society, and you really can not know who the bad guys are before the last quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> But it contained so many stupid clichés from the worst Slasher / American horror movies. Now, I like slasher / horror movies, but there are all the old clichés that have long disappeared from American cinema. For example, the old message "I hear noises in the basement and I'm home alone and the light in the basement does not work, so I'll investigate" a cliché. <br /> <br /> Three examples of these shots really pissed me off: <br /> <br /> 1) When Potente discovers that there may be a secret society at the medical school carving corpses, she Then ask everyone questions. - very publicly. In essence, she says, "I've discovered you, come kill me because I tell everyone your secret." And then, she wonders why she finds blood stained on her bed and that she is brought the cut finger in a towel. <br /> <br /> 2) Even after a guy she met two weeks ago finds herself on the dissection table and She discovers that this secret society is robbing living people. She goes to the laboratory where all the corpses are stored two or three more times. She is pursued by the killer, whom she knows, does not report her to the university or the police, then leaves school to return home to visit her parents. Then she goes back to school, apparently thinking that the guy who tried to kill her will let the past disappear and not try to kill her, even if she knows her secret. She was wrong, of course. <br /> <br /> For a person supposed to be so smart (she was studying to become a doctor in the best school in Germany), she behaved like a cliché bimbo in a horror. movie. <br /> <br /> These things come from making a good film potentially very frustrating, and make me wish the end comes even sooner. At halfway through the film, I stopped filming for her and wished she was also on the dissection table.
