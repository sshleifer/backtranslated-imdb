This film is not a horror movie. There is nothing scary, it's more of a torture movie. And it does not make sense to me, there are some scenes with bodies that disappear. For example, he is a woman at the beginning of the film. That being shot returns for a scene in the bathroom with Nicole and she and she disappears completely. Then she kills the policeman to put him out of his misery and he disappears, plus he had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him I do not think so especially when we can see his head half blown and not not kill him? In the end, she sets the killer's truck on fire. That, but he is not there. He is standing behind her. Then, Cuts To Rest Stop has been completely renovated and some people are at the rest area. A new girl arrives and Nicole asks for help as the first girl totally meaningless in this movie. Save money and skip this movie.
