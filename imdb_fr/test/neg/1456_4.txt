Have you ever tried some kind of food that your friend prepared, then you said, "Wow, it was not a good mix"? That's how I felt after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Many viewers will feel very uncomfortable with this strange mix of crime and comedy very, very cheesy. It's almost like watching Mr. Rogers play a ruthless, very bizarre gangster. Some things do not mix and this film proves it clearly. <br /> <br /> There are some very good performances here, because Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin are all excellent, but that does not make for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme has done great work in such films as Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia, but he seems to be coming out of his element with this one.
