If you have seen this film with Mary of the fourth form for the first time, it may be possible that the fog of nostalgia encourages your charitable side. Otherwise, it has no chance. The hip of young things is completely absurd, people may have used the casual word you hear here, but not a lot of them in sentence after sentence. It does not date so much from Dracula AD 1972 as to destroy it, from the moment when a person of less than thirty years opens his mouth, it is impossible to take the film seriously and, if it is about laughter, it's not even a smile. The idea of ​​throwing Dracula into modern times is good and deserves a much more powerful scenario than Don Houghton can provide. The Thames and Chelsea Male are no match for bats puppets, model castles and terrified extras, but you can not help but think that with better writing, it would have been so different.
