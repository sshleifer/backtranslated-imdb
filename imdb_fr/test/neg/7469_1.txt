I saw this movie at the New Festival in New York. It was by far the worst movie there. It's a use of uncircumcised frontal nudity and an insipid scenario and direction that does not involve a "Maurice" redesign, nor does it decide that it is a film by Neil LaBute, who left the feeling "Why would anyone ruin such a successful cast? . It lacks irony and fills the void of feeling, which causes the moments when the film turns on itself to make you want to wipe your face while your mind and your heart are looking for what could happen in the film but are not. I wish the director and editor had reissued the film because there might be other stories that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience.
