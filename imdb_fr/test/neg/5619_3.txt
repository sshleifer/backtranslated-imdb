with this movie directed by Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino doing the screenplay, I was sure it was going to be a jewel. I was wrong. I do not hate this movie, but I do not like it at all. <br /> <br /> I love Roger Avery because of his amazing sense of attraction rules and his pulp fiction and silent hill scenarios, but he made a mistake in doing that. Do I really need to comment on Tarantino, we all know he is a genius. <br /> <br /> This movie describes a gang that devalues ​​a bank but fails because of idiotic people involved in the flight <br /> <I'm disappointed by Tarantino and Avery to have shot this movie, but I do not do not change their opinion about their extraordinary quality. everyone makes mistakes ......... 3/10 ........... j.d Seaton
