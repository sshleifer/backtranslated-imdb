All Americans, except the youngest, are probably familiar with the iconic "Laaaaaa-sie!" Little Timmy, or whatever the child's name was, kicked his friend Border Collie. These same Americans may not be aware that Lassie has gone from television to movies (or was it the other way around - I'm clearly too lazy to do research here), and The Painted Hills is one of those. It is irresistible to make a "this movie went to the dogs!" word game, so I will not do it (even though technically I just did it). But in a sense, he did it. Lassie (who plays Shep, the best friend of man) is the star. THE DOG GETS THE TOP INVOICE. Now, I do not know how the actors or their agents negotiate the contracts, but here's how it goes in my mind: <br /> <br /> MOGUL FILM: Okay, Lassie, in the credits, it'll be, "and with Lassie as Shep!" LASSIE: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr. THE MOGUL FILM: Ha, ah, kid, calm down, calm down! LASSIE: Rrroo rrrrooo roooo. THE MOGUL FILM: Okay, I think I see. Co-direct billing? LASSIE: Rawrf! Rawrrrrff rawrf! THE MOGUL FILM: Oh my God! Let go of my arm! Top billing! Top billing for you, now loose my arm !!! <br /> <br /> The dog is well seen, and with the rest of this distribution in shock, I guess it's understandable. We find the adorable old Grumpus Jonathan, the prospector, his lamenting and seemingly orphaned young friend, Tommy, the little loser Lin Taylor and the charming religious pious Grumpus Pilot. The flesh of the plot here could be summed up in a few sentences, so I spare you the pain of watching the movie. Jonathan is a prospector whose dog is called Shep. His partner dies while he is searching for his cause. He gets a new partner named Lin, obsessed with gold, and Jonathan, for whatever reason, gives Shep to Tommy, little whiny baby. Lin kills Jonathan, Shep sees him and Lin tries to kill Shep. Then Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy moans, it's cold and Shep realizes an elaborate plan to avenge Lin, what he (or she?) Does. The end. <br /> <br /> Unless you have a deep and disturbing need to see a Lassie movie (even in this case, there must be a better Lassie film than this one), just avoid The Painted Hills. When she does not hang around, she marvels at Lassie's limited ability to "act" (similar style, perhaps, to Keanu Reeves - always the same facial expression, only the body moves), creating evidence in using several minutes of film or insulting Native Americans everywhere with his white paint "Actor! How does it work!" The Painted Hills are only suitable for Lassie's fetishists or those who have connections to prospecting through their old graying prospector's days who are looking for that glistening golden vein!
