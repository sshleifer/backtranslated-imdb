I kept looking because it seemed like the plot was going somewhere. When he arrived ambiguously, I was very disappointed. I will tell you what really happened in the next sentence. But maybe I will not do it. Maybe I just want to say that something will happen. The writers lacked imagination. It's not even a movie "B" - it's a movie made for TV "B".
