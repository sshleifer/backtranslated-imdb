This film lacked credibility for two reasons. First, no mayor of a big city and New York is certainly as important as possible. Would allow a neighborhood of his city to degenerate into a place of life as violent. especially for voters who could have a lot to say about his future job security. All the victims of the film were mostly elderly, Jewish or defenseless. At 62, I have never seen a film describing a lack of respect for authority as this film. Even "Escape from New York", which was fictional at first, that is, they told you it was science fiction, did not resort to such deep violence. In this film, most of the older victims were victimized and had firearms but were not willing to use them. In addition, in this film and I have not seen the previous two, is more lawless than the movie "Escape". Secondly, gangs, according to my research, have never been more cooperative than what this film shows them. On the one hand, they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he is killed. Yet when the heroes start firing on local gangsters, the next gang is welcomed with open arms. Outside gang members are still considered strangers and are arrested. We are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to do everything. Why did outside gangs come to help? I believe that more than one outside gang has come to help. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why did the other inmates ask permission to attack Bronson's character? It was not a good movie and I could go on, but I will not do it.
