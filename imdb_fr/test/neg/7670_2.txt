I gave "Airport '79" only two stars because it's a really ugly film. Those who participated in it deserve no praise (with the exception of Chihuahua de Charo, who does a very good job in his role). That does not mean that the film is not worth watching. It helps if you have a buzz, but it's not essential. <br /> <br /> A'79 really seems to be a first version of "Airplane!" Each scene has a montage and a reward, and the scenes jostle one after another as if they were totally disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that passengers, crew and aircraft keep moving forward, no matter the circumstances. You are a journalist and a strange guy is murdered at your place in your presence? The killer then pursues you on the roof of your greenhouse? No problem. You can always take this flight early in the morning to Paris ... no point in involving the cops. Your plane dodges a "drone" unmanned missile, four thermo-aspirating missiles and cannon fire from an unidentified Phantom fighter, performing barrels, a self-dive and a crash landing without thrust reverser? No problem, we will ask the mechanics to check the oil and get you started in just a few hours. It is really funny. <br /> <br /> And I will admit that there is a little anarchist in me that manifests itself when passengers pay no attention to flight attendants. The highlight is when the attendant tells Jimmie Walker that he will have to tidy up his saxophone (God keeps me from flying in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) Before takeoff. Jimmie basically says, "Nope". Later in the flight, the sax is damaged in a barrel and Jimmie arrives at the next stage of the flight with another sax that he does not want to put away. This aspect of the movie is just fun. (A passenger actually obeys the attendant.) When told not to pick up his dog, Charo leaves the plane, of course, because you can not see his ass and tits while sitting .) <br /> <br /> In summary, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a little fun. Unfortunately, filmmakers and actors deserve no credit because it was probably quite unintentional.
