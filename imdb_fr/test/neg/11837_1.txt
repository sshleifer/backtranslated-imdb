I understand that Roger Corman likes to do things cheaply, but it's just sad. I bought this dollar movie in my local video store not a month after watching the original Carnosaur. I was dazzled; It was the same movie, with just a few Corbin Bernesen together! It reminded me of all those 80s ninja movies that were taking old Kung Fu movies and sticking to a group of white ninjas bending around with the word "ninja" written on their headbands (if you have not seen them, consult "Ninja Terminator", "The Thunder Ninja", "Black Dragon" and "Ninja Warriors"). Thank you Roger Corman; you just made me lose a dollar.
