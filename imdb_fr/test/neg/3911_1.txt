There is only one word that describes this movie: BAD !! I have no idea why this movie was even shot or how they brought Dennis Hopper to play in this movie. Stuart Gordon is a better director and Hopper, a much better actor. The movie is just stupid. I liked the idea of ​​"square pigs" and there was an interesting love scene involving a cyborg, aside from that, avoid this movie at all costs.
