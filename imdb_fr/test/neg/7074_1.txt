"Tamara" felt like another imitator of the trend "I know what you did last summer" and is painfully dull. A young high school student, who practices a lot of witchcraft and black magic, is killed by accident during a cruel farce perpetrated by a group of brutes who secretly bury him in the woods, swearing not to tell anyone. The next day, the so-called "dead" Tamara arrives at school with a brand new image and seduces her so-called killers. She's taking a bit of revenge ... It's actually a combination of "Carrie", "The Craft" and every straight-to-video teeny bopper turkey that hits the shelves these days. The actors are absolutely atrocious and seem to have ten years to do without high school students. It's a little gore, which is actually nothing interesting because the film is so boring and I could not wait until it ends. If you like modern garbage, I beg you to look for this one, otherwise, do not bother ...
