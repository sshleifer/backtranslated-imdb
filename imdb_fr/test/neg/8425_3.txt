After reading so many rave reviews about "Serving All My Days," I went to get it and bought it for Christmas. A waste of money, I'm afraid. I was looking forward to something similar to "Brideshead Revisited" and some of the few other great British TV productions, but that's definitely not part of them. <br /> <br /> The characters are too beautiful to be true, wrapped in a very predictable scenario and with the most banal and horrible scenario I've heard in years. Yes, he has his moments, but they are very thin on the ground. The main actor is interesting, mainly because of his strange resemblance to Anthony Andrews (Sebastian in "Brideshead"), only dark. But his undeniable talents are wasted on a character who is insupportably important in himself and priggish. His piety is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the Somme during the First World War. He does the first episodes better, centered around his nervous state, than to play later the good socialist who does good. <br /> <br /> Women are completely incredible, as if they were real. His first wife is a chipper and an annoying chirpie, his girlfriend, the perfect sophisticated slut, and his latest lady a political mishmash. The most interesting characters are Howarth (Alan MacNaughton) and one of the other masters, named Hobarth, I forget the name of the actor. <br /> <br /> The scenario, in its great preaching, is typical of the scenario: Andrew Davies, screenwriter, at its beginnings, and becomes tiring during the first two episodes (this mini-series counts 11 episodes!). By episode 4, I just wanted to get through the blasted thing. <br /> <br /> The music is also tedious, limited to a mawkish piano melody and a choir sung by boys in the credits. No expense was spared on location settings, which provides some visual relief to an otherwise unsustainable viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I like stories like this, as a rule, and I am very disappointed with the maudlin nature of this series. . If you want to watch something interesting about the First World War and its aftermath, there are many other more refined vehicles to rent or buy. One thinks of "The Unknown Soldier" of 1998. The characters of this presentation of Masterpiece Theater are real and fascinating and move one, unlike the puppets with two dimensions of "To serve them all my days". As for movies about boys' schools, stick to "Goodbye Mr Chips" or "Tom Brown's Schooldays". <br /> <br /> I know this goes against the generally favorable opinion of this mini-series, but I highly recommend thinking twice before paying Acorn Media $ 80.00 for their set of 4 DVDs, including 2 discs on my game had insurmountable problems of freezing and jumping.
