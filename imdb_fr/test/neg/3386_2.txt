I heard good comments about the fact that this movie was very bloody and scary, but it's neither one nor the other. Of course, the screenwriter wanted to make a scary horror film while injecting a teen comedy for the target audience. Fears and comedies rarely give rise to good films, so does MONSTER MAN. <br /> <br /> Not really funny, scary or too nice at ANY other level. <br /> <br /> Aproaching 39 years of age, I saw my share of horror movies. I've seen some good films and some terrible movies, but the films that are out nowadays are terribly mediocre and it bothers me to watch them. The current acceptance of bad movies like this really annoys me. Let's face it, they produced a lot of crap in the 70s, 80s and 90s, but they were also considered as such. Today, they are considered "good entertainment". - Bollocks!
