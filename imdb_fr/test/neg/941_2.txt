Inentaine, a horrible joke about a young man who refuses to comply or uses non-compliance better to achieve his goals - misleads his parents into thinking he's attending college. The truth is that this moron was rejected by all the schools he enrolled in. After viewing this information, you will see why. <br /> <br /> What a ridiculous name: the South Hampton Institute of Technology. You do not have to be a scientist to understand the initials of this nonsense school. The problem with this type of film is that in the end, the maverick becomes the accepted mode. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the real world and call this movie what it really is: a manipulative trickery!
