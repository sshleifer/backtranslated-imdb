This film was not only disappointing for the horror / suspense movie lover, it was disappointing for all who see it. Sensational. I thought this movie could be funny because the guy with huge head. However, the conversation was long and long and unnecessary. There was so much sex that I hate women and men now. This film was not only boring, but there was no substance. Sensational. Sensational. On top of all this, each scene seems to be lit by a single light bulb and I think they used the same decor for two different lawyers, a restaurant and an airport. This movie is not meant for movie buffs who love bad movies because in the end it feels like wasting time. Watch the movie! <br /> <br /> -party
