Although I'm a fan of Heather Thomas and have some of her old bikini posters here somewhere, I can honestly say that if the only movie I ever saw her was "Cyclone", I could never guess why. she had arrived as far as in the entertainment industry. <br /> <br /> Led by Fred Olen Ray (as good omen as seeing harriers turn over his head in the desert), this story of a woman (Thomas) who must protect a high-tech motorcycle against unscrupulous types is a "B" movie as he gets it (or in the case of Fred Olen, "B minus"). <br /> <br /> The distribution itself should tell you something. Not all films combine Thomas with actors of the caliber of Beswick, Hall, Combs, Donahue, Tamblyn and Landau (!!). If you are lucky, very few movies do it. And even if they seem to be having fun, should not we share some with the public? I vote yes, seems to have voted no. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you've always wanted Heather to provide an uppercut to another woman, use the word "F" and connect to battery cables, you've probably looked for this one. this. Myself, I will be satisfied with the reruns of the old "Fall Guy". <br /> <br /> A star, given in hopes that when another "cyclone" hits the city, Heather will take refuge in the shelter. I know I'm going.
