This adorable dog (called various names during the movie) is apparently loved by the whole city ... but he is alone. He's friends with two kids (Cindy and Paul played incredibly badly), but their dad will not allow them to have a dog. Then Benji meets Tiffany - another adorable dog. They fall in love (instantly) and this leads to a hysterical montage of two of them frolicking in the grass, drinking in a fountain ... in slow motion no less! Benji also lives in the cleanest abandoned house I've ever seen. Then the two children are kidnapped by the most inept and less experienced kidnappers I've ever seen and - do not you know - they hide the kids in the exact house where Benji lives! <br /> <br /> WOW was this bad! A huge success (for some reason) in 1974 that led to many sequels (which I will not see). The movie is just terribly played with "humor" so little funny and badly done that you just watch TV with astonishment. The film also features a song that is played non-stop during the movie - so much so that you feel like screaming. He was inexplicably nominated for the best Oscar song - he did not win. Yes, dogs are adorable and much better than human actors, but I need more than cute dogs to stay interested. <br /> <br /> You might think I'm a bit tough on a children's movie, but I saw it with my 5-year-old nephew. After 20 minutes, he was stupidly bored and stopped looking. I kept looking in the hope that it would be better - it was not. Really ugly - but VERY patient kids or dog lovers might like it. <br /> <br /> Note to parents: It is noted G, but a dog is violently beaten several times. You do not see it - you just hear that and the dog survives but it could disturb real young children.
