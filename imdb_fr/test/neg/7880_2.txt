I'm fed up with the "open-minded" argument. I am generally open-minded, but this type of line is basically made by people who like things that should not be "appreciated". You know what, there is a reason why so many people are disgusted by this. And it's not because someone is not there. After all, the feeling of disgust exists, and no amount of "open mind" or "pushing the limits" should eliminate that feeling. Otherwise, we are no better than insane living beings. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Another argument is that this film puts women in the roles normally reserved for men, which may explain why men do not like it. But the mere fact that it revolts more men than others does not make it really great. Maybe men should not be excited by what dominates the film industry, but is it the solution for women to do the same? Maybe if you do not like movies, television and shows with so much sexual objectification of women, so much violence, do not look at them. <br /> <br /> And if you're a director, do not do it. Do not make them. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, one day someone will ask for an open mind when what happens in this "movie" happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Heck, some people seem to like it so much.
