The real problem with this story is that there is not much history in the story. There is hardly any plot to speak of. The widower buys an electric grandmother for her children. A child resists electric grandmother. Then finally accept it. Then the kids grow up and grandma leaves. Really, very little happens. It's more a premise than a story. <br /> <br /> In addition, stay away from his schmaltz and you have a story that has already been made before, and better: the lonely. Same basic idea: initially, no one can accept the love of a robot, because it is simply a machine, then gives in and ends up loving the robot. The biggest difference is that The Lonely is much more powerful, because the protagonist and ourselves, the audience, are suddenly shocked by the reality and forced to remember that in the end, the robot is actually only a mechanism. <br /> <br /> I also find the story very flawed in the fact that the electric grandmother is just * too * perfect. She is not only "human", she is "superhuman". She is * more * wise than a real person, she has no trace of mechanics at home and she makes the balls appear from all parts. Frankly, it's really confusing to think she's a machine.
