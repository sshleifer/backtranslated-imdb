Bad dialogue, slow story, scenes lying around and absolutely useless. I can not believe that so much money has been invested in such a badly written film. The staging and staging could not save this bomb either. <br /> <br /> 50% in the film and you still expect it to begin. They lay the groundwork with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes setting up NOTHING. You watch 40 minutes of absolutely directionless footage to try to do what, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Much of this film looks like a very bad French film where nothing happens and where the characters are just a kind of dull, lifeless and egocentric living without purpose or care. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. All those who recommend it prepare you for disappointment and you will doubtless question their taste and depth.
