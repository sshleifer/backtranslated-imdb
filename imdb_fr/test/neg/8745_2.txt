I guess you could say that this film has a grain of potential, but nothing more, because the filmmakers have botched it. The plot is almost incomprehensible, the rhythm is lethargic and the game is pathetic. And what is a commercial rat? Worst of all, however, the highlight of this movie is the anticlimax of all the anticlimaxes; Moreover, the title does not even seem very precise. The only redemptive characteristic of this film is the pretty woman with black hair ... The blonde girl was pretty too, but she was boring and not as beautiful as the brunette. Anyway, as in many movies, this is a movie that we only see on MST3K.
