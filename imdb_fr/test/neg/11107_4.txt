First, let me say that this movie is not spectacular. The cast is like the saved by the meeting of the bell, the monster is a guy in a bad outfit and as always; the army is useless. It seems that the more training you have and the more powerful your weapon is, the more likely you will die if you are in a low budget horror movie. Apparently, moviegoers have little respect for the seals of the navy, the marines and the ninjas, who have the worst of it. The plot is thin, a cryptozoologist tarnished by the name of Dr. Pe√±a traps the Chupacabra. He then smuggles it aboard a cruise ship where two members of the crew dropped it. You can do your taxes and watch this movie without losing a beat. The most remarkable part that really makes all this interesting revolves around the captain's daughter. Towards the end, she tackles all the martial arts on the monster and kicks her. Let me understand, the monster erases all the unity of the seals of the navy, while it uses ammunition ARMOR PIERCING !! OK, it's a film that can happen no? But here is the captain's daughter, who can not be over 19, and who gets out of the chupacabra with front and side kicks. It was hilarious. They should get a medal for proposing that.
