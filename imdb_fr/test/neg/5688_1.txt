The film begins with a 30-minute explanation of the war, the human cyborgs, the battles, the story, and then drops two actors in a gravel pit. They run around this gravel pit / desert area for about an hour while shooting at each other. That's all. Must have cost around Â£ 10.00 to make, with the change. To avoid. <br /> <br /> Brands out of ten: acting -9 sets 1 costumes -9 direction -50 production 1 titled intro 4 <br /> <br /> I think the improvement of this film would be: Lose it comment. (Let the observer decide what is happening). Take away some of the terrible CGI. Add some techno rave music. They could just save him .......
