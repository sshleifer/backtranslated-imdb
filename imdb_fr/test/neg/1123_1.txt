National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2: Adventure on Cousin Eddie's Island (2003), Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Jake Thomas, Sung Hi Lee, Eric Idle, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, D: Nick Marck. His cousin Eddie and his family have taken a vacation for expenses paid in the South Pacific by his boss, hoping that the dunce will not pursue his company after being bitten by a monkey smarter lab! The silly spin-off can not compete with any of Vacation's movies (even European Vacation!), With a question of whether or not filmmakers thought the screenplay was really funny. Even Quaid, Willard or Asner can not watch it from a distance. 83 min., Not rated. *
