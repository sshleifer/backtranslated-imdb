If there had been no mounting cursed words and superimposed blur when a character gave another, it would be easy to confuse this low-budget snoozer with a Sci-Fi channel driver. The plot about the government's attempts to destroy a telekinetic group, originally formed as a military weapon, ends in a rather ambiguous way about the gifted hero himself, in search of a revengeful telekinetic survivor. Alas, the film is talkative, boring, predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects. Top-billed, Louis Gossett, Jr. plays a minor role as the evil government bureaucrat behind the program and now wants to eliminate all traces. He walks across the room and it's hard to understand why he's bothered. The other cast members do a decent job with a scenario that requires little.
