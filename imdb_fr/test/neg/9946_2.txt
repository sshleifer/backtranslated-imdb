As Jennifer Denuccio said on Square Pegs, "gag me by the door". I would certainly vote this film on the list of the worst IMDB films. <br /> <br /> Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a Chicago guy who travels to California to peddle his brother's jazz records. He is supposed to be a barney placed in the local surf community. But he acts more like he's new to civilization (just try to cross his sex scene without squirming). There are also the ongoing adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer has to endure. That of Duke (Seymour Cassell), an expert in volleyball who tries to make TT pass like a normal human being, the odious drunk surfers who deceive their girlfriends and the guy who makes a bet with which he can live by car sixth month. <br /> <br /> California Dreaming is just an old bazaar. It starts as a typical 70's craze, with bad 70s music (even though this movie was released a year before the 80s). And Dennis Christopher appears as the most irritable loser, this makes the movie hard to watch (keep your finger on the fast forward button). Even though this film was supposed to be about surfing culture, the surf scenes are a total wrench. Surf contest people seem to be unable to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> I guess the only nice thing is to see Tanya Roberts outside of her role as Midge in the sitcom "It's the show from the '70s." And Cassell was not bad, he was just in a bad movie.
