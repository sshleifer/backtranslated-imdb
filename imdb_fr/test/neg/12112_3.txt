This film is bad. I saw the versions rated and unrated. They are terrible !! Now, I know it's supposed to be a low budget, a Spiderman porn spoof, but Spiderbabe is just not good for being bad-good. It's not funny! Not funny at all !! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this movie dropped me. At least the unrated version has a lot of nudity to hope for. And it's me, because Mundae is not a beautiful woman. From the waist up, she is fine, but while riding, it leaves a lot to be desired. She looks good in this schoolgirl outfit. Please, if you have to watch this spiderbabe, rent it first. Classified or unclassified, it makes no difference, they are bad for me !!
