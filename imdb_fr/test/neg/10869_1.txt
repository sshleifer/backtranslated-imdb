When a movie called Hell Ride comes out, you expect some biker shot. With names of characters such as "Pistolero", "Comanche" and "The Gent", I prepared for the worst and was hit in the face by that. Dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are the norm for biker movies. A dusty desert faded by the heat while motorcycles arrive on the road while "CC Rider" plays and they talk about sex and violence. Yawning! The three tracks were just ridiculous and unbelievable. Seeing old men like Bishop and Madsen (wearing a scary ruffled shirt) driving down a dusty desert road made me think of two men trying desperately to relive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour did his best but with such poor material, he went astray. Even an appearance of Dennis Hopper in full swing Easy Rider could not save him. And let's talk about the shop bought do we bronze? Many have compared this to Tarantino's work. It's not even close. What makes Tarantino's work so brilliant is that he knows he's above all he's done. He is therefore content to throw balls and carry him as far as possible. Bishop took the film so seriously that it became a poor copy of the genre of exploitation.
