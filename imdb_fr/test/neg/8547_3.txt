Reluctantly, he gave 3 - one point each for Fonda, Stanwyck and the secondary cast. <br /> <br /> I've never seen this one before - I'm looking at him right now and he's just arrived at the part where Henry Fonda is carrying Babs on the doorstep. If I keep looking, it will be just to see if Fonda and Stanwyck will be able to remove this one from the dumper. <br /> <br /> But after reading the comments of other spectators, I'm not very optimistic. <br /> <br /> The first ski scenes were enough to make me forget my lunch. The voiceovers were obviously made in a sound studio, and the editing between the outside shots and the close-ups was appalling. I do not know much about the technology of that time, but I can not believe they could not do anything to make it more believable. <br /> <br /> My second sigh of disbelief was when Fonda was wiped off and (I guess because of the extreme speed of the trip) he is plunged head first into the snow up to his chest - Stanwyck pulls him with obvious difficulty staged - and, (I guess because he is an equally experienced doctor) does not react to his seemingly unconscious state and his soft stance. <br /> <br /> Listen, I'm quite capable of suspending my disbelief, but I could not forget the fact that she had just jostled a man with a possible head injury and that he could be paralyzed for life. This is not my idea of ​​big yuk. <br /> <br /> So, as I finish this comment, we have just seen Kirk's first bout of jealousy, and Dr. Hunt is going to perform an appendectomy! I'm not sure what I hate the most - the script, the background music or the story !! Argghhhh! I'm finished. Game over. Click on.
