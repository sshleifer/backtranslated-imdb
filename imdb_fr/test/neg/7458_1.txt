Everything in this movie is bad. all. Ridiculous haircuts of the 80s. Ridiculous mustaches. Ridiculous action and fight scenes where you can actually see that opponents do not even hit each other. Bad, Bad, Bad music from the 80s. Repeated scenes of people running through woods. A bad guy with a silver plastic hand and ridiculous hair. Stupid dialogue. The acting game is non-existent. Everything seems extremely cheap. This film even surpasses "Plan 9 of Space" in its greatest decay. <br /> <br /> It's not "funny", it's just bad.
