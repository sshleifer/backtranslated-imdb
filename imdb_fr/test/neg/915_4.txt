It is difficult to evaluate the first effort of a screenwriter / director. After all, it's one more film than I wrote or directed. James Hunter wrote an interesting story, but suffered from an irregular flow. <br /> <br /> After all, the idea that a man (Ja Rule) has to choose between the life of a thug and go straight is common, and even fall in love with the girl (Tatyana Ali) of the man you killed was done. The remake still requires something original and originality is lacking in this film. <br /> <br /> I was seduced by the inclusion of so many favorites: Tia Carrere (Trues Lies, Wayne's World), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Frank Langella (Dracula, good night and good chance) and Ving Rhames (rosewood, Dawn of the dead). They did not disappoint with their performance, but they did not work much. <br /> <br /> The transition to video is becoming more common, but that does not mean it's a waste of time. Maybe Hunter's second-year effort will be more enjoyable.
