This is yet another embarrassing story of the same plot in the nth group of idiots-young-adult-in-danger-because-they-are-idiots of the beginning of the millennium: this time we have the story of a madman minor who returns from the dead to take his gold from the hands of the usurpers. We have almost no thrills, almost no bare flesh (even if the girls are really hot, only one of them shows her naked ass for a few seconds), the usual group of horror stars of the boulevard of sunset in cameo roles (this time, Karen Black, Richard Lynch, John Philip Law, Jeff Conaway), a lot of fake blood, only the crazy miner resurrected like a zombie is cool enough to let you stuck - well no exactly - on the screen until the end. Do not waste your time if you are not a completeist.
