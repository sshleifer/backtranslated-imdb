I do not know what happened to director Abel Ferrara. Since the remake of "Body Snatchers", he seems to have lost. "King of New York" and "The Bad Lieutenant" remain two of the best movies of the '90s: the incendiary indictments of a decade gone awry. With movies like "R Xmas" (whatever that means) and "New Rose Hotel", he seems determined to disgust and annoy his former fans. This movie has no life in it. Even if he gets excellent results from his actors in all his projects, the result of this mish-mash of ideas is not unanimous. Be that as it may, the new generation of drug traffickers is more or less identical to any other New Yawkuh of the upper middle class, it gets lost in the insane and tiresome script. <br /> <br /> I saw this opening night at 4-Plex in downtown LA. In the lobby, while buying tickets, I was surprised and delighted to see her occupied by a large group of men and their twenties. Then, they entered the theater, but it is the theater that presented "8 Mile" and not "R Xmas"! The theater that broadcast "R Xmas" (do not forget it was the opening night!) Was watched by 4 people in total, myself, my wife and two others! <br /> <br /> Bravo Abel! <br /> <br /> 2/10
