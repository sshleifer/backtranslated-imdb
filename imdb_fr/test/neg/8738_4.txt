MAIN PLAN: have the winning team in a deadly tournament. One of the many martial arts action images that have attempted to capture the flavor of the famous 'Enter the Dragon' from '73, this one is an effort from South Africa. The fortress of the wicked is a little different, resembling by far a white fortress looking like a castle in the middle of the desert. The villain himself, a baron or a general, is a slightly more perverse version of the "Dr.No" or master mold of Han's wickedness, having strange backtracking to the glory days of Nazi Germany. He wears the Nazi ceremony uniform at times. His main ambition in life is to organize an illegal martial arts competition / tournament against his Japanese rival, an extension of their complicity in the Second World War (my army is better than yours). It sounds silly and it's true, although the suggestion of madness and crazy machismo almost works. The central hero, Steve Chase (Ryan), looks like a white character of "Bruce Lee", having such a thin and thin physique, although, obviously, he does not have the same level of expertise in martial arts . I thought he would be a secret agent of the government here, but apparently not. He and his girlfriend joined Baron's team of fighters, but decided to resign (what did they think they were doing?). Of course, it is not so easy. There seems to be a strange sequence of them escaping into the desert with a ruined car and a rigged sail - these desert winds can do wonders for travel, it seems. <br /> The hero joins the team of the rival of the villain and the girlfriend is held hostage by the villain in a cell, under the threat of rape of his rival. The most interesting character turns out to be Chico, a dwarf who is the wicked's assistant; he is faithful to the baron but sympathizes with the fate of the hero. A lot of the fighting uses the hero's abilities like a ballet, with a lot of jumps and slowdowns. The sound effects are also amplified and exaggerated in order to add more impact to the shots. There were some good fights during the tournament to the climax, but none really stands out. If we had to choose, I guess the best is the brutal muscular man of the Baron, introduced late in history (he raises the back of a car at some point). You wonder how the hero will take it out at the end, since the brute seems to dismiss most of the punches. The acting is very mediocre, descending into the camp until the girlfriend, who tends to laugh without reason, as if she was high on the grass, although she is very cute. Some training scenes are also lively, especially all those types that run or hit the sand of the desert. And with such a title, there are surprisingly few murders. Ryan, as Steve Chase, returned as a traditional agent in the "Kill and Kill Again" suite.
