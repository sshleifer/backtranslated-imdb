This movie at home is basically outrageous, but you have to give them 3/10 to try. The blood sucks, but the grandmother who kills them is pretty funny, and I think the concept is good and the make-up is suitable for a movie at home. However, thank god, it only lasted 55 minutes and the twist at the end is literally the Fight Club (almost as trashy as the movie). Just read this comment, do not watch the movie.
