Ok, let's start by saying that when a Dutch film is bad, it's really bad. Rarely something with a little quality happens (Lek, Karakter) here in Holland but not often. Costa! It's about 4 girls going to Spain to go on holiday, party, get drunk, get fucked (you know the exercise). It's also the world of clubbers or proppers. The pro who try to draw the crowd into their club. <br /> <br /> I do not know how long it took to write the script, but I suspect the time spends between 15 and 20 minutes because you watch a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes. Nothing, and I want to say that nothing is credible in this movie. It's almost too ridiculous for words what happens with the script. Suddenly, the film turns into a kind of karate action. With a face-to-face fight with "the villain in black" and car chase scenes shot through a water tank car (can it be more corny). In addition, the words character development and casting are unfamiliar to the creators. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Traffic" 3 days ago, I fell from pure brilliance, from a work of art to this one. It's filming at its saddest. And do not leave the small budget. Because even with a small budget, you could write a better script. It almost seems like the filmmakers were too busy partying to make a movie worthy of the name. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the girls in the water at the end have invented it a bit, but for the rest, do not waste your money in such garbage.
