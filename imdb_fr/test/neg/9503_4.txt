I thought it was an amazing boring movie! I heard that the director did not speak French and he let his actors say what they wanted ... Well, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is great, as usual, but I can not say as many other actors. They have nothing to say, especially Bruno Todeschini. <br /> <br /> They all seem very tired, it's the plot of the film: tired of being together, of living abroad, of their life in general; so they spend half of the movie sleeping in a hotel room. After a while, I felt tired myself ... <br /> <br /> I gave 4, because of very beautiful scenes, the last of which.
