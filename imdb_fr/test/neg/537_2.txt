I agree with the previous comment: this movie has an awesome animation, but has problems in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot holes are huge, the dialogue hardly explains the concepts of the plot-- the MAIN POINT POINTS are not even fully explained before the last five minutes of the film. The characters state the obvious, without however explaining the most confused points of the film. There are characters that appear and have an importance in the story that are never explained - most of them have names that are only mentioned * once * and this greatly confuses the viewer. <br /> <br /> Don 'Do not waste your time with this movie. Unless you're having fun laughing and you're not like DUMB.
