I just had the misfortune to see this film really awful. <br /> <br /> Think of this scene of Magnolia in the end with the slowness of the scene on this woman. Now, remove the pan, add some unshaved, breathable men, and you get what the 2 1/2 hours of Humanity were complete <br /> <br /> The inspector is a real jerk, not even a jerk, just a simple idiot, slow and slow. The way they have ever solved a crime is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Mandatory sex scenes are awful and rewarding. <br /> <br /> Eventual villain (he raped and killed an 11 year old girl) is tagged early and will not surprise you unless you are the same. <br /> <br /> An uninspiring camera work. <br /> <br /> The director was there to say that it was up to the public to provide their own interpretation of the procedure. I suppose he also wanted to offer them a dialogue (there's bullshit, which adds to his level of boredom), an inventive camera work (only static shots, totally erasing the obvious beauty of the landscape in which film is shot) and the plot! <br /> Really horrible. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10.
