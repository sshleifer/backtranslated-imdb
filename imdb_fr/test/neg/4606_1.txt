The idea behind this movie was great. The story of a little girl facing abuse (both emotional and physical) and trying to cope and survive. What destroys the film is the terrible use of voiceovers and the nerdy dialogue. The actors must emphasize the most obvious things over and over again. In addition, there is a very tedious, almost amusing use of metaphors in voiceovers. The highlight is the play of the little girl. Well tried, but this one is a whore.
