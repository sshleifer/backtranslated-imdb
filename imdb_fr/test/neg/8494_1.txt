What is this movie? Well, if I did not know that "the son of the mask" is considered a comedy, I would never have a clue! A comedy? A tragedy is the right kind for this episode which is still called a sequel. <br /> <br /> Yes, I've already watched "Dumb and Dumber", but I never thought anyone would ever make a Hollywood title. Yes, you look at "The Son of the Mask" and you think ... 5 minutes - Dumb ... 10 minutes - Dumber ... 15 minutes The most stupid ... And after 16 minutes, there is only one thing to say: / I came out of there ... <br /> <br /> Sorry, my candidate for the comedy Crap of The Year 2005.
