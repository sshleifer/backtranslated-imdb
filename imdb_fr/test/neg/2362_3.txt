This extremely beneficial Blaxploitation / Kung-Fu hybrid was released in my country by a dubious DVD label that usually handles pure shit on a disc, so it was not really a favorable herald. Several other titles have been released in the same series, such as "The Black Six", "The Black Gestapo" and "The Black Godfather" and judging by their low ratings and negative reviews, none of them belong to the elite of the hype of blaxploitation of the 70s, ni. "TNT Jackson" is a rather ugly film, devoid of intrigue, but with too many laughable battle scenes and horrible acts of comedians. Apparently, Roger Corman ?? never too embarrassed to make easy money ?? asked two of his most loyal acolytes to quickly invent a simplistic story that would appeal to fans of Oriental Kung Fu movies and contemporary Blaxploitation movies. The result obtained by Cirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller is "TNT Jackson"; the story of a dark-haired black girl traveling to Hong Kong in search of her missing brother. She quickly discovers that he has been killed by a criminal network of drug traffickers and vows to avenge him. Jackson sneaks into the subway and meets with macho pimps, undercover agents and many vicious Kung Fu fighters. Only one thing is sure. they all want a piece of TNT's ravishing body one way or another. I sincerely doubt that movie concepts are more basic than that, but ?? Unfortunately, all other aspects are equally invalid. The battle scenes are very long and, moreover, pathetically organized. Jeannie Bell and the other poor suckers really try to look menacingly and assume a difficult position, but ultimately all they do is kick in and jump stupidly from room to room. 'other. The cinematography is horrible, the soundtrack is extremely disappointing (no matter what happened to the soul music?), The few dialogues are poorly written and the performances of actors are inferior. Speaking of which, Jeannie Bell is undeniably a beautiful woman, but she still can not hold a candle to Tamara Dobson or Pam Grier. In TNT Jackson, there is only one truly memorable and memorable scene, namely the famous hotel room battle where Bell, completely naked, except for the panties, turns on and off the light repeatedly by throwing nonsense. Fun scene ... I still do not understand if it's thanks to the ingenuity of the light switches or Bell's perfectly formed breasts.
