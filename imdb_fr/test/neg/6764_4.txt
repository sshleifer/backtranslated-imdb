Some unnamed extraterrestrials boarding a distant ship from a distant planet sent the giant Kronos robot to strip the world of its energy. They have a prototype that slams in Mexico for the openers and if it succeeds, others will be sent. It would certainly take a long time for this Kronos alone to perform this task. <br /> <br /> For reasons I can not explain, the aliens first capture the spirit of the renowned scientist John Emery who telepathically directs Kronos to his first targets. Since Emery is killed later and the monster seems to be working well without Emery as a controller, the reason why the aliens needed him in the first place is a bit weird. <br /> <br /> Anyway, scientists Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence and George O'Hanlon, who work under Emery, are not fooled by his nature. And of course, they are developing a plan to tackle the raging metal giant. <br /> <br /> Kronos is a perfect film for the 50s, the bad guys are never seen but seek to undermine humanity. It's a perfect film for the cold war. And Jeff Morrow assures us that we will be ready for them in the future. <br /> <br /> The players have the impression to pass at the time with the same story that the authors could write in the scenario. I get the impression that Kronos is the kind of film that Ed Wood could have done with a bigger budget with a little more care.
