On paper, it looks like a good movie. Michael Caine plays a tough and ruthless boxing promoter whose son is ready for a title eliminator. What is a pity is that when the story is transferred from the paper to my TV screen, it loses some everything. I had hoped that we would be imitated from his definitive role in GET CARTER and, as the film progressed, he seems to take on the qualities of a hard and tenacious thriller but the whole tone of the movie jumps so much that you will be confused. as to what kind he tries to fit in. For example, Caine (in whom you can not believe like Billy "Shiner" Simpson, it's just Michael Caine) has a fun phrase because he refers to someone as "Hattie Jacques" and then in a moment supposedly amusing, his henchmen break someone's arm. Oh how I laughed. I mean, it's supposed to make you laugh like it's on the screen, right? But that seems to go against the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, director John Irvin does not know what approach to take with Scott Cherry's screenplay. Irvin is not a bad director and he is very much appreciated for his war movies such as THE DOGS OF WAR and HAMBURGER HILL, but he is ill suited to this type of violent drama and one can not help thinking that he might have been intimidated by a living legend like Caine. Caine gives the impression of doing it for his money and well-known characters in supportive roles like Landua and Cranham are actually just cameos that could be played by anyone.
