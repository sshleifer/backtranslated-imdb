It was one of the biggest bullshit I've ever had to watch. I mean, seriously. What would others feel if they were in Woody Harrelson's place and your wife would even think it would be a good idea to sleep with each other, even for a million dollars. After all, she was talking about it in bed and saying what would be good for them since he could build his house or anything with that money. Woody never fully accepted her until she persuaded him. How can you trust him? Who the hell would consider even if they were married? I do not care about their despair. It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life. Then he turns against her. Apparently, he had no right to be wary of her, apart from the fact that his wife had just slept with another extremely rich and handsome guy. Oh, and wait, so he's supposed to apologize to her on behalf of her divorce petition so she can be with the guy she slept with. Of course, Woody has no right to tell him anything or be wary of her, especially after she still has Roy Hobb's card in her wallet. Then, at the end of the movie, she is apparently so in love with Woody and he misses so much, that she was not going to leave Hobbs until he invented a ridiculously stupid story to try to make him believe that she would leave. Bleeping Thank you Hobbs ???? Are you making fun of me? Was she under contract as her sex slave or something ?? I mean what the beep ?? Oh, wait, it's better. She bleeds kissing passionately before getting out of the car. Yes, she is not a whore. Oh, thank you for letting me go, let me leave for the last time with you for the good of the world. Smooch smooch, smooch even though i'm still married to a guy i left for a rich guy. I have never seen such shit in my life. How on earth are we supposed to feel good after this horrible end? What was this film supposed to represent? Nothing came out of that! It was the most useless movie I have ever seen in my life. Two pathetic desperate people. If I were Woody, I would tell him to go drowning in the nearby water. Apparently, he had no self-respect. What could Roy Hobbs think about taking this horrible role? I feel like throwing up after watching this. This movie was so bad that it was really laughable. I want those two hours of my life that I lost watching this piece of ****.
