To summarize, this film was disappointing and could have been shortened by twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> The acting was mediocre, the only actors worthy of this group being Trisha, the killer and Molly. The music was slightly lame but ok and the special effects too used. The writing and script were mediocre, scenes of torture and unnecessary fictional scenes dragging on and a disappointing end. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film was rather slow, the false pretense of false interest gore. Trisha arrived at the house and there were bases for a good script. <br /> <br /> Trisha began to receive threatening phone calls, which heightened the suspense. This momentary suspense, the movie's best feature began to build, but friends crashed on the spot, destroying any potential suspense / horror in the film. <br /> <br /> The plot becomes obtuse from now on. The chemistry creates sparks between the two couples, then the murderer drives away Frank and the other girl. This scene was dragged in length and useless. <br /> <br /> The slayer then goes to Trisha and ties her up. There is an exaggerated torture scene that lasts at least another ten minutes. As the gore is poorly done, it's not entertaining at all and it's more annoying than shocks. <br /> <br /> In summary, the first thirty minutes of this film seem promising, but then a poorly written dialogue and a general lack of intrigue. ruin this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
