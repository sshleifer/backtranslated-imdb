This film had excellent production values, good lighting, costumes, sets, cinematography and acting. But someone, somewhere, took the script and replaced all the dialogues with little literate scriptures. I felt my IQ lose points every time a character spoke. <br /> <br /> Did they do it on purpose? Was it just an accident of Brain Dead Studio Executives? At this point, we do not know. <br /> <br /> All I know is that this movie was a big mistake from start to finish. We do not even manage to see how the team has become a cop, so instead of any character development, we get what looks like a bad TV movie of the last years. Or anytime. <br /> <br /> Find the writers, beat them with a sock full of quarters. Everyone, nice job, but read your scripts next time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
