I went to see this movie to save time. I remember Cole Hauser in "Tigerland", and although his game is wooden, he portrays a difficult "leader" character. Same here. This film spoke of a group of young passionate scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania that had to dive to see. The starting scene was very interesting, with a group of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave for loot. 30 years later, a team of divers was summoned by a scientist and his team to explore a cave for unknown scientific purposes. <br /> <br /> There are many clich√©s and useless speeches. Women are too hot for their work, let's face it. I hate to look at these women's lips talking about guys while drinking beer at the pre-cave exploration party. I mean it was like we were in a bar with fraternal guys and sorority talking about the opposite sex - not a group of scientists and divers. Each character had a zero personality, with the possible exception of the scientist, who at least was not a young and beautiful character. Thus, acting, although professional, was not inspiring. <br /> <br /> The dialog was rather bad. At one point in the film, Cole Hauser ("Jack"), the main diver - his irises turn into a Cingular wireless symbol and stay that way. We are led to believe that since he was scratched by one of these monsters, he is becoming one of them. It's enough. But first of all, no one tells him the obvious thing: "What's going on with your eyes, man ??" Everyone has just said that he has "changed" and that he should no longer be the leader of the group. And then this guy says, "You see how he is not human." Huh? If they really thought he was a monster, then why not act like that? Instead, the group breaks up into two - those who go with Jack and those who separate, I think, by considering him a monster. It does not mean anything. <br /> <br /> The best scene of the film was this blonde diver climbing the wall of a cave and is attacked by this goblin. Her scream was really bad, but she fought like crazy to send the goblin. <br /> <br /> The photography was good when the camera was STILL. But all the action sequences, the director found it useful to confuse us with flashing bubbles, flashlights, a dark space, God knows what. I would like them to show us a scene from time to time. It's not because you move the camera in all directions that the movie is scary, dear friends. <br /> <br /> This film could have been much better if the following changes had been made: <br /> <br /> 1. each actor was replaced by someone who looked real. Let Cole Hauser take the lead, it's nice to let him be beautiful. I'm tired of seeing scientists in their twenties. Give me a break, people! <br /> <br /> 2. The director of photography has been fired and replaced by another who has just pointed the camera and remains motionless. It could be the director's fault, I do not know. The nerve camera (as in Constant Gardener) ages, people. <br /> <br /> 3. We have seen goblins devour people. What about gore? There is not much else in this film. We barely could see the creatures - I felt a little ripped off about it. <br /> <br /> 4. The end was pretty lame. During the denouement, the sexy British scientist has a secret ... guess what? It's a little canned. The end would have been better if all had died instead of the black guy (Morris Chestnut), who seemed to inspire a little sympathy to his character just by his worried expressions. All the other actors had NO expression. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 4 out of 10, because after all, the acting was without notable mistakes and the concept was quite original. I'd like to see Cole play more military roles - he's doing well.
