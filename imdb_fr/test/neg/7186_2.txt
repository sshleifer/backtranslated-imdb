The fear of the black left me with the impression that several scenarios were written, too short for a feature film, then glued awkwardly into Frankenstein's monster. <br /> <br /> At its best, the protagonist Lucas, is scary. Although it is difficult to draw a pearl on the secondary characters, they are much more sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Fear of the dark could have ended in mediocrity if she had taken a single approach and crossed it - and if it had made Lucas simply psychotic and confused instead of macabre and repulsive. I wanted to see him packed in an asylum so that the rest of the characters could lead a normal life.
