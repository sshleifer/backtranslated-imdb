I know that many people will automatically assign / have awarded this movie a score of 1, simply because they do not have the huge budget and high-end special effects they are used to. However, I knew what I was getting into when I inserted it into the VCR. <br /> <br /> I do not think we have a lot more budget than that, unless we film a family reunion. The lighting is awful, the sound quality is sometimes incomprehensible, and the acting is extremely bad for most people involved. BUT, it's still a fun movie and the plot is quite interesting. It is centered on a man named Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt), who was not very lucky. He is very protective of his wife and does not allow him to work, putting even more pressure on himself. As he begins to work more hours, we see him slowly transcending madness and obsession and he becomes suspicious that his wife is cheating on him and begins to brutally murder the various men (most repairers) he believes officials. <br /> <br /> I must say that the effects of gore are extremely inexpensive, but harmonize with the overall tone of the film. The brutal ways in which Tom Russo tries to kill these men give us an idea of ​​what to do. he became crazy. The rhythm of the film is also very good and there is rarely a boring moment. The end really does not follow the rest of the plot of the film, because it seems to want to go from a psycho-slasher movie to a dream of "Dawn of the Dead", but it's nonetheless entertaining and I have to give Tim Ritter deserves to want to use an unconventional end. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can say I liked this movie, but it's not a good movie, if it makes sense. Its budget is its main stumbling block and the consequences are almost negligible. I do not recommend it to people who are totally spoiled by big budget movies and who can not be open to very low budget movies. You are not going to enjoy it. For others, and fans of gore - I say try it. You will find at least SOMETHING RESTORING IN! <br /> <br /> My note: D
