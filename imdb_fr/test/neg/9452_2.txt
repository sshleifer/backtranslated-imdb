A really awful, low-budget movie with a dreadful acting game, a twisted and insane plot, a modest reworking of vampire tales mixed with modern science. <br /> <br /> The result is a total mess, meaningless for most parts, with very limited and cheap effects. It's not even fun, like several independent movies of this type at low budget. <br /> <br /> A waste of time
