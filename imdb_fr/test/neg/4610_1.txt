The most enjoyable parts of this movie were the clips from the original movie. The acting was mediocre and the base of the sexual dashboards was revolting. The effects were at best marginal. Amy Irving was put in this movie to try to be part of the public Halloween H20. The original was much more pleasant and rewarding. I'm sorry to say it will not be one of the best 10 years ... so far, it's at the bottom of my list. Do not bother with this one people!
