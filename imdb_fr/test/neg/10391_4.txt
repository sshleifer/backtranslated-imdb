A girl named Isobel becomes possessed by a demon. The local priest (who once left Isobel's sister) must try to save her, but the most important problem is the family's suspicions of each other rather than their daughter's demon. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Ethan Wiley, the writer of "House" and the writer / director of "House II". I loved the first movie and the second one even more, so you'd think it would be a winner. Alas, it seems to have been assembled by students in the first year of cinema. Dawson Leery could have done better. I thought to blame the new writer Ellary Eddy, especially because the idea is not original (are they trying to seduce the fans of "The exorcism of Emily Rose"?), But Wiley should have been able to do his magic. <In addition, you would like to think that veteran horror stars Jeffrey Combs and James Russo would help this film. Russo (playing the role of the bishop) barely arrives, and Combs plays an important role as sheriff ... during the five minutes that he passes on the screen (but I love the mustache). So, no help here. <br /> <br /> After seeing "The Exorcist", all the other exorcism movies have to be compared to the classic by default, right? And demonic possession in this movie was not scary at all. No paranormal activity or turning your head. Just a girl with a deep voice and a runny makeup. All the "demonic" content was centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife. As another commentator has written, "Isobel often bounces on his bed like a trampoline, hiding in his closet and jumping out of a hayloft ... Yeah, that's Chuck E. Cheese in the wild." This sums up sadly the extent of the "evil" in this film. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie about family members who are making accusations and screaming at each other while the possessed girl is sitting in another room -camera, that's the movie for you. But if you do not mind me telling you, you have a horrible taste in the movie if that's what you're after. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to focus on the father accusing a cowboy of sleeping with his wife (who did not sleep with his daughter) and the vet who slept with his wife (who would have pu, but denies it). And then you have a gardener who attacks the possessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but once the priest has arrived, the gardener declares that he does not believe in God. What were you doing Bible quotations five minutes ago? <br /> <br /> A horror movie about exorcism. Horrible examples of what Combs and Russo are capable of. And such a directorial deployment after the film series "House" has become classic. I would like to claim that Wiley did not participate in the making of this shamefully derivative film, without originality and without inspiration. The power of Christ forces you to avoid this film as if looking at it was a capital sin.
