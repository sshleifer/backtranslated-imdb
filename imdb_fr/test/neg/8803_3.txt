This movie was not the best ... but there were good actors. Isiaiah Washington was pretty good as a homeless guy, Guy Torrey was good as his disabled brother, Ice-T was humorous as owner and surprisingly ... actress Tami Roman was good as a judge in the movie. I did not even know it was her and I am an unconditional fan of the Real World. She was totally believable. Hope this movie will not hinder the development of these actors. I know that Isiaiah left this film far behind with the success of Gray's Anatomy, Ice-T with her usual role in the NYPD's special unit, and Tami Roman had a recurring role in Sex Love and Secrets (the new soap opera). UPN). I wish the same thing for the other actors, because a bad film can not be produced by a bad actor.
