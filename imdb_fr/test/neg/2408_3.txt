As I struggled to stay awake during this festival, I struggled to find a stupid plot about the brotherhood schmucks, quite unbelievably annoying, encountering problems with a semi-human / half cyborg named cyborg called Splatter sending his soldiers to their pursuit after the murder of their prestigious political leader (for whom Splatter killed himself, preparing the blame for him to become the leader). These painted-face monsters form a group that expresses its feelings in an anarchic, though nonviolent way, living in dilapidated streets abandoned by the "civilized world" and expressing their concerns about nuclear disarmament. Anyway, in the movie, these five fraternal henchmen run in dark streets with graffiti walls, while Splatter and his punks pursue them. Fortunately for them, they find a punk chic to help them in their journey out of this rather ugly terrain with which they are not familiar. This territory where the guys are immersed is a maze of streets and alleys with the idea of ​​a very difficult exit especially when the crazy and the group of Splatter occupy almost every corner. <br /> <br /> Yeah, I was fooled like the others Thanks to the poster of HR Giger who is the most excellent. If only he had been the designer of this shipwreck ... it is not the case and we, spectators, remain a film inspired by all the films, it seems, "THE WARRIORS" of Walter Hill, except that this film does not have the style or grain that the film has. The film has a plethora of non-funny tracks and lame confrontations between frats and punks with often laughable hand-to-hand combat. The setting is rather interesting, and there are some atmospheric uses of neon light, but it is not the environment that is the problem. It's the plot and the characters in the environment that become tedious. The saddlebags under my eyes weighed heavier every minute this film went on. Yes, Edwin Neal (Texas ..) is a pretty funny singer, who has an entertaining interview on the DVD I rented for this flaming movie) and Marilyn Burns plays a "key" role as opposing members of their faction against the government culminated in the final conclusion in a real estate complex at the end. The character of Neal Splatter uses these metal spikes that emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims.
