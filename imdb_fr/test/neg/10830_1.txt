This film does not even have the merit of being so bad that it's good. It's really dreadful. It's closer to an ironic parody than a movie about the disaster, but alas, they were serious. Made for TV, but not worthy of it. It contains all the clich√©s and moments of the plot that you can imagine. Oh, will he save the city from the flood? Will his wife admit that she still loves him? Will they escape before the flood drowns them? I can not explain how bad it is. Terrible predictable scenario that makes you wince, it's so cheesy. Bad effects (although to be honest, I saw worse boiling water super imposed). Wrong script. Sad actor. Hideous. So bad actually that you should probably get drunk and watch it.
