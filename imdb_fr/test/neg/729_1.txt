Usually, when I do not see a show on an original series, I find it later on the cable and I realize it's a jewel. The "Gimore Girls" are one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad I missed it. <br /> <br /> I really despise the shows that fill every minute of the space of the actors jokes disjointed, stupid and boring. It's an hour away. The mother, Lorelei, made me wonder if she was bipolar and without her lithium. She never stopped talking; every minute, every second, talk to every person she interacted with. Even worse, his speech is childish and so, like Valley Girl. She talked about guys, her hair, her mother, her clothes. Like, what is the sitch ?? (for situation). I have watched this show three times and still have not understood the purpose of this series. It's not a comedy, it's not a drama, it does not make sense except to make three generations of women of the same family look like the "girls" of the planet Mars. In comparison, men are intelligent and make the show a little watchable. If Lorelei already existed and was trying to catch me by the conversation, I should push her to get rid of her. Obviously, she does not know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else. She does not know how to notice the existence of others. <br /> <br /> During a show, Lorelei returns home after a date close to 22 hours. She had the date after chasing a guy she had met at an auction. She goes to her daughter's room where she asks how that happened. She explains how boring the guy was. His date has somehow got some words on board. Lorelei complained that the man did not stop talking (choking). Let's hope the date has learned how lucky he was. <br /> <br /> Another person here commented on the teenage mother's behavior and her daughter's personality. Lorelei dresses even like her kid. Obviously, about forty years dress up and looks like a girl in high school. <br /> <br /> I thought this show should have been followed by "Just Shoot Me" because that's exactly how I felt.
