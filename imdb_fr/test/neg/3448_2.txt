Two stars <br /> <br /> Amanda Plummer who looks like a young version of her father, Christopher Plummer in drag, plays in this film alongside Robert Forster - who should have really put a little black shoe on this bald spot . <br /> <br /> I have never seen Amanda Plummer in a good movie. She always plays these slightly wacky characters in movies that do not mix, and she does it again in this one. <br /> <br /> First, we have two young women, sisters, who do not look the same in the world, who let themselves be taken apart, by dubious men along the roads. <br /> <br /> Amanda's character, Sandra, has at least one good reason to allow Dr. Jake (Robert Forster) to look for her in the first place. She was driven off the road, apparently by a maniac, and her car is almost destroyed. <br /> <br /> Attention - The spoilers in front of you! <br /> <br /> However, as we progress, we realize that Dr. Jake is not playing with a full set, nor is Amanda playing. He makes every decision on the basis of a coin. <br /> <br /> When Dr. Jake and Amanda arrive at a motel, who only sees the car of the maniac and what does Amanda do if she enters her wagon office and start poking. What she has motivated to do this is never clear since the man is apparently dangerous and could attempt to kill her. One might think that the last thing she would do is to put herself in such a precarious situation. <br /> <br /> Not only does she poke, but she finds money and takes it. <br /> <br /> Shortly after, we have several other problems that do not add up. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake, with Amanda as a passenger, lack of fuel and both leave their car and start walking. One would think while crossing a desert, he would have checked his gas gauge - it seems very unlikely for him. Then, later, we see him driving the same car. When or how did he get the car? <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake tells Amanda that he knows she took the money. Now, how could he know that? He did not see her doing as much as I know and she did not tell him she was doing it. Then, later, we have a character called Santini (David Thewlis), the man who was driving the break, give them a lift and I'll be cursed if he does not know that Amanda has also taken the money . How could he know that? <br /> <br /> As we move forward, it loses credibility at an alarming rate. <br /> <br /> When Alice, Amanda's sister (Fairuza Balk) gets in the clutches of the murderer and decides to cast a coin - you'd think she'd be very, very careful about it that the coin she is trading against a trap coin is definitely the trap coin - but apparently this is not the case. <br /> <br /> This destroys any credibility this film could have had.
