Bad game? Yes, but it was not a surprise. Stupid story? Yes and so? <br /> <br /> But why, tell me, Mr. Director, why all this idiot crap? The fight scenes were bad, really bad, because of the slow motion and the bad cut. Not because of Seagal. <br /> <br /> "And if I speed up the process for 2 seconds, then slow down the next 5 seconds, then ... maybe I should go back to make the decision?" What did you think, Mr Director ???
