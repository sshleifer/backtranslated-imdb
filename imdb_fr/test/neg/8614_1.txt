The plot is simple: an American couple is on vacation in Thailand. They are somehow attacked by the "all-powerful" Chinese vampires and the girl is kidnapped by the big boss of vampires. It's OK until now. The girl's partner is left looking for her. And now, the horror begins. He comes across a strange group of semi-vampires or something (they only drink animal blood). These vampires have been in conflict with the villain for about 800 years. However, with the help of "good vampires", the guy starts looking for his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Now, the fight scenes begin, what karate film without a fight? Another thing I noticed is that vampires are ugly guys. I mean .... a vampire is an old guy (he's been alive since ... forever), he has style. There are also modern vampires, but in this movie, the vampires are ... weird. Like, come on, they ride a bike, they are all dressed in leather and they destroy everything that happens on their way. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that you can clearly see that this film is economical. The scenario is boring and the actors are not too talented. The music is good, but the effects are not very good. <br /> <br /> To summarize, it's not so good, but if you have a free afternoon, look at it and tell me if I'm right or not.
