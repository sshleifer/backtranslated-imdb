Strange things happen in Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and their young daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, Greg's real daughter) when they move to a big house inherited from Ireland. Crisp corpses are found in the cellar, a turkey is spilling blood, furniture moves and the ghosts of a dead child and a shaky old lady come to frighten the little girl. Paranormal investigators are eventually called to ban evil spirits, but Maura anyway becomes possessed and chases everyone with a meat cleaver. <br /> <br /> This film is full of clich√©s, but Alexandra Paul stands out for her performance. .. pity it does not belong to this movie (nor to any other than I can think of the hand)! She can barely keep an impassive face and her angry and hysterical tantrums are a joy to behold. In any case, it is much more interesting to watch than anything else in this film. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
