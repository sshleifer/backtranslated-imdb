British film of bad taste from a Japanese novel about a very troubled young man who is influenced by a classmate Hitler type and seeks to harm the lover of his widowed mother. Some good scenes (Sarah Miles discovering that her son was watching her and confronting him angrily, the boy with the pasty face trying to take Kris Kristofferson to the trap of his death by being very friendly), but what is the interest not to provoke shock? Sad and uncomfortable, it does not offer any benefit to the people involved (especially Kristofferson, whose hollow looks and usual gritty words are misplaced in a psychological hodgepodge like this). Coldly, without any sense of its own absurdity, director Lewis John Carlino seems to believe that such a circumstance could occur. If he's right, it's a lot more shocking than anything in "Sailor". * from ****
