The film has so much potential that it has not been developed. Mark Hamill gives a good performance, just like Bill Paxton. The scenery is beautiful and ultra-light planes are cured. The problem with this film is that the story is well underdeveloped and that the plot leads nowhere. The film at times almost puts you to sleep. I give it 3 stars out of 10 for flight scenes.
