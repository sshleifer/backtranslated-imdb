This is by far one of the worst movies that Sandra Bullock has played. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. It's definitely his forte and playing is not. In fact, I spent 54 minutes in this movie before getting bored of it so much that I felt compelled to leave the theater. Anyway, it's boring from start to finish, well 54 minutes after the beginning of the movie. The premise of "Guess what happened to me on the way to the ...." has been repeated many times. In one way or another, there seems to be nothing funny or romantic about people who are wrong about each other. Parents should be aware that this movie may not be suitable for your teenage children, especially those who are impressionable and who may consider Sandra as a hero. There is a scene where the writers / producers / directors thought it would be good to show how "ok" to smoke a joint ... while driving ... and to have no consequences at all when we get caught. I'm not prudish, and I smoked my part when I was younger, but I guarantee you that I will not drive my teenagers to see her and that they are strong A & B students. If you want to see a good film by Sandra Bullock, rent "The Net" or "Hope Floats" which, in my opinion, are two of his best works.
