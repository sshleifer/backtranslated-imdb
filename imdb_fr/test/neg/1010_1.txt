It's a little less disgusting than the first two films, but otherwise, it's as if nothing was wrong: a slice of cinema sick, devious and unbalanced. Charles Bronson is back and launches action when his friend is killed by terrifying cries terrorizing the neighborhood. Crime, you see, has gone up 11% in the South Belmont area ... so what do you have to do? A stronger police presence? Harder prisons? More severe sentences? No, the only solution is to send a loose cannon like Bronson to take a bloody revenge? justice, according to the authors: this time, he is the killing machine of the chief of police, Ed Lauter. <br /> <br /> The writers go out of their way to make Kersey the hero, sending unnecessary cops to the area. only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident guarding it to provide a scene in which Kersey gets his camera stolen and shoots the thief in the back, to the applause of the crowd. Capital punishment for theft? Well, ok. The attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution, and the dishonest character of the characters in figures that exist only to encourage Kersey or support it is appalling. <br /> <br /> Of course, these villains are but should the film not let the viewer decide, rather than tilting all this towards Kersey and his stupid answer? Curiously, the besieged residents do not fear the reprisals of a gang or blame Kersey for any violence, which is strange because a character is killed precisely because of the involvement of Kersey. At the end of the film, they take all the guns in their briefs and happily join the massacre, never stopping to think and struggling with the idea of ​​having to kill another human being. <br /> <br /> Excruciatingly shallow performances do not help you? Bronson literally has a facial expression and can not even bend the right words. New heights of stupidity are reached here ?? a machine gun? A rocket launcher ?! ?? and new hollows of misogyny: the film manages to desecrate all the female characters in sight, whether by rape, explosion or slaughter; and it puts them in an extremely stupid way, like a victim who ventures into the crime-ridden neighborhood and controlled by a gang to ask a stranger, or someone who does the shopping alone at night. It's pure and simple, garbage without brains, without style or sense.
