Is the subject of the controversy in Cannes remarkably esoteric, or are Americans so insensitive and cynical that we never read between the lines again? Anyway, with a lot of careful analysis, "Falscher Bekenner" does not seem at any time to live up to the long-awaited controversy that it would have brought to Cannes in 2005, a strangely dull film with no objective that deserves rather, his American decay. -title ("Low Profile"). <br /> <br /> By relying on familiar themes of bourgeois anxiety and the resulting sexual liberation (in a way), it is a film that does not lack superficial interests. It begins with a grappling hook, while the haunted look of a desolate road off the road focuses on a teenage vagabond, who eventually passes by a stunned car, where supposedly a brutal leakage has left the driver died a bloody mess. Stunned, he only picks up one end of the engine that remains. <br /> <br /> Barely out of school, the wanderer turns out to be Armin Steebe, a product of the German suburbs with minimal ambition. Under the persistent pressure of his benevolent but somewhat harassing parents to find a good job, he supports interview after interview with each haughty interviewer, all with the same unsuccessful result. Gravely ill, his meeting on the aforementioned road soon causes his first act of rebellion: claim responsibility for the crime he did not commit. <br /> <br /> Pretending to fill more requests and go more and more weird job interviews by sunrise, he is involved in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism after bedtime Sun. As the days get shorter and the nights become much hotter, he continues to live in his suburban neighborhood, as if he was doing nothing unusual. <br /> <br /> If you seem confused as to exactly what is happening, do not worry about being alone: ​​it's about as coherent as the story. The plot seems rather simple, and it is perhaps because of its seemingly direct purpose that "Falscher Bekenner" becomes unnecessarily complicit, seduced by innumerable erroneous conclusions, dreamlike situations and illustrated sex scenes to try to to illuminate a story without logical argument (so-called the scary effects of the modern suburban wasteland, or something about the fascination of young people for crime.he could even be a movie that will come out.) within reach of hand. He spends a lot of time creating many symbols, both tangible and surreal allegorical, but they do not really seem to symbolize anything of interest. <br /> <br /> The most serious flaw, however, is the way filmmakers paint all their characters in a rough shade of vanilla. There are hardly any distinguishing features to understand their purpose, and how the secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between Armin and his rather normal family, perhaps too normal) catalyze the "hardship" of the main character already underdeveloped. How are we supposed to identify with the rebellion of this young adult, little aware of the world in which he lives or personalities around him and who help him? <br /> <br /> Many people come in and out of the movie (including Armin's girlfriend, Katja, and a strange and wealthy visitor who, for some reason, finds pleasure watching the protagonist eat brownies ) and seems to have existed for a long time. no reason whatsoever. In the end, they look like a long tale of an already lean story with unnecessary side-tricks that continue to prove that the film totally eliminates the future. <br /> <br /> And even a movie supposed to play with reality (especially with Armin's nocturnal exploits), it ends with a literal, almost moralistic puzzle that seems to stop the questions in a "story" that does little, but puts his viewer in a state of perplexity unnecessarily exhausted. <br /> <br /> Without any color, it is impossible to hide anything essential.
