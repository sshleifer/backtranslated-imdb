First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all the actors who appear in this film and that at the moment when I rented it, I wanted to like it. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason for my disappointment was that the outer box promised me a thriller thriller. To me, a suspense thriller for British films resembles a Ruth Rendell novel, which has a lot of twists and leaves the viewer with an end that is unlikely to be forgotten any time soon. <br /> <br /> This film began with the promising note of such a film. We have our main character, who suspects a man he does not like, to be involved in a hit and run that kills the husband of one of his servants. His notions are fair, but the idea that his wife might be involved, does not come to her mind until she confesses that she is part of the crime. <br /> <br /> The elements of a good suspense thriller were in place at this point, but I felt that the movie took a different direction and became almost a kind of soap opera about who wants to be with whom and what is the love of a real relationship. The film might have been nice to me if the outer box had evoked the triangle of a twisted lover and had not been called suspense suspense. the true content of the film. I thought this movie could have done a lot better than it did. I felt as if she continued to bring the viewer to a great event that never materialized. So, I have to give it a lower rating than I would have liked and say it did not meet my expectations.
