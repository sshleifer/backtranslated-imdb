I saw this film more than 20 years ago and I have fond memories of it. Coming back to Cinemax this month, I realized how little discernment I had about movies at the time. This is a very ordinary spaghetti western, which contains absolutely nothing remarkable. The scenario, the staging, the acting, the photography are all great bla Stay true to the westerns Sergio Leone!
