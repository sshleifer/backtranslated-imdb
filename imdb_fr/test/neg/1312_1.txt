This dreadful effort only shows what happens when you not only use computers to generate the effects, but also let them design the plot and write the script. Somewhere somewhere has obviously developed a new software that asks a few questions, then produced four hours of vaguely connected snapshots, a lousy dialogue and a collection of standard characters that you would have all drowned in the first five minutes. Tom Courtney won the award for the worst performance. To say that it was made of wood would be an insult to the trees. It's hard to blame Robert Carlyle for almost everything he does, but the odds were against him even in this situation, especially since he was held for an inexplicable reason to adopt a lamentable London accent. <br /> <br /> A complete wash.
