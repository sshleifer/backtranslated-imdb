Like everyone who bought this, the "20 pieces of the extreme gore" and the "banned in 20 countries" or whatever is written in the box, fooled me. I must admit that I am a fan of Gore and I am always amazed when films manage to make a convincing film. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are some of the best in the industry. The revolutionary makeup effects in the 80s. Today, you no longer need it, everything is done on a computer. But computers can not compare to the visual magic that these three men could imagine. But I am moving away from the subject. <br /> <br /> Watching terribly bloody movies like Fulci's Gates to Hell or even Savini's coronation on Friday the 13th of the final chapter, you can enjoy everything that goes into making a terribly bloody movie . You can not tell the difference between reality and magic. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine another reason why anyone would want to see Cannibal Ferox, if not the gore who is apparently omnipotent in this film. If that's the reason you're looking for this movie, you're wasting your money. As many other commentators have noted, most critics are a consequence. You do not see the torture, or the bloodshed that's happening, you see what it looks like after the words. <br /> <br /> The gore? Well, it's here, but not as much as one might expect or expect. A man is castrated and a woman is hanged by the breast, but apart from these two scenes, one with scalping; there is nothing really much else to this film. The scenes of gore, even in the three mentioned, are still quite tame compared to what you were hoping for. Maybe it's just me and my experience sick and twisted in the horror and gore genre, but I was expecting a bit more. Call me sick or crooked, but is not that the only reason people watch this movie in the first place? Honestly, I found myself bored in many places. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on the craze for a film of superior quality. Although Cannibal Holocaust is not really a good film, it is much better than this tripe. If you're going for $ 20, you'll feel cheated. <br /> <br /> 3/10
