This film is a total and total waste of time, one of the worst films I have ever seen. And coming from me, it's definitely saying something. In fact, I would have liked to be able to give it negative stars instead of considering it as a pathetic a frightful star. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I was open-minded. I find the legend of Chupacabra interesting and I have a penchant for horror movies with cheese. But I draw the line to this one. <br /> <br /> The acting game has been sucked. The leading man achieves one of the worst performances of all time, with a look and sound unnatural as he delivers his poorly written replicas. The main woman gives a slightly more acceptable performance, but it does not really do much. <br /> <br /> The chupacabra ... well, considering the small budget that this movie had to have, the creature was tolerable. However, he looks exactly like someone in mask and in combination. The mask is pretty detailed and can look cool in person, but not on the screen. <br /> <br /> Speaking on the screen, you might think they might at least have been able to use a better camera. It looks like he was shot with a camcorder for shouting loudly. Not very good either. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the one who wrote this abomination thought. The dialogue is nil and ... I can not describe how I feel about it. At least not without having problems with the site. <br /> <br /> My advice? Avoid that at all costs. It's just not worth it. If it goes on TV and you have nothing else to do or watch, then * find * something else to do or watch. Read a book, listen to music, * anything. * Do not submit to that. If you do, you can not say that you have not been warned. And for the sake of Lord and Lady, do not rent this miller. It's not worth it, even if you can rent it for fifty cents. Believe me, I know.
