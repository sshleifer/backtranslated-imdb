It's horrible. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty succinct criticism that I know, but it's been a long time since a film left me in such a state of stupefaction - I wonder how on earth such a movie can be shot. <Br /> <br /> The last time this happened was "Mission to Mars" in Turkey last year. <br /> <br /> Salvatore Coco is a former prisoner - trying to improve herself through self-help videos, endless seminars and refresher courses. He lives according to the slogans that these courses explain. <br /> <br /> He falls on a faded disco singer, played by Nikki Bennett, and has an epiphany; his new career will be that of an artistic agent - with the singer as one and only customer. <br /> <br /> Funded by his gospel song, his paraplegic girlfriend, played by Sasha Horler - he opens a shop and tries to revive Nikki's career, with disastrous results. <br /> <br /> "Walk the Talk" is why Australians are so scornful of Australian cinema. It is poorly built, lame and far too long (111 minutes for a comedy that should have barely touched the bar of 80 minutes). <br /> <br /> Each scene is too long and very repetitive. The audience is not given a character to sympathize with; an essential ingredient in a film like this, which would aim to give the opportunity to an "outsider". <br /> <br /> The decent end and frankly mediocre ends after 30 minutes of dialogues and scenes that anguish the mind you need a power failure. <br /> <br /> This film is a failure at all levels - worsened for the Queensland public by its liberal and innocent use of various locations of Gold Coast / Palm Beach; and its laughable use of Brisbane's suburban names such as Norman Park and Caboolture.
