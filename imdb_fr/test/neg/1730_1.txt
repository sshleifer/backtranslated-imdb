Horrible! I am a teenager and I do not mind watching movies for teenagers but it's horrible! Aaron Carter plays this popstar named JD McQueen and, to keep his notes, he collaborates with Jane, whatever his name. But the "wicked girls" are too predictable and similar. The clothes that most girls wear in the film are not realistic. How would one of these girls get away with a bra, camisole, or shirt that exposed her belly? AT SECONDARY SCHOOL? In my school, we would be sent home for something like this. <br /> <br /> And part of the movie where JD sends an SMS to Jane, she says, "Sleep well, he must think I'm an idiot!" I did not know that texting was so stressful! Are the text messages stressful? And how Jane is obsessed with JD and falling in love with her is very stupid .The dialogue is silly and stupid, the acting is terrible, the music is a little fun and the plot is almost nil. <br /> <br /> For the older ones who still love Aaron Carter, you'll appreciate it.If you're a casual observer like me, this is not the movie for you
