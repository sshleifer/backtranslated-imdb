I was invited to watch this film during a screening in a small art museum. I did not know what to expect. At first, I was optimistic in the opening credits, citing Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, James Cann, Rob Lowe and Lara-Flynn-Boyle. However, after rough and disturbing scenes (which do not add much to the progress of the story), this film quickly becomes a weapon of torture. The gimmick of the ever-increasing intrigue of the arms is never really developed. I waited patiently for this film to be cashed. There was a small profit at the end, but having to invest and sit in the infinite, raw, brutal, sexually perverse, screaming in the face, screaming and without gore was too expensive for me (even for free viewing ). What were these established actors doing in this horrible film? The art direction was very convincing and scary. At a minimum, it should only be a 75-minute movie. It's a movie that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld would kiss.
