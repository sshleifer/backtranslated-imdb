At least for me. I followed Mr Almdovar's career from the beginning and I was not crazy about this film. I think Penelope Cruz was a bad idea, the kind of woman she describes does not look so good, she makes the character amazing. In addition, the singing scene was just weird. I do not understand the point and the timing of the lips was awful. <br /> <br /> As a Spaniard, another thing that drove me crazy is the accent. Why do people from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is notable and makes no sense. And the village? Are we in 2007 or 1950? I found myself trying to explain to my American husband that a lot of things in the movie are "old school", that it's not like that anymore. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more, but this time, Mr. Almodovar did it. not deliver, at least for me. I'm not saying that Miss Cruz does a bad job, I say she does not belong to her, not portraying this character.
