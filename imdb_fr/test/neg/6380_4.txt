This show has shown its true colors now that Democrats are in power. He never led the world in IQ, because everyone who thought they had intelligence was programmed to think in a way (which is a frightening thing). <br /> <br /> Comedy Central moved him and he went back to an earlier one Once the Democrats took power for a reason - because now, when the Democrats are mistaken - which is as often as the Republicans - Stewart does not take any more pots. That's why the ratings for this title and the rotation are down. <br /> <br /> Basically, most of the humor is now either lame or lame jokes of Sarah Palin - that all the critics abandoned by the comedians are telling. The facts in support of that speak for themselves. The Jay Leno show, which has done the same kind of humor, is about to be canceled. The notes of Letterman & Conan and the series that follow them are down. <br /> <br /> The Emperor Stewart is not alone. The problem is that if one of them starts to get caught by the real Democrats in power, they could raise their ratings quickly, because the best humor is always to the detriment of the one who holds the power. The Bush years proved that because the ratings of this show, Colbert, Letterman and Leno, were better. <br /> <br /> O'Bama did one thing: he proved that these shows had to be prepared to take the people in power to risk if they wanted to prosper. Right now, the Daily Show and Stewart are sinking, but maybe they can get lucky and have Palin elected to the first woman president in 2012. Then, Palin's lame jokes will become cards to conviction.
