<br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly funny, it makes you want to cry, the pictures are thicker than the peanut butter of 5 years and so that they aspire the humor of your heart, every joke was badly programmed and would not have been funny if it had been programmed correctly. <br /> <br /> You can not see this movie, chances are you never go to comedy ... ever again.
