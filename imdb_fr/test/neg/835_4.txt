ANY GUN CAN PLAY (2 stars out of 5 stars) A totally banal "western spaghetti western" featuring this guy who used to play "Kookie" on "77 Sunset Strip". The plot is complicated nonsense about stolen gold coins and various men with questionable motives trying to find it. It's one of those "light" westerns ... which means a lot of painstaking "comedy" attempts ... and really awful music for most action sequences (you can say it's not the work of Ennio Morricone). George Hilton plays a bounty hunter called "Stranger" ... but he does not leave much footprint ... he just does not have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero, who is able to do a lot with a little written character. The end is a complete homage / parody of the end of "The good, the bad and the ugly" ... although it's barely enough fun to be considered a "parody". The highlight of the film is the first 5 minutes ... featuring actors inspired by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and someone else (is it supposed to be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? is not very clear ...). by Stranger. It's a fun joke for fans of Sergio Leone fans and Western spaghetti lovers ... but I guess no one else would understand the problem.
