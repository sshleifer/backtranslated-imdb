The first 20 minutes were a little fun because I do not think I've ever seen such a bad movie {acting, scenario, effects (!), Etc ...} The rest of the time seemed to be hanging around forever with each snapshot of the dialog box is used without effect. These people did not seem to really like horror movies or how to make them or any other movie. There is no language for adults, a little short nudity, and no gore except fake blood stained on any open wound, etc. He was reportedly PG in the early eighties and at 13 today. I do not know how he got an R rating or if he actually did it. I saw the international American version called Hospital Of Terror. I've seen 100 horror movies in the last 12 months and it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here is an example of the seriousness of the situation: there is a scene where something green comes out of the door. I do not know what it's supposed to be, but what's on the screen is the green pencil scribbles of some kids {I'm not exaggerating} super-imposed on the movie, half-moving inside the door, then supposed to do something for Nurse Sherri must own it, I guess. I could not believe they had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment.
