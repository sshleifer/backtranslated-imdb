In fact, I own this movie which is the MST3K version called "Cave Dwellers", which is really the only way to watch a movie like this. If Joel, Crow and Tom Servo were not always fooling around, it would not be possible to miss this shit. You have a hero called Ator who looks a lot like Jeff Spigoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and is only slightly smarter, but not smashed. He confronts caverns (cave dwellers?), Invisible Guys, a giant snake (with a group of anal retaining snakes who like to align all the skulls to face the same face), invents a glider that looks suspiciously like an aluminum modern. one with cheap vines wrapped around it, then fights with the bad guy who looks like John Saxon. Then he rides his horse through the tire tracks where someone has already driven four wheels. <br /> <br /> Yes, most of this information comes from MST3K, which, as I said, is the only way to watch this turkey from a movie. If it were not the case, it would have no stars.
