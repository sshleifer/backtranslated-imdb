It may be the worst thing I have ever seen on television. First, I'm sure it's taken quite seriously and I'm pretty good at recognizing satire. Second, it displays the levels of Aristotelian chauvinism; in one of his commercials, one of the "playas" describes women in terms of "quality". Thirdly, all the competitors I saw (six, I think) were a pioneer of the variety likely to have a Facebook account with "BONING U" or "WOMEN", entered under "Here For". To paraphrase Roger Ebert, this does not scrape the bottom of the barrel, nor does it deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as the barrel. The closest thing to a buyback feature I experienced with regards to Key to the VIP was to make me reassure by a friend, that male actors were actually the opposite of attractive, both physically and mentally.
