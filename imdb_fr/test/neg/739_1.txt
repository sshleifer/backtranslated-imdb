It is a dreadful film, hardly recognizable in the book, although their intrigues are similar. The time it takes to watch this movie (which only lasts an hour and a half) would be better spent on something else, including watching the grass grow. Adding fancy fantasy scenes makes Catherine ridiculously stupid. The actress who plays Catherine also falls on the fact ditzy like a goodness and looks constantly surprised, even when she is supposed to look with love in the eyes of her Tilney. Honestly!! The film ends with a phantasmagorical scene of Catherine in which we can not help wondering if this happens or if it is simply delusional, and not the right way that makes you think, but in a perfectly horrible way which sums up the terrible film. The only good thing about the movie is the title, which was written by Mrs. Austen herself. I usually like BBC productions, but this one is horrible.
