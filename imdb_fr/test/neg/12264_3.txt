This film follows a storyboard very similar to The Warriors, but with less intensity and a rather mediocre acting, which is not unanimous. <br /> <br /> The story in general is not so terrible, based on a small Australian gang trying to get out of the city when one of their members is accused of rape by the daughter of another gang. They must then make their way through the streets while being hunted down by a number of rival gangs. One could assume that the writers took a page from The Warriors' book and rewrote it, but as mentioned above - with a not so equal intensity. <br /> <br /> The action as a whole is not very good in my opinion, and it is clearly obvious on many occasions that they are doing well ... the fight scenes make up for that, but the mediocre sound effects that accompany them make it go down. <br /> <br /> This film has nothing on Once Were Warriors. <br /> <br /> Small budget, exciting story, mediocre acting, nothing to talk about him.
