This film is a beautiful example of what happens when a studio wants to get at any price after a movie quality. Only with this film, it's really a bankruptcy. Everything seems in place for Robocop 2 to be a worthy continuation of this first revolutionary film. The complete original cast (apart from the casualties, of course) comes back and gives it the best. Too bad the scenario and the director are incompetent and neutralize their efforts. <br /> <br /> Irvin Kershner might have been ideal for George Lucas to lead Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian filmmaker like Kershner, Lucas's flimsy film series does not have much to lose. A worthy successor to a classic like Robocop would have needed Paul Verhoeven to come back or a director with enough brass to give his own image. Kershner can not give anything (Lucas hired him for that) and he's probably not Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> So here we get a film that reproduces all the movements to reproduce the first film, but without the freshness, the humor or the audacity of the original. Kershner no doubt thought he could beat Verhoeven by adding more bloody and gratuitous violence, but he reveals how much he was at work as a director instead of a passionate director. And it's a shame, because everything was in place to make another classic. As mentioned, the actors give the best of themselves, but Phill Tippet produces revolutionary effects in stop motion and the story of Frank Miller, born to write a film Robocop, contains excellent ideas. If only the studio had engaged a director competent enough to exploit the full potential.
