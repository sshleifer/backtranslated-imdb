The best thing I can say about this pornographic horror film is crazy crazy people! <br /> <br /> Beyond, this film was shot by a Hindu / Indian guy with experience in porn or other movies. Intrigue: The talk show host and her girlfriend are being harassed by a psychopath who is unhappy with homelessness and who is attacking you, you guessed it, pretty real estate agents, ladies ! (These movies are why 80s slasher films have had a misogyny representative) <br /> <br /> This movie is not really a slasher, but presents the same kind of implausibilities and stereotypes: idiot cops, the villain is a white old man, and women are busty girls. <br /> <br /> If you like porn-horror, this is your movie, otherwise stay away. (Adrienne's fans will see her breasts sag for a second or two)
