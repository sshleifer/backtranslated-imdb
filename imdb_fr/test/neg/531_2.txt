Cybrog 2: Glass Shadow stars Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (Rhymes with kicks!), A karate instructor who helps a Cash (Jolie) escape from Pinwheel, its creators who seek to explode it to destroy a rival company. Along the way, Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd show up to move the duo, while Jack Palance is there to guide the duo on the run. One of the rather shocking aspects of the Cyborg franchise is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and offbeat actors in the cast. The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (I do not know her, she was in a pile of 70s porn). This one has Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third is William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. (Okay, the Cyborg 3 cast is not that impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3, but I've seen it on a science fiction channel before, and I must confess I did not not impressed. In fact, Cyborg 2 is a film that often has a beautiful appearance. It was shot with excellent style and the visual details make it easy. However, Cyborg 1 was similar, the film was done with a certain style, slow motion and music that made it all pleasing to the eyes. Unfortunately, as the first, this one has no new idea or something that looks like a plot or texture. Most ideas are from Blade Runner and Max Headroom. Therefore, for a variety of reasons, the film does not have much to offer beyond its appearance. Another aspect is the terrible game. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie is not much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance are doing well but Palance plays a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor. I guess on the bright side, you can not accuse Michael Schroeder of not being ambitious in casting. Still, the movie is boring and I, the 15-minute interest in the story has also lost interest. Also, why did they tie him to Cyborg anyway? This has nothing to do with his predecessor, who manages to be worse than. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
