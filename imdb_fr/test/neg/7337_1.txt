Is it just me or the fact that the evil race team is Japanese and that their arrogant star rider is German seems a little exaggerated? Maybe that's what happens on the international circuit, but if all the Americans represented them were bastards like Cody and his mechanic Chris (Peter Berg, who still had to learn to play), I'd be looking for a other country. Formula films can be good but the characters must be friendly and no one meets these criteria in this movie. To put it succinctly - a very bad movie.
