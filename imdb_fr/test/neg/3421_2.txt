This film illustrates like no other the state of the Australian film industry and all that holds it back. <br /> <br /> An impressive talent, exceptional performances (including Victoria Hill), but an almost absolute disappointment. <br /> <br /> An "adaptation" in a way, it does not bring anything new to Macbeth (no, to place it in the current Australia is not enough) and, fundamentally, it completely failed to justify its existence, besides facing it, quite uselessly) paying tribute to the original work. If there is a work that has been done (and done and done and done), it is Shakespeare's. Thus, any adaptation, if it does not have to be a complacent and useless exercise, must at least bring a new interpretation to the work. <br /> <br /> And that's what Macbeth can not do. As it was done, this film has no contemporary relevance. It's the same piece we've seen countless (too much!) Times before. Except with rifles and in different outfits. <br /> <br /> Aside from the fundamental fault (not to say more) of retaining the original Shakespearian dialogue, one of the film's most kinkiest moments is the extended and incredibly boring duration slowing down the slow motion to the end, during which I completely tuned, even though I was watching the screen. I never thought I had a limited attention span, but here it is. <br /> <br /> I guess the film succeeds alone, under very limited conditions. But while Australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its filmmakers must stop being proud to succeed under limited conditions and set standards high enough to show they respect the kind of talent of actor with whom they work. /> <br /> Too bad. Absolute shame.
