It's schmaltzy, but what more did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella's younger sister, with her wicked mother, sister and brother-in-law. the hero (if you can call him that) is an inefficient putz; and rival love interests are full of melodramatic malice. <br /> <br /> The cast, the sets and the wardrobe were all very attractive, and I thought that the actors were doing a superb job considering the weakness of the material. The film was beautifully filmed and featured a carefully designed soundtrack to indicate to the viewer what emotions he should live. Megon McDonough sang sweetly and provided the film with some of her best moments. <br /> <br /> If you like Danielle Steel, you'll love this movie. If you like archetypal romance, you'll love this movie. I do not have. I was able to sit through, but it was close.
