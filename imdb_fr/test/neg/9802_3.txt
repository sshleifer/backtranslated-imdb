As I had just finished the book, Mrs. Dalloway 'from Virginia Woolf, I was delighted to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend. What I have come across is a boring, incomprehensible, meaningless film. One can not quite blame the film, he did his best with the material he owned, but when the source material is Virginia Woolf, it is almost entirely written in a simple style, with long periods of time. internalization and little dialogue, we could certainly think that there should be no film made from it simply because we can make a film. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave, who embodies the main character, deserves no blame for the failure of this film, nor any of the other actors. It's just a film that could not be intelligently drawn from the story written by Woolfe and should not have even been attempted. Do not watch the movie, read the book. <br /> <br /> --Shelly
