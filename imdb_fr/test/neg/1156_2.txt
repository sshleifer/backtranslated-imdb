I am a big fan of horror movies and know a lot of information about serial killers. Obviously, the director of this one refused to do research on the film that he was creating, because the half of the film was a fiction. More than that, the character of Ed Gein was described in a bad light. I did not rent the movie to worry about the MP and his girlfriend Erica. I rented it to watch Ed Gein and his legendary story. This movie was awful, the only reason I gave it a 2 out of 10 is that the gore was not too bad. Actors = horrible Actors = under by Movie = loss of time. <br /> <br /> A big flat all around, but I will not give up my search for a good horror movie.
