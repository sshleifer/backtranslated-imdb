Interesting concept that does not make it. I watched the whole movie, but I had to read the IMDb comments to understand what Code 46 meant. If / when it was explained in the movie, I had to be in a coma, or maybe brain dead at that time. I only watched it for Tim Robbins. The fact that I did not know any of the other actors should have been a clue. We all have to start somewhere, but this film should not be. Regarding the "virus of empathy virus" - Batman! Where were the Joker, the Riddler, etc.? Also, why are women all so naughty? If I want to see less than plain sticks, I'll just walk down the street. The best part of the movie was the car accident. It was totally believable, and not exaggerated like most movie crashes.
