This film, which likes movies that appeal to intellectual releases and those who simply tell stories, should have been attractive. But as written and directed by Catherine Breillat who seems to play her own riddles in her cinematic experiences, this tedious and talkative film does not arouse any interest. <br /> <br /> The main character Jeanne (Anne Parillaud) is Breillat, a frustrated director in her attempt to film a compelling sex scene with two difficult actors (Gr√©goire Colin is The Actor and Roxane Mesquida is The Actress). The only "comical" element is the imposition by Jeanne of a dildo attached to the actor to allow him to carry out the scene of sex, but even this mess is seen quickly and we are left with a film in a This film feels more like a 'Deleted Scenes' featurette on a DVD than a solid French comedy class.
