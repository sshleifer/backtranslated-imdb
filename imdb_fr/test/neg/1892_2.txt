I'm not picky with movies, oh I saw so much bullshit that I could watch anything. Maybe that was the reason I looked at this one to the end. I'm also a big fan of RPGs, but this movie is a shame for any self-respecting RPGer. The security images of a game seem to make it more realistic than this movie does. The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong. In some scenes, you can see that the film was filmed on a photo when !!!!! (spoilers ahead) !!!!! people who run do not interfere with people sitting near computers. I mean, would you continue your work if you had ninjas around you? oh and jokes about pirates, it's the worst thing in the movies !!!!! (end of the spoilers) !!!!! At least, at first, it felt like a documentary, now it sounds like a personal video experience of someone. You can find better movies on youtube. Top line: Do not waste your time and money on this one, it's as bad as it comes.
