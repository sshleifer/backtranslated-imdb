I just saw Coronado ... The only line they offered to sell it is "FX Team behind Independence Day". I think that says a lot. No question of writers, directors, actors ... <br /> <br /> This is a little story of a cute adventure taking place in a banana republic in central America, but the plot is thin. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I kept thinking about how much this movie looked like the cut scenes of a computer action war game. Although FX are nice, they are too often visible. This is very similar to CG style scenes like Command'n'Conquer. <br /> <br /> You know almost instantly that this truck, this backdrop, this bridge, this castle or this jet fighter has never existed. The look is smooth and nice, but not up to the expectations we expect from Action Adventures today. The film misses a lot of obvious filming on the set. <br /> <br /> The scenario, the scenario is below average and the special effects are nice, but they are not up to the standard of feature film. I'm not surprised that this thing went directly to the video / DVD. <br /> <br />
