As a useful warning to others, I believe that "Skeleton Man" is actually worse than "Raptor Island". I use RI as an example of the worst original movie shown on the Sci-Fi channel, but SM is the most ridiculously incoherent and miserable movie I've ever seen. Yes, I watched almost everything in about 35 minutes. He attracted me with his pure incompetence. What did science fiction think? Once Skeleton Man and the surviving platoon leader (or whatever it was - I'm not good at military unit terminology) arrived at the chemical plant, the film went into an area absurdity impossible almost hypnotizing. I had the same idea as another spectator wondering if more than one film had been put together to make it a terrible set.
