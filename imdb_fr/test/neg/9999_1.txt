When all we have now is rather reality shows with people who ridicule themselves for whatever reason, be it too big, or not knowing how to sing or cook worthy of what I know, Hollywood no has more original ideas. I do not remember a time when something original or intelligent came out on television in the last 15 years. What is our obsession to watch the buttocks ridicule? I would have thought that these types of programs would have been curly, but each year they come up with something new that is stranger than the one before. OK, so the people who work there need to lose weight ... most Americans need to lose weight. I think we all like, to a certain extent, watching people humiliated. Maybe we feel better when we see someone else look like a fool. I do not know, but I just want something smart to appear that does not insult your intelligence.
