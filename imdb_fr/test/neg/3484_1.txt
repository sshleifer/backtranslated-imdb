One of the worst surf movies I have ever seen. This film is so bad that I do not know where to start-- Okay, let's start with the principle: a continent guy who barely knows how to surf goes to Hawaii and participates in a big wave contest that he's Expect more or less to win. A good analogy for those who do not surf would be that of a grossly overweight chain smoker who taps on a pair of running shoes and enters the Los Angeles marathon with the hope of winning. No way! And, the contest takes place on the north coast, which evokes images of waves over 15 feet, but on the day of the contest, the waves may be 6 feet. The game? Which game? If you have to see this frame see it on TV, do not waste your money renting it. If you want to see a good surf film, know that it is defective, but that's another story, rent Big Wednesday.
