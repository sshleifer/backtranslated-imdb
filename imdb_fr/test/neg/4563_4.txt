It's an old black house movie. A young couple slips into a strange mansion that would be led by Satan, where they will collide one by one with a mis-matched crew: a distressed lady, a monkey, a monkey man, a dwarf, various look people, and (for some reason) two Chinese. They end up in a throne room where the hero has to compete in a sort of "Price Is Right" competition consisting of climbing seven steps with seven luminous footprints; hence the title. For my taste it's too much the same thing. The progression in the corridors of the entertainment house is fun for a moment, then becomes repetitive. In comparison with Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy who do the same thing on two rolls, it's not really funny. It's not scary either, and apparently it was not planned: the housework is too absurd. Most movies of this genre combine comedy with a real threat, and usually two - one that the characters are supposed to believe is real, and another for which it is a cover. Here, the blanket should not be taken seriously, nor what is covered. Some fun moments emerge from the mix, but it's rather fun. The novel on which the film is based was a pure thriller and I think it could have been played directly for a better effect - and could still be.
