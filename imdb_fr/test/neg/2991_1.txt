Do not get me wrong: I like house art movies, low budget movies, character studies and foreign films. Unfortunately, I could not take advantage of it - frigid pace, complete lack of intrigue and characters that you can not resist to be hated, but you can not tolerate enough to love. <br /> <br /> For me, Distant, it was like watching the images of a reality TV show on the floor of the cutting room - all the scenes deemed too uninteresting and that would not normally do the job. final cut were the only scenes included. A camera in my apartment with two of my friends hanging out for hours does not make an interesting movie. <br /> <br /> By far, the observer really feels like this - long periods without dialogue (almost 10 minutes before we can get the first word of credits working) (2001 comes to mind) but for me, something more attractive must attract me. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of observer who can watch a movie and just a movie analysis, it may work for you. However, if you prefer to watch movies to relax, expand your mind or have fun, you should probably go elsewhere.
