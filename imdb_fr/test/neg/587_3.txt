Wow, well, do you know those shocking things they use in hospitals for your heart to start beating faster? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It took me almost 4 hours total to watch because I had to pause and restart my brain at a semi-normal feature once in a while. I mean, this movie becomes so ridiculous that to say that the script has about 10 pages of dialogue, it would be generous. They just do not speak !! And while talking, everything is not everything, and I admit that there were scenes where only music was needed, and the music is excellent, it was probably the best part, but then listen to a symphony or something like that and forget the movie. So many people give these great critics, and for his time, I would say that the special effects and the filmography are pretty good, but as far as the acting, or lack thereof, he needed just a little something more , no shootem ups or sex, etc. ., blasphemy is not even necessary, but a little more emotion, these guys were like pebbles, just sitting with long faces. All in all, if you need something to calm you down, just play the movie, do not start early if you've seen it before, start anywhere, lie back and relax, it's okay to fall asleep.
