As a fan of the series I was thinking about, how bad can the movie be? Well, I got my answer. Some movies should never be made. Why call this a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters. The character of Pete in the series was not a little baby like the one described in the movie. The only good thing about this movie besides the music and beauty of Clare Danes is that it was short. What is this dance scene ??? The only reason I did not leave this movie was because it was so bad that it was getting funny. It may have been the plan! It's a shame when a cheap 1960s TV show is better than a 90 million dollar 90s movie. El Mariachi costs only $ 7,000 and is a much better movie. Do not even waste your money when it comes out on cassette, it's not even worth renting.
