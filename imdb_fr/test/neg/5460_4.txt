I was also disappointed by this movie. For starters, the things that happen to him do not seem too bad (sorry male chauvinist poV). As one kidnapper put it so well: "Most men would pay to be in your place". To which he answers "But it is not my choice". OK, OK, good point, so it was really bad? Please let us know. But now, the kicker: He does not tell anyone until after the end of the film (invisible). Not his girlfriend, nor his mentor, nor the police, nor anyone. Instead, he develops the awesome plan of all the girls he knows, so he can recognize the tattoo (or something else) of one of his captors. I thought he had just had enough unpleasant sex during the 12 days of his captivity? Is not it time to take a break? For me, his misguided actions broke the film's "suspension of disbelief". I pulled out a book looking at the last half hour out of the corner of my eye.
