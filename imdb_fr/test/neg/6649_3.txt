Federal agent Frank Poo (Andy Garcia) discovered in a secret database of matched DNA sera that the only person who can save his son's life is a psychopath, played by Michael Keaton. However, when a transfer of serum to the local hospital goes wrong, a certain Mr.Poo must do everything in his power to keep the fool alive to make the inevitable transfer possible. By the way, his name is not really Poo, I just want to call him. In spite of the original concept, it is an action thriller that is implausible and insensibly uninteresting. I have never been a big fan of Andy Garcia, and we admit that his character here is not attachable. the sequences are handled in a disappointing manner and the end is really nil. After doing a big bad guy in Pacific Heights, Keaton's nasty psychopath is disappointing, providing a crazy and charismatic fool to be lamented. Brian Cox is also lost as Garcia's firm and outspoken superior.
