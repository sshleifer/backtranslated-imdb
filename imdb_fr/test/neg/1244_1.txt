What in the world! This gaming cinema would have been adapted to the network for life. Michael Imperoli is a good actor but I think his rendition of "Stu" was disappointing. The montages were unbearable and too numerous. The support cast, where are you? Whoever did the casting should be partly at fault. Cinematography was useless. A game story with a feeling after school. Stories of this kind should be left to Oliver Stone of the world. It would still be nil, but at least it would be fun to watch. It was an attempt that lost its wheels even before the race started. We remember Mario Andretti in 1982 Indy 1982.
