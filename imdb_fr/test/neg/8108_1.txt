No need for spoiler to get rid of this movie ... Well, weird movie. Canada becomes part of the United States. OKAY. So, I guess I'm unusual, but I was expecting Canada to become an integral part of the United States. I'm stupid. Continue with this movie and go to the cloud cloud. The opening principle has nothing to do with the rest of the movie in which you (believe me) do not worry about any character. Slings and Arrows and Due South must be among the most imaginative series of all time. But in this case, I'm really sorry to see that Paul Gross had no idea of ​​the possibility of making a consistent movie and wasted a lot of talented actors in the process. A real disappointment.
