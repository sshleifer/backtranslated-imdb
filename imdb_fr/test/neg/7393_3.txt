Well, they sent it on TV between midnight and 2 am - it seems like a good time to watch it, then go to bed after ... <br /> <br /> No, it was not not really fashionable. to my expectations. I think the Dogma concept is good because the movie gets close to what's really happening between the characters involved when you remove all the unnecessary effects and the music that creates the mood. But again, this concept requires an interesting action between the characters. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I know King Lear very well (the version of Shakespeare). If I had known the play, I would probably have been able to predict much of the movie. <br /> <br /> A crisis can bring out the best and worst characters - and we certainly see some bad ones. Oh yes, the painting of civilization and culture can be very fine and behind this painting you can find an animal. <br /> <br /> If you compare it to "Italiensk for begyndere" (Italian for beginners) or "Mifunes sidste sang" (last song of Mifune), you see the same thing, but the opposite thing: a crisis can certainly get people to see their lives in a more constructive way. And if you dare, you can win. <br /> <br /> Once the film was finished, I said to myself: "Oh, that's why I had not seen it before ...". The film has its own beauty. . The quality of the cameraman's work, actors, etc. is good. But the script might need something more. A conspiracy might not hurt.
