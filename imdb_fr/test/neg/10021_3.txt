I think it would have been a more appropriate title for this film because it is padded back and forth with archive footage of various insects and animals. I recently discovered The Prey in its original "big box" VHS form and was very excited. I love finding old slasher movies on VHS because the cover is fantastic. Usually, it turns out that the movie itself is not fantastic. The Prey is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it all started, OK, the killer stalking the cliches of teenagers in the woods. The pulsating sounds used are an excellent effect that makes you tense when you look. This movie is basically a big shot, and when the Campfire Stories section arrives, the film takes a new direction and devotes nearly half the time of its time to the killer scenario. I actually thought it was an original idea. However, the story ends abruptly and shows us some background images of a forest on fire (the lack of budget is beginning to be felt now). After that, we went back to the stupid teens being kidnapped in the woods. The killer himself is not shown until the end, which is a shame because he is actually an effective killer. A bit like Cropsy from The Burning, but better. As for gore, there is not too much, although there is a good face at the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone except the slasher add-ons - it's really a big mess.
