I saw this at the independent cinema in my city - no surprise, because no traditional theater would want to have its fingerprints on this train wreck. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is very embarrassing. Constant shifting, refocusing, and zooming could make a sensitive person feel motion sick. It's more like a student film project than a serious movie. <br /> <br /> Although played well, the characters are inimitable. Josh is devious, always trying to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. Without any context in Emily and Josh's relationship, she presents herself as a moaning and insecure girl who desperately needs to get married. Rhett is an emotional child, unable to understand the complexities of human interaction. Without any quality, I did not care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> Obviously, some people liked this film, the couple sitting behind me laughed hysterically. Of course, they could have just made fun of it. I could hardly blame them.
