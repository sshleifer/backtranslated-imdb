QUESTION: How does a film deserve two different titles, such as "Librarians" and "Strike Force"? <br /> <br /> ANSWER: The film is so bad that the filmmakers could not even choose a title !!!! <br /> <br /> This film is a mix of martial arts, death wishes, vendodas, melodrama, romances and clich√©s. The story focuses on a group of vigilantes called The Librarians, led by Constable Simon (William Forsythe). The group is looking for an infamous, multilingual and punchy creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff), who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of South Florida. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this film and his scene is totally foreign to the action. Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest draws I have ever heard. It may be Burt's attempt to create an Irish dialect, but the general effect is a kind of perverse imitation of Marlon Brando in "The Godfather". <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak, who has infiltrated the inner circle of the strange world of Marcos, also appears in this film. Erika's character was propelled into an alliance with Simon. Librarians and Erika will become a powerful force to strike harm in a movie that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable converter.
