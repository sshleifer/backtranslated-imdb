Mickey Rourke is currently experiencing a renaissance ... and fair play with him. I have always loved his image and his acting abilities in roles such as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you're going to have with Rourke: naughty, moody, dirty. But this movie gives you a lot more - and you do not want most of it. <br /> <br /> First - it makes no sense. Rourke is a hardened killer of the IRA who, after killing a busload of schoolchildren, fled Ireland to London. He is on the run from the cops and his own comrades in the army. He also promised never to kill again. Looks like the bus filled with kids finally made it for him. <br /> <br /> However, when he arrives in London, he is found by a local gangster (Bates), who looks like his eyebrows and hair torn off. Burton's model) to kill her main competitor in turn for Â£ 50,000 and a boat trip to the United States. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do so but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses to him the crime in front of the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. He thinks it's better than killing him. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things that are simply not happening here: <br /> <br /> 1. Why choose Rourke for your competition? As shown in a scene in which an employee is stuck to a wall by two heavy people with what looks like punches - these guys from London are tough enough to do their own murder. <br /> <br /> 2. In addition, the gangster asks a guy to follow Rourke and witness the murder with his own eyes. Why did not this guy just kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with Rourke? <br /> <br /> 3.Hoskins sees the murder unfolding and the police let him go - unprotected, can I add - to get a confession? No way. <br /> <br /> 4. Rourke drags around the church (right next to where he committed the murder) immediately after the crime to confess. Why do not the cops check the place? <br /> <br /> 5. Rourke hangs around the church and the blind niece of Hoskin in particular, for days without anyone bothering him. What? He is on the run and remains in the same place where he committed another murder? Stupid. <br /> <br /> 6. The cops meet Rourke in the church trying to "fix" the organ and have no idea who he is. Do not they know he's on the run for the bombing of a school bus? They do not even watch him? <br /> <br /> 7. Why ask Rourke to kill for you, then tell him to wait a few days before getting on the boat? You would think that you want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill it. Either? <br /> <br /> 8. Why does Bates's brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the middle of all the queues? Could he not hold back for a few days? At least until Rourke is safe in the United States? Ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 9. After all his years of murder, Rourke suffers intense turmoil and immediately seduces the blind niece - even after she realizes he's a killer, she still loves him ? Again - completely ridiculous. And then - she falls in love with him in record time - a few days !!!! <br /> <br /> 10. The bomb problem in the end is just ridiculous from Bates' point of view. <br /> <br /> 11. Things happen in parts of this movie that simply do not make sense or are simply there to help the script (and I say it jokingly). Bates Rourke's houses in a brothel until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly displays a high moral place to respect the prostitute of the house - while keeping the bed of a blind man. <br /> 12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is - and the henchman launches virtually every movement of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy said a lot more to Rourke than he'd even asked. <br /> <br /> 13. The priest of Hoskin is a former soldier and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. Completely inapplicable and yet another grumpy scene. <br /> <br /> I'm going to stop here at 13:00 unlucky without mentioning Rourke's hair (so falsely red that it's laughable), his accent (which is just not too bad sometimes but breaks down in mumble barely heard at other times), his clothes, his walk, his gaze to the sky, and so on. I will not mention music and unstable editing style either. <br /> <br /> Oooppps - I just mentioned them. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is the disaster of a film containing obvious religious images (Rourke on the Cross, preaching from a pulpit) that would embarrass a student in first-year cinema, without talk about the summit. star and director. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
