This direct video in cheap video is based on a true story. I have no doubt about it. This does not mean that it is particularly interesting (unless you are one of the main characters who really experienced this experience). A young woman named Angela buys a very large country house really cheap. Well, as we all know when we watch horror movies, when you buy a big cheap house, it usually means that it is haunted in one way or another. In fact, the second time the house is entrusted to Angela, the wise boy who lived until then in the house takes a moment to "introduce" Angela to one of the ghosts! Good guy, huh? Angela contacts a psychic and a paranormal expert to tell them that her house is haunted and invites them to come see the ghosts themselves. They come to a party and, of course, there are ghosts walking around, sitting on the couch, hanging in the garage and trying to seduce people in the bathroom. Some friends sleep all night, see the ghosts and make the vow never to return to the house. (Look at the girl who died.) "I'm so scared, I'm so scared." Totally emotionless, if she was so scared, why did not she get up, turn the knob and go ?!) Ghosts do not really make anything threatening outside to show up (and there is no blur or aura about them - they look like ordinary people). They steal celery in the kitchen, move chairs to the POLTERGEIST and a bisexual ghost woman seduces Angela, who does not seem to mind! This scene is played like the kind of soft-core porn you see on the SPICE channel. (Ummm ... not that I know, Hahaha). The actresses are not, however, your typical pornstars. They should go to the beach and the gym more often. When Angela does NOT make love to the dead, she gets angry with them and stays alone in a room shouting, "Why do not you go away ?! This is my house! Get out!" They do not leave. I could not help but think of all the times I saw the seer Sylvia Brown on TV saying that if you had a ghost at home, you should calmly explain why and say, "Look, you're dead It's time to cross the other side - in other words, get out! "According to Sylvia Brown, as long as you're not hostile and mean, they'll leave! This film seems to cost about $ 50. It has a really cheap feel, and bad action. I could have made this movie with 5 friends and a camcorder.
