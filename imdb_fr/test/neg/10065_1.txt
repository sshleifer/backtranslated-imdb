The adventures of Hercules must be one of the most lamentable excuses for a movie I have not yet met. You would have to look far to find anything that is close to the level of inefficiency displayed in this movie. Acting ?? Wrong. Edition ?? Wrong. Direction ?? Wrong. Special effects ?? Bad and laughable. Ground ?? Wrong. Lighting ?? Wrong. Cinematography ?? Wrong. Costume creation ?? Bad and Silly. Everything else ?? Wrong. Watching the adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real test of endurance. This is a program for masochists or completers Lou Ferrigno (if any). <br /> <br /> Eight things I learned while watching The Adventures of Hercules: <br /> 1. If you do not have the budget for true special effects, perform a scene on the rotoscope previous. It will look great - trust me. <br /> <br /> 2. During a quest to recover Zeus's wrath, take the time to make frequent stops to oil your body. It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions. <br /> <br /> 3. Any sword fight, use of magic and almost every other daily activity of ancient Greece creates a sound very similar to a game of Pac Man or asteroids. <br /> <br /> 4. Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed as Star Wars extras. <br /> <br /> 5. If you need to make your shitty movie run longer, extend the title sequence by adding Star Trek-style credits and add excessively grand music. This will also help you if you have a previous movie in which to extract scenes. <br /> <br /> 6. The fight scenes unfold much more slowly if the villains attack Hercules one at a time. <br /> <br /> 7. William Berger did everything for money. <br /> <br /> 8. I did not think it was possible, but The Adventures of Hercules released the first film, Hercules (1983), as an Oscar winner.
