Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. From his novels were shot really wonderful movies ("Away from the raging crowd", "Tess D'Urbervilles", "The Mayor of Casterbridge") and I had high hopes for it. The Hallmark of Halled Fame-ification of "Return of Native People" totally destroyed it. The casting was great, the photography excellent, but the scenario was dark and the direction totally ruinous. People were walking towards people, saying lines, going away. Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones (very young, very beautiful) exchanged a bit of pressing, but even Clive, who is a superb actor, could not save him. He was flooded with Hallmark's usual "romantic" ambient music and claimed that bumps offered a conspiracy show, and what could have been dynamite proved to be horrible. The richness of the three films above was totally absent.
