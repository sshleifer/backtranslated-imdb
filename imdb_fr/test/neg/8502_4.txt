Other critics seem to have held this film in high esteem. I would say congratulations to an eighteen-year-old film student, but that's not the case. If you want to watch a good film about graffiti, stick to documentaries. It is filmed with the same quality as a home digital video. The two main characters are dreary actors and once again, it would be nice if it was a student film. The plot follows a lone artist who skates around Portland writing graffiti. He is joined by another and they skate together to create art. Then comes the useless gay love scene. Then comes the quarrel that has never been discussed, because this film has as many dialogues as an image of Charlie Chaplin. This film shows the seriousness of street artists, and the music is nice, but overall, I would not really call it a movie.
