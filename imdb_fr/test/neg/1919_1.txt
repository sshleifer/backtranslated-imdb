Where to start, where to start ... hmmm ... well, what about the most rigid, abnormal, unbelievable and camped out performance you can imagine? What about stereotyped "characters", situations and places? Or how about a manipulative, disgusting, completely miserable script? I do not see any element of this film that is original, worthy of looking at or interesting. Note to all, fans of Josh Hartnett / Chris Klein / Lee Lee Sobieski - enjoy their collective fifteen minutes, friends, because they will not be famous any longer ...
