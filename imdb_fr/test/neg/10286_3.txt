If you find that the description of abusive murders and unjustified police brutality is expressed in a less filmed scenario with an entertaining icy rhythm, then you are forced to take advantage of Surveillance. This film was a waste for the mind and spirit. The notion that it is a "thriller" is comic; it would involve a kind of tension and twists. You waited for the story to end up "starting". It never goes beyond the glorification of violent criminals with weak minds and individuals from all walks of life. Imagine all the violence of "No Country for Old Men" without any kind of pursuit or sympathetic characters. The thrill killers are unleashed. The acting is good, but the scenario is a stack. Do not bother and tell your friends not to bother you.
