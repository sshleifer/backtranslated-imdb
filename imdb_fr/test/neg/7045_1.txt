Can you believe that a university professor made this movie ????? <br /> <br /> The same man who did DHOOP <br /> <br /> The film is horrible and has some strange scenes <br /> <br /> The main message is good but poorly presented <br> /> <br /> The film looks like a collage of amateur scenes, miscasts.etc and poor performance <br /> <br /> The direction and everything is poor <br /> <br /> The music goes well <br /> <br /> Emraan's band works well and he's doing well Tusshar is bad Tanushree and Isha are bad Paresh's annoying when he's looking at the mirror
