A quick and fun morning that will seduce the underprivileged aldolescents in each of us. It actually works as a vehicle for Justin Long, who then appeared on our screens in the fourth Die Hard via PC commercials against Mac, Dodgeball and The Break Up. He is funny, serious and young - a big career in the future. <br /> <br /> A city worth a lot to its students looking for a fake website that Bartelby (Long) created to trick his critical parents and get off on "college" as it was a Facebook party on short notice. Lewis Black summarizes anarchic philosophy as a substitute Dean - Long's delinquent friends support this subterfuge and its appeal to the great traditions of education and friendship (Adam Herschman deserves special mention for his unexpected contribution) . Well executed, felt good and instantly forgettable. 4/10
