My mother and I rented this movie. I mean, we like this kind of sci-fi movies, whether they're big Hollywood or Indy movies. <br /> <br /> But oh, we were fooled !! Two journalists are investigating a UFO abduction in a small Texas town. Halfway through, all of a sudden, everything becomes christain. My mother and I believe in God and Jesus and the devil, but the way this film preached made it boring. All I have to say is that we are Christians, but even we like to have fun. So, do not blame Christians as a whole, but blame the Christians who must aspire to the fun of this movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, you can clearly understand the position of administrators on UFOs, and that's what he believes everything is demonic. Now, I could say a few words, but I will not do it. All I'm going to say is DO NOT WATCH this movie unless you want to be preached. In fact, it is often said that we must be perfect to enter paradise. Well, the last time I checked, the only perfect person died on a cross.
