I'll tell you, this movie is really boring. It's about a flood, that's it. Blah blamed a little on the family, blah blah blah politics, blah blah blah boring. <br /> <br /> All the blame on the meteorologist, poor turf. Deputy Premier Campbell is a tough guy who expects everyone to be clairvoyant, a very irritating character. <br /> <br /> If you're from the UK or any other flood-prone city, you might like this movie. It's a bit like earthquake movies are most appreciated when earthquakes occur. <br /> <br /> This is not really an action movie, where the weather is the enemy and you must overcome or surpass the letter, it is rather a time bomb that must be deactivated . <br /> <br /> Looking at this film, we understand why the UK thinks that the world is overpopulated, but it is not the case for them. <br /> <br /> Really, the film is as exciting as picking scabs and I can not recommend it. It's over 100 minutes, way too long. <br /> <br /> The problems with the film; I will not go further in this discussion because the film does not deserve such a dissection. A clue for you, Londoners - buy more boats. If you bring children to this movie, they will fall asleep or become boring and uncontrollable demons.
