First of all, I am annoyed by the fact that there is no choice of a "0" out of 10. <br /> <br /> I got bored tonight, and flipping through the channels, I see Dr. Chopper. Since there is nothing else, I decide to watch it, expecting it to be just another shitty horror movie, with a plot similar to Cabin Fever. <br /> <br /> The man was wrong ... Chopper gave the impression that Cabin Fever should have won many Oscars. Let me remind you that Cabin Fever contains a scene of a very hot little boy circling the terrace shouting "pancakes !!", characters who leave their dying friend in a small cabin where he bleeds. to death, and Shawn from Boy Meets. World mistakenly stuffing a hole in a girl's thigh. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, Dr. Chopper was a big stinky heap. It was not even funny shit. It reminded me of a horror movie that I had to shoot in the 8th, called "The Campout". Except that "The Campout" had a better script (we wrote it about an hour before the shoot), better actors, intrigues, bloody scenes and camera work. I was hoping to get some laughs from a bad horror movie, but instead I could only look in amazement as I thought, "Was this done by 8th graders?" ? ". <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, the events and different minor intrigues were assembled and made no sense, and the violence and violence were very minimal. I liked the fact that, following a small knife wound, people died on the spot, and the only weapons available to the killers are small pocket knives ... if you want to make a movie of horror, give at least one senseless murder to the murderer (s). device. <br /> <br /> In addition, what was the interest of the girls of the sorority to amuse their promises? A good way to bring scenes of girls running in their arms, even if they have no relevance to the story. And I have to say that my favorite phrase was when the blonde said to Dr. Chopper, "I'd like to introduce you to someone ... my inner bitch." Her "inner bitch" then takes a trash, throws it on Doctor Chopper, misses it, and then retreats into the killer's terror. <br /> <br /> Wheww ... well, it was long, but I felt the need to express my feelings about the horrible horror of this "movie". I know everyone has their own opinions, but if anyone thinks this movie is over 2, it should be shot in hell ... <br /> <br /> ... seriously.
