There are spoilers but believe me, I do you a favor. <br /> <br /> My friends and I love watching shitty movies from time to time. Inspired by the Mystery Science Theater and our talent for live jokes; We looked for interesting movies to watch that are not worth watching. However, the problem comes to paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them. And I am firmly convinced not to give a penny to such a group of crazy people without talent. So, as another reviewer has said, movies like this one are a reason to legalize the free download of movies. I prefer the idea of; instead of going directly to VIDEO you have directly to INTERNET. In this way, the asses that made this farce will never make a profit. What you unfortunately know they do. They hire a host of actors who can not play, special effects in a high school class, rubber snakes at the dollar store, constant Green Jell-O vomiting and both characters main things that seem to switch between border. Mexicans jumping who speak only Spanish, Arabs perfectly mastering English, random nudity, a guy being shot about 10 times, including one on the side of the head and alive and the most delayed end of the history of the film, the book, drawings of the cave and Hustler magazine. The fact that I predicted that the snake girl jell-o puking would turn into a snake halfway terrifies me ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is a pleasure Make fun, but make sure you're at least 4 and you're joking fast, because if you only have a second to watch this movie without laughing, you'll feel physically sick. I am not joking. My friends and I were eating chicken wings and I can not even look at that kind of thing without recalling that piece of Sh! T. <br /> <br /> This movie is on top of Alien Vs. Hunter, which is by far the second worst movie of all time. And I saw a lot of bad movies. Incidentally, it's the same production company as this movie and this bald guy is also in both. I thought you might like to know this little fun fact. -100 on 0f 10.
