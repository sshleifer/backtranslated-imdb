In the early 2000s, production companies had an ephemeral craze for supernatural genre films in France after "The Crimson Rivers" and "Brotherhood of the Wolf" turned out to be hits, so several movies were on in green or saved from their "live to the video" destiny. However, France, unlike the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy, has little tradition of fantastic B movies and it soon turned out that "Samurai", "Bloody Mallory" or the sequel to " Crimson Rivers "were ill-advised attempts to recreate a kind of magic that had never existed in French cinema. After failing, the producers returned to their usual price: derivative farces or umpteenth self-referential tribute to the new French wave by an old critic of the "Cahiers du cinéma". <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" could only have been lit in green during this short window, since it serves no purpose. This is your slasher movie by-the-book, mixed with vague mythological elements and horror references. You'll find female characters bimboesque, a French university resembling an American campus and twists so complicated that you do not care because you guessed it. yourself an hour before, even before the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> These elements make the fun of a 70s or 80s movie B and you expect them in a movie of the 70s or 80s. However, we are no longer in the 80s and nobody warned director Doug Headline, this tribute to the genre of slasher film is nothing more than a derivative slasher movie. Headline himself is not a rookie and has been writing reviews on this type of photos since the early 80's, but as a director for the first time, he's showing a lack of talent and ambition that makes "Brocéliande" boring. <br /> <br /> When you put together clichés from a sub-category of films and hand them over to a skilful and inventive director like Wes Craven or Quentin Tarantino, you get a "Scream" or "Death" Proof ", movies that are imitations of old guilty pleasures but also magnify these shots and add a lot. This is called "talent" and that's why you can not confuse these recent movies with their original inspirations shot decades ago. <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" takes the path of laziness and reproduces only the worst elements of past films (unfortunately for the viewer, free nudity is mostly lacking). There are very strong (presumably unintended) similarities between the plot of "Broceliande" and the insulting "Halloween 3: Season of the Witch", both dealing with supernatural perverse rituals and a foolish attempt to conquer the world the Halloween night. Even if the plot of "Halloween 3" has more meaning than this, it means something that really was wrong with "Brocéliande".
