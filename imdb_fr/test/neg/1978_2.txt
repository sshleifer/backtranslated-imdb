Nice visuals and lots of fights do not make a good movie. And that's exactly what happened here. <br /> <br /> First, admit me, I have not played the FFVII yet (I plan to order it soon). However, I did some research to familiarize myself with the characters and the story. However, not everyone has the time to do research in this area, and Advent Children asks that knowledge of FFVII be required. <br /> <br /> Despite incredible graphics, I can not say there are too many things New. We saw it in Final Fantasy: The Spirits of the Interior and, apart from a better movement, I can not say that they did a lot of super-dared things with that. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes - Well, they are a little fun. Yet how could we ever doubt the outcome of any of them? This one was boringly classic: there were three fights with the bad guys, according to the usual procedure (the hero, Cloud, is crushed, then he gets there almost, he is crushed and finally wins). The reason I said it was boringly classic is that it is very used, but in this case, it is poorly executed. I will address this issue later. <br /> <br /> The English dub seemed good to me, even if I did not watch it in Japanese, so I will not judge the Japanese dubbing, but only the one in English. I will say this - I have heard many others, even in my limited repertoire. <br /> <br /> And now, the plot. Ummm ... what plot? Let's be frank: this film is only a service for fans, a chance to see the characters of FFVII on the big screen with a nice feast for the eyes. As I said earlier, the fighting seems to be going on for no reason. The opening fight is never explained, Kadaj seems to have no ambition to destroy the world itself or a real motivation to do something nasty. Cloud remains besieged throughout the movie, and virtually everyone receives a mandatory cameo. <br /> <br /> Really, FFVII was an ensemble piece. Advent Children is anything but. If they had managed to give everyone an important role in history (Star Trek: First Contact proved it was possible, I might add), it could have been much better. Of course, that would have also changed the plot, which, let's be honest, should be almost better than the one we had. <br /> <br /> The characters were also generally either unused or almost forgotten. The members of Avalanche (this is the group that Cloud worked with in FFVII, for those who do not know) get 2 scenes (3 in the case of Vincent Valentine and some have even less). Damn, the villains have more replicas than these guys, and it's very bad. <br /> <br /> The music ... well, I do not care if Nobuo Uematsu is God himself, he missed this movie bad weather. Advent One Winged Angel was the only decent piece. Otherwise, he could not decide whether he should be epic (and orchestral) or fun (with an electric guitar). When he went from one to the other, you felt as if he had knocked you out of a hammer. <br /> <br /> And the last point about whether this movie was epic or fun ... to be both, and failed miserably. Honestly, you can not please everyone and do everything. The movie also tried to be deep (you can go epic and deep, or fun and deep, but the three is too much), but failed here too. The last scene, reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony, was screened for what looks like this. You do not have to be a Christian to shake your head and cry. This scene was just not part of the movie (and Freith's frequent appearances - she's dead, Jim!). <br /> <br /> Given how fantastic I was to hear Final Fantasy VII, this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment. Because of the beautiful visuals, I give it a 2 out of 10.
