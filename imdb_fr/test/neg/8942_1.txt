Oh my God, I'm lost. I know now that everything this guy does is useless. R JA wrote on August 13, 2006 (posting # 881): What a terrible experience. It looked like a group of Grade 3 students who stole a video camera, borrowed old 1995 editing software and made a joke.

It was a group of friends having fun and filming each other. The scenario was very difficult to follow. Attempted shooting by artistic camera angles has harmed history and turned into a dizzying experience. The comic game was very amateurish. The concept is OK, I guess. Next time, producers may need to raise capital, hire real professionals and try again. I must say that I'm fed up with so many people think it's easy to make a good movie. It's not easy ... This fact seems to be lost or ignored by many who believe that without training, experience and talent, they can not make a good product. I guess in the end they will learn how hard it is, I'm so disgusted that I have no comment. Chrisite wrote on August 5, 2006 (posting # 762):
