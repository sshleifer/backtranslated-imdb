Do not see this movie. In most cases, such as Ju-On and The Grudge, the Japanese movie is infinitely better than the American remake. However, this movie was terrible. Ghosts look a lot like a trick or a caterer dressed in ghost cloth that groans and breathes whistling in an effort to scare away in the absence of good makeup or special effects and the acting is simply awful. The story itself is incoherent and confusing, not everything is explained, leaving the film deteriorating. Do not waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it and I'm sure there's more to do, like watching the paint dry.
