I have watched a number of Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme movies lately and I really liked them. <br /> <br /> This SRE movie seemed a lot lighter than any other I've seen. It may be because it's a comedy / horror movie rather than outright horror, and maybe because the humor did not register me very well. <br /> <br /> It lasts a little less than seventy minutes and the credits start with the last ten minutes. There are tournaments, goofs and backstage going on as the credits run. <br /> <br /> SRE films tend to be short and tend to feel inflated anyway. This is no exception, with some scenes that last too long. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a poor boy from Christmastown, California, who was harassed by all his classmates. He had stolen a shoe and, unable to replace it, he was nicknamed "Oneshoe McGroo". Because of his obsession with pirates, his parents gave him a headband for Christmas with a Christmas tree wearing the headband. <br /> <br /> Many classmates are killed and the few who remain gather to make a decision. McGroo chooses them one by one, which resonates with the sound of sled bells. <br /> <br /> The characters are almost all widespread stereotypes, like the nerd named Dorkus, etc. scene in which a perverted couple has sex; the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded, the man carries a large slice of paper watermelon on his head. It reminded me of some strange sex scenes from the director Rinse Dream. <br /> <br /> The quality of the photo is good and the extras are numerous. But basically, a pretty stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I guess you can never have too many Christmas horror movies. Still, there are many other holidays in need.
