What a waste of a large distribution. I thought I'd go for a ride because it sounded like a good comedy to stoner with a lot of well-known actors. It turned out to be a useless collection of endless and boring stories about several characters with minimal links between them. Characters who begin to look honest but do not end up with a nice or interesting feature among them. To call it a comic was also a stretch ... the only thing that made me laugh was the song of Jack Black, who was essentially Tenacious D. I waited for something big to happen, but I did not I finally lost only 97 minutes of my lost life. .
