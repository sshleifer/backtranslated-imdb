So many people took pictures of Peloton and Born On on July 4, calling them, among other things, a "leftist propaganda film". Now it's my turn to take a political shot in a movie. For me, this film is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political opinions. <br /> <br /> The acting and the writing have been a little cliché for my taste. Mel Gibson seems to like playing in these useless violent movies and proves it again by teaming up with his partner Randall Wallace for another. Throughout this film, there was this typical garbage prototype "Just tell my family that I love them" or "Tell Ronny to pray before hoe goes to bed". The trash lines were so overloaded that I felt like I had to throw up. How about that scene where Gibson's wife was going to do her laundry and that "no color" applies to what to put in the washing machine. In the mid-sixties, she was stuck under a rock without realizing the racism that surrounded her. Another scene is where Gibson's daughter asks what the war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter. <br /> <br /> The staging shows all of this perfectly. The innumerable scenes of Gibson and his family or his soldiers in prayer. It suits me to show it once or twice, but after a while, I wonder if the film is trying to put something in my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its hour of glory were shot with melodramatic music. The director also gives the impression that we have won a victory in Vietnam. What was won exactly? Cinematography was the worst with the slow motion scenes seeing the American flag in distant scenes spread all the way through. I love America, but movies like this one seem to glorify every little thing we do. <br /> <br /> It may sound like a rant and it may be, but I can not stand it when a film like this makes non-religious people not so patriotic they will agree with everything their country looks bad. This film is for me narrow-minded and limited in many ways. For me, this means that if you are not a Christian, you are wrong. Would God or Jesus want people to kill, I do not think so. For me, this film was offensive. At first, this movie was funny with countless clichés and exaggerated scenes, but then, when I watched what this movie was trying to say or not to say, it was really frustrating to watch. I guess it's my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope nobody takes this comment on the offensive because I do not criticize religion or patriotism, but some of the narrow-minded people who both love both and neglect everyone. <br /> <br /> If you want a true representation of Vietnam War Watch Platoon, born July 4th, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or The Killing Fields. Even Full Metal Jacket, which I absolutely hated, was a better performance. I read a quote that, in its context, says that a true patriot does not go with everything the government or the country does, but questions it when it is wrong. A true patriot loves his country too much to see him do bad things.
