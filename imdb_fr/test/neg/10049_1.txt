What if someone made a horror movie completely devoid of intrigue? <br /> <br /> Well, I think it would probably end up looking a little like this one. I do not think I've ever seen a movement as stable as slipping his hackney (at first) to his shit (at the end). I just kept it, because I thought it could not get worse. Until the end, "Necrophage" / "Cemetery of Horror" proved me the opposite. <br /> <br /> Who would have suspected that a film with a dead-lizard man, cultists devouring the grave, and mad scientists thrown for no discernible reason could they aspire to this point? One would think that there would be at least a value of humor ... but not here.
