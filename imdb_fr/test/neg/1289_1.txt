If you plan to rent (hopefully not buy) this movie, think again. It was like Gary Busey had a rifle on his head and was forced to act or die. I'm just wondering if Busey was arrested for something and condemned to play in this movie because I do not see the guy who played so much better with Keanu Reeves in Point Break in this disaster. It was a wellness film, but there are thousands of other movies of well-being that make you laugh without asking you to get your money back. The only reason I would ever tell someone to rent this movie is to watch this movie is to see Gary Busey jump up and down like a monkey. If you want a good funny movie, skip Quigley and rent Spongebob or something.
