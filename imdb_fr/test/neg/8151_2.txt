Gave him two stars because the DVD sleeve allowed me to buy this horse manure. I paid a dollar to the local DVD exchange and I want to get my money back. I have some good movies (at least I think they are good) that have never seen inside a video store. After seeing this, I'm really insulted by that. Light years worse than anything I've ever seen, I can not even recommend it as a campy joke movie. It's so bad that instead of making you laugh, it makes you angry. How did this horrible movie find a kind of distribution? I can only believe that it has been self-distributed, as suggested by the amateur DVD writer. For producers of this "film", get out of business, it is obvious that you have no talent.
