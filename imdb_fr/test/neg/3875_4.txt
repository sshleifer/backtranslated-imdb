"Return of the Seven" contains some good action scenes and Elmer Bernstein's score is still catchy. Nevertheless, it's a boring film because it just does not get us involved emotionally. The absence of Mcqueen makes really bad impression, and the fact that his character here is played by a different actor (little known) is strange - in a bad way. The characters are not developed, so we do not communicate with them - and we do not care when some people die. This suite is a passable but mediocre imitation of the original.
