Mystery at a low budget. A shot is coming out of the darkness and we see a woman running in that direction. A young architect Jimmy McMillan (Chick Chandler) discovers a corpse that has disappeared. The hurried woman, Mary (June Clyde), is related to the scene of death; but it is McMillan who must try to solve the case to avoid serious suspicion. The suspects are six merchants located near the crime scene. All the atmosphere of Black Film; but not quite the real thing. This film must be enough to constitute a decent mystery / drama at low budget and is a nice little escape. Other players include George Meeker, Michael Raffetto, Milton Wallace and Rebel Randall.
