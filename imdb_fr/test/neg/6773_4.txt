I mostly watched this one to see Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel, two of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The plot has many twists - it's not a mystery aboard a train. <BR /> <br /> But why throw a wreck of a circus train and a fleeing gorilla? I can mention it without it being a "spoiler", because the wreck of the circus train and the gorilla have nothing to do with the complex intrigue of the mystery. <br /> <br /> The wrong person trying to kill the right people has many traps on his sleeve, but the wreck of the circus train was purely coincidental. This allows a single scene with a threatening gorilla, but let's get back to the mystery of murder!
