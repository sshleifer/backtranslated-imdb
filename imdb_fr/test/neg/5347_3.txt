Chip Foose is an absolute genius and the end result of these projects is truly amazing. The co-hosts are doing a good job. I particularly enjoy watching the "project" come together. The end results are much better than when they left the assembly line with the mechanical and cosmetic progress of today. However, I am a little annoyed by the fact that "projects" seem to be the property of those who are already rich and / or famous. It is unfortunate that those who have been revised can afford to do so. Let's see now, Vince Neill of Motley Crew has a car repaired for his friend. Hi! If he (Neill) was a real friend, he would have paid to have his friend's car restored. What joke! Another episode shows an apparently wealthy middle-aged girl preparing her 1956 shopping cart, Betsy. The husband over 30 was behind all that. The couple seemed not to run out of money. Too bad. I guess the lunch bucket guys like me will have to save for the day that will never come. I own a Ford '53 project chip. Will someone pick me up?
