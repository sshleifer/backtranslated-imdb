Okay, I read the director's commentary on this film (presented as the "first comment"), and I must admit that I can identify with his post. <br /> <br /> Micheal, I hope your career will recover. particular recession and you have moved on to other, better things. I saw this movie as MST3K. Even with all the choppy continuity and drooling remarks made by the robots, I saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to break free of the limited budget and the limited number of actors at its disposal. And it's one of those movies ("Mitchell" is another one) where the MST3K team took a lot of low shots at the character herself while deserving better. You know that they had fun unfairly at the expense of the actress because it gave rise to a more vivid episode. <br /> <br /> IMO, the fact that the movie really tried to be something, and had some decent and effective moments. here and there, keep it away from the "Bottom 100" ("Tangents / Time Chasers" is another film with a plot and a heart that does not deserve to be there either). <br /> <br /> But it's still not a very good movie. I do not blame the main writer / actress for being who she is. It's just that his acting and writing skills need a few more years to mature before you can do a vanity project like this or make a feature film. Writing and characterization are amateur and slapdash, and the dialogue is often barely up to ABC Afterschool Special standards. The actors sincerely do their best, and the acting in general is clearly superior to abortions such as "Future War" or "Space Mutiny", but there is no truly professional performance here, with the exception of 'Big Joe' Estevez, which is solid but of a suitable intensity. I have never seen the entirety of the original version, but the sampling of "Soultaker" by MST was sufficiently representative to make these facts clear. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the film contains Robert Z'Dar. That is to say, IMO, a real "Kiss Of Death" for any film that hopes to be taken seriously. Yes, he's fat and scary looking for his role, but I hate the guy as an actor. (In real life, I wish him good luck and hope he is comfortable financially.) <br /> <br /> There are few things I liked in the movie. For example, the camaraderie between the male lead and her dead friend added warmth and humor to the film and made it much more watchable. The idea of ​​an elevator in the afterlife hospital was an inspiring way to conjure spooky waves without looking for special effects, and I respected everyone who incorporated that into the script for try to keep the budget manageable. It did not really work, but it might take a little more tweaking. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mr. Rissi, a better chance with your other projects - your involvement in this failure would not keep me from looking at something else you did if the "buzz" was good. And Mrs. Miller does not have to blush - she was young and ambitious, and the movie was NOT SO bad.
