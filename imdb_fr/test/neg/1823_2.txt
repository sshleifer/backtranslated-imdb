Simply miserable vehicle Lana Turner-Ezio Pinza. Pinza had a beautiful voice but he rarely uses it in a movie that reminds me of "The Student Prince" with adults. Pinza is not a prominent man either. He looks like an old man ready to collect social security and go fishing. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely thin and the secondary actors Barry Sullivan, Marjorie Maine and Debbie Reynolds have little to do. Sir Cedric Hardwicke intervenes at the end to announce that our King Ezio would be interested in returning to his people. As far as I'm concerned, the sooner the better. Does Lana Turner really sing with Pinza? Not bad if it's her. The photo also reminds me of the 1960 film "The Prince and the Dancer" with Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier.
