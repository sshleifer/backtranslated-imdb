It became clear in the first 25 minutes of watching this that the writers really wanted to make a feature film and they certainly enjoyed the process as a whole, but then seemed to forget the fact that they needed a decent plot! If the best they could do was get some of the blandest characters into the real world and have "all sorts of fun capers", then they would have had to stay alone! I did not laugh once, and everything that happened in the midst of Baron Munchausen / Time Bandits' adventures was very, very poor! Converged, artificial and very loose. It just sounded like a whistle for anything that they thought could "work" just to drag it to an item. <br /> <br /> Full of holes, for example - Royston Vasey's characters needed writers to keep writing In order to save them, Jeff nevertheless managed to write himself in the sub-story filled with time , William and Mary and his time. If he could do that, then why did not they keep writing Royston themselves? And the hearing of Mr. Lipp? What was it for? I mean what was the purpose? He did it, and we heard nothing else about it? <br /> <br /> The important thing is that even though I liked the series, it was a poorly conceived and apparently hasty project. In other words, the plot was so mediocre that if we did not already know the characters (and as a fan, I had to keep a certain loyalty to watch) and we relied solely on the story itself even, it would have fallen flat on his face! At best, it would have gone straight to the video and, at worst, it would never have been done! Or maybe it should be the other way around? Really terrible ....
