As I said, sometimes a small budget is good. You get to see a good movie without a lot of extra BS that can hide shit elsewhere. Well ... it was that piece of shit. If anything, I thought there was humor, unfortunately the humor was not intentional. Bill Smith was the only half-witted actor and his role was cut (it's a joke). There has never been a Bill Smith, and no one has been allowed to act. Even Gerald Okamura was nil, and he played in almost 40 films. The fight scenes were comical and made me feel like I could hit all their $% # @ # $. The sound was horrible, as if all the sound was recorded on the set. My 10-year-old could have written a better script ... By the way, my 10-year-old fell asleep ... no kidding. I give a B + editing to cut the film only 90 minutes ... 60 minutes would have been an A +.
