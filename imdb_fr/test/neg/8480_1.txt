This movie was not necessary. The original, although hated by some, was something that I found really entertaining, mainly because it was before Jim Carrey really started to lose his hand, and Cameron Diaz was, well, "Smoooooookin! " 'Nuff said. So, why do a suite / prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey would not do it, it should have been a sufficient idea that he did not deserve to be created. But then they just make mistake after mistake. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this man still allowed to breathe? Writing and history: terrible. Why would I ever want to see a baby wearing a mask? Besides, why would I want to see him fly? Already? How did anyone think it was a good idea ?! The acting game is despicable, in fact almost everything in this movie is. I'm trying to stay calm, or IMDb will probably not let me post this. Bottom line: do not look at this trash. Take the original, look what Cameron Diaz looks like and how Jim Carrey had a career, and laugh. Do not waste a second of your time on this.
