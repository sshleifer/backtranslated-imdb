If you take all the elements of a Shrek movie (grumpy ogre, pesky donkey, cute cat, compulsory dance number, etc.), put them in a blender and summarize it at 20 minutes, you will have this mess. Painful to watch; I may have laughed once. History and dialogue go beyond understanding, the actors of the voice sounding as if they had phoned in their lines. The final rendition of the poem "The Christmas Story" seems to have been written by a committee in five minutes. And little boy, a little Eddie Murphy goes a long way. With his desperate attempt to be trendy and trendy, this show will be long gone and forgotten while classics like "The Grinch ??" will remain timeless. Sad waste of effort on the part of all, true "shark jump" for the Shrek franchise.
