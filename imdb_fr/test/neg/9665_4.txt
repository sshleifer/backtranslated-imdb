We chose this as part of a Brentwood set, titled "The Broken Skull". Shot directly on a video, with a very variable sound and lighting quality, this film ends with an overactive quality that can inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in the way of an "Evil Dead". Without going into trouble, what at first glance seems to be a simple ghost ghost story becomes more and more complicated and bizarre. Although there are some interesting ideas here, the general effect will probably leave you shaking your head and saying "hunh?" <br /> <br /> It's a very very bloody movie. The gore effects range from completely bloody heads to the ridiculous effects of Video Toaster that must be frozen to be (un) raw. The level of coarse effects "Fangoria" in this film is really amazing and should appeal to greyhounds while giving those with a weak constitution the feeling of being a little nauseous. <br /> <br /> The Broken Skull is also an extremely noisy movie. It includes not only ambient noise (picked up by microphones and not replaced by mail), but also screams. No, no, I mean MUCH. A lot a lot! The characters scream, scream, howl and scream, shake and laugh maniacally. Turn down the volume if you appreciate your eardrums and nerves! But you can not blame the cast for its enthusiasm, they really devour the landscape and the effect is sometimes quite entertaining. In particular, the actress playing a certain Vietnamese immigrant delivers all the above with remarkable enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> In fact, very few actors were in wood. Some of them may have done too much (oh, just a little bit!), But most of them are certainly fun to watch. The cast is ethnically diverse and bravo to the filmmakers for that. The two middle-aged white women, however, are two of the meanest and most exasperated characters since the MST3k classic's "The Brute Man" trader. Just watch them see all the other characters, it's fun! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the skull can not become a horror icon in the same way as Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger (or even the Leprechaun), but we can really say that ... c was a movie.
