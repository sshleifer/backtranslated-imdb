In general, I do not make negative comments here. But since this is a festival play, I do not want you to waste your time seeing something else that might not play again. <br /> <br /> I thought the actors were pretty bad. For example, they absolutely did not play, they rather waited to RECIT their lines that were poor enough to start. The dialogue seemed really forced. Norman or whatever his name has tried, or at least it seems to be, witty and biting in the replicas he has chosen but which has just fallen to the ground. <br /> <br /> After words, he asked if anyone saw the end coming and some people were all "yes", and he almost all called the liars. Look, there were so many clues, the most important being a briefcase filled with money for a fucking $ 500 an hour. I mean, the client gave him at least 20g of ... Now, no, you could not see exactly what was going to happen, but by the time the twisting actually happened, I did not did not even care. I was just happy to get out of there. I asked him what project he had fired and he said 8.1, maybe next time he will wait until 15.3, because it takes a lot of work. <br /> <br /> But he seemed to be a rather nice guy, he's making his own movies, he'll probably be better and I hope he'll do it, not arrogantly either, I think, I wish him good luck. Just remember, this is just my opinion.
