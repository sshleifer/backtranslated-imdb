Scarecrow Gone Wild begins as high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) and his classmates decide to give a "hazing" to wimpish Sam (Caleb Roehrig), diabetic, as initiation. Mike and his friend decide to take Sam to a cornfield, tie him to a cross next to a weird scarecrow and leave him there all night, sounds funny, does not it? Well, things turn against Sam when he falls into a diabetic coma after a hypo & Sam's vengeful spirit goes into the scarecrow that comes alive and begins to track down the kids responsible for Sam's sad situation that puts his life in danger. Can Sam's best friend, Jack (Matthew Linhardt), and his girlfriend Beth (Samantha Aisling) save Sam's life and life? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian Katkin Scarecrow Gone Wild is the third video entry in the Scarecrow series & Although I've never seen one of the two previous ones after seeing Scarecrow Gone Wild, I I am certainly not in a hurry to change this situation, that's for sure. The scenario is actually a pretty decent premise, because Sam's aggrieved soul is seeking revenge and his friends have to keep the real Sam alive, but the way he is told is mediocre and I guess it's basically without relationship with the fact that it is a film about a deadly scarecrow that kills people in a way that is not very gory or imaginative. That said, there are one or two scenes here that save a star's ranking, the pie gag in the cornfield is funny and one thing that a lot of immature guys could do (like me), the moment two guys bury their mate in the sand and then lean over him and pee on him, it's also quite funny in a juvenile and cool way when a guy starts singing a horrible song, so the scarecrow throws a pole that 'impaled! However, these excerpts are rare and all in all, it's a stupid, boring and poorly written teenage slasher movie with very annoying characters that irritate. It's also very predictable and ends with a stupid twist that does not really present the scarecrow, which is a problem because when you watch a movie called Scarecrow Gone Wild, you expect to see a scarecrow go wild and I must admit he looks really cool as a horror character. <br /> <br /> The director Katkin is doing a reasonable job here, although it is ultimately with this hospital at the end and all this neon lighting everywhere and the fact that there is only only one patient there & two staff members? The cinematography is much better than the usual low-budget horror film, right and video, and the lighting is nice, although totally unrealistic. The film does not contain any real fear or tension and some of the medical terminology used is a little uncertain to say the least and I say that as an insulin-dependent diabetic. There is not much gore here, there are some scenes where an actor has false guts placed on the belly to represent them eviscerated, but it looks rather fake, there is also a burned face and some impalement but a little more. If it suits you, there are a lot of bare breasts of naked women. <br /> <br /> Technically, Scarecrow Gone Wild is pretty good considering the low-budget abominations I've encountered recently, unfortunately the movie is still mediocre. global. The least said about the game of the best. <br /> <br /> Scarecrow Gone Wild is not as bad as some of the horror horrors directly to the video that was recently, but after saying that it's not so much better And that's when even a bad movie when all is said. Not recommended, the two previous entries are Scarecrow (2002) and Scarecrow Slayer (2003), which are also passed directly to the video.
