... Or even better, watch Fandango if you want to see a really smart and fun movie. Rolling Kansas looked promising (in fact, the program guide gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars, which usually means it's pretty observable), but I moved it quite fast. Usually, travel movies have good music, but I do not even remember if there was music. The only highlight was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old hitchhiker / guru. Otherwise, jokes and timing were missing throughout the course. The four main characters are unknown actors and I do not remember having seen them in another film. (Oh, yes, I see that Thos, Hayden Church was there, but he is in everything, good, bad or indifferent). This movie is about as funny as watching someone get screwed when you're not.
