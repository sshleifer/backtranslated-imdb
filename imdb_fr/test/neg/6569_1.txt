Leonard Nimoy did Star Trek III, which was not bad at all. Maybe William Shatner thought Nimoy had managed to do it. After seeing this film, he should have reconsidered his decision. <br /> <br /> Star Trek V The last frontier is the worst of the series. Actors from all parties involved, including those like Shatner and Nimoy, are bad, washed and look as old as they look in real life, the special effects are sticky, like when Spock has to save Kirk from a jet pack when he falls down a mountain. <br /> <br /> The attempts at humor were pitiful and the story is so horrible that it can not stand to think of what essentially implies that a Vulcan steals the Company to find a god (seriously) care about everything about this movie and oh not to mention Uhura doing a belly dance to distract the male guards. It looked like she was participating in a granny contest. If they wanted to make her sexy. They were wrong. She looked grotesque. <br /> <br /> How did this happen to production or even writing ... well, do not think about it. The only good place for this movie is in the trash. The worst of the series.
