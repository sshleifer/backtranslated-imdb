The success of Anna Kokkinos with "Head On" begins to give the impression that it totally depends on the scenario and the excellent performance of Alex Dimitriades. The extent to which the latter, "The Book of Revelation" is at once derivative, pretentious and completely unoriginal (with the exception of Tristan Milani's superb cinematography) seems to confirm this. . <br /> <br /> Alas, there have been quite a few Australian films dealing with such themes, some avenged for "sexism" (and / or explicit sex scenes) in the 1970s and 1980s and and maybe they are interesting to watch again after this piece of down. Of course, placing everything in the world of ballet and slowing it down terribly (and in its choreography, as an experimental issue of the Dutch ballet of the 1960s) suggests the Great Art if you have not traveled much, and only if you Art Theory 101. <br /> <br /> Add to that a frightfully vaulted dialogue ("you will do as we ask you ...") and all the shebang falls on her well-financed face. Then there are the "sexy" scenes: straight from Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Given the beautiful but truncated performance of Colin Friels - how about a real urban primitive thriller? <br /> <br /> All-inclusive with the book of Revelation, the feminist project has been carried forward from decade to decade - and with the will and deep imitation (of male writers like Henry Miller, William Burroughs, or even Bukowski) to collaborate with a collective in Melbourne, Oz, suffering from a form of educational and ideological amnesia! No revelation awaits us here.
