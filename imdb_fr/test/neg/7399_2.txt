Although their bright colors are exceptionally colorful for a second series of adventures, brightly colored women fail to bring the flat-scripted story to life. The "conspiracy" is about young people recently released on parole who try to get straight to the point but are pursued by a former avenging man from Pinkerton (a Fred Clark chewing scene) and a femme fatale determined to involve them in his work. bank robbery schemes, whether they want it or not. or not. As Cole Younger, Wayne Morris is quite tall and powerful, but his "cool" demeanor and his acting skills undermine things. The standard of action is, frankly, nothing better than an episode of Gene Autry or Roy Rogers TV with Colt .45 that never needs reload skills or strange shooting techniques that allow a rider to shoot hip and wound a man at least 50 feet. ..Oh dear...
