Another example that we should avoid trying to do spectacular action movies in Sweden, it does not work, except for Widerberg which has still not been surpassed by MANNEN PÃ… TAKET. Stormare is doing his best, I suppose, and some scenes are relatively effective, but the plot is full of holes. Why does Hamilton continue to attack the base, knowing that his wife is being held hostage? It was fun to see Mark Hamill, but his game of Bad Guy was very underwritten. I am always amazed that relatively large Swedish films like this one are made without a sensible and functional script. 1 out of 5
