Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as "Zombies") is a rare pearl ?? a film that promises one thing but gives another. This is one of the few genre-based films from Millennium Pictures, a European film studio known for producing many B-level action movies and thrillers, some featuring star Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> Karen Tunny and her two daughters, Sarah and Emma, ​​arrive in the town of Addytown, Pennsylvania, to move into a large house that Karen's late husband owned after discovering the act of a minor. Once arrived, they find that the house is very old and needs repairs. But the condition of the house is the least of their problems, as they discover that the area is prone to disappearances and that Karen is facing the owner of the area and ordered to leave. Once night falls, the Tunnys discover the reason for the disappearances: a group of zombie children, killed in the collapse of a mine in the region more than 85 years ago, came to kill everything that happened. go in the woods. With the help of a gray-haired neighbor, Karen tries to stop the curse before her children and herself become the next victims. I bought the DVD, waiting for a movie with zombies eating flesh, but I was disappointed by this movie. one thing: the movie is more like a ghost story than your usual zombie movie, dead children being the incarnation of a curse that haunts the woods, taking revenge on anything that moves at night (though the imperfect internal logic - children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals and are thrown by the blood on doors in the same way that vampires are repelled by garlic and mirrors - these children are they not supposed to be zombies?). The plot as such would not be a problem and would be really entertaining, but the main problem is that the producers adapted a scenario with the intention of making a movie of zombies, and then fall flat on this effort. <br /> <br /> As such, a film like this could be considered a ghost story but, because of a poor storyline, it is nothing more than a routine effort . The greatest strength of the film is the acting, the distribution offering better performance than the film deserves. The Taylor-Compton Scout, who plays his role well ?? it's a shame that she spoils her genre credit with a very bad performance in the HALLOWEEN remake (or maybe it's just Rob Zombie's script).
