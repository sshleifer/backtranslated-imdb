"Paranormal State" is an interesting sight for most paranormal believers. I like to watch what the "team" has to say and what they "found", but I know that the whole series and its editing and its scenario are completely configured. They go to real haunted places and I suspect they are talking to real witnesses. When I watch this film, I often feel that I'm not watching fiction, but a film that contradicts reality. Personally, I would not advise or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic fear researcher. <br /> <br /> Interesting show. Stick to "ghost hunters"
