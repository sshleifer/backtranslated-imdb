To be honest, I have never read one of the comics and I absolutely do not remember parts 2 and 3. I can compare to the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this one is really disappointing, compared in Part 1 and most of the other films I've watched in recent weeks. The first few minutes seem to be just a useless clone of the movie's first intro and then it gets even worse. There are some good (funny) scenes, but all in all, it's just another boring essay from the German film industry that can not succeed (almost as usual). A good thing: the film is quite short (75 min.) The bad thing: it only contains stories and jokes for 45 minutes;) -> Do not look at it
