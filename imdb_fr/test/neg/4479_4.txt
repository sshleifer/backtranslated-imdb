The only romantic thing in this movie is the pain and anguish of romance. If you expect this film adaptation of another novel by Nicholas Sparks to follow the infallible formula of previous films, such as "Message in a Bottle", "Nights at Rodanthe" and "A Walk to Remember", think again. you. Nobody dies of an accident trying to save someone and the romance here does not transform these characters. This makes them even more miserable than they were. <br /> <br /> John Tyree (Channing Tatum of "GI Joe"), Sergeant of the Special Forces Army, has a soft voice, he spent two memorable weeks at Army leave with a student impressionable, Savannah Curtis (the radiant Amanda Seyfriend of "Mamma Mia"), who spends the spring holidays in South Carolina. Savannah does not drink, does not smoke, but she tells John that her head is full of profanity. Inevitably, John and Savannah fall madly in love with each other and launch countless letters of exchange of love letters that bring sleep to any point of view. Tyree is in the world serving the military in a remote corner of the world while she is in college looking through her letters in class. At a time when they are getting hot and heavy, suicidal terrorists crush planes in the World Trade Center. John and his friends are once again in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with Savannah. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, another guy, Tim, a very hairy but friendly family friend of the Tim family (Henry Thomas of "ET: The Extra-Terrestrial") who has a child with autism without a mother named Alan, becomes the object of Savannah's feeling. This is the kind of girl who helps build homes for the less fortunate and wants to create a summer ranch for autistic children. It delays what seems like an eternity before finally contacting Tyree with the eponymous letter. Indeed, she drops it for a man with a disease! Later, she confessed to John that she knew that the sound of her voice would have broken her in her desire to marry Tim, so she does not make that fateful call. Predictably, John worries about Savannah's lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero takes some terrorist bullets in the back and goes to Germany. While all this is happening, Tyree is trying to deal with her own coin-collecting father, Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins of "Step Brothers"), who suffers from Asperger Syndrome. It seems that his father has the last legs after John's exit from the hospital. The main female character lacks a bit of respect and her betrayal of Tyree equals a low blow. Tyree, his father, and his captain, Keith Robinson, are the only sympathetic characters in this remote epistolary novel. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" gives new meaning to lethargic love stories. Yuck!
