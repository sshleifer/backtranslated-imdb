This film is excited !! I'm sad to say that I can watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and that, after all, I will have to force myself very hard to sit and watch the rest of the movie. It's totally stupid and very wrong. The robot in the film looks like a man wearing a steel jumpsuit and the acting is really bad, especially the one playing the Alien character. It is totally boring! Do not waste your money watching this sequel to the popular Cops Gen-X. I prefer to sleep or spend my money on other things rather than watching this movie. 1 of 10. If possible, I would give 0.
