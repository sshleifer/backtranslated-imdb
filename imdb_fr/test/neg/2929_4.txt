Coming from Kiarostami, this visual and sound exhibition of the art house is a surprise. For a director known for his stories and his careful observation of human beings, especially children, this trip to minimalist cinematography raises questions: why did he do it? Was it to keep him busy during his vacation at the coast? <br /> <br /> "Five, five long shots" consists of, you guessed it, five long shots. They are (the title names are mine and the approximate times): <br /> <br /> "Driftwood and waves". The camera is almost motionless watching a small piece of driftwood as it is moved by small waves splashing a beach. Ten minutes. <br /> <br /> "Watch people on the sidewalk". The camera remains motionless, looking at the ocean horizon and a walk. People walk on the camera frame, the face too far away and blurry to make it interesting. Eleven minutes. <br /> <br /> "Six dogs at the edge of the water". The camera remains motionless, looking out at the ocean horizon with a sandy beach nearby. At the edge of the water, six dogs do not do much, they relax. Sixteen minutes. <br /> <br /> "Ducks in line, group of ducks". The camera stands still looking at the horizon of the ocean near the water's edge. Dozens and dozens of ducks parade in single file from left to right. I guess Kiarostami released them gradually. The last two ducks stop on their tracks and suddenly, a band of ducks rolls gently from right to left. I suppose Kiarostami gathered the ducks and republished them all at the same time. This is not the first time he approaches the contrast between organized behavior and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes. <br /> <br /> "Symphony of frogs, oops, I mean cacophony, for a stormy night". The camera stands over a pond at night. It is dark except what seems to be the reflection of the moon on the undulating water. It's a stormy night and the cloud race covers the moon. The screen goes black. What we have left is the cacophony of frogs, screaming dogs and, possibly, morning cocks. Hit me on the head if it was done in one take. I saw this segment as a sound composition assembled in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. Twenty-seven minutes! <br /> <br /> Except for the slightly amusing ducks, this minimalism exercise left me cold. A non essential film for the fans of Kiarostami. <br /> <br /> I thought I'd give five to five, but four is what he deserves. <br /> <br /> The film is dedicated to Yasujiru Ozu.
