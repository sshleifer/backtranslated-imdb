I had the impression that the two hours I spent watching this movie might have been better served by perhaps going to the local used bookstore and looking for old fashion magazines and commercials Halston. Or maybe watching the paint dry. These two jobs would have at least occupied my mind a bit more than "India Song". The most frustrating part of this session was that I could see what moods / atmospheres were trying to be created and that the notion of these could have been interesting if they had been further developed. Instead, what has happened is the presentation of an incoherent and silly chain of non-events - with the same scenes recited repeatedly to mark any point in our senses. this film writing all kinds of criticism, except perhaps to warn other people of this waste of time.
