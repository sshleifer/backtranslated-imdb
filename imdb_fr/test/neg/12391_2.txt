It seems at least vaguely possible that this film provided a little inspiration to "The Sopranos", his main character being Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a great success that has so many problems of his past and his job that he is in therapy. trying to manage everything. Everything ends up dulling at her 10-year high school meeting. The problem was that when Blank reached the meeting, I stopped taking care of myself. Frankly, I found this film a little painful from start to finish. <br /> <br /> He had potential. Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, led by Grocer, his rival in the commercials industry, and Minnie Driver as Debi, the darling of Blank's high school, with whom he woke up the night of the prom role for Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman, psychologist of Blank. This talented cast has never really seemed to come together, though. The drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humor. What I thought was most likely to become a comic scenario was Grocer's proposal to create a hired gun syndicate, but in addition to becoming a farce, the idea never really developed. As far as romance is concerned, one wonders why Debi would even think of letting this guy back in his life. <br /> <br /> There was a handful of laughs, but nothing really caught me and held me back and I spent most of the movie wondering if this thing would ever start clicking. It never happened - not for me, at least. 2/10
