My Take: Typically routine and lazy, direct video attempt by Disney. <br /> <br /> Disney must have fallen in love with the tradition of family film, namely the family dog. Many movies have devoted themselves to stories that focus solely on the best friend of man. Disney themselves have made a handful. They also made a handful of those who are literally dogs. Add this one to this group. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the original for a very long time, so I'm probably not the right person to judge if this video is better. Anyone over the age of seven is not the right person to see it either. Maybe only the youngest of the youngest will want to see LADY AND THE TRAMP II: THE ADVENTURE OF SCAMP, and even if they grew up saying it was not the best kind of family entertainment they ever had seen. I guess to be fair, I can say it justifies a rental, but it's not much to say. <br /> <br /> This suite takes up more or less the parts left behind the classic often called. Lady and Tramp now have a litter of cute Crocker Spaniel puppies ... and a mischievous mestizo named Scamp that is a burst of old block. Instead of being confined to the house, Scamp wants to flee with the other dogs in the city break, unknown to his father's past as one of those bastards in the street. To capture the charms of the original, this one throws in the same story of poor dog / dog rich love, and vice versa. Scamp falls in love with Angel, one of the dogs of the case, and who would not do it with a name like that and a voice that looks like Alyssa Milano?). What to replay the famous spaghetti scene! Aside from the "cute" factor, no effort is expected for this lazy audience in this direct video effort. Stick to the original. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
