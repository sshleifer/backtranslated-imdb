This is happening on Fire Island in the 1970s. A couple Peter (Craig Dudley) and Buddy (J. Will Deane) are organizing a party on July 4th at their home. Unfortunately, their relationship is falling apart and they have to get ready for a house full of very strange guests. The rest of the film tells the party and what's going on between Peter and Buddy. <br /> <br /> OK - I'm a gay man, but I was 8 at the time. If it's a true vision of what gay life was like in the 1970s, I'm glad I was not there. According to the opening credits that shows children playing in the sand (???), this film slowly slides into disaster. There is a guru (Robert Case) who speaks nonstop nothing important. I wanted to gag the guy halfway through his first long speech. There is the young child Danny who is here for the first time. There is the lesbian couple (who does nothing - except a strip without reason). There is the queen of leather. The worst of all is the effeminate man named Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). We are introduced to him and his friend (I never got the name) when they have a flat tire. They scream and shout for 10 minutes and do not know how to fix an apartment. I know some people find this funny, but I found it shocking and rather sad. The party itself is full of people you would never want to know. It's like being thrown into an evening full of bad actors playing obnoxious people. With the sole exception of Dudley, no one can act. <br /> <br /> This can be useful to paint a picture of what Fire Island looked like in the 1970s ... but the visualization is rather boring. This gives a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of very beautiful bodies.
