It was a first feature film for Clinton, I was there, as he was shooting this mess in Adelaide around 98 ... <br /> <br /> Even though I was not directly involved in the production, I witnessed the illusory behavior, post-set, which fell: the holidays, the drugs, the illusory mirage, really an example of what not to do to make a film, but also a sub-set produced by talented young people letting themselves be drawn into the classical ideologies of fame and worldly position. <br /> <br /> I like Clinton, we had a curious friendship, he deserves to have another crack with a more mature scenario ... there are the problems, and I'm much better The job will be done, if there is a next time. Because, frankly, he certainly did not do this with his CV and the cast either ... but hey, it was a lucrative job, in a country where actors regularly die of hunger <br /> > <br /> In summary, fascinating to look at the "making of" wholesale, not so much fun to live (alas!).
