Young couple on the road, taking care of their things and having casual sex in their car in daylight. Yet, suddenly, they are threatened and terrorized by a disturbed psychopath in a rusty old van. Hmm, where did I ever see this premise? Oh yes, now I remember, we have seen that a thousand times before, and about nine hundred and ninety-nine other cases were much better than "Rest Stop Stop"! This new weak and pitiful film is insulting even to the minds of the most modest horror fans, as it does not present an original twist or a memorable gadget. It's very sadistic and nasty, but every teenkill-slasher movie is sadistic and nasty nowadays, so it's not really a surprise either. The main absolute problem of this production is the incredibly large amount of stupid parcel holes and meaningless subplots. Screenwriter / director John Shiban has understood very well that the ultra-thin basic scenario was not nearly enough to fill a movie. He thus fills his film as a Thanksgiving turkey with a stupid and insane padding material. Nicole's boyfriend disappears at an abandoned and dirty rest stop in California. Killing her character right away would not give a very long movie and she will eventually meet a family of motor-homes freaks, suffering from visions (?) In which she talks to the previous victims of the deranged killer and she is deeply moved (and boring conversations) with a policeman who will not die even if a truck crushed him ... twice! Stupid intrigues never lead anywhere and they are certainly the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch the length of a movie I have ever seen. Instead of all these useless jams, Shiban should have paid more attention to creating tension and making his main characters a little more sympathetic. Nicole's character, Jaimie Alexander, is an annoying, brainless girl, and you will not really care if she survives the test or not. His boyfriend Jesse, as well as the policeman, are both losers and their brutal death was still not painful enough, if you ask me. I counted exactly three sequences, all of them including torture and free mutilation, which were pretty bloody and exciting to give me a sadistic smile. It's still too little for a horror movie nowadays. Basically, "Rest Stop" is simply a miserable attempt to take advantage of the success of movies such as "Wolf Creek" and "Hostel", but you'd better look at the originals. It was the first film of the new production company called 'Raw Feed'. They present themselves as the new name with great horror, but they will have to offer something much better than "Rest Stop" if they want us to believe it.
