With the exception of the appearance of Austin Powers' talented impersonator Richard Halpern, this photo was your parody of the factory film. References to dated movies will not help the audience who may encounter this difficulty in the future. Watch for the "Groovy" Austin Powers in the spa. It's funny and a half. <br /> <br /> The mediocre special effects are overcome by the appearance of many starlets in skimpy outfits, so at least you should keep one entertained (if that's what you're passionate about). <br /> <br /> For my money, I would rent the DVD of classic parodies such as "Airplane" or "Lobster Man from Mars".
