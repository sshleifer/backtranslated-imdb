For a film made in Senegal and based, I suppose, on Carmen, the book of Prosper Merimee, this film does not present a simple resemblance to the story that has been made famous as an opera and other films. <Br /> <br /> Mrs. Gai as the Karmen of the title is very good to watch. His fiery dance covers the screen, as is the case of his hot love scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> It's a Karmen that aims to please all genders, but a real Carmen, she is no! <br /> <br /> We would like to see Ms. Gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here.
