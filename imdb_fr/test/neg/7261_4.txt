Something strange is happening in remote areas of the Arctic. An Air Force weather station is in ruins and its occupants are missing. An Eskimo village is destroyed. A fishing boat disappears. Curious soils are found in the snow. A four-foot piece of living organism is near a destroyed plane. The piece looks like half the claw of a giant Alaska crab. The army (Craig Stevens as an Air Force officer) and his experts are perplexed. A distinguished scientist (William Hopper) and his lovely assistant (Alix Taltan) are called to New York. Hopper deduces from this fragile proof that it is a monstrous religious mantis. He is right. The pretty assistant looks out the office window and sees the ugly face with her protruding eyes staring at her. She drops what she's wearing, strikes her hands on her cheeks and screams in horror. <br /> <br /> The mantis begins to fly south along the Gulf Stream, stopping from time to time to attack large population centers such as Washington and New York. to overturn the buses and eat people. Military weapons do not affect him much, but eventually, Stevens falls into his fighter plane and fatally damages the beast, which comes to Earth and occupies the "Manhattan tunnel" linking New York and New Jersey. <br /> <br /> After surviving the collision, Stevens leads his team into the tunnel and kills the big "Mines 3RG" bug despite his fierce appearance, his threatening behavior and his howling roars. Stevens and Taltan kiss in front of the body while Hopper laughs and takes their picture. <br /> <br /> Ho buzzing. <br /> <br /> Like the mortal mantle itself, the formula at that time was breathless and breathless, groped, seeking for prey not human beings, but any obstacle to a new idea or original. In the state, they forgot a clich√©. Hopper should have hastily invented a Super Duper DDT that alone could defeat the insect. That's what the 3RG mines should have done, rather than the ordinary explosive. <br /> <br /> The working model is pretty good, considering what the budget should be. Little money could have been spent on anything else because everything else is rather routine. Craig Stevens is bland, a face and style made for a television series. William Hopper looks straight - with big, silver hair - but his instrument has only one note. The pretty assistant is quite simple, considering her role. The party calls Joan Weldon or Laurie Nelson. They could not act either, but carried with them light but distinct affirmations of molestibility. Anything that could have helped this thorny movie. <br /> <br /> I wish that the killing mantis did not roar so loud and so often because you can not roar - you can not even whisper - no lungs. It did not bother me, though, when the monster came to an end in the tunnel. A praying mantis is a gracious insect in its graceful manner and it is good to have them in the garden as they eat caterpillars and all the rest. But basically, they are not really very attractive. The male mantis is smaller and weaker than the female, as in humans, and when the couple is about to mate, the woman bites the head of the male, as in humans. But at least men know when to stop. The male mantis continues to mate for several minutes even though he is now headless. We humans do not have brainless males mating with goal-motivated females. Do we?
