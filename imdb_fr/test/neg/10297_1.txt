It must be the worst thriller I've seen in a long time. The staging, the acting and the adaptation of the story make what could have been a good conspiracy a waste of time insignificant. A few minutes after watching the movie, it was easy to understand the plot as a whole. In addition, there are early, more obvious clues that leave no mystery. I guessed it in the very first minutes and I kept hoping I was wrong and, to my dismay, that was not the case. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two FBI agents driving to a remote town to investigate a murderer. Spree who left three witnesses, a girl, a drug addict and a cop. They are interviewed separately under surveillance cameras and each tells his account of the day. Everyone has something to hide about himself and the day unfolds as he tells his story. This part is probably the grace that saves and if it had been developed, the film could have been improved. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The story ends when the FBI agents are the real killers and the girl is the only one to understand it. This is left unharmed. <br /> <br /> Why do they go through the whole charade of questioning three witnesses and bonding with the girl if their idea was to kill them in the first place? How did they manage to pretend to be FBI agents (when you discover that real FBI agents have been killed and their badges have been found)? How did they know how to configure and use surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so unconvincing from start to finish. Maybe the idea is to develop their characters for the final revelation. Come on, they both look ridiculous, stupid and not at all sinister. The character of the girl is also a lost potential. Her actions have no meaning and no meaning to which she prefers to attach herself in her ordeal. She does not seem anxious, but rather detached, which again is not explained. <br /> <br /> Awful movie overall.
