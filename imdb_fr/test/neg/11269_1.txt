"Yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (let's just say "Shogun's samurai") is between awfully boring and incredibly painful to watch. As a historical epic, it would have been much more likely to be a rich saga ... but it's actually just another cheap 70s action movie, with a story based on real events and a Sonny to Chiba's optimized look. Before half of this movie, I was even tempted to commit seppuku! The music is like a thousand horny dogs screaming in your ears on an air composed by Ennio Morricone (it's not an insult to Morricone). The use of zoom cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating. And in terms of action, it is actually a series of brutal attacks and shocks "oh no no they did not". What a terrible movie.
