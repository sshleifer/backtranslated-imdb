For football fans everywhere - stay away from this movie. It was so baaaaddd! Blade acting, lame scenario, lame football and no staging! I rented this film during my stay in Asia and was appalled by the fact that it was considered one of the best Singaporean films. It was just absurd and completely boring. There are thousands of rich and fascinating stories in Asia. Why write a bad story about stereotypical Singaporeans?
