Even though this film was nothing special as such, I am led to comment at least one factor that has decided in his favor: that of the main performer of the film, Dyan Cannon. Despite the film's ridiculous scenario and what she's going through here, hers was the best acting work in the film, making the incredible more plausible. His noisy scene with gay photographer David Hemmings must be seen to be believed. Good job, Dyan.
