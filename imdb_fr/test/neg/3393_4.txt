This is why this movie was way below its potential (I do not read much, so I do not care what the novel looked like). 1. I think Brendan Frasier copied his Lambert Tarzan Encino man. It was steep and, although his appeal to Tarzan was a little more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. They fucked with the story. Maybe that's how the book goes, but as far as I can remember, Tarzan's first words were "Me Tarzan, you Jane." Jane is the first human encounter with Tarzan. I loved the natives a little more than the dwarf boobies of Weismuller's version, but these bows and arrows were a little tacky. 3. Tarzan is above all a love story. I am sorry, but the love interest between more than an hour in the photo. This qualifies it best for a supportive role. Secondary roles and tracks do not fall for each other, not enough time in front of the screen, sorry. Not only was Andie McDowell's vioce pathetic (probably because her strong southern accent could not be masked), but the chemistry ladder between Tarzan and Jane was a huge 0. I never thought they'd loved, which pushed the Belgians to be heard. , frankly, silly. When Tarzan sees Jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels a desire, if you will, a sensation he had never felt before. Jane brings out the humanity in him and he brings out his untamed side. It is this chemistry that imposes the story of Tarzan. Not that Lord Greystoke's wish is to keep his entire land and that Johnny will do it for him. Even a good facelift could not help this movie. He needs a massive internal reconstruction. Oh, and could we shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that do not show the sound stage as the qualities of the place. Final judgment, 4 out of 10. Sorry, Mr. Tin-man, and by the way, if you want to see a real role, let Lambert down and consult Leonardo Dicaprio.
