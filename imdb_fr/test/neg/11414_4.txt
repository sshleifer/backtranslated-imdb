I am really surprised to see all these positive reviews for this movie. Do not get me wrong, it's not that I do not like 'this kind of movies'. <br /> <br /> Although I can very well enjoy a good unscrupulous blockbuster in Hollywood like Die Hard 4.0, I like "dogma" type movies, or real life movies, they are well done. <br /> <br /> A good example is Festen (1998): no music, no dramatic angle of view, no special effects, no prime location. Just a good story combined with an excellent acting and the result is an excellent film. <br /> <br /> Is Nine Lives devoid of dramatic camera angles, exceptional special views and whimsical locations? Yes. Is it a good movie? I'm glad you asked. <br /> <br /> The answer is: Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> First of all, everyone is amazed by theatrical performances. I am terribly sorry, but you can play whatever you want, but if the story and the dialogue are not credible, the game falls immediately behind. And that's exactly the case with Nine Lives. <br /> <br /> I did not have the sensation, just once, watching "Nine Lives" as I was watching real people talking. I felt like I was watching actors who were trying to portray themselves as "real people" when they were saying things that a "real person" would never say in the circumstances. <br /> <br /> You can hardly call this a SPOILER. , but there are some excerpts from the dialogue below. If you think that reading ten lines of dialogue (ridiculous) will ruin your cinematic experience, STOP READING HERE. If you want to laugh, keep reading. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragic. Do you want examples? Many are in "Nine lives". <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE1: <br /> <br /> Imagine this. A couple visits their filthy mates in their new mansion. A woman sees this house castle and says to her husband: <br /> <br /> Woman: I could get used to it (that is to say the expensive house). Man: No Woman: why not? It might be. Man: No They are who they are and we are who we are. Woman: I like the sound of that - we are who we are. <br /> <br /> She likes the sound of that? His man acts like a fool, but she loves the sound. Then an elderly couple passes by them holding hands. This is what the woman proposes: <br /> <br /> Woman: Look! They are like children after school. They have lived so many things. All shared. I love you. <br /> <br /> They are like children after school? And then the most used clich√© lines you've ever heard? Finish with 'I love you'? She says that while her man does stupid things to her? Yes, very logical, very realistic, NOT. This kind of dialogue rather made me want to strangle some characters in the film for saying these horrible and horrible things. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 2: <br /> <br /> An elderly mother, her father and her youngest daughter at a funeral. Dad: I did not realize Andrew was religious. Mom: It's for comfort. Girl: It's for strength. Mom: Life is fleeting. Dad and his daughter BURST OUT LAUGHING. <br /> <br /> Yeah, this one-liner makes me crack all the time, especially at a funeral! Sorry, I must have missed the joke here. <br /> <br /> And that goes on and on .... <br /> <br /> And what about working with the camera? Do not even go there. "Boring" would be a compliment. He is supposed to appear "realistic". Instead, you miss half of the facial expressions of the actors (the only thing left to watch in this movie), while half the time, the camera is directed to someone's back or side instead of the face. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Well, do not say I did not warn you! It's a good movie to rent if you want to talk about your date or something during the movie, because you will not even want the movie to air or not after the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> Overrated and more boring than watching the grass grow, it sums up well.
