Very slow film, dull and enigmatic. MAybe the kind of film that Jean-Luc Godard would have realized if he had been Italian. This certainly shows how a person's life can be tedious, repetitive, joyless and empty, but I do not usually go to the movies to find out! The plot (as it is) does not convince. Why would a great hotel receptionist (an exception to the monotony of the movie) be so interested in a gloomy loner, smoking a chain, silent talking under deep aphorisms baffling me Very hard to feel sympathy for the main character . We want to shake his throat and tell him to "get out!" His brother is a much more human character. The end is inconclusive and confusing. Everyone at the movies (when I saw the movie) came out mumbling about being almost asleep. Of course, it should not be a Hollywood-style "shhot-em-up" and "crash-bang" fiesta, but a little energy and action would have made the event a lot more exciting. One of the best Italian movies of all time ?! Please ... A house of art, a curiosity at best.
