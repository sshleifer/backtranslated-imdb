Garden State was at best a mediocre film. The film is more like a compilation of thoughts that the writer (Zach Braff) had, rather than a coherent story. The disjointed plot might have been more appealing if it had not been punctuated with useless scenes that were nothing more than "weird". Coincidentally, these scenes are often the ones that are relayed in the conversation (Zack passes in front of faucets that light up in passing, a delirious party scene, screams over a throat, the list is long). <br /> <br /> The main character is flat, disengaged and ultimately improbable, especially in the scenes where he talks to his father, selfishly ignoring his father's problems, including a recently deceased wife, and stammering for his own account. with my life? "problem. <br /> <br /> The movie ends when Andrew (Zach Braff) decides not to return to Los Angeles because he can not tear himself away from the love of his life, Sam (Natalie Portman) he knows for two days, which can only lead me to conclude that the message of the film is that love at first sight solves professional dilemmas ... Of course, you could interpret it as a misappropriation of priorities, but if that were the case, it could have been done better, much better. <br /> <br /> This film does not know what it wants to be: a drama, a comedy, a film about teenage wasteland or a whole range of other things, I'm not saying that as a single person, but as a person who loves multi-genre works such as those mastered by Stanley Kubrick. does not work for Garden State, it's because rather than mixing genres, it's obvious, a scene is a genre, another, and so on, and so on. <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot of people tell me to give Zach Braff a bit of leeway, after all it was his first feature film and he made his debut as a director, screenwriter and actor main. As impressive as it was a first film, I think that with so much money, it could do better. There have been many better directors of the first feature film (Michel Gondry "Human Nature", David Gordon Green "George Washington"). Maybe if he just wrote OR directed OR played, it would have been better. Zach Braff is a talented performer. Maybe his second attempt will not be so tedious and disjointed.
