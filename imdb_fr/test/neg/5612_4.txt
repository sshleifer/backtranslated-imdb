Rutger Hauer participates in a film that can be summarized in the category of young people who find themselves, which obviously requires a lot of help. <br /> <br /> The beginning is more promising, on a film that could become Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's a shame because I'm really addicted at first. Then, like the soundtrack, he went from awesome and intriguing to almost nowhere. <br /> <br /> It's quite fun with a lot of curiosities and interesting characters who played well. I'm sure that will be enough for many people. The problem is that everything feels artificial and empty, which, ironically, is supposed to be the main discovery for the character's self-realization. Not the film itself (it is not a self-conscious film), but that the character is supposed to recognize his own life is artificial and empty.
