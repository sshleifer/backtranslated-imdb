Tom and Jerry are visiting Africa and disguise themselves as "Amos-n-Andy". They even act and speak differently, with the degrading standard use of the extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of blacks described in many cartoons of the time. Aside from the offensive images, this cartoon is just not very good. Why did they go to Africa in the first place? Apparently, just to provide the public with another Amos-n-Andy and the over-exploited cannibal representation of native Africans. The only reason we got a 2 instead of a 1 is that there are a few seconds spent on an octopus. <br /> <br /> One view is always worth asking how ignorance could prevail ... <br /> <br /> (Note: I consider that some caricatures containing such stereotyped images are very All depends on the quality of the content surrounding the caricature or the only reason for its existence.In other words, if you get rid of "Mammy", wagging your feet, bad grammar and black face images with giant lips, is there anything left? In the case of "Plane Dumb", there is no.)
