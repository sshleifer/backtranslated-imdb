It's pure CRAP, and probably the worst Bible-themed movie of all time ... Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, they put Sodom and Gomora BEFORE the Great Flood. They described Lot as a friend of Noah although he lived after Noah. To make matters worse, later, Lot became a pirate and attacked Noah's ark during the Flood !!! ??? And what happens with the trader who arrives on a boat that is moved over the water with a bike mechanism ??? And exchange of alcohol for a food and water, then Noah is described as alcoholic !? Endless jokes and blasphemies one after the other, and so on ... The director and all the participants made sure to be in the front row in hell with this trash ... <br /> <br /> please stay away from this shit, because you will save yourself nearly three hours of your life.
