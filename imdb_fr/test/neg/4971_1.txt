In 1993, Sega released a dull and dull video game from one of the greatest movies of all time. Quickly realizing their mistake, they developed a different version of the game, saying it would be bigger, harder and better. <br /> <br /> Neither one nor the other. Both games were slow and boring. <br /> <br /> You can choose to be Dr. Alan Grant or ... a raptor. Both have their problems. Why would Dr. Grant kill all these types of army (what do they do in the game)? And why does a raptor kill other birds of prey? Bizarre. <br /> <br /> Obviously not learning from their first mistake, Sega really dropped the ball on the original version and the so-called Rampage edition. One of the slowest, slowest and most boring platform games I have ever played.
