Worthless film. A total loss of time and nothing that I expected. The packaging gives the impression that it is the American Pie (this is not the case). it is rather a ridiculous sequence of coincidences that makes the film look more like a writing exercise (let's see how many mixes we can write to make what should have been a bad sketch of SNL a complete presentation). What is remarkable is that the director (based on their comments on the DVD) takes himself completely seriously. I am a big fan of the films to which National Lampoon lends its name, including Van Wilder. With this one, I feel completely deceived. In fact, I feel fooled. I was expecting a Van Wilder joke to revive my college years, but I rather served him an hour and a half of garbage. What led to my ultimately unsatisfied expectations? Well, for starters, the fact that all actors appear naked (with a huge sausage covering everything that needs to be covered) on the COVER of the DVD. Add to that the images on the back of the case as well as the description and you mislead people into believing it's a movie that it is not. To make matters worse, the movie begins as one might expect with drunken, half-naked students who are faintly trying a cascade of photos, but that ultimately has nothing to do with the movie. In fact, I did not even know that the characters in this opening sequence were supposed to be the characters of the film before the directors told me in the commentary. Do not get me wrong, I love the twists and intrigue of movies, but I hate the fact that this movie tries to pretend that it is not what it is. In the end, it does a disservice (artistically, but probably not financially) because it plunges its audience into confusion and disappointment simply because it neglects to broadcast its ads. <br /> <br /> In short, do not rent this movie based on what you see on the case. This is not your usual national film of Lampoon. The only funny thing about this is the fact that many actors have appeared in other movies and TV series that make their involvement here entertaining.
