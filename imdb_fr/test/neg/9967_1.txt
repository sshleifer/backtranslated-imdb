I was encouraged to watch this movie because I had heard about it: it was supposed to be this thrilling crime, thrilling, shocking ... all that jazz. Well, I'm upset because I spent money on it, and I'm shocked that something so horrible has come out. That is just about everything. <br /> <br /> This is a supposed "new look" of the family of insane junkies and their murders, Charles Manson. But if it's a "new look", it's probably "new" as in "fresh and totally inept": just looking at it gave me a headache and I had to give up trying to understand anything or even understand The director intended to do so. <br /> <br /> I guess I should say something about the plot, but the fact is that it was so stupid and incoherent that I hardly remember if there was even a plot. There was something about a "Manson cassette" delivered to a radio DJ (or a TV producer?), Then to an hour of unnecessary random sequences of "the family" in '69, then to the murders of Polanski (looking like a bad school play) and finally a silly part of a group of skinheads getting drunk and fighting each other in an alley (I do not make fun of me), and then it ends (thank god) (do not ask me to make sense of that I just remember what I saw!) The performances were terrible too. And how difficult is it to make a convincing "Manson"? Get a skinny, skinny little guy, put a dirty wig and a hairy beard on him. There is your Manson. But this "Manson" does not even look ok. He looks like a guy wearing a cheap wig and a beard glued to a black painted Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> Or maybe the movie is about that: Manson's family did not make sense, so this film does not make sense either. It's symbolic! (Yeah, that's right) I'm still so upset about spending money on this project. I stopped hiding on this site and I signed up just to vote 1 for this movie and post this warning which, hopefully, will prevent others from spending their money in this garbage. Stay away, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> PS. The recent American TV production "Helter Skelter" received bad reviews but I saw it last month (I also saw the 1976 original) and let me tell you that, compared to "Manson Family", the new Helter Skelter is BRILLANT and FLAWLESS. And I was disappointed! This is how "Manson Family" is bad: it gives a TV film imperfect and especially disappointing.
