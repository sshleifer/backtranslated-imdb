The Midnight Hour AKA: Tell me no lies (as in some video stores) can be judged in two different ways. One by Merritt as a film, with a plot (no holes), a good story and a credible conclusion and the other by the skin film he's trying to be. It's certainly not more than a B-Movie movie, whose only goal is to show all the girls in the movie at least once in an overly long sex scene. <br /> <br /> If you try to rate this as a regular movie, then it's down the drivel line. Huge holes in the plot ruin the plot of the story. For example, if a colleague is killed, do you call the police or go home and go to the spa? Judging by its skin content, it's watchable ... barely. The girls, for the most part, are all beautiful but obviously highlighted. The sex scenes were all long and excessive, however, and that only made the redeeming quality a little boring. <br /> <br /> Amber Smith could probably be a decent actress if she wanted to. She was not as horrible as you could imagine or maybe next to the rest of the cast, she seemed a lot better than she was. movie, much less to act in one. She looked good, so we know why she was there. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone. Even if you are looking for a good skin film, there are many better ones. I rate 4 out of 10
