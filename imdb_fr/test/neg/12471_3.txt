"Pie" is a good illustration of the old Yogi Berra adage: "If you do not know where you are going, you will probably end up somewhere else". Screenwriter / director Christina Waye (in her first feature film) has managed to make a $ 3 million film that ends elsewhere. "Tart" is either a characterless teenage story with which a rational person can connect, a humorless black comedy or a sexually exploitative movie without anything particularly sexy. <br /> <br /> Contrary to standards Swain's "Tart" film employed a skilled and experienced production designer. Good enough to provide two very beautiful shots: the Swain and Barton scene taking a bubble bath together and the Swain scene in the park with a nice montage of the "Alice in Wonderland" sculpture. The symbolism embodied in these elements suggests the possibility that Waye (despite the absence of linear logic or unity of tone) actually has a visionary talent and aspirations for the realization of a quality film. <br /> <br /> It is even possible that Waye has attempted to merge the somewhat expressionist metro and camp classic, "Cruel Intentions," which also deal with Manhattan's upper class. There are many shots framed by windows and doors, but few faces and tight eyes. The first technique refers to symbolism and the last to an intentional distancing of the characters and their motivations. "Tart" seemed to be about to turn at least twice on camp territory and would have been well advised to continue in this direction. First there was the scene where they tried to throw Swain, apparently dead, into the garbage chute. Then there is the story of his Jewish father (played at the same level as Joel Gray dancing with the Jewish guerrilla in "Cabaret"). <br /> <br /> In her other films, Swain's actor technique consists of overwhelming each scene in which she appears (inserting a chewing scene here), but in "Tart" she actually shows an ability to hold back. This is the best performance of his career. He also provides clues to his physical deterioration, ranging from super cute Willie in "Girl" to chubby Hulking to the "Pumpkin" face. This transformation was about half finished when she made "Tart"; so go the ravages of time. <br /> <br /> Mischa Barton ("I feel better, daughter of the Sixth Sense") and Lacey Chabet excellent in supporting roles. The rest of the cast is just awful, although some of the blame has to be attributed to Waye's script and instructions.
