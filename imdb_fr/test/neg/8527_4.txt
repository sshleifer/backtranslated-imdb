The directors of "The Messengers", Danny Pang and Oxide Pang, are responsible for "The Eye" and its sequel. Their first American film takes place as "The Grudge", a country house composed of four people. In rural North Dakota, near their teenage daughter Jess begins to see ghosts. Of course, his parents and the police are skeptical. Boo effect. The plot is still a true copy of many ghost stories and its end is anti-climatic and terribly awful. The Scares are also very low with a trend towards computer-generated images. movie that just does not book.4 out of 10.
