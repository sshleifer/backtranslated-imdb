Apparently, he was a laureate. Apparently, someone had a gun on his head and was forced to name Maize: the Movie. <br /> <br /> Or it must be a mistake. <br /> <br /> This is the most unassailable movie ever made. Projection and editing are the biggest horror of this film. Two little girls are lost in a cornfield and are harassed by someone who laughs under his rubber mask. The little girls meet their father, the hero, then flee, W.T.F. The father of the hero in the film keeps losing sight of them for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The girls were obviously not qualified actors and had no common sense. They were so annoying and so childish in the movie that it was not even comic from a distance. Hearing them scream again and again as if a disc was broken was the reason I got up and went away. You can not even listen to this movie without almost having convulsions. <br /> <br /> I can throw up a better winner of this award.
