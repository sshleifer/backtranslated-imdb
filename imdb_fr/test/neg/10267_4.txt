When the word "present" finds its place in a title, preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately dismissible. For some reason, people who are able to create good art do not seem to be able to see it in others. However, I have always been willing to try the second installment of the Demons trilogy. On the one hand, soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to align the genre of talent on the soundtrack of Demons 2. Another, well, two words: Asia Argento. (Of course, this film was shot at the age of eleven, and a few years from its apparent decision to turn her into an actress after Helen Mirren's debut: a vaporous air and a little garment.) Also, Lamberto Bava The most beautiful Italian dynasties in this subgenre of strange horror known as Giallo (he is the son of Mario Bava, who may have invented the genre in the sixties). And the original demon is a must-have for B-80 horror movie fans. So how can that be true? Good, bad. Demons continue to storm the Italian media, as the film opens in a modern Italian skyscraper, where many people who go about their lives have their television in the background. They all watch some sort of news video / news story that combines investigative reporters trying to get proof of the events of the first movie (which would not seem to take longer than this a few days after the end of the first one). movie). first film). Because of the usual additional inability of horror movies to concentrate, reporters manage to revive a demon. He then goes to the TV screen to trigger the plague again. <br /> <br /> Yeah. It's so bad. The only good thing we can say about the movie is that the soundtrack (when you're not jostled by artists like The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc.) is staggering. It comes from the keyboard of Simon Boswell, who made his debut in the Argento dynasty and has since directed films like Lord of Illusions and Hackers. <br /> <br /> Give a half-decent free rent if you plan to drink a lot, but it's far from fun that the original was original. Shivers (also known as They Came From Within) is much better.
