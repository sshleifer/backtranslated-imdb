Apart from the DA (James Eckhouse) and a brief lady who is convincingly sympathetic to the fate of Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellweger), Ellen herself is the only convincing - and sympathetic - character in the film. She, and not her dying mother, should be and is - the only thing that is true. it's not only in the role, in Zellweger's acting, but also in the plot itself ... Until the plot turns against itself and makes the mother "the only thing true" in the eyes of her superficial and voluntary husband who can not do anything good for his wife or daughter. The girl perceives what the viewer perceives, but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the superficial feeling of the husband who is concealed at the same time on the realities of his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition, the most powerful scene of all this film, when Ellen confronts the cruelty of her father, is lying at the end. Ellen is just another strong young woman who needs to be tamed by a crybaby father. A very flawed film - so imperfect that it's called boredom and not worth it.
