I do not know who recommended me Surveillance, but I think I have an idea: one of the "Fat Guys At the Movies". The person stated that he was surprised by the quality of his film and that it was one of the most gorged and disturbing films. (I paraphrase and do it only by memory, so forgive me if I misquoted.) In any case, I made the decision to look at it. So I'm entirely responsible for my own miscalculation by watching one of the most horrifying, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strange, I doubt to have ever described a film as "stupid", but it is the first word that was mentioned to me about the third party and that kept me in mind until the end. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Incredible premises and reactions, incredibly dead brain characters (who could blame the writing or the actors, or just the two) and an extremely bad acting game. I would rather believe Bill Pullman as president of the United States than an FBI agent here. (Of course, there's a reason for that, and I'm going in part.) And to top it off, if you can not understand the so-called shocking "shock" in the first 5 minutes, then you have to to have arrived late to the theater or entered the room to watch it late. Do not worry, they will tell you what is the "twist" every five minutes. <br /> <br /> Serial killers have been arrested in the most depressing city in the county or the world. But there is more in the story! Some stupid and corrupt policemen like to blow tires for fun. Could there be more? Oh, yes, there is a family, but maybe not, but there are four humans, a boy, a girl and a couple of adults. The girl says she sees things with much less conviction that Cole does not see deaths in The Sixth Sense. There must be more than what I mentioned! That's what makes an interesting movie! Adding as many subplots that can or can not be developed is the way to go! Okay, so I will continue. We have crazy FBI agents that made me laugh. Two jokers who laugh, who first shocked their OD dealer and then resorted to theft. An awesome police officer who must have been comical and must always fight against an angry / suspicious policeman. And finally, Michael Ironside (poor, poor) who did not just call his interpretation, he barely sent him a text. <br /> <br /> None of these solutions work. They are all told different forms of presence tensions or flashbacks and, believe me, you will lose all sense of solicitude after the beginning of the first of many secondary intrigues. Moreover, the reaction of some of these characters is the most shocking of all. I think I'm talking mostly about cops, but mostly about the girl who has lost her family or not, and who is just blinking. <br /> <br /> This stupid movie, stupid, stinks. It's hardly gore that the person who recommended it said, unless its exposure was limited to goose bumps. And what is the title? Monitoring? Oh, I understand; it's because it was used in 1/50 subplots just to shoot interviews. Since it's so random, it could also be called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Stay away from this horrible mess.
