"Thunderbolt" is probably Jackie Chan's worst film since "The Protector" in 1985. Yes, I know no one is watching his films in search of their stories, but the plot of it is unusually lame, even according to his criteria, At the height of its requirements, the fight scenes (both whole) are ruined, as others have already mentioned, by the frenetic and distracting shooting of the camera. Even the most serious fans of Jackie Chan should not really bother with this offensively messy garbage filled with waterfalls and traffic jams. Anita Yuen's cute and cheerful performance is one of the few redemptive virtues. For a good movie "Serious Jackie", I recommend "Crime Story". (* 1/2)
