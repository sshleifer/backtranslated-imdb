This was the most uninteresting horror film I've seen to date. The premise is forgotten after about 1 minute. The acting is terrible. The scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys are kissing, yuck! What did the film festival judges think when they attributed the garbage to "best film"? The only reasons I did not turn off this film was to see what NOT to do as a filmmaker and if the plot as thin as possible could continue to work as before. I was not disappointed by this last notion. There was not even a bit of nudity or gore to interest the kids! Plus, I thought it was sticky to use about 3 minutes of "Resident Evil 2" in the movie ... Was it supposed to be a charge? Because it was the most goriest and most interesting part of the movie.
