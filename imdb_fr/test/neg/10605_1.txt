OK, Number One - this "movie" is a "90's" version of a crappy show from the 70's that nobody remembers! Number two - As soon as the movie started, I was confused, it was as if I was walking halfway through the movie! There was no conspiracy! it was very annoying! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but it's not credible for me, the skinny little Omar Epps can chase a great unarmed man and make him talk! It's a ridiculous "plot". I'm sorry, but for me, children nowadays can not even put their pants on one leg at a time, let alone catch "wicked, illegal killers". I went out of the theater and asked for and got my money back! I do not recommend this movie to anyone over 12!
