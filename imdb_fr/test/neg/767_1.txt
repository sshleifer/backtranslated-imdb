Although credited as a cartoon of Tom and Jerry, it is not the team of the cat and the mouse, but a previous scam of Mutt-and-Jeff showing them going to Africa and disguising themselves in makeup in burnt cork stereotyped to try to blend. Although the dialect humor is rather lame, there is a brief musical sequence featuring "black skeletons" that was fun. However, I have to ask: how could Tom and Jerry have been made up even after being thrown into the water several times? One of the many entries produced by Van Beuren for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO reached an agreement with Disney. Do not miss it if you're a fan of animation or interested in how certain ethnic groups have been stereotyped as entertainment since the time.
