this film, although it may be considered a good comedy attempt, is not what the previews have done. the first half is composed of typical robin Williams material, although he did not make much of a voice; He has always been great with lineups and hitting strike lines ... Somewhere during the election, the computer program used during the elections is a problem. here's where the net 3 comes in ... a woman who helped with this program wants the truth to be told and the evil society wants to shut her up ** treats ** her boyfriend is even helping them, though this is not not even fleshed out ... this film could have been a brilliant political (perhaps with sorken under the reigns) but it lacks a stew prepared by too many chefs
