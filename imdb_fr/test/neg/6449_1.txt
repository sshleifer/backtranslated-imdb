This piece of horrible guts is everywhere. The script is bad, the plot is bad, the acting is bad. There are some worthy actors (Charles Durning, for example), but the director did not get anything out of it. Santa Claus, depressed and thinking that no one needs him anymore, takes a little girl from one country to another to try to bring back her father and mother. It includes a scammer in Santa Claus costume with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder (played by "Isaac" of The Love Boat), the world's tallest elf (played by Bruce Vilnach - a very funny man, but no actor ), a hardened Plant Owner who makes his employees work overtime on Christmas Eve and a sled race where someone cuts one of Santa's skis to try to win. If the plot sounds bad, it's worse on the small screen. If you see this upcoming movie, go ahead, do not walk to your TV and unplug it. You may want to boil your TV to eliminate any remaining infection. If you accidentally watch more than 10 minutes, you may need to burn your television and ask the cable company to install new lines.
