It's sad what they let in film festivals these days. I had to spend over twenty minutes of this sad short film that was not funny at all to get a good spot for a feature film I wanted to see at a local film festival. The organizers of the festival have associated this horrible short film with a superb feature. I'm just happy that the feature film is good, otherwise I would not have been a very happy camper! <br /> <br /> For a comic short film, it does not make you laugh. The title says it all.
