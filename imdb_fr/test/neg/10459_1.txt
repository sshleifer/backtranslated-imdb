As other posters commented that it was a very bad movie (keep it friendly for kids), FX was lower class, they should spend the US dollar on coke. As is typical in these D movies, most victims die and leave a mystery, with the exception of a lucky soul and of course the track. I hope the money was worth it for Boxleitner, a big step since Babylon 5. Good to see what happened to Buck Rogers, but hey, it was low even for him. "It was so serious and on the older actors, you could even seem to say that they thought it was so bad. Do not look. <br /> <br /> ***** Warning Spoiler below **** <br /> <br /> This case chased everyone after and yet Boxlietner escaped ... that was pure BS. And the end? How on earth did the children end up with him? It was just too stupid.
