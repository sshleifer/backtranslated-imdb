I will talk about this film from two different angles. The first is the point of view of if someone sees the film and never reads (and never reads) the book. The second is from someone who has. <br /> <br /> (Film without book) From the point of view of the film, it was a good movie. Nowhere near as good as one of the underworld, but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking about conspiracy either. The visual effects were doubtful in many areas, although the transformation of the wolf was very pleasant. The characters have very little development and Vivian did not even really seem to worry that her "love" was killing what was left of her kind. Some of the other characters might have had more air time, like The Five. The plot was very similar to Underworld for my tastes. <br /> <br /> (Film WITH book) As many of them have said, apart from the title, the character names and some minor parts, the film and the book are nothing. alike. In the film, Gabriel was much older and was Rafe's father (Astrid was his companion). In the book, Gab was about 24 years old and never linked to anyone since wolves became partners for life (Astrid tries to win her affection) and Astrid was Ulf's mother, not Rafe. Another important thing is the location. The book was held in Riverview, Maryland. In addition, the reason they left West Virginia is very different. According to the film, it is Vivian's fault and all her family was killed because of it. In the book, the leader of the Five, named Axel, killed a girl from their school. The hunters tracked down the wolves and killed many (Viv's father included), forcing them to move. In addition, Viv's mother, Esme was a major character. <br /> <br /> One thing in the book that could have improved the film would have been the "dance of the bitch". For those who do not know, it is the ordeal where all the bitches (females of the pack) fight to see who is the companion of the new leader (since a while ago, there had been a fight for the males) . Vivian won, trying to save his mother from Astrid (who is a horrible perverse woman in the book) and had to mate with Gab. There was no prophecy! Anyway, if you read the book and you liked the book, I strongly suggest NOT to see this movie.
