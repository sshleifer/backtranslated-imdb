Why every time I mention this film to someone, I have to hear 10 minutes of praise about it. I have come to the conclusion that any film that has a twist on a twist is called "genius" by anyone who looks at it. Is this really what the film has become? Or whenever someone says "Wow, it's so cool" everyone has to agree with them and does not have a personal opinion? How this movie has a rating of 7.5 is a shame for the film industry in general. It has also become another film that "needs" two sequels, so I'll have to hear about this horrible franchise for quite some time. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the movie and why it's too bad. The original concept of this movie is actually not so bad, because there has not been a good serial killer movie for a while. The writing of this film is horrible, as is the performance. OK, so it's a low-budget movie, but that should not change the story or the writing. The actors could not be worse in their attempt to scare us from this killer or just from this movie. So they go looking for a big name in Danny Glover, but his talents (whatever they are) are in vain because HIS CHARACTER IS WITHOUT VALUE. Why was he even in this movie? What was all his fight at the end proved useless and misleading for what the public thinks is happening. This is of course the intention of the filmmakers, but could not we have found a better way to do it without making us look at all this garbage. And then the "big" turn comes (was it the third or fourth?) And the whole audience is shocked and goes out of the theater as if it were some kind of masterpiece. Of course, the film leads people to talk about the screenplay and what is not, but it was not the only flaw in this movie. The staging was trying to be too creative in his work. Rewind sequences were used only as a shock effect. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, even if you enjoyed it, go back to see the movie again and you'll soon understand why it's not up to the praise it gets. If you have not done it yet, take a look at Se7en. That's what this movie wanted to be. I had more arguments about this movie than probably any other and I will continue to argue against it. Please, do not support this franchise not only for your good, but also for mine and for all others. Hollywood has to find a good horror movie, rather than 1,000 remakes, sequels and shock movie (like this one). Oh yes, saw 2 looks very promising: "Oh yes, there will be blood." Yaaayyyy !!!! Sugar!! blood, it must mean that it's good, right? Leave me alone. Sorry everyone who loves this movie, but bad writing, brilliant direction and bad acting do not make a good movie.
