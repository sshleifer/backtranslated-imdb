A new guard in the armored truck is recruited by his colleagues to steal $ 42 million from the truck. No bad, so no one will be hurt, right? Of course, things go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and right the situation by saving the life of a dying man. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I really had no interest in that. movie, but I had no interest in Fantastic Mr Fox either, and this movie made my top 10 of the year. The armor is even more disappointing than I thought. As a burglary film, it can not deliver the goods, it is boring and intriguing, and it makes sense to hurt yourself by thinking about it. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the film has a very nice distribution, but the film does not even use that to its advantage. Everyone seems lost in wooden characters who make stupid choices. Columbus Short is an uninteresting track that is never charismatic and never gives the audience a taste for daring. Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the robbery and he plays the role of Mr. Nice Guy at first, and then when things do not go as planned, he quickly becomes the bad guy. Lawrence Fisburn, Jean Reno, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amaury Nolasco from Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia from Heros are also part of the cast. None of them do a lot and when they really do something, it is without too much reasoning. <br /> <br /> The film is relatively short, but even with a range of less than 90 minutes, he felt trailed. How long can you make a movie about a guy stuck somewhere? Phonebooth did a decent job and he was even more restricted. The logic jumps regarding the plot here are tragic. 42 million and all the security they have are recordings every hour or so? From what I understood, the whole plan was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Pretend to be hit and burn the trucks. They would then leave with the money. Of course, something is wrong, or there would be no movie, right? After a series of unfortunate events, the so-called hero was trapped in the truck with a wounded policeman. The rest of the movie is Dillion and his team knocking on doors to enter. How exciting. <br /> <br /> The scenario calls our hero to have financial problems, he could lose his house, which makes him lose his brother. You see, both of their parents are dead, and there are only two left to look at each other. So now he has a reason to join the heist. At first he did not want to go home, but his money problems are the ideal solution to throw him into the heat of the moment. As is practical. <br /> <br /> The whole armored genre in the heist genre is that it comes from an armored truck, guys who drive it. After this basic premise, the film falls flat on his face. I found myself wanting it to end sooner and earlier each time someone spoke. Speaking of the end, it sucks. <br /> <br /> Ignore it.
