If the movies where the virtual reality characters come to life and they are all tough guys or female candies interest you, then maybe this movie is not a total loss of movie. It goes without saying that the vast majority of people will find that it is an absolute boredom, that it has little talent as a comedian and even less a scenario. Yes, Athena Massey is nice to watch, but it's the only positive thing I can say about this disaster.
