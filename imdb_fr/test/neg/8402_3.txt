I have heard that Novo has been compared to Memento for the simple fact that they both rely on key characters suffering from short-term memory loss. Well, it's like comparing The Silence of the Lambs and Friday the 13th as involving a character who killed several people. They could not be more separated in their ideas. <br /> <br /> Novo deals with a copyist in a company that has a short-term memory loss. He is regularly followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to sleep with him in the office. Then comes a temporary employee who gets involved and may not use it to make love. Needless to say, he has a lot of sex on the screen. <br /> <br /> Wait, there is more. There is a boy who encounters troubled amnesia and it is obvious that this boy does not just bump him up. And there is a notebook that the man keeps to try to remember important clues. <br /> <br /> I confess that I'm not the type to make films of foreign manufacture. It does not bother me to read the subtitles, but I do not mind that sometimes takes away one of my favorite aspects of a movie: a good dialogue. Since they have to translate, or I would not be able to understand most of the time, I honestly believe that they simplify what the characters have to say. This film was no exception. the dialogue was right, well, blah. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was interesting enough to keep me around for 98 minutes. Odd, yes, but I do not live in France, so I do not know their tastes and lifestyles. (For example, I suppose it's okay for a father to lie with the son on the beach and frolic with his son on the beach - it must be a cultural affair.) Fortunately, it was not more than two hours spent watching this man find his past and progressively progressing towards his recovery. Because, when the "secret" is learned, I was really like? Okay, then. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend it for a rather decent acting game, handsome guys and soft-porn sex situations (like every 2 to 4 minutes), but if you're not in this kind of scene, I would jump wholeheartedly this film slow and upsetting.
