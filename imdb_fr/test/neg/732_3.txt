I will admit that once I started watching this movie, he took me by force and forced me to look at it until it was finished. Maybe it was a latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero blame his victim, or maybe a fascination that he get funds to make, distribute and show this movie that had kept me in search of merit, or perhaps even bizarre wish fulfillment fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the pain. But no luck. <br /> <br /> You are therefore warned not to start looking at it, lest the same thing happen to you. There is nothing worth losing your hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The fake documentary in the first person and the story of Fabian's "quest" to permeate the women of the Malvinas appear even more like a sophomoric (perhaps Freshman - High School Freshman, that is) a film student project that you could imagine. The effect ends up being both sneering at local people (who, aside from the two professional leaders, are actually real people), as well as engaging in a rather disgusting sexual policy (whether you take it in the proper sense or in the symbolic sense, it is useless). and sexist). <br /> <br /> The reason I ended up looking all the way is the same reason that once one starts to tackle a crust, there is an irresistible fascination to continue to do it until it's completely extinguished, even when you know it's bad for you. You just want to see what happens. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a rather dishonest film, because it finally seems to have no moral center, no elucidation of the local political situation, nor of place in the genre of the universe of politico-sexual-personal film at the Goddard. In short, he has nothing to say and spends a lot of time pretending that this is the case. Smug would be the slogan in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> I would suggest to filmmakers to rent "Waiting for Guffman" several times, or even "Blair Witch Project" if they want to continue their project a little more style and emotion a little more authentic. Or at least the value of entertainment.
