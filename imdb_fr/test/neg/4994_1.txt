With the Terrible game, the hideous dialogue, the multitude of bad mood, the rotten plot and the terrible movie. It must be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I'm the king of bad movies. For the effects, they simply shed fake blood on people and objects, without wasting time creating wounds and creating special effects worthwhile. Most people who make low-budget horror movies do at least something that looks like sheaths of fabric or something that makes them feel heartbreaking. The dialogue was far from even decent and the acting was without direction or effort. They just threw some actors on a set and said, have to do. I swear I saw better films from my movie that I'm classing at school. How did it ever happen to have a DVD?
