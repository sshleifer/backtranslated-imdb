You know, I really hate the IMDb censorship system, because all my criticism has almost disappeared if you eliminate the curse. But we are going. Assembly time! <br /> <br /> Is Saint Moley so bad? I thought it might be a cool little movie, judging from the plot summary, since I've already blindly rented pearls like Frailty and American Nightmare before. But it's just abominable. This is a murderer who uses the works of Edgar Allen Poe as a reference for his deadly exploits and the story of a detective who must arrest him. Can not these blithering hacks make a good movie without staining the grave of a great horror writer? I mean, the murders here are completely devoid of thought and originality, and the references to Poe are misleading and factitious, without sufficient thought. They are shallow and they are ashamed of Poe's work. Full of holes, with a horrible sequence. The acting is bad too, reminding me of the abortion that was known in some third world countries as "Fear X", with all the lines of pause and not emotional. <br /> <br /> I realize it's an independent film, but it's not an excuse. I've seen high school students act better than those morons, and I myself could have imagined better scenes of killing and a better scenario, with enough time. <br /> <br /> This has no reason to exist. Avoid at all costs.
