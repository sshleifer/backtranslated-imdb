I can not believe that I sat through this garbage can. Palm trees in DC (already mentioned), a dummy piece of dead body so artificially that I thought it was ABOVE to be a model ... until it left a trace of blood ... a dialogue tense, a ridiculous plot. I think it's a pity that Jill Ireland's last movie before her death was so bad. Do not waste your time - I would not like to have. The only thing that saves is that it was on a cable, so I did not waste my money on anything else.
