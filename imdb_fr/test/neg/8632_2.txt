If I had to choose the most depressing film, try to be suspensive, I have already seen. I know how good the original is supposed to be, better to be better than this one. The movie is so dark and depressing, but it's not interesting to watch either - I've seen some depressing "thriller" movies that have been saved because of the suspense of thwarting and balance the dark quality. Vanishing did not have that, it was so annoying to watch and there was nothing positive to make it a classic movie. I think another poster of IMDb was right to say that this genre just saw thrillers to be done in a much superior way. I totally agree, I would recommend not using this one. Maybe I'll look at the original someday, but I doubt it. I give it a 2 out of 10.
