The untold origin of the Lone Ranger. It shows who he was and how and why he became the ranger. <br /> <br /> Legendary bomb. The idea was not bad: reinventing and introducing the Lone Ranger to the public of the 1980s. From the beginning, there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to no longer appear anywhere under the name of Lone Ranger. This led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know people who refused to see the film because of the way Moore was treated. They also hired Klinton Spilsbury, a talented talented, to play the Ranger. Spilsbury was very handsome and muscular but had absolutely no charisma and could not act. In fact, all his vocal performance was replayed by another actor! In addition, his off-screen antics (public drunkenness and beating people) do not help things. By acting aside, the script is dull and slow. In addition, the ranger himself does not show up before one o'clock! There were some complaints at the time that the film was too violent for a PG. However, I do not think it was so bad. <br /> <br /> There are some (very few) things that are done here: the photography was really beautiful; Michael Horse was excellent as Tonto; Christopher Lloyd is very funny as a villain and when the Lone Ranger finally arrives (with William Tell Overture resonating from the soundtrack), it's really exciting. But overall, it's a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the Lone Ranger. It's easy to see why this was bombarded. A 4 - mainly for photography.
