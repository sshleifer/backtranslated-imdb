It was not a good movie. Badly scripted and interpreted - the concept was not new, the effects mediocre and not a showcase for Arnold Vosloo who is really a half-decent actor. I watched it under some protest and I only remembered having seen it until the end - it's unforgettable. The actors' play seemed to consist of a certain number of glare and glances devoid of all sincerity. I was still expecting that to happen and I was just hoping it would end. As for the medical elements - well, I was not expecting a faithful version of the emergency events, but it was just comical - I'm a Dr., so I know what I mean - and the operational elements are simply ridiculous. <br /> <Do not waste your precious time - unless you have absolutely nothing else to do - go out, call a lost friend for a long time, watch the paint dry out, organize the draw of your socks, perform housework. AVOID at your own risk.
