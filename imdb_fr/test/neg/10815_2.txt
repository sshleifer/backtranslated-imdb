I can not help but forget this incredible scene in Alien, when the alien came out of the chest of one of the men. Or even in Predator, when the invisible monster sneaked on the disconcerted soldiers and reduced them to pieces. These two films have expressed fascinating ideas about the ordinary creature function. Go back to the days of nerdy B movies and watch great men in fictitious costumes parade around killing people in small towns. Recognize now that the two films above have revolutionized this genre. The cave does nothing to improve it. He's not trying anything new and, even worse, The Cave does not even taste good. Shame on them, shame on everyone. <br /> <br /> In sexy Spandex, one-dimensional characters from The Cave. Which seems not to worry about the death of their colleagues. They walk around, unbeknownst to the wicked creature hiding in the darkness. The plot is very easy to understand. So you have both brothers, the black guy and the sexy scientist. The others (by the rest, I mean all those who meet gruesome deaths) are even more exhilarating than the others. We have the Korean assistant, the dangerous outdoor chick, a Russian scientist and two divers, both of whom are lacking emotion and are stupid enough to go astray on their own. This film is far from being extremely clich√©, since everyone except the black man, one of the brothers and the scientific woman ends. It also seems that only Americans can survive terror, since Russians and Koreans are dying. Do not be offended if I give details. Anyway, there is no real surprise. <br /> <br /> To be honest, they find this cave. They go to the cave. They are stuck in the cave. They begin to die in the cave. One of them is infected in the cave. More die in the cave. They come out of the cave. only to discover that one of them has a parasite that will turn them into a horrible monster, which really does not seem to bother them. It's the simplicity of the dull plot. He does not even try to be original. There is even the part where they decide that their leader is not able and separates. We have seen it many times before. <br /> <br /> I know that in a film like this, people do not care about performance but it's worth mentioning how bad they were. Everyone is so sad. Cole Hauser was particularly simple and did not throw me into Eddie Cibrian, who is often much better. Morris Chestnut is undoubtedly the best thing of the film. His performance is really decent. He portrays the guy who calms everyone. All the other actors are at best average. In a show like this, it's really not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the reason why we are going to this kind of movie; the action, of course. Well, to my regret, the action was dull. The scenes of death are all boring, the whole movie was. There is almost no blood at all. It is either they disappear and found later, or they are attacked and die without a bruise. Seeing the death of the Korean man was the only exciting action I could find. <br /> <br /> It's pretty amazing. Bad things shade most good things. A good example is that the special effects were well done, what they were. The only thing that is wrong is that since everything happens in a cave, it will be dark. I found it extremely difficult to distinguish the cave walls from the monsters. It was therefore difficult to see the creatures. Although I liked the special effects, the monsters were not original. They were all alike and they were not scary at all. <br /> <br /> The Cave marks the beginning as director of Bruce Hunt. I do not see what he was trying to accomplish while doing this movie. He obviously made a huge mistake. Almost everything in this movie is like a stink bomb. A stink bomb is probably even nicer than watching this mess again. Only the most indulgent film buffs will find this forgivable. I gave up hope in the middle of the film when I heard the expression "what was it" for the third time.
