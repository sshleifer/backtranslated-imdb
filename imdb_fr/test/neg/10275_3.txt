I know that my resume looks very hard, but this movie has a very limited appeal. The average Joe would have a hard time staying with this movie. The entire film consists of animated lumberjacks doing their work and dancing on floating logs. All this is done with very bright and artistic colors and the film could be good to show to the clients in an art museum. However, unless you really like that kind of art or are a Canadian who loves movies in your home country, it will probably be almost impossible to finish. I have a big tolerance for this kind of thing and I even had to force myself to watch after a few minutes. I can respect the work done, but it's not convincing.
