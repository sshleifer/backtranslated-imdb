Despite the excellent cast and potential of the story, this film fails on many levels. I was convinced that the director was a beginner. The film is very poorly mounted, shows a lot of unimportant and annoying flashes, has very visible blunders and has no atmosphere of suspense. The question that kept coming back to my mind when I looked at it was, "so what?" I do not care about the character and what happens to him. It's not that the story is not convincing, it's just the way it's told. The film tells the story. PERIOD. It's like an actor mumbling his lines without knowing what he's saying. The film simply tells the events that occur, without any soul. And the director is to blame. He does not know how to do something interesting, suspensive or pleasant. (And believe me, I'm NOT someone who wants to see 8 or 2 shitty fast 2, on the contrary, I particularly like slow-moving movies.) So I was convinced that the director was a beginner. But to my astonishment, this man has years of experience and worked as a director of photography or assistant cameraman in many fantastic productions. I guess he had a bad year at the time.
