It's a very strange movie, with an unnamed cast and hardly anything known about it on the web. He uses a familiar approach to those who have watched films like Creepshow in the sense that he introduces a trilogy of short films called "horror" and mixes them in a connection story of the people involved in the segments that come down from a bus. There is a narrator who talks about relationships, but his conversation adds absolutely nothing to the mix and only adds to the confusion. Regarding the stories themselves, well ... I swear I do not understand why this film got a certificate of 18 in the UK, which would bring it closer to those of Nightmare On Elm Street and The Exorcist. Nothing here is even scary. There is no gore, sex, nudity or even a big word to animate things, it's the kind of thing you could broadcast on children's TV and no one would let go. I can only think that if he got the rating he really deserved (a PG), no serious horror fan would be seen dead, so the dealer probably shoved the BBFC until he gave in . Anyway, here are the 3 stories in summary: 1. A man becomes dangerously obsessed with his telekinetic car to the point of alienating his fiancee. 2. A man living in a filthy apartment is naturally panicked when a living organism has evolved from its six-month old tuna casserole. 3. A woman thinks she has found the perfect man through an online dating service ... until he begins to act strangely ... And that's it. Some of them are quite amusing because of their wacky places (my favorite being the number 2) but you have the feeling that they were supposed to be a) scary and b) morality games, unfortunately they fail miserably on the two shots. In summary, this film is an obscure curiosity .. for very good reasons.
