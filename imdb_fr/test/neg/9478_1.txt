Exactly what the world needed - another superficial film with cookie cutter, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. This film sends horrific messages to girls around the world, with a stereotypical "junior high" experience. They make learning seem totally taboo. I can not stand the false French accents nor these types of mopeds that end up "falling" in love with the twins. Why do I put everything in parentheses? Because everything is stereotyped. The twins even complain about not having a stereotypical grandfather. They should be happy to even have a grandfather. How does it fit the Mary-Kate / Ashley mold? This one is repairing a single guy who (panting!) IS NOT THEIR FAT !!!!! Yes, they actually have a mother who appears for five seconds. I did not even sit for thirty minutes and I can already say how it's going to end. This film is so pitiful that Miss USA looks like a university bowl. Really.
