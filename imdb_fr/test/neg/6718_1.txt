The Lord has mercy! Why was this film made? Why did Seagal and rising star Max Ryan agree to participate? The stranger is so terribly bad in every conceivable way that he is staggering. <br /> <br /> The film has an ultra-cheap appearance. Like a budget of a few dollars was far from their reach. What is worse is that the manufacturers know it and try to make it smooth to compensate. The result is a film that does not seem right. The fighting scenes are so boring and edited "quietly" to hide the fact that Steven Seagal is out of shape. None of them are engaging or exciting. The plot is a nonsense that is of no interest and has no particularity. Places in Eastern Europe (a clever decision of producers to reduce the budget or nonexistent) seem unpleasant and should not be used as a backdrop to a film of action (what action?). <br /> And what is the problem with the title? As far as I know, everyone in the movie was alien. What ONE is the title referring to? <br /> <br /> The DVD is in 1.85: 1 anamorphic widescreen format and Dolby 5.1 sound. Neither are remarkable enough to warrant even a single rent. The stranger is not worth a second of your time. I must love this slogan tho! "If they think they can stop it, they are completely wrong." Sheesh!
