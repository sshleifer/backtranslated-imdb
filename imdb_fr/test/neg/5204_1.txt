**** SOME SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film that you have not seen surfing the net yet. Nothing is shocking about this film. In the film, a man sodomizes a goat, there is a bulldozing beheading and the face of a lesbian is burned. All these scenes of "extreme violence" are so false that one wonders why anyone would even want to resurface this waste. I just can not believe I spent hard-earned money on what must be the worst movie ever. Do not let the critics deceive you, this film would be a shame for anyone ... except maybe prisons who want to torture detainees. For a classic of exploitation, check out Bloodsucking Freaks or even the most recent generation of Doom. The island of death sinks to the bottom of the toilet of the film and must disappear completely.
