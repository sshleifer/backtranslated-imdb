I saw this film in a cinema-club in Germany in 1970. Most of the participants came from the local private school where I taught. I had already seen some of Godard's films while living in France and, although they were not my favorites, I could at least understand them. Being able to speak French helped me. <br /> <br /> The harmless beginning of "The Weekend" has quickly turned into a kaleidoscope of images, very well, perhaps too well photographed, which does not make sense for me anymore. For me, movies, like books, must have a clear meaning. That does not have for me. I guess I'm not "in" the artistic films. The pictures still haunt me from the movie. To this day, I refuse to eat rabbit meat, much appreciated by the French. Those who saw the film could understand why. Yes, the theme of materialism has passed, but cannibalism, the sinking of the car and all the scenes of destruction and horror have only made me sick. I do not know if I went out before the end, but I certainly wanted to. I promised myself never to watch another Godard film, and I will not do it and I will never do it knowingly. <br /> <br /> My opinion: nothing. It was the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. Others may have been more inept, stupid or stupid. I forgot these scenes while scenes of it will haunt me forever.
