Probably one of the biggest celluloid waste of the last 100 years. Not only does he suffer from an incoherently painful (and extremely predictable) script, but it is clearly a true copy of Alien II. After five minutes, I correctly predicted who would die and who would not die (and in what order). The special effects are laughable; there is a scene where a crew member is mutilated (unconvincingly) by two krites that look like a pair of teddy bears and where the humor is appalling and misplaced. There is better to do with a VCR remote than using it to watch this movie.
