The worst film ever seen. Worse acting too. I can not imagine a movie worse then. Nothing to see. No actor at all. Actors should look for another job. I do not understand who was stupid enough to invest money in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry about Eric Roberts. It must be hard ... I can not imagine how badly his mortgage must be HUUUGE to justify his decision to take the job! /> Regarding LEADING MAN ... what a lead! It's better to be on a leash and stay there! I can see him more able to bark than to act. <br /> <br /> General Note: Do not rent, do not buy!
