I found this gem in a rack that the local video store had with cassettes exchanged between several rental agencies. "The man who skied Everest". Hmm ... I have never heard of it. In the box, we see a Japanese who has always wanted to go down Everest and who did it. It seems interesting. I rented it. As expected, it was documentary style. The first part can be summed up as follows: "I always wanted to go down Mount Everest". This is followed by some images of preparation for the event. MANY sequences of preparation. OK, I guess it takes a lot of preparation. We then go on to a long article on the skier, Yuichiro Miura's philosophy on life, etc. More charge follows and I start to wonder where the ski fits into this show. More preparation is shown and they begin to make the trip to the mountains. More philosophy is shown. Finally, they come to the mountains and maybe he can ski in the mountains. Many filmed sequences later describe the parachute device intended to slow down the Miuras speed on the steep slope. Finally, he ties the skis and prepares to leave. <br /> <br /> He left ... He skis about twenty meters and his skis spring from beneath him, he unfurls the parachute and drops himself into an unglamorous fagot. a certain distance on the mountain and that's it. End of the story. What was that? <br /> <br /> Okay, I can say that he always wanted to go down Everest, make many preparations and try it out with a film crew. It did not work out and he ended up falling down and getting almost everyone, so what extreme pride would he inspire the man to take out a movie and call it skiing in Everest? Maybe the title "The man who kicked under him and slid on his ass to the bottom of Everest" was too long for the cassette box.
