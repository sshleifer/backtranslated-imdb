For most people, RoboCop 3 is the movie that is really the big shame of the Robo series. He has few fans and most people hate him for his shameless commercial approach to the PG-13. Now, I'm not going to say that RoboCop 3 is good. Frankly, it sucks enough. But being a film properly shot and executed, it surpasses this circuit chaos. Yes, the truth is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of two bad and useless suites to a near-masterpiece. And if RoboCop 3 makes Robo a cartoon super hero in an ultra-mainstream production that kids will enjoy - at least they do it openly. I do not know where RoboCop 2 starts and ends, I do not know what it's about, who it is, I do not understand what's going on, I do not understand what jokes are deliberate and which are not, I'm going to go crazy if I try to understand the characters, I do not see anything that is anything that everyone says, I can not believe anyone has taken a look at the shooting scenario and figured it would work and I can not believe that Irvin Kirshner finished result and thought he liked what he saw. By the way, he probably did not do it, neither Miller, nor Weller, nor Allen. It is not difficult to see why. <br /> <br /> Now, RoboCop 2 has its fans, I know it. Most of the time, they belong to this league of absolute anti-claims, rejecting anyone who expects a depth or subject from the first film, as academic apprentices of Roger Ebert Sith. The argument is that it's just a lot of fun, a good action and a good entertainment. Yeah, I guess if you do not listen to what one of the characters says, you can fool yourself, we might as well have Arnold in the suit instead of Weller. Do not get me wrong, I like a good action movie, with a value of pure entertainment, because it is only the most satisfying of virtues. But RoboCop 2, sir, is not the same. <br /> <br /> Look at the first two scenes. This horrible actor makes Robo repeat that he is only a machine, then launches in this lyrical speech on the fact that he could never be a man, after which Murphy's wife (who sues OCP for harassment of robots) enters unexpectedly and at this sad moment with him, and then we do not talk about it anymore! I would surely go into this movie scene by scene because everyone has this kind of nonsense in them. It's as if a 12-year-old boy fan made the script, the characters act in a totally random way and say this first, then say that. OCP wants to end the crime with a new Robo, especially this drug called "Nuke", but then, it seems that they really want to become this great capitalist empire and control the entire city. I suppose the policy is abandoned, which is understandable given the cartoon's mayor, The villain (played by Tom Noonan, who made a better version of this in Last Action Hero and that says a lot) is a drug addict but is still used for this machine. The woman behind all this has an incomprehensible agenda. <br /> <br /> About twelve, this film has the infamous role of "Hub", this crazy child who swears and kills people, played by a child actor. I'm not going to be quite moral about it, it's a free world and if you want a psychopathic kid in your action movie, go for it. I do not know to what extent Frank Miller's initial vision has been implemented, but credits recognize him at least as the designer of "history". And if I zoom out, I could see that as a pretty cool character. It's certainly sinister to have a maniac killer kid, but again, it's the world of RoboCop and who would be surprised? This whole affair with the OCP, which is trying to become this giant monopoly on everything, is really dystopian and good too. In addition, the idea that RoboCop comes into contact with his wife and child, integrating them in one way or another into the story, would also be a good idea and, as far as I know, a natural step and logical would be to create a sequel to RoboCop. <br /> <br /> But, of course, these are just ideas. As many people have already said, the scenario is 100% messy. The kid has a scene (the scene of torture) where it is suggested that he is in fact a spoiled stereotype, then we have this unimaginable scene where he dies and becomes all sweet and friendly towards the head. Why does not he just take his uzi and try to get him down with his last breath? Is not that what his character would do? Does he give his life for a second on his deathbed? Not necessarily, since his last words are "it sucks", so why? It really does not make any sense and it can be said about everyone, not everything, in this movie. Is there a strike in the police? Is RoboCop a machine or a man? What's wrong with turning Robo into this community service machine for 10 minutes? I mean, of course, it's pretty funny, I would not deny it. But why build it, then throw it? And why the hell is Allen so criminally underutilized? and what is it that Weller has an obvious desire to express with his character and yes, well, the sons are numerous and the mess is enormous. <br /> <br /> This criticism is as messed up as the movie. The only reason I give an extra star up there is because of the actors in the first movie, I'm sure they had good intentions. I mean it's something pretty stable, a sort of anchor in this sea of ​​bad film.
