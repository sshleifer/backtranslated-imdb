If I did not like the film, apart from the pure ugliness of the actors themselves, it's because someone could actually believe that. <br /> <br /> First, the second coming of Christ will be at the end of words, and when Jesus Christ comes on the day of judgment, He will not come as He did before, in human form. He will come in all his glory as God and we will be judged not only for our sins, but also for the consequences of our actions. Everyone will! Secondly, I saw the eternal gay pride illustrated in this film by the indisputable "I read the Bible last night and it is written nowhere". Well it is. Moses quotes three times different men who make love with other men or women who make love as if the man and his wife were to be killed, because they will never inherit the kingdom of God, because they are fetid! If we really had to follow the Bible word for word, there would be executions now, would not it? But I think that misinforming people does more harm than it would ... It was in the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of crazy people in psychiatry who think they are the Son of God, but a movie after that really makes you think of the number of idiots who can make a movie.
