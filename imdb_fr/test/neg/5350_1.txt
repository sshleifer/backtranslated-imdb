This film supports self-righteousness! He gives freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and in the end, he is free! Quite despicable, there is also adultery in this film. The character of Connaughey has a crush on Bullock and the film has some of these stereotypes of experimental films (such as the important news brought to the court at short notice) that make all aesthetically demanding moviegoers sick. me! I really can not believe someone loved this junk. It is a film so bad and so fraught with false ideals that I fail to present my critic as eloquently as it is pleasant. When are the Americans going to wake up and discover that they are being handled 24/7 by movies like these that turn reality into a BS where there is justice for all if they just take it between their hands. This cowboy attitude makes me sick and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong with America!
