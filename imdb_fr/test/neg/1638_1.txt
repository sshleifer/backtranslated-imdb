The credits come from Sandy Frank's assembly work that was done to turn this film into Cave Dwellers for a reissue. Now that it's cleared up ... oh! Excruciating and oculative pain. The Blade Master shamelessly jumps on the movement of the sword and witchcraft thrown by Conan's movies ... except that the movement never left the garage anyway. As such, this Italian film is a failure that tries to snatch a box-office failure, with predictable results. However, this would give too little credit to the director and writers, who make no effort to maintain a coherent plot, continuity, a semblance of continuity from one era to another. Miles O'Keefe is not an important man, now or forever (Tarzan The Ape Man proved it, if Ator did not do it). Just an unpleasant image and a chore to watch.
