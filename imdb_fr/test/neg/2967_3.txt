There have been very few good moments in this film. Only a few characters have been fleshed out and not very well. There were mine holes big enough to pass a truck. The step was like an old man. There have been many moments when the film never came back as Coco's striptease. What happened to him? What about Garci's sister? Is she better now? What about Leroy? We did not learn anything about him. What about the electronic piano guy? What about the rich girl who had an abortion? What happened to him? It was an interesting secondary plot. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a good movie and I recommend another musical that appeared in this movie. MAKE WARP TIME STILL !!!!!!!
