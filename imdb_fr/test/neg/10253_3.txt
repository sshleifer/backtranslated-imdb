I readily admit that I watch a lot of very bad movies. But there are very few things I think are as bad as When Women Had Tails. It is a stink of epic proportions. What should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is rather a dull and lifeless affair, without a single laugh to have. The comedy is extremely weak. I guess if you think hitting someone in the head is funny, you might find a laugh or two. The guys in this movie make the Three Stooges look like great art. And there is simply not enough intrigue to keep everything together. It seems like it's hanging around again and again. <br /> <br /> Well, you may be wondering, "If it's as bad as you say, why did not you notice it less than 3/10?" Good question! And I have two answers. First, the film is not devoid of curiosity value. I find some interest in an Italian parody of movies like One Million Years B.C. with Raquel Welch. I will give a point to When Women Had Tails for its historical "value". The other two points concern the mere presence of Senta Berger. I know it's not really an explanation or reasoning for a rating, but what are you going to do? It's the best I can find.
