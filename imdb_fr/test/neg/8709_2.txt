I had high hopes for this film. I even gave up a Stargate watch night for this movie. I found that there was a hurry feeling about it and a lot of key biblical moments and facts were missing. I am perhaps a little jaded and spoiled for the 1956 version, because I look at it every year for twenty years. I doubt that this one will reach the realm of the annual classic, like the other one did. If you have not seen the 19546 version, you may like this one, but I seriously doubt it and urge you to skip it and go rent or buy the classic version. It has some interesting special effects, but that's not what I'm looking for when I tell a film like the Ten Commandments. I was looking a bit at how they told the story, and the writers did not work well with it.
