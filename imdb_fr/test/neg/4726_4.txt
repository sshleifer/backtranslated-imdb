This is another notorious Mexican horror film: however, although the original Spanish version is quite docile, all sorts of gore and nudity have been inserted for the dubbed variant in English (prepared by Jerald Intrator - who performed similar tasks on THE CURIOUS DR. HUMPP [1967/71] - and, like the American version of this film, had already been available on DVD through Something Weird / Image)! <br /> <br /> I looked at the original first and, even though it did not make much noise, it was quite interesting - especially with a plot as familiar as this one: a doctor goes beyond the call of duty trying to save the lives of his terminally ill son; he even has an impressive leg assistant (played by Carlos Lopez Moctezuma, who had played a surprisingly similar role - albeit in a more sinister vein - in The Curse of the Crying Woman (1961)). I know that several Mexican films mixed horror with the genre "Lucha Libre" (wrestling) but I had never watched one myself; this element is present here - in fact, the heroine is a wrestler - but the two styles are, fortunately, separated from one another (that said, the wrestling sequences are done with skill, some of the maneuvers are proving very amusing). <br /> <br /> The doctor's son is transformed into a monster (resembling the incredible Hulk with mud splashed on his face!) after transplanting the heart of a monkey - but then, when this is replaced by that of a comatose wrestler, he stays in that position and develops a pair of fangs to start (should not he, realistically, turn into a transsexual ... even if I guess it does not would not have been very interesting) !! The culminating sequence on the roof in which the monster kidnaps a child and witnesses his disappearance at the hands of the police is reminiscent of THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN (1942). My favorite moments that are deliberately amusing in the film, however, occur when the doctor, trying to comfort his son, tells him that he will soon be healed - only to turn his back on him soon after the tears - and also the impatient, he gives his maimed assistant (when he slowly advances in the car) when they are about to chase the monster that has escaped from the laboratory. <br /> <br /> The alternate nude scenes work for the film (these were done by Cardona himself for a more racy Mexican version called HORROR Y SEXO), but his reputation rests largely on the adding material showing excessive violence, such as an eyeball torn from its socket, a scalping and even a person. the head is torn off. There are also several inserts for graphic operations that give rise to a blunder: although it is clear that only two people are involved in the operation, we see a third pair of hands constantly holding an oxygen mask on the face the patient! <br /> <br /> It is also said that the film is a remake of Cardona's horror film in black and white, DOCTOR OF DOOM (1962), but I can not say since I did not watch this one. how much of it was actually pilfered for NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES ...
