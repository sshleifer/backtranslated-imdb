Man alive, is this game bad or what? The graphics are well below average, even if it was a Playstation 1, not to mention a Gamecube. The gameplay is pathetic and the camera moves disorienting. What a worthless game! <br /> <br /> I totally like Warner's Batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games that way. Batman: Vengeance could very well have gone as planned keeping all Gothic visuals and vocalists, but they have seriously stumbled in gameplay and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is not fun to play. I really have to point out how bad the graphics are. Do not let the color schemes fool you. I have seen better things on a Commodore 64.
