A very disappointing film by Oliver Stone who, unlike his recent epic "J.F.K.", does not arouse any real emotion. "Talk Radio" talks about talk show host "Barry Champlain", a very noisy and insightful man who manages to annoy a lot of people while attracting an audience most of whom fear that you only want to call and mistreat him. His boss in the movie (Alec Baldwin) sums up his character very well by saying that he is just a shoe salesman with a big mouth. And as Barry (Eric Bogosian) is threatened with death, the final outcome is almost inevitable. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that usually has something very powerful to say. However, "Talk Radio" does not make any serious comments and remains a frustrating and useless film. <br /> <br /> Thursday, September 17, 1992 - Video
