It's not a good movie. This is a tried remake of the English movie 'The Hitch'. But that insults the original. This is not a film you expect from a veteran director like 'David Dhawan', credited for making great films like "Raja Babu", "Coolie No.1", "Hero No. 1" ... <br /> The main theme of this film is taken from "The Hitch" with some modifications to please the Indian audience, but the story and the script are not convincing enough. In addition, the role of the lead roles, namely Salman Khan and Govinda, is pitiful. It seems that they need the slightest provocation to remove their shirt and reveal their naked torso. I do not consider it fascinating and less comical than ever. What was the director thinking? In addition, viewers must support the case of Govinda's Over-act. It was simply unbearable. I advise viewers to observe it at your own risk. My score of 2 for this movie could be considered very generous. <br /> <br /> I would rather advise viewers to watch the English movie "Hitch", which is much better.
