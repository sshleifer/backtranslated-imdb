I am a big fan of horror movies and horror movies. When you ride them, it's my focus: the horrible video. However, you will not get it in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is certainly morgue, in the form of abduction and torture of girls, bound naked to various things. The sleaze is not very fishy, ​​though. It was not very high on my sleaze counter, mainly because none of the girls were at least attractive, and they did not try to act as if they were threatened. They seemed to think more about what was planned for lunch, or maybe when they could score points. <br /> <br /> Forget the effects, they were lame in the extreme. The bad action contributed to the lameness; The effects are harder to believe when even actors and actresses do not buy them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was rather bad. They could have hired a couple of cameramen from a porn movie and done better. In fact, it might have increased enough the sleaze factor to make it nice. As it stands, there are many dark shots where you can not see very clearly, and what you can see does not look too good. <br /> <br /> The horror factor is zero. No. Zero. Nada. Zip *: French. Nothing. I saw children's movies that were more scary. There is no camp here either. It's just a movie that tries to be sordid, but does not even come close to it.
