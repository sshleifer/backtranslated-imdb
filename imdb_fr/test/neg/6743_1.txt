Absolutely nothing redeems this total waste, and the only thing worse than seeing this movie is to see it in English class. It's literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. He totally ignores and contradicts all the themes he can present, so the story is really dull. Thank God, the 80s are over, and God save the man who was really born of "James Bond III".
