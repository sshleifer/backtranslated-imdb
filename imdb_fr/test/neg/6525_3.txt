I really liked the idea of ​​traveling between dimensions and I even liked the tension of Wade / Quinn in the first episodes. Some of the worlds they created gave the main characters an extremely interesting backdrop for their stories. However, as the show unfolded, there were more and more stupid arguments between friends and less and less a real bond. There was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescending. And each world had one of the characters falling in love. The writing was getting boring and everything was too exaggerated. Too bad, it would have been nice to have for several years a group of friends very united (Star Wars) traveling in different dimensions, rather than a group of tired gatherers.
