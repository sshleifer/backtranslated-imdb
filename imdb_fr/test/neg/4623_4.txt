Wow! That James Purefoy looks exactly like Thomas Jane! <br /> <br /> This is the deepest thought I had with me after seeing George And The Dragon, quite disappointing. For a fantastic comedy, the story was very bland and the effects not spectacular. <br /> <br /> The problem was not the acting game. James Purefoy is a good knight and his various kicks are not bad characters. I even thought that Patrick Swayze in this role was a very good idea too. Piper Perabo, with a flat chest, also had great potential. I even liked the kid. <br /> <br /> But the story and everything that happens, and the * way *, it happens, it's just "huh". Not interesting. Compared to another recent fantasy comedy, Ella Enchanted, which was actually funny, this movie is terribly short. I'm sorry for the honest actors who were in this galley that was causing a yawn. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
