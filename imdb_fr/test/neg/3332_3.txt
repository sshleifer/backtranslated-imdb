My boss at the time and we showed it at a Halloween party at our office. He is Chris Huntley who co-wrote and acted in this movie. He knows it's bad, we know it's bad and we all agree that the monster looks too much like a vagina to be a coincidence. It may have been a gynecological experience that went wrong. <br /> <br /> It was a VERY VERY LOW budget and the actors were all friends, that's why you are dealing with a "Hey gang, let's organize a show". . <br /> <br /> No one was hurt and it was a first attempt. No problem with that. It made us laugh and it's a good movie to watch with friends and make fun of. :-)
