Cartoon-style special effects, horrible acting and dialogue, and a dry plot! This film has everything! My friend and I went to the blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could make fun of, but it was too much. The film begins with a woman and her son on vacation on a makeup island in the Bahama region. Women, who happen to be a doctor / virologist, are in the area when a man collapses. He has a strange arm wound and she immediately knows it's a contagious virus. The story continues to show a surprisingly fast love story between the two teenagers (this is justified by the word "I know it's fast, but it feels good." ????). the CDC is introduced. We are told that within three months, if the virus is not treated and contained, it will spread to the United States and kill millions of people. This information does not prevent the CDC from leaving the island to save itself. Fortunately, the treatment against this horrible virus is just in time and the whole island is saved. To celebrate the death of their loved ones, the people of the island organize a brilliant party during which everyone dances, has fun and forgets the horrible epidemic that has just occurred.
