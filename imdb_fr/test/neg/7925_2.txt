This movie is so stupid that I want to recover my $ 2.99 for which I paid !! First, this film begins with a group of talented wooden geeks, as if they were chosen somewhere in the street because the "real" actors did not show up because of the ludicrous scenario or because they just could not get someone desperate enough. make this movie! The music of this film is enough to make you sleep, the flute created for the faeries dancing in the desert would not even be enough for this film! And the guy dressed like Satan looks like he's dressed in a special Halloween costume from K-Mart! There are no dead scenes except for a few lame scenes. When I saw what the terrible killers looked like in Nosferatu's robes, I laughed! This is what the whole city is supposed to flee once a year! This film is one of the worst demonic movies I have ever seen. Avoid this one!
