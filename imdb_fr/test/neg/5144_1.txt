Perhaps the worst movie of all time. At least plan 9 from the outside was fun. I can not believe they persuaded anyone to invest money to do this thing. Complete waste of celluloid. Before seeing this shit, I had a certain respect for Kristophersson. I guess someone needed a tax deduction. Please, in the name of all that does not fear anything, stop those who did that, before they suck again! This film should be avoided by anyone who is not under LSD, or by my insane cousin who insists that we are Native American. If you are in the woods and an owl starts talking to you, consult a psychiatrist. There is no need to make a film about it.
