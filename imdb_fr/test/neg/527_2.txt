This film has been moved far too slowly for my taste. The concept of history is refreshing in that it explores the family dynamics of life with a mentally disabled family member in a way that I had never seen on the screen before. The execution of the concept was imperfect. Each character was fully developed in the scene of his first appearance, then had to endure the feeling that each character was trampling the rest of the way. That is to say that each character acted clumsily in his relational. relationships with others in the film, which I found to be a form of emotional and social retardation. I guess this has artistic merit, given the irony of the fact that the story centers on an intellectually deficient individual surrounded by intelligent entities and relatives. I agree with other critics to say that cinematography was beautiful.In summary, I think the film has great artistic value because of the quality of sound and cinematography, but fails emotionally because of the shortcomings described.
