Calling this film a disaster will be a euphemism. I do not even know where to start! However, I have questions and many of them. I would like to know who designed this script? Who gave them money to make this movie? Who was in charge of the casting and the costume designer? They should all be pursued! I saw this film in the catalog of my local library and I thought, "Hey, awesome!" I had just seen the two FOG films produced by Hollywood and I realized that Bollywood had a version. Without my knowledge, this would prove to be a total and total shit party! <br /> <br /> Dhund - the fog, is a film about four friends (in fact, there is only one of them, but know that there are four friends), one of which is a queen of beauty (played by the first lady of India). World, Aditi Govitrikar) and the director spares no effort to let you know. The script even claims that she (the character's name is Simran) has Aishwarya Rai's eyes, Kareena Kapoor's lips and Rani Mukherjee's hair. Do not be shy if you want, at least at this point you have not seen the movie, unlike the poor me. : * (<br /> <br /> Anyway, Simran receives one day death threats from an uncle of the competitors, who tells him to withdraw from the contest so that his niece has better chances to win, but Simran's boyfriend does not allow her to do this and so she enters the contest and wins, prompting her former classmate Tanya's cocaine and crack cocaine uncle to follow her. but with the help of his cousin Kajal, Simran drowns the culprit and they enlist their two friends in the task of getting rid of the body.That is difficult, but they end up doing it. <br /> <br /> In a scene borrowed from the Hollywood film Diabolique, the pool where the corpse is hidden is drained only to reveal that the body is missing and it starts a riddle of Whodunit and Where-is-it? By the time the movie is over, the movie succeeds steals scenes from 'I know what you did last summer, I still know, Scream 1 , Scream 2, Scream 3, Murder, she wrote episodes and did not mtion, Columbo and Scooby Doo '! Shamelessly, I tell you! <br /> <br /> Inconsistencies and problems within the film include but are not limited to: <br /> <br /> 1. Simran, barely dressed, answers three times the phone of his alleged murderer . The camera shows her release the phone, but the phone is able to ring every time and she picks it up to answer. <br /> <br /> 2. Tanya tries to kill herself because she does not win the beauty contest? WTF? Even Aishwarya Rai, ten times better, did not try to commit suicide when she did not win Miss India! <br /> <br /> 3. In the pool scene, children who come to retrieve the ball that fell into the pool easily disappear as soon as the police arrive. And the ball disappears too. <br /> <br /> 4. The killer's blue cliched lenses change from blue to brown in the drowning scene, but when his body resurfaces, his eyes turn blue. <br /> <br /> 5. Nobody who dies in the film is cried (strange, especially for Indian society). <br /> <br /> 6. When Vikram jumps into the dirty and cloudy pool, an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously, the pool is transformed into Olympic size and is clear and clear as the day. <br /> <br /> 7. The sexy belly dancer performs a song drenched in pseudo-orgasms and a dance number on the transition to adulthood. It would have been cool for a bachelor party, but they were celebrating Simran's victory! Hello!!!! <br /> <br /> 8. Kunal, Sameer, Simran and Kajal can neither dance nor beat the rhythm of the lips. But do not blame them, just accept that there was no choreographer for the dance numbers. <br /> <br /> 9. Nothing in the film was choreographed, it's as if they had just told the actors to show themselves and do what they wanted. <br /> <br /> 10. The movie played as if there was no script. Either that, or the director was high and drunk when he filmed this junk! <br /> <br /> 11. When Simran's photo was published without her consent in a magazine, she went to the police headquarters to arrest the photographers. Yet she receives death threats and never bores to alert the police. <br /> <br /> Just to mention a few. of course. This film has been a painful experience for me and I advise everyone to skip it by any means necessary and possible. Bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this kind of movie.
