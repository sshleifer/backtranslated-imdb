Have writers paid people to come here and write positive reviews? I mean, really, it's a little silly, and Spike is not that funny. It seems more than the serious guy is trying too much to be funny. There are so many mediocre concerts in this show; as once, the opening skit was "Talk show, apply directly to the front" again and again. And another starring Spike and another guy getting fucked, and it was not even funny. They did not even do anything except sit and laugh again and again. Ha Ha! And another in which Spike was talking to a Korean who ate duck and told him he had a domestic duck. Ha ha! I mean, really, Spike gets some entertaining guests on his show, that's why people like this show
