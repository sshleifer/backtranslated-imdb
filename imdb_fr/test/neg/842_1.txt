After reading the novel, it does not bother me, for the filming, how different is the scenario, as long as it adheres to the plot, or at least it includes it. For reasons known only in Hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored and a different story is added. The reason this novel has stood the test of time is undoubtedly due to the intertwining of the characters and the intrigue as a whole. To interfere with this structure is to destroy the complex balance of the narrative and, consequently, the intension of the storyteller. Although this is a matter of opinion, the distribution of this film leaves much to be desired. The characters, described as very big, must at least have a corpulent appearance for the character to be credible. The period of slavery can not be over, or actors of this caliber would have been in revolt, before such a parody of history. Marian Halcolme's face is described as having a manly appearance, [...] Tara Fitzgerald's very feminine appearance does not sound right. Once again Laura Fairly is described as "fair", if not "ethereal". Therefore, with her black hair, she does not quite match that of the novel. .... badly done, Hollywood! <br /> <br /> J. hunter
