The Big Knife, a film about the dark side of the Hollywood film industry, looks much more ironically like a movie than a movie. With the exception of a few very brief exhibition scenes, all the action takes place in the film's hero's lounge, performed by Jack Palance. It is a film actor who wants to leave his contract with his studio because of the lack of redeeming qualities in the films they broadcast. His wife (Ida Lupino) is also tired of the studio, not to mention the modest methods of her husband. Unfortunately for them both, the head of the studio (Rod Steiger) is a true bastard. He has blackmail equipment to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract. But it's only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far. <br /> <br /> This film is not, I repeat NO, a film noir. It is rather a particularly theatrical melodrama. The plot unfolds at a snail's pace and is so complex and confusing that it is in violent disharmony with the static setting and the carefully artificial blocking of the real scenes. The game of actors is at its height, in the extreme and oscillates abruptly between histrionics and soliloquies softer, but no less subtle, which are obviously intended to be poignant but appear as pretentious stupidities, especially in the hands of sadness bad palance. Aldrich was obviously ready for anything for a stylized "something" here, but I doubt he even knew what it was, and the public certainly never knows it. <br /> <br /> I think the main lesson here is that movies and plays are very different mediums. What could have worked in a play did not seem as natural or plausible on film. The result? A big waste of time. There is little to appreciate here.
