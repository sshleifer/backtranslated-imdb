The fusion opens with a scene of scientists preparing to perform a major test on a missile system developed to deflect asteroids in the event of collision with the Earth. Nathan (Vincent Gale) expresses his doubts, but the test seems to be an unqualified success. Then the asteroid breaks and the larger piece is pushed into a direct collision course with the earth. Fortunately, the huge rock jumps out of the Earth's outer atmosphere and ricochets into space. Unfortunately, this move is just enough to alter Earth's orbit and the planet begins to spiral closer to the sun. <br /> <br /> While all this is going on above their heads, Los Angeles cops Tom (Casper Van) Dien and Mick (Greg Anderson) are at stake. They are supposed to gather evidence against an alleged drug dealer, but the deal they monitor quickly turns into a shooting match. Tom then takes a few minutes to be interviewed by a local TV journalist, who happens to be his girlfriend, Carly (Stefanie von Pfetten). <br /> <br /> In a nearby hospital, Mick is being treated for a minor injury. Tom had a brief conversation with his ex-girlfriend Bonnie (Venus Terzo), who is a nurse. He tells her that he is concerned that their 17-year-old daughter, Kimberly (Amanda Crew), has a romantic relationship with a man named CJ (Ryan McDonell). Once Tom explained to Bonnie that he had discovered that CJ had a criminal record, she worried herself. <br /> <br /> It's not long, though, before everyone has to worry. The temperature is rising rapidly around the world. Carly is one of the first non-scientists to understand what's really going on. Nathan, who is his brother, calls him to tell him that he may have a way to survive. Carly calls Tom; Of course, he quickly contacts Bonnie. <br /> <br /> In a relatively short time, the motley group is on the road. However, before they can reach their ultimate goal, they must fight their way through gangs of looters, face a catastrophic water shortage, and be able to move to temperatures high enough to cause death. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien is a handsome man and I really enjoyed him in Starship Troopers. It may be because he is good at action scenes. It may also be because he did not speak much in this film. In Meltdown, unfortunately, he only has enough lines in sufficiently dramatic situations to show his average acting abilities. Amanda Crew is doing well, and Ryan McDonell is not bad either. Vincent Gale and Stefanie von Pfetten are also good enough, but Venus Terzo is unfortunately tied with Van Dien. <br /> <br /> What really makes or breaks a movie is the story and the storyline. Although the story is correct and has real potential, the script is awful. The science fiction part of science fiction is non-existent, starting with the asteroid pushing the Earth out of its orbit and reinforcing itself with the idea that "the gravitational balance of the solar system" could "bring the Earth back into its usual orbit. " with time . "When the temperature in Los Angeles reaches 120 degrees, cars start to explode. <br /> <br /> You know what's worse than bad science? Bad continuity. Ok, really hot. Why are people in the movie do they wear not only long-sleeved shirts, but also jackets, why do people get bored for bottled water instead of opening faucets at home, and why are the streets completely empty, while the highways are full and why are the highways full of unexploded? It is almost superfluous to note that sets, costumes and production values ​​were good, especially when it forced me to say that changes were not. <br /> <br /> So, basically, you take a good idea of ​​history and combine it with a mainly mediocre game, a terrible scenario, low-end special effects, totally ir twists rational and mediocre montages, and what do you have? A film that is even less than the sum of its negligible parts. I'm sorry I can not recommend anyone to Meltdown: Days of Destruction. <br /> <br /> POLITICAL NOTES: It is mentioned here that the Congress finally released enough strings from the handbag to finance rolling film tests. While the tests here were totally irresponsible (targeting an asteroid with a nuclear weapon and not knowing the composition of the big rock is actually far beyond irresponsible and approaching lunatics), the fact is that such scenarios represent a very real danger for the planet. Unfortunately, we found no trace of any near-Earth asteroids that could be disturbing in an orbit one day; and our ability to spot something on a collision course with us is at best limited. <br /> <br /> Once we discover that we will be affected, we have virtually no system in place to deal with it. We can not launch space missiles with nuclear end; the Space Shuttle is quite incapable of going beyond Earth's orbit, and if it did, we could not launch enough or fast enough for it to matter. I am not in favor of the government doing anything beyond its constitutional mandates, but I certainly think that protecting the planet from destruction from space could be interpreted as a defense of the country, is not do not you? SUITABILITY FOR THE FAMILY: Fusion: The days of destruction are rated R for "a little violence". Frankly, I have not found anything more violent than violence here. If your teenagers are excited about seeing Meltdown and you can not talk about it, the R-rating should not deter you from letting him see it. However, it is not a good idea to leave the youngest children in the room with their older siblings. Although the shootings are not too graphic, some corpses are.
