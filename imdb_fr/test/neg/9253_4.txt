Lord David Cecil has written an interesting book in beginners to Victorian novices, in which he has examined the works of Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot, Trollope, Mrs. Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte. He picked these writers from the favorites of the first half of the Victorian period and explained their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them) to the public. Some of his comments are relevant enough to date, but like any criticism, they also give an idea of ​​the spirit of the times of critics. <br /> <br /> Cecil greatly appreciated George Eliot (Mary Ann Cross)), who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poetry). But for most modern readers, they usually know his shortest book, SILAS MARNER, which is still read in some high school programs. The other books, FELIX HOLT THE RADICAL, DANIEL DERONDA, MIDDLEMARCH, MILL IN THE FLOSS, ADAM BEDE, ROMOLA, SCENES OF CLERICAL LIFE, are still in print (Penguin, for example, have most), but mostly unread. One of the most interesting today is her latest novel, DERONDA, where she discusses Jews in English society and a nascent type of Zionism, prior to Hertzl. ROMOLA is his only historical novel attempt (on the Savanarola experience of a purely religious republic in Florence in the 1490s). MIDDLEMARCH, his most fleshy novel, is interested in English society in the provinces in 1832, the year of the grand bill on the reform of Lord Gray. I had to read MIDDLEMARCH at the university to take a literature course. It is certainly a thought-provoking book (Virginia Woolf called it the most adult book of the English language). But he suffers (like all Eliot's novels) from a defect: she can not write a livable and exciting prose. Although Dickens is sometimes too exuberant and Thackeray can become pompous and prolix, Trollope can become (as Lord Cecil puts it) very ordinary in his discussion, and Charlotte Bronte may not explain well some relationships, and Ms. Gaskell seems the best solution with female characters, all (and Emily Bronte in her unique novel) hold the reader's interest. Reading most of Eliot's novels is like trying to chisel sentences with toothpicks on marble blocks! <br /> <br /> To date, I have read about fifty pages of MILL OF THE FLOSS. I notice that one of the other commentators never finished the novel too. But I read a summary of what it is. The Tullivers (Maggie and his brother Tom) are the central figures - they own the mill in the title. Although she is close at the beginning of the story, Maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is struggling with legal difficulties with Mr. Tulliver, Sr. Tom has a bleak view of this relationship and tragedy of the story concerns the separation between the brothers and sisters, culminating in their death at the conclusion (Maggie returns to the factory to save Tom during a strong flood and they die together). It must have been a hit with Victorian readers, but it's very dark and depressing for the modern audience. <br /> <br /> The film has changed a little bit late - Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) dies in the end with her lover and Tom (James Mason) notes their death at the conclusion in his note book. The story is totally rewritten, except for a double death at the end of the deluge. It does not really help things. Although Fitzgerald and Mason are doing pretty well with their roles, they can not really shoot the film by their work alone. The end result is a rather minor film, which fortunately did not detract from the director's career. The only other thing to note is that Frank Lawton was playing the boyfriend, who two years earlier was playing David Copperfield as a young adult against W.C.Fields, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan. But then, Lawton has never really had a major film career - it just happens that he's always present in pictures, whether he's good or mediocre.
