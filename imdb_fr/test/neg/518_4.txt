"Submerged" is certainly not "the worst film of all time". It has its flaws, such as borrowed images, a crazy script and nonexistent special effects (these are the worst), but it also has some positives. The acting is surprisingly good, there are many familiar faces you probably know if you're a fan of b-movies like me. <br /> <br /> I was very happy to see Brent Huff play one of the heroes, especially knowing him for his 80s action movies, and I have to admit, he's not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield and Tim Thomerson have limited screen time, but they are credible. Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert are very sexy and very mean in this film by Fred Olen Ray. Michael Bailey Smith adds power to the background as a Navy SEAL. Unfortunately, the only member of the cast that (in my opinion) is completely moved is Coolio. He does not act at all, speaks as if he did not even read the script, and being a tough guy at the beginning of the movie, he gets shot like a whore an hour later. Not a good choice. <br /> <br /> In summary, this film is not such a bad choice for nighttime entertainment. If you manage to overcome the special effects (so many weapons, shots and not a single injury), the annoying performance of Coolio and the recycled images of Airport 77, you might like that after all.
