This is on my TV right now ... but only long enough for me to finish panning in this comment. The previous comment let me know that this movie will not improve, no matter how much I hope and pray. I agree that this film is a colossal waste of time, and would be your time ... it will not get better! I can not believe this writer is doing Atlas Shrugged! I hope it has improved a million times! I see other credits on his resume that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced. If you know his work, please post something here, because I really want to see Atlas Shrugged, and I would hate it if this guy put it in the trash that this movie turns out to be.
