This terrible film marked me permanently. <br /> <br /> The main action of the film is nothing special. There seems to be a tribe of snake-worshipers in a remote mountainous area of ​​northern China, where women are the leaders and decision-makers, not the men. I suppose that among some men, this is enough to make "Succubare" a horror film ... Anyway, Chinese people sometimes walked in the village, seduced the girls of the region, seduced them and then the abandoned. Unfortunately for the men, the women had put them under a spell, derived from the snake venom, which would cause them to die horribly in 100 days - their belly swollen like that of a pregnant woman with live worms and snakes - they did not come back. <br /> <br /> Forget the coverage of the American video. It has nothing to do with vampires, although there is an inept scene that drinks blood. The title itself is only marginally appropriate: "Succubare" is the Latin verb meaning "to lie down below", and it is the root of the word Succubus, a demon that would seduce men in their sleep. In fact, it is the MEN who are the deceivers here. <br /> <br /> But this is not the main action of this ridiculous film that is so shocking. These are the minor secondary incidents. I will ignore the slaughter and butchery of an ox that was played on the screen. The participants seem very experienced, as if it were an unpleasant task in real life; and I'm sure they really ate the animal afterwards ... even though I regretted that the act was imposed on my face as "entertainment". <br /> <br /> What I would like to forget (or HAD forgotten) is the many totally alien plans of an unidentified man, who interrupts the story from time to time by eating live animals. He begins the film by tearing a living snake with his teeth. During the movie, he devours an insect, a lizard, a toad (I had to leave the room after that) and a whole mouse (I stopped watching at that time and I lost my appetite for days). Let me emphasize that this was totally unexpected and had nothing to do with the film ... unless it is a cynical reference to love as it is described in the film: a survival mechanism blind, selfish and predatory that tears the helpless ... but again, I'm probably rationalizing to get rid of the baseness of the head ...
