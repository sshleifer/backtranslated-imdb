Incredible starts in Los Angeles with Jim (Roger Cline) and his wife Alice Fhelleps (Tamera Noll) arguing as they ride in the pouring rain. Unfortunately, Jim crushes the car and his daughter Heather (Leigh Silver) dies while Alice is returned to a wheelchair vegetable. Devastated by the death of his daughter, Jim begins to visit prostitutes. He then kills them because of voices in his head. Uh, that's all. <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Chad Ferrin I hate Unspeakable as a movie. There are movies that you sometimes see that move the "goal posts" like everything you watch afterwards, some movies are so brilliant that everyone else will be judged by her, while others like Unspeakable, for example, are so bad that they fix themselves. a new kinematic bass. It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm seriously surprised by the largely positive comments on the IMDb, although I'm not surprised by the overall low score on the main page, I'm not not sure to have forgotten something, but to begin with, Indestructible does not have a plot, it does not have a story and many seem almost random. There was nothing in Unspeakable to keep my interest or entertain and as a result became an endurance test to go all the way. The film tries to be shocking with some lame scenes of sexual abuse by a priest on a rent boy, there is a scene in which a disabled person shits herself, she splashes the floor and her shady nurse starts to feel his genitals, dirty legs & underwear. If anyone can find such an entertaining crap, I'm just going to cut my wrists now, those of the character are some of the worst I've had the misfortune to know, the dialogue is hilarious, some seeming to come directly from a queer dirty. porn of the worst kind. It does not work like a horror because it's not scary at all, it's absolutely hilarious and frankly insulting to pretend that it's a serious drama about someone who suffers a great loss and trying to get by and, all in all, I just think it's a shitty piece of shit, poorly made of Troma. <br /> <br /> The director Ferrin films as a poorly made documentary, the special effects are terrible and are part of the movie 'Ketchup verses to tomato on the face of our actor & the audience will be convinced that they are dead of a mortal variety, there is no graphic violence apart from a suicide where someone puts a knife in his own mouth. Given the number of prostitutes in Unspeakable, nudity levels are limited to an absolute minimum ... <br /> <br /> Apparently, Unspeakable had a budget of around $ 20,000 and all I can say, c where is all the money? Oh, a quick note to the filmmakers, if you want to record live sound, make sure your actor does not deliver his replicas at the edge of a main road that half of Los Angeles seems to be ramping up ... game is null, period. <br /> <br /> The unspeakable is, in my opinion, a total crap. It's probably not the worst I've ever seen, but it's just downstairs and I do not remember seeing such a horrible movie recently. One to avoid unless you are masochist or insomniac.
