Yes, the video coverage of this movie made me want to watch this movie as a child. It was called "Screamers" on this cover with the slogan "Men upside down!". There was even on the cover this skeleton with a distorted look that made me pass all kinds of bloody and bloody images. Maybe some sort of movie about a strange virus that burned someone's flesh, maybe a movie about undead zombies that look bloodier than you're used to, a scientific experiment that has gone terribly wrong and strange men with flesh that drip their bones are unleashed. Yes, all those thoughts crossed my mind, but that was not the case with the types of fish caught on an island that was virtually bloodless. This film really looks more like Dr. Moreau's Island than anything else, and frankly, this film bores me too, it's far too much science and not enough murder for my taste. These films are too complicated and do not contain enough blood for my taste. Yes, I know, I have strange tastes, but I can not help it, I love my horror movies that are really bloody or fast and exciting and this exciting movie really is not.
