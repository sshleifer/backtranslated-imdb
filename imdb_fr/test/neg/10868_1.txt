That's what I was wondering while watching this movie. I mean, the amount of nudity and sex was one thing, but another part of the film that gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack of script. Really I just wanted to get up and go during the whole movie, but I persisted. I persisted in the hope that the scenario would improve, that there might be a good turn at the end. However, I could not have been more wrong. In the end, I persisted because I thought I could write a bad review if, after watching it. <br /> <br /> I mean, do not get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with having beautiful, sexy and dynamic women, but when the director only shows that, with a crap story thinking that that's what the viewer wants to see, it's insulting us all. To think that we are all so superficial that wanting to see only the burlesque of the big representatives of the film industry is ridiculous. My advice: rent a different movie.
