Anyone who complains that Peter Jackson has made movies too long must attend this "event" from CBS. There is about 45 minutes of history completed by 2 hours of unnecessary side-tricks, staging fictional shots of television drama. Bad science is a staple for disastrous weather movies, so I will not complain. A silly science can be fun to watch if it's fun. What kills this film are its 10 subplots ... all of which can be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot. Tornado Tommy is the most fun character to watch in category 6. This stereotype is very annoying. <br /> <br /> Note that I did not worry about special effects either. Their quality should not surprise. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
