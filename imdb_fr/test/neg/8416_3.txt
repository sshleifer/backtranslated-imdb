It is a ridiculous parody of private ophthalmic thrillers as a novelist (Michael Cain) is called to "write about ghosts", an autobiography of a colorful Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). Sometimes foolishness becomes odious. It's not Cain at its best. Rooney is really too strong. Outstanding support from Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and the beautiful Nadia Cassini. Not easy to watch.
