I would have given a 1 to this movie, but I laughed so many times that I had to give him a credit, luckily the movie was supposed to be funny. A film so bad that you think the chimpanzees wrote it. You want the chimpanzees to write it. The dialogue is so good that only the cockroach and cockroaches will survive the next nuclear holocaust. The film exaggerates its horror by interspersing scenes of Original Carrie (a very good movie) in scenes of it. Like scenes that cross the scenes of taxi driver in Baby Geniuses. Do not rent it alone, because you will not enjoy the experience. You will need someone next to you to confirm the seriousness of what you are looking at. The worst actress of the Millenium goes to poor poor Amy Irving as a monotonous school councilor, in wood, with lean stone. The worst movie of the year to date (see also _Arlington Road_). --FRINK-3
