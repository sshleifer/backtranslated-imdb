Seriously, I do not understand why people are all like "Oh my God, Step Up is the best movie of all time !!!" It's a bunch of junk! First of all, the acting is ridiculous, and we do not even start talking about the dialogue because it was terrible ... The films are supposed to be entertaining, and this, let me be the first to say, n was * not * an entertainment. In fact, I laughed because I was so embarrassed to watch it. Music and dance did nothing for me too. And what is "hot" with Channing Tatum, that all girls talk? It does not matter. The film was pathetic. Do not waste your time or money. Unless you're a movie fan, but movies like this are * not * movies ... they're jokes.
