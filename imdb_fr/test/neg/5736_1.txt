I know a lot of people claim that some of the movies are "the worst ever", but I think Redneck claims this award. A combination of fairly formidable actors Mark Lester and Telly Savales and a progression of the plot that defies any belief. <br /> <br /> On Telly Saveles: was he drunk when he played? He seems to play a madman who laughs without conviction. Maybe he mixed his medicine with his whiskey, I do not know. <br /> <br /> About Mark Lester: a more woody performance than a carpenter's shop. His cut British tones do not belong to this film; and his transformation from protected teenager to gangster apprentice in 24 hours is crazy. And the strip scene with Mosquito has nothing to do with the plot; The director may like that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Logic of the plot: When Memphis and Mosquito ambush the car at the beginning, why does not Mark Lester's mother do anything or say anything to get her son out of the car, before the loonies hunt it? She just lets them all go, without saying a word! For its part, Redneck must be seen - you will not believe how far it is otherwise!
