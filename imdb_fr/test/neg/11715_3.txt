Some friends and I visited the video store a few years ago and we were in a bad mood to rent insignificant movies. My friend took the head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. That made us laugh and we decided to bet to see who would be the one to go to the ticket office and pay for the movie. Well, you guessed it, it was me !!!!!!!! I have never been so embedded in my life. We went home and put it on and we rolled on the floor laughing for about 45 minutes because it was the funniest movie in the world. I do not remember much, but I remember one thing: the blonde girl did it with a guy in the back of a store every 5 minutes. This head made me laugh and when I look at the comments of other people about this film, it makes me laugh even more. The head of the family is so good and the head is funny and I am still laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha
