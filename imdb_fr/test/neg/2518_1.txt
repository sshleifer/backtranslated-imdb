Like most people, I saw this film after hearing it from Patton Oswalt. Curiously, it was easier to find than I thought. It should not be surprising, though, that I found it used. <br /> <br /> The plot is summed up majestically in the title. It's a bed that eats. No more no less. There is an effort to write a story but not a very good one. <br /> <br /> The blood of a demon ended up on a bed and, as a result, he became possessed. He devours everything that happens to him by absorbing and then dissolving it in what appears to be an orange Fanta. There is an artist who has been a victim of the bed, but he was ill and found himself behind a painting in the room where he lives. The narrative is fully narrated through him. <br /> <br /> This film fails horribly, even when it's bad. Still, it's not without its own brand of charm.
