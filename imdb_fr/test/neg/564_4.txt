Made in a fictitious documentary style, the subversives of the late 1960s and the alleged detractors of traditional government are stopped and have a choice. Once convicted of wrongdoing, they have the choice to go to prison for seven years or spend three days and two nights in a Southern California desert at Punishment Park. In the heat of 100 degrees, the prisoners have to travel about fifty kilometers to get to an American flag their freedom. United States and state security forces will follow two hours later. If the dissidents are captured, it means a prison. <br /> <br /> Appearing in this pseudo-documentary: Carmen Argenziano, Katherine Quittner, Mary Ellen Kleinhall, Stan Armsted, Scott Turner, Patrick Boland and Kent Foreman.
