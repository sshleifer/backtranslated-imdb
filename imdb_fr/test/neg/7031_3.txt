Have we all seen the same movie ??? I can not believe that some of the others are praising this truly awful bio that, believe it or not, was authorized by Shirley Temple herself, according to her book CHILD STAR. This gives me the feeling that some are terribly easy to satisfy. <br /> <br /> First of all, ASHLEY ROSE ORR, whatever her modest talents, her form will even look pretty like Shirley Temple to be cast like her in this kind of simple biography of the most star child famous world. She gives no indication of why this child was so revered, except that she did her best to imitate Shirley, which is never heard. None whatsoever. <br /> <br /> And that's the main handicap of the play. But as if that were not enough, all the drama inherent in Shirley's story about his almost overnight rise was whitened with a tasteless writing sprinkled with occasional singing and dancing moments that do not even look like that. that Shirley did for example, "The Codfish Ball" with Buddy Ebsen, which was probably the culmination of Shirley's choreographic routine). <br /> <br /> Just putting a girl in a polka dot dress does not make her Shirley Temple. No charm, warmth and appeal from Shirley is suggested remotely. All we see on the screen is a pale imitation of the original proving once and for all that there was only one Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> It's useless to write anything about this mess. None of the others are more ordinary than in lifeless roles. My advice to Shirley's fans is to read his book - or better yet - to watch his films. <br /> <br /> It's the pit.
