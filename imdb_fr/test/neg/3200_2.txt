I am a big fan of the first Critters movie. The second episode is good, but not as good as the first. The third episode is a little boring, but charming. And what is it ?? What shit! It's stupid and really, really boring. This is the worst of the series. I can not watch it anymore because I fell asleep on the first watch. And the perverse side of Ug is one of the most horrific moments of the movie. In the first 50 minutes, we can not see the little hairy monsters, which is why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> It could have been a lot better. <Br /> <br /> 2/10
