How on earth did these guys get money to make this movie? The lack of script is one thing, but cinematography makes you want to cry. A portable camera can have a great value for the look and feel of a movie, but in this case, you need a photographer who knows what he's doing. I know that the actors are amateurs but it is not a defense since the director is perhaps the least talented who ever made in Sweden. It would be a shame for the industry if we give it money to make a film. This film simply fuels the argument that too many films are made in Sweden every year.
