It's easily the worst, most shocking piece of shit on TV. I'd love to ignore him completely, but Fox has included him in their Sunday program, forcing me to find something else to look at between the American father and Family Guy. The dink-male head guy is pretty much the least evolved pathetic excuse for a human I've ever seen on television. Nothing in the series is really funny and pretty much everything has already been done and much better by others. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that their strategy is to dive deep into the Sunday program and hope someone starts to like it ... but I have to tell you, Fox is the bad hole. The scam did not work on me - I just look elsewhere - but go, you dare to panic, this panicked show, and it fears even more when compared to the rest of Fox Sunday programming. <br /> <br /> THEY DEVELOPMENT STOP CANCELED FOR THIS STEAM PIELE?
