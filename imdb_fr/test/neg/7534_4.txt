Think of an extremely low version of "Heathers" and you have "Pep Squad". This summarizes the film in a few words. I have to give credit when the credit is due, however. The film has a beautiful visual appeal. I liked cinematography, wild color schemes, costume designs. But without a good acting, a movie has no redeeming value. I prefer to watch a film with little visual appeal, with good actors and a sharp dialogue (for example: "The Brothers McMullen" or any film by Edward Burns). The actors recite their dialogue in monotone or scream as if they were in a bad soap opera. That's why I do not blame most traditional actors. Let's face it, most of the dominant players are for a reason. If they are not "big" actors, they are at least competent. People blame Leo DiCaprio, but when was the last time you saw a movie where he recites the dialogue as if he was reading it off the page? It's a shame, because the director seems to know his stuff when it comes to staging (sp). At the same time, I can not praise Steve Balderson (the director). He wrote the script, which contains a horrible dialogue. He may also be a little racist, because there is a black character in the film, who lives in the culmination of African-American stereotypes.
