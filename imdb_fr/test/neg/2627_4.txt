It was a very good show. I enjoyed building in real time and going back, seeing the old Diggers and reminding me of the terrors of their captivity at Changi's POW camp. The main problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in Changi are more like a holiday camp than where the place should be. I am old enough to remember a film sequence showing the liberated men of Changi and other Japanese POW camps. No actor could lose enough weight to have a resemblance to the condition of these men. They made the Belsen Jews look like sumo wrestlers. I have met several Changi veterans over the years. Many would never drive in a Japanese car, let alone own one. The physical and mental torture suffered by these men was too horrible for them to even talk about it. What percentage has survived? John Doyle may well write the comedy for "Roy and HG" (I hate that too), but it's a serious layer of sugar history that should never have been tolerated. I'm glad the satirists write "Brian's life" and make fun of the crucifixion, because it's obviously a comedy, even if some people think it's in bad taste. "Changi" is written as a representation of a real event and, as such, could be considered by young people as a real record. The beautiful performances of a perfect casting can not exchange this light scenario.
