This film must be classified with Ed Wood films. A terrible scenario and bad behavior. <br /> <br /> A machine gun battle in front of flat glass windows; it takes minutes before anyone is touched and no one is covered - no windows are ever broken. One might think that after a fire, the big U-Haul truck could be riddled - not a scratch. <br /> <br /> Do CIA agents and government contractors make shout = top secret information at a welcome cocktail party with hundreds of people around. <br /> <br /> There is not a single actor that interests you; everyone is superficial and fundamentally implausible. <br /> <br /> A Hawaii bound for 747 flies from Los Angeles and hangs twenty minutes later in the Pacific "... in 100 feet of water ...". A short time elapses when the flight attendant announces to the other five passengers that she has only two hours left; on a 747? <br /> <br /> The next day, rescue teams arrive and, surprisingly, the six passengers are still alive. <br /> <br /> A film that starts mediocre and goes from worse to worse. <br /> <br />
