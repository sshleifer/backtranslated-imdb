"The Foreigner" is a story of foreign intrigue with Seagal in the center, as a deep cover agent who has a package that everyone wants and wants to kill to get it. The film is devoid of inspiration and contains less usual activities that place Seagal on the film map (fire fighting, hand-to-hand combat, pyrotechnics, stunts, etc.) and more complicated, uninteresting and full story filling without meaning. What action it seems to seem symbolic and gratuitous while Seagal, looking more and more like a pork chop, winds through this tasteless, bored and ungainly film while showing no improvement in its ability to act. Somewhere around "The Glimmer Man" or "Fire Down Below", Seagal's films have plummeted and "The Foreigner" is just a continuation of this trend. Here, nothing deserves to be watched, except for the most fervent Seagal fans. (C-)
