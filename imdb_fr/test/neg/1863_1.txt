Ghoulies IV begins in a museum warehouse where Alexandra (Stacie Randall), a blonde dressed in leather and leather, is looking for an antique jewel. After mobilizing various guards, she summoned the devil Faust to whom she devotes a cult and who wants to have sex. Unfortunately, she lost the jewel. he is therefore not very happy and orders him to get the last remaining ... What belongs to Jonathan Graves (back from the original Ghoulies (1985) Peter Liapis), who is experienced in demonic possession and what kind of things after the events of the original Goulies. Alexandra seeks to find the jewel to bring Faust to Earth permanently from "the other side", finally, I do not know for the moment. Uh, that's about all ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jim Wynorski whose very name gives me chills when he's attached to a movie I'm about to lose 90 minutes of my life on IV Goulies is as I expected full, total and total shit from start to finish and it's as simple and straightforward as that. Mark Sevi's, ahem, 'script', cough, has virtually nothing in common with the other Ghoulie films, except in his title and they've managed to convince Liapis to return to his role, which also has the added benefit of being able to use images from the original even if it has no relevance. The story is almost non-existent, the whole movie is a real chore to watch, it's incredibly boring and stupid, it's slow, it's predictable, it's spotless as far as blood or gore goes has two comic relief goblins that I suppose are supposed to fill the Ghoulies quota even though they do not look anything like the previous movies and are actually just embarrassing to watch, actually I think they practiced to be ventriloquists for the most part Part of the film as when they talk about their mouths Do not move ... You know I do not want to talk about Ghoulies IV anymore, so believe me, please, it's a huge piece of shit the size of an elephant, do not waste your time or money. Dirctor Wynorski turns into a completely rotten movie at just about every level, the special effects are awful, just like the whole movie. Apparently, Ghoulies IV is supposed to be a kind of horror comedy, but it misses both targets in the light of the proverbial mile and is neither funny nor scary. The best thing about this movie is the actress Randall in her leather and PVC suit looking to find the jewel and not worth looking at. There is an almost runaway car scene with a couple of accidents, but it looks like it was shot in a completely different movie and given Wynorski's course, I'm sure. Forget all that is gore, because there is none. <br /> <br /> Technically, Ghoulies IV is bad, it's obvious, its budget is low, but it's just not an excuse for it to be so bad, is it? Liapis is back in distribution, although he probably wants to stay away. Randall, the girl dressed in PVC, is undoubtedly the best thing about this movie that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies IV is a shit, there is nothing else to do. really say. Honestly, I do not see anyone who likes movies get something out of it, I can not. I can not believe I'm going to recommend the original Ghoulies to everything, but it's going to happen now, because even if it's crap, it's way better than Ghoulies IV, to avoid people and you can thank me later. The things I sit so you do not have to, honestly ...
