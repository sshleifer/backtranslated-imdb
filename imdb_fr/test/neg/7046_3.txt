It's a pity that there has been so much controversy around this picture (in other words, the infamous affair between Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini), because it has drawn a lot of attention to a very forgettable film . The story is incredibly slow, cheap and uninteresting. And to top it off, the movie is crowded with amateur actors who barely speak English. I really would have preferred the subtitles - the experience would have been less trying. Back to the rotten game. The neo-realistic movement was important in Italy at the time of filming. Many of these films are absolute masterpieces (such as De Sica's Umberto D., Children Watch Us and Miracle in Milan), as they have benefited a lot from non-professional actors. They behaved like normal people, but in Stromboli they act like normal people. TRYING to be actors and to behave badly - like children in a play at school. <br /> <br /> By the way, ... if you hope that the film ends well (which will allow you to devote your time to the film), do not bother. The plot was totally absurd and silly - so much so that I really realized that I could not care less about the characters. As in the island they all inhabit, the film is sorry, without color or life.
