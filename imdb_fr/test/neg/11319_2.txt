This is supposedly a story in which a cultured man tells a story about his youth. Yet you see objects such as personal computers, e-mails, faxes, etc., which are used in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. <br /> <br /> So, when is this guy supposed to tell this story - in 2020? Well, I wonder how advanced we are. Why not tell us. <br /> <br /> There are also several legal problems that make no sense. In the courtroom scene, history is part of the routine of unexpected evidence, which is inadmissible in any real court in this country. In addition, it would take at least seven years for Grandma in most states to be declared officially dead. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, Elmo Shropshire. You are now officially a SELLOUT.
