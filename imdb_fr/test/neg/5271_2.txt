<br /> <br /> First, as many critics have pointed out, this is a scam of the story of Martin Cahill - represented for the first time by the BBC and by the film John Boorman's "The General" - a great movie by far, far superior to this one. <br /> <br /> Speaking as a Brit, Kevin Spacey's cast was really good in terms of British and Irish acting talent, especially Peter Mullan - but it was totally lost. The characters were c ** p! And as for Kevin Spacey, he did not present himself as an adorable thief, but there is nothing that is really substantial or significant. <br /> <br /> Not much to buy this film. The best songs are gags and tricks from the other films he tears. Compare notes on this film and "The General" - I would be interested to see what others think. <br /> <br />
