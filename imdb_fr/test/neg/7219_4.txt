Let me start by saying that you know that a film is badly managed when extras make the cover. That said, anyone who says it's the worst movie of all time is dramatic, and whoever says the movie is great is completely delusional. The film "is what it is". And what is it ... A modest budget ($ 4 million, according to my estimates) suite studio. The movie is not great, but for Road House fans, it will be a disappointment. And that brings me to problem one, just as Dirty Dancing would not have been like before without Swayze, Road House is not the same without it. The film lacks depth, character and sympathy to carry the film. I think the lead role was poorly expressed and the producers should have bothered Patrick to do it if they wanted to do a sequel. The other players were uneven, with notable actors like Will Patton alongside players who could not play in a paper bag. Busey, whom I saw seeing great characters, felt like sending him by mail. Ellen was well played except she was not credible at all like a bayou. Sherri, the DEA agent at the first bar, was hot and good actress, but her role was clumsily small and undeveloped. The author has totally missed all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters. Instead of opting for a one-dimensional base film. Which leads me to the biggest problem, the script ... I had a bad feeling when the credits were generated and there were three writers separated by a "and" and an "&". It looked very amateurish. And that's what writing was. I heard that the original script was better, then a rewrite was done and the sucking of the hard core started. Some parts of the film to watch are to watch ... During the first meeting under cover, the obvious drug case under the table. "Hey, we're in a bar full of naked girls, I'm going to take a block of coca out of my jacket and take out some money, and then we'll slip it under the cocktail table" WAIT! "Make sure you look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is watching!" Secondly, I love when someone gets shot in the chest and you see him sitting happily 10 minutes later. There are very bad editing cuts at the end of the film, especially during the fight scenes and when the main character runs through the doors and meets a client. Which brings me to the realism of training at DEA, I would not want to be technical at the same time ... But to go through the doors is not a standard training ... Neither the typical female agents, who are being broken ass to succeed in a field-oriented man, act like weak characters ... boring! Thanks for the chauvinistic Heir Director's vision. There are other subjects that I could teach in a school about this ... Accelerated fighting, bloody dialogues, recycled history ... etc ... But apart from everything you can not just do not like it. Applegate, he totally lacks the Zen humility that made Mr. Patrick Swayze so mean. I just think I'm one of those actors who think they're bad, but like Van Damnit, he runs into a big ass (Chuck Zito in Van Do not) and gives him a lesson on "badassdom." Therefore, I feel that the pivot of the film is major. If you are a bad ass, you are a bad ass, you do not have to try. Example: Swayze! If you are a pretty boy trying hard to prove that you are a bad ass, among other things ... So good ... You are the reason why your audience, the average Joe ... will not rent this movie and if they do, they will write reviews like this.
