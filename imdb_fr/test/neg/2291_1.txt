In fact, I feel as if my criticism was that one. My friend, who I almost always trust in movies, especially horror movies, warned me not to rent this rental, no matter how tempted, bored, or desperate to see a new movie. I was horrified because it was a total waste of time. Unfortunately, I did not talk to him for a while and I was in a hurry to pick a movie and I thought, "But damn, how could that be?" WHY I do not learn? What was I thinking? Did I think it would magically turn into a better movie by sitting on the shelf for years waiting to be rented? <br /> <br /> The plot is about a guy who makes movies for a company. His boss is a fool. The guy who had the job before him went crazy and blew himself up in the pre-credit sequence, so for whatever reason, the boss chose Ed for the special splash film editing project "Loose Limbs ". He never says what Ed is supposed to edit, but I guess it does not matter. Ed is upset by some clips, working on it in this house all by himself, after which the boss decided to move it for no apparent reason. He asks his boss if he can stop or do another project, but his boss does not care. He begins to slowly go crazy, supposedly watching the clips, and wants to carry out the bloody murders in real life. Or has it been like this since the beginning? Please note that I give this story a much deeper, interesting and coherent sound than it really is. <br /> <br /> We do not care about the characters at all, nor have any sympathy for them, or even hate the bad guys. The plot is really boring and predictable. Splashing is not even so macabre or creative - it's not worth renting to see the gore, because there's nothing interesting or original. <br /> <br /> All the "tributes" of Sam Raimi just live like very bad scams, and no one in the movie is as handsome as Bruce Campbell, so you can not distract yourself from that. I think a poster "Evil Dead II-Dead by Dawn" is only visible in a scene in the hope that Sam Raimi is flattered and does not consider any kind of legal action. A qualified chimpanzee could have written a better script. Whenever I hear phrases like, "Do we have fun ... again?" (That even Bride of Re-Animator could not withdraw without making me wince) I'm starting to want to pick up some sort of lethal weapon myself. The characters just appear from nowhere without explanation, wandering for the sole purpose of being killed. It might be acceptable if the movie was even entertaining or entertaining at a distance, but it was all I could do to prevent most of the progression. Fortunately, I chose to pay bills and balance my checkbook at the same time as the movie was playing. Believe me, that did not require my full attention. I always felt as if more than 90 minutes of my life had been wasted just by having this in the background. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, no matter how tempted you are to hate yourself for wasting your money. Horror fans will be completely disgusted by his incompetence. Even those who have not seen too many splashed movies should stay away, as there are so many movies you can rent that are worth more than that. If you want something fun, budget and fun, rent something else. Loss of total time without any redemptive quality. Be smarter than I was at the time and do not be fooled by the warning message-not for the faint of heart on the box. You have been warned! <br /> <br />
