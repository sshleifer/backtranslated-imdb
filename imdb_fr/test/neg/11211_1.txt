The plot is very basic, but acceptable: a young American soldier, having studied Asian martial arts, uses this to defend the general's daughter and falls in love with her. Unfortunately, the combined IQ of the three main players (soldier, girl, rebel) is 3: one point for the soldier, one for the girl, a lot of Ninja fighters have to share the third point to lose against the first two .
