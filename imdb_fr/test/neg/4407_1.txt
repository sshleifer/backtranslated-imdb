It's not conspiracy, OK; it's not a character study, well; there is no action, all right; it's useless, hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Maybe it's supposed to represent the boredom and absurdity of life in Palistine and parts of Israel lately in a state of violence, small disagreements, deep-seated hostility, etc. But most of the time, it's long and long scenes in which nothing happens - or things that seem to make sense (a control tower that collapses on the ground, a Arafat balloon floating in Jerusalem, a Tiger woman squatting deflecting a ball in a halo), but when you try to make sense, there is not there. <br /> <br /> Bonus: You can watch this movie in advance and it will not change anything except that it may be a little less boring.
