The concept of this film is quite convincing: zombie children coming out of an abandoned mine to avenge their death in the background of Pennsylvania. Cool. The problem I had with the movie is the lack of creativity in dealing with zombies. The filmmakers could have really spiced up this movie with "terror" images such as stop scenes, reverse camera reverse, and so on. When zombie kids wander through the woods, they look like a 9-year-old group walking to a playground in West Philadelphia. Instead of ice axes and shovels, they could have easily worn baseball bats and gloves. Why should I fear these little children? Everyone could safely escape safely. Besides, who could have stayed one night with their children in this terrifying house? By the time I opened the front door and looked around, I would have said, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, Son, go start the car, I'll go back and pee in. a bush, and then we leave here. "Film totally incredible. Do not waste your time.
