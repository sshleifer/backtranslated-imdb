This program aired early in the morning on SPACE, a science fiction cable station. I am surprised that anyone who pays for it or diffuse it; it's incredibly amateurish. <br /> <br /> The whole show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes played on a decor that looks like a cabinet with a lot of circuit boards glued to the wall. There is very little continuity between scenes and no plot. A typical scene revolves around a joke or a special lame effect and lasts about a minute. The dialog box makes little sense and the special effects look like Photoshop filters. The actors are all adults, but I literally saw high school plays with better writing and better sets. This program is awkward. <br /> <br /> Maybe each scene would work like an interstitial; a charge between shows instead of commercials. By linking all the scenes, the limitations of the material are extremely obvious.
