For a science genius super-dog supposed to be the solution to the small crime, CHOMPS was an idiot. <br /> <br /> All I saw in Chomps was sitting, walking or running. Or run, then walk, then sit down ... then get up and stretch, then walk and run to the K-Tel's dance tubes. And sometimes he had all the answers to the Jumbo daily. <br /> <br /> All I say is: in a Death Match with a celebrity, Chomps could not defeat Mr. Bigglesworth.
