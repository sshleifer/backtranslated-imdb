The alleged writer and director, Mr.Dhawan, has copied almost the entire plot of the hit Hollywood movie "HITCH" starring Will Smith. Many scenes are also exactly the same. The plot was just a copy-paste and some low quality humor (probably from Mr. Dwan's own creation) and frequent dances were added to increase the film's duration to local standards. some smiles, but that does not suit legendary artists like ours to be part of plagiarism, especially when they always tell people to stop buying pirated discs!
