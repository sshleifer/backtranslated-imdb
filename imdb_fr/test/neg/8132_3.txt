I really wanted to love this movie, but it barely exceeded 3 points. It's amazing that 10 voices were tied, the other half at 1. All the characters were fun and even talented, but overall, the movie did not pay off. . Sebastian Hernandez appeals. charismatic and friendly (he even looks like Marc Anthony physically in a more accessible but ultimately conscious sense ...), but even if he could not save that mess of a movie. The scenes dragged far too long and the points were finally beaten to death. The banana scene fringed on self-absorption, apparently showing how much movement was in her boxer. But for his defense, it was his first film as a director (and I know it) and I appreciate his love work. It left me empty despite what we were trying to say. In the end, I think the story would have been better handled by a more experienced director. From what I've seen "extras," there's a real story behind that, and maybe when I finish looking at them, I'll appreciate it more.
