A mild-mannered New York lawyer (George Segal) slowly goes crazy. He promised his father on his deathbed that he would NEVER send their senile mother (Ruth Gordon) to a retirement home. Years later, he takes care of a senile and dangerous psychopath. He meets a beautiful nurse (Trish Van Devere) and they fall in love. But his mother does not stop frightening him. Segal is ready to kill her .... <br /> <br /> Ummmm ... It's a comedy? I have nothing against black and sick humor, but go ... there MUST be limits! This film does its best to throw all the tasteless and tasteless jokes it can think of and rub its face. Too bad no jokes are funny. Jokes involve rape, nudity, public humiliation, senile elderly people, swearing and racism. Basically, it's a movie that thinks it's smart trying to shock people and thinking they're going to laugh at it. I was disgusted and I did not laugh once. The film is morbid, disturbing and (surprisingly) dull. The casting is the only thing that kept me watching. Segal and Gordon were both wonderful in their roles - Gordon in particular. And Van Devere is very good too. But the script is against them. The only interesting thing (not funny) was a useless court room scene with Rob Reiner Jr. (and trying to spot his wife Penny Marshall as a spectator). <br /> <br /> This film could have been worse - the original ending if Segal was sleeping with his mother and pretending to be daddy! This has (fortunately) changed. <br /> <br /> A real ugly and sick movie. Bottom of the drum. I give him a 1.
