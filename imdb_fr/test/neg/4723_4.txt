Dr. Krellman wants to save his son Julio, who is dying of heart disease. He decides that a heart transplant with a monkey will cure his son (no - I'm not kidding). He does the transplant and (somehow) his son, who was a frail man, turns into a muscular man with a dime mask that looks (in a way) to a monkey! Naturally, he goes out, kills men, tears women's clothes and wreaks havoc. All this is related to the annoying romanticism of the police. Arturo Martinez and the wrestler Lucy Ossorio. We also have useless female wrestling sequences that add nothing to the plot. Everything ends by copying the end of "King Kong"! It's (obviously) a pretty stupid movie. The plot does not make sense, there is free female nudity (a staple of any movie exploitation) and the VERY graphic gore that looks ridiculously wrong (with the exception of transplantation to open heart). However, that has merit. The whole cast takes everything seriously seriously and, in fact, is not too bad as an actor. Also, the dubbing in dialogue was (for a film like this one) well made and interesting with a surprisingly good dubbing. I also saw an excellent DVD copy with a bright and vivid color (which helps). We are not talking about a classic here, but about an OK movie.
