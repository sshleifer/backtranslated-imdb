Come on? FANTASTIC DRAMA ON THE SCREEN? Are you joking? I would not put the horrible Molly Gross to play even playing at school! Where did these people learn to play? Borrow papers from the actor of their neighbors? Terrible plot, terrible action. Hey ... why are you mistaking us for a fool? What more can i say? I understand that this is a television production and that the role is not supposed to be that of Citizen Kane. But nevertheless, they should make more effort to make their money. And apart from that, what can we say about 10 lines for such a simple movie? Do you want an article in the morning paper? To say what? Worst film of the decade? OK, you want it, you have it!
