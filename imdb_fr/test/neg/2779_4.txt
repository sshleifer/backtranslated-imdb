First of all, I'm in my mid-forties. I watch horror movies since I was a kid, so I saw a lot of variety. IMO, it's not as bad as the multitudes who gave a 1 or 2. Yes, it's a low budget horror movie. The dialogue is soso and tolerant sometimes. The basis of this movie about the plot is actually quite good. For those of you old enough to remember or lucky enough to have seen them on DVD. It sounds a lot like the movie of the week of the 1970s. Just add in the blood and minor blood, the minor T & A and swear words, without big names. That's all for one T. I'd rather watch that than Jason vs. Godzilla or some other crap that exists. Although not so good, EVIL DEAD was a low-budget movie. At least, give credit to these guys for trying. With a couple MIL budget, it could have been a very good movie. My score to watch 4.
