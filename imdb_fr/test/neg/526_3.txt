I finally got a DVD copy of this production and was amazed by the curiosity, because I had read so many people praising it in the sky, especially the portrait of Angela Lansbury representing Mrs. Lovett. I saw the movie Tim Burton a few months ago and found it excessively bloody; Fortunately, this version is not as horrible as it gore, but it suffers dramatically in many other ways so that it satisfies me in the least. <br /> <br /> To begin, the casting. George Hearn is adequate and shows at least one expression (unlike Johnny Depp's endless wooden face in the film). Angela Lansbury is just annoying. At least she has enough power in her voice to get the message across, unlike the voice of Helmin Bonham Carter and the voiceless little girl voice, but the subtlety seems to be just a word in the dictionary for Ms. Lansbury . You can not be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends all their time waving and winking in a "look, mom, I'm playing!" fashion and being too aware of the public. God knows it's not typical of theatrical productions. I have been used to a lot of Stratford Festial productions for many years and the actors do not behave in this way (at least those who want to keep finding a regular job no!) ... <br /> <br /> > Joslyn Betsy. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Other than me, did anyone notice that she could not sing that role even vaguely in an appropriate way? And she plays George Hearn's daughter is just scary, since she was married to him at the time. Is she not supposed to be a pretty little girl of sixteen? Yes, I realize that's the actor's job, but she did not convince me once that she was under the age of thirty-five, and the expression "sheep disguised as lamb" seems to have been invented just for her. His "Green Finch And Linnet Bird" massacre made me cringe and was ready to turn off the DVD player immediately. This song was so well written in Tim Burton's film, and it was a sad shock. The song requires Julie Andrews' vocal range in the 1960s and a purity of voice comparable to that of a boy soprano. All vibrato killed her dead and Mrs. Joslyn spent all the time bickering so hard that I thought she was about to fall off her ladder because she was shaking so much from the effort of supporting the coloratura notes with a Mezzo voice at best. Let's go on the sound show vibrating at least a quarter of your tone on at least three of the highest notes ... It's just not a coloratura role and a shrewd director should have told him - but the fact that she was married to the star who might have linked the director. <br /> <br /> Cris Groenendaal was enough, but again, he's obviously way too old for the role and there's no chemistry between him and Mrs. Joslyn, which makes the entire subplot fall completely flat. It reminds me a little of the previous stage productions of the Wagner Ring, where, because of the vocal power required for singers to scream at the sound of a full Wagnerian orchestra, they should play according to their ability to penetrate vocally and not of any appearance. or the ability to act or even a good voice, that's why you have the caricature of the mountainous Brunehilde mountain range to Viking with a triple chin and a beard, when the booklet calls for an ethereal beauty that is eternally young and bewitching. The cast of "minors" is exactly like that - if you close your eyes, you can almost believe in Mr. Groenendaal's Anthony, but as soon as you look at the screen, the illusion is broken. (And at no time, can you believe in Mrs. Joslyn's Johanna ...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost because of three of the four main characters that were so obviously misunderstood. I can not give appropriate criticism of anything else because they were so distracting that they ruined the rest of the production. I really do not understand why people marvel at the filming of a badly shot, self-conscious play. In the theater, the work of the camera is not just a dive in the first row. If I wish, I will play in a decent play, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where at least they work together for production and do not always make fun of the camera. I attribute to him three stars only because the quality of the production, apart from the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn, seems adequate if not spectacular. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do is probably to buy the movie soundtrack and cast recording of this piece, then combine the two to make a bearable ensemble. That's what I'm going to do, and try to forget that I have never bothered to rent this totally innocuous production.
