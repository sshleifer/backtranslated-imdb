Having appreciated Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in "The Dream Hunters") in the past, I thought Mirrormask was a sure thing and I was very disappointed. The beginning of the filmed part of the movie was quite intriguing. The relationships between the characters were credible and easy to understand, and I loved Helena's sets, costumes and artwork. The computer-generated scenes that followed were, however, unsustainable. The dialogue was clumsy and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the CGI was horrible. The events occurred for the most fragile reasons and most events seemed superfluous, no matter what the plot might have been. I only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the film, so I'm not quite an authority, but I strongly recommend that you do not look at anything and not stick to Gaiman's rigorous written work. .
