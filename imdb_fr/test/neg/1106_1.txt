I usually like this type of movie. However, this time, I found myself wanting to launch the screen. Since I can not do that, I'm just going to complain. It was absolutely stupid. The things that happen with dead children are very cool, but living people are absolute idiots. I am a grown man, tall enough and I can defend myself well. However, I would not do half of the things the little girl does in this movie. Moreover, the mother in this film is imprudent with her children, to the point of neglecting her. I would have liked not to be so mad at her and her actions because I would have otherwise enjoyed the movie. What number she was, follow my advice and move quickly through everything you see her doing until the end. Also, is anyone else tired of watching such dark movies? Moreover, we hardly see what is filmed. As an audience, we are incredibly involved in on-screen actions. So why can not we have a night vision?
