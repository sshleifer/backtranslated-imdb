Please, do not go see that. I had several laughs throughout this film, but they were all due to an involuntary comedy. <br /> <br /> There were only three characters in this film, the development of this character was incredible. Pacino still played Pacino and aggravated most of the time. The scenes from this movie seem to have been assembled from 20 other bad movies by a very bad publisher. There is no continuity and I wondered why I did not let myself take 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I would suggest never to see a film directed by D.J. Caruso. It was really horrible.
