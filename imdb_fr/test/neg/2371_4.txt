Leonard Rossiter and Frances de la Tour make this film, not without struggle, because the scenario was obviously assembled hastily from old episodes. When it came out, it must have been a real disappointment, as it is also done on the budget of a bus ticket. The attempts to get him out of the house - which is beautifully unrecognizable, a bad job - with a picnic, fantastic sequences, rugby and a boxing match in the local gym just do not work. Most of them are only light-character configurations for a solitary gag not particularly good. That said, the interaction between Rossiter and Tour (and all the others with him) is rather hilarious; they even manage to run a soda soda soda, but you can see the difficulty with recycling a literally uninspired script that changes the plot midway. Don Warrington has very little to do except "be black," and because of the random script, Christopher Strauli changes his character at least twice. And in the end, as he has often done in the television series (even if you may not remember it - read the scripts), Eric Chappell lets you down with a late "time's up". Were they as cynical or just too desperate to be in the film business? Rossiter and Tour are always fun, but as a movie, it's a terrible postscript for a television series whose memories have not escaped. TEAR.
