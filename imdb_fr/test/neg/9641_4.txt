My mistake in thinking it was a serious war movie is hell before I see it. All this ended a few seconds in the film when the logo "MTV" appeared. It could also be called "Sexy-N-Loose" by National Lampoon. And he played at the crowd "MTV"; the film that followed these first comic seconds was played as the music clips they broadcast over 40 years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to send Rated R files to Touchtone and we took them seriously. Ok, I am hard; it was not so bad of a movie. However, it definitely has its share of over-action and the film is extremely biased / one-sided. Certainly, I am not a movie buff. I can not watch 'Platoon', 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Saving Private Ryan' more than once. Of course, these were good films, but they are not my strengths and they all seem to blend after a time when I would not be able to tell them apart. After a tour of Iraq, Phillippe plans a life after the war, but he is fired because of a clause in his contract. Or at least that's the plan of the army until it becomes AWOL and the characters do cross-country with a few incredibly unexpected dollars. No, I have not participated in any war, nor in Iraq, nor do I agree with it. I also do not have all the knowledge necessary to recruit or sign their contracts. I can say this: Although I regret that they have been brought back into this conflict, I can not feel too strongly that someone so stupid does not read the details. It's like someone on his deathbed bending over to finally read the Surgeon General's warning on his box of cigarettes and say, "Oh, what's that, mortal, I'll sue them! "
