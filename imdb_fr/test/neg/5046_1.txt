This is just one of a hundred million movies where directors are trying to put too much drama in a film that is not at all. As in the beginning, the part where the monk's guy put the arrow in his own hand, then pulled that same arrow into the gargoyle five minutes later - no sense at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is worse than the line of intrigue is the CGI, which would be greatly challenged by a homemade flash movie. The actors seem to do their best to represent a group of robots from the 70s; dialogue makes so little sense that it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Many things ARRIVE without explaining how or why, like a lady wandering suddenly around a zoo that had been closed for hours. And when she sees this thing flying towards her, her first reaction is to take a picture, rather than what she does ten minutes later - the power of walking (not even the race) as if her life depended on it - who, obviously, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is not recommended. Wish me that they have made new episodes of MST3K yet.
