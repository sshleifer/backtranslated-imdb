I was anxious to see this movie because the trailer made it look so cool. But the fact is that this movie is boring and totally confusing. There is no plot and half of the film is composed of quick shots of football matches. Zoom on the plans, it does not give you an overview of the games. I was constantly watching the timer to see when the movie was over! <br /> <br /> There is only ONE good thing about this movie. The sound!! The soundtrack is great! ............. Do not expect anything from this movie.
