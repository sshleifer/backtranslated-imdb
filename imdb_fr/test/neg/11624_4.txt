I was disappointed with the Swan Princess suite. I can see what they were trying to do with the story, show how Odette and Derek lived in married life, but the story was not interesting enough to hold my attention and it seemed to cover the same bases as the original. <Br /> <br /> This is not funny. The only thing I found funny was to turn Jean-Bob into a prince, then back into a frog, without anyone knowing it and he was trying to convince them that it was. <br /> <br /> The villain is nil and the animation is not as impressive as the first movie. <br /> <br /> The queen is a very irritating character and instead of encouraging Derek to save her mother, you hope that the villain gets a spell on his voice mail to prevent him from speaking. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because I really liked the first film, but it did not live up to my expectations.
