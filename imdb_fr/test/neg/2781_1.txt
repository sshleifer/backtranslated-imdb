Another stupid "movie" The quality of the image is correct. Its too. The music is average. The guy is trying to make music like Halloween. <br /> <br /> The producer / director seldom chose a non-anorexic girl. That's because this "movie" takes a week and costs $ 10,000. Does this mean that when producers have money, they choose all anorexic girls? Good question. <br /> <br /> But the girls in this "movie" are physically correct. But they are not a good actress. Neither guys too. But maybe it's just because the "story" of this "movie" has no value. <br /> <br /> I'm sure we give $ 10,000 to a teenager who loves movies and can create a better movie. <Br /> <br /> Do not waste your time looking at this "thing".
