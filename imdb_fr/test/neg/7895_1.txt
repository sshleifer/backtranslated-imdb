I watched this movie with my boyfriend, an avid hip-hop fan, and he was really eager to capture the "soul" vibe that the movie claimed to have. Boy, we were wrong. When I finished watching the movie, I felt two things: remorse and relief. I had the regret to regret wasting my time watching this horrible dung, and to relieve it because I watched it for free by cable. <br /> <br /> This movie really gives Black a bad name by putting so many horrible stereotypes that I believe all intelligent blacks around the world have tried to eliminate. I am Asian and I am very sorry and sick for those who made this film. What more can be said? Bad writing, worse acting and horrible scenario. <br /> <br /> Even if you are bored to death and you have no other choice, do not watch this movie. Seriously. The film really has nothing to offer unless you want to see things such as minor illegal consumption, slaughter of an animal, degradation of the woman, and overall: A REALLY REALLY BAD-OBNOXIOUS-SICKENING FILM -AWFUL. Yuck.
