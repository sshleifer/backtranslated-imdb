It is difficult to find something commendable with this movie. It's not the worst image ever, but it does not say much. The plot is quite incoherent and incredible. it seems that the producers wanted to make a film about the space, but they decided to put it under water to take advantage of the success of The Abyss. In certain scenes, it seems that the story was indeed settled for the first time on outer space; the submarine has a landing gear, the technicians worry about a tear in a rubber diving suit several kilometers deep, where the pressure would crush the diver and the suit like an empty beer can. <br /> <br /> The film starts well, with the recovery planning of a lost naval submarine. After that, the film dives with the Siren 2. <br /> <br /> The effects are mediocre. The navigation screens are all made on the Commodore 64 (remember, we are in 1990 and not in 1983), the submarine is controlled like no other submarine; Instead of control consoles, the officers have keyboards with which they seize long sequences of numbers to control various functions of the ship. The interior of the ship is not very convincing either. <br /> <br /> The final scenes go from awkward to absurd. Welcome to the 50's, you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door. <br /> <br /> I do not see the pleasure factor here. The movie is neither good nor hilarious MST3k (until you get to the final scene), it's like eating a bad apple.
