I can not say more simply that it's a terrible film. I worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so, ok, my level is quite high, but seriously, I hate this movie. I had never commented on IMDb before, but I hated the movie so much that I had to literally come and tell others. It's a piece of sh * t. The screenwriter / director is an idiot who has no idea how to make / write a good movie and who has the writing skills of a teenager. The characters are unrealistic (the main woman does not think to take the policeman's gun, but is sufficiently resourceful to improvise a Molotov cocktail? Please ...) and not even amiable, I hated and applauded her his death. I do not understand what the director was trying to do with his redneck demon idea, but it just sounded like sloppy writing and clever bullshit, with no thought behind it. It's officially the worst film I've seen all year. Congratulations Shiban, you are now ranked among the big names such as Micheal Bay in the prestigious club "should not be allowed to lose millions of dollars for making a movie". I hope you read this, I really do it. And to the 163 idiots who rated this movie 10 out of 10 BWAHHAHAHAHAh oh my god, I hope a redneck demon conveniently appears behind you and tortures you.
