Demon Wind is as much fun as breaking your legs. It's really a terrible example of a movie. So horrible that I do not even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. One thing that needs to be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing hidden under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do, so we decided to watch some cheese horror movies (we unfortunately chose this one.) During the 90 minutes this story, we ended up laughing so loudly that we almost vomited. . The thing is literally useless in every sense of the word. It's just a poorly done and badly done scam of Evil Dead. All this "story" seems to be nothing more than a guy wanting to overthrow his friends by inviting them into an abandoned house and letting demons demolish them. I bet the writers were writing the story during the shoot. I have already seen bad horror movies (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS !!!) (thrill). I must admit that Demon Wind could definitely face any of these movies in terms of stupidity. Look at it only if you like to laugh while watching silly movies. <br /> <br /> Fun fact: this movie is like a cockroach on steroids! Like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to reappear mysteriously. A little scary huh?
