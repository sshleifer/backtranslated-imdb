This is an absolute drivel, designed to shock and titillate the mentality of the 60s. The game is completely wooden, consisting mainly of ad-libbing, which brings the sub-standard actors to dribble the first thing they can think of. , repetitively. <br /> <br /> The end result is a poorly written piece that is read by people who have no idea and do not care. The only exception to this rule is the main character "Joe" (played by Joe Dallesandro) who spends much of the film in a stupefied nude (either smashed or the only one in the room that can play!) I do not "understand" not Warhol - this is clearly a Stinker that should never have come out of a movie.
