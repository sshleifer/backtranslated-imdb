This film is a real shame, not only for the plot, the empty performance of the characters, it is the lack of creativity of the director and his team, it is perhaps one of the worst films of all time , and it's hard to believe that this is the sequel to one of the most famous movies of the 90s. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of The Mask, when I went to see this movie, I was expecting a movie with a good sense of humor, a movie with an acceptable plot, instead, I saw a very bad copy of the cartoons of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery, the movie was not funny, even for my 7 year old sister, so I wonder what was wrong with New Line Cinema ???. Was he trying to repeat the success of the first film, or was he trying to create another masterpiece like The Lord of the Rings? Because if they did, they were completely crazy.
