Rigoletto is Verdi's masterpiece filled with drama, emotion and powerful, memorable music. The maestro surely rolled into his grave when this silly parody of his work was released with his useless frontal nudity and inexpensive copulation and his portrayal of the naive but so-called Gilda as a horny saying. Opera can certainly be adapted to the cinema - look at Zeferelli's magnificent La Traviata - but when a work is as superb as Rigoletto, it does not need cheap gadgets. It might have been acceptable if the dubbed music had been good, but it is a poor rendition of the libretto with a second-rate sound quality.
