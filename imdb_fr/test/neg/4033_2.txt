Watching this movie really surprised me. I've never stopped watching a film in its entirety, because renting a movie with 3 dollars is a good amount of money and it would be cursed, I should at least look at all that and get my money's worth. I spent about 30 minutes of this absolutely crappy film when I said to myself: I am now a little silly after watching this movie. I can not believe that the director and the actors of this film had this lack of respect for themselves to allow the exit of this one! <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can say that has been said by other critics, but even in the worst movies, there is usually one or two decent performances ... not in this pathetic trash . I saw better playing in high school plays. Everyone, and I mean each actor, is unimaginable, and what is really amazing is the uniformity of the meanness ... that then, it must have been the director. Where did they find these people? <br /> <br /> This is perhaps one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Although entertaining in some places because of its ludicrous scenario and its even weaker acting, and I use this term very vaguely, it is unfortunate that this film is not intended for hell B for any reason. 'eternity. What could have been a good idea was ruined by an extremely low budget, low sound and effects and actors who probably won their parade on children's television, and poor children's television. <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this movie. Not worth a minute of your time.
