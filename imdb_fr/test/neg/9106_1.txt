Seriously, this film is not. Steve Guttenburg is constantly pushing his tough dialogue and giving everyone the bad eye all the time. He was just not credible, he seems to want to be a tough guy and he fears. I just remember him as a millionaire dad with the Olsen twins in It Takes Two ... so that's a BIG change. I rented this movie for Sean Bean and he dies (as usual). Only this time, he did not impale himself on a boat anchor (Patriot Games), crushed by a giant satellite antenna (Goldeneye), nor be crushed by cows (The Field). He has just been shot in a quick and civil way, and that's all I got from this movie: they did not kill him in an extremely grotesque and morbid way. How sad? I only watched for the 3 seconds that Sean was in, and then the rest was hogwash. In fact, I tried to look at and understand the plot, but there was not really any. It looked a bit like Mission Impossible with the hole, "Oooooo, there's a mole, he's the leader of the band, and nobody was waiting for him! Let's trap him! Let's coach the evil outsider so we can get out!" Clich√© and tired, this film was a waste of time.
