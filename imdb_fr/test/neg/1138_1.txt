I can not believe I bought this movie on DVD. I do not even remember it being shown on television last year. Why in the world could not they have made a real follow-up to one of the best Christmas movies ever made? Damn and Randy Quaid seems to have taken the same drugs as Jerry Lewis. I did not know this movie until I bought it tonight and decided to check it on IMDb and see how it was rated. Boy I made a mistake. If you read this advice, be warned, avoid it and stick to it at the first Christmas holidays. At least I did not pay more than $ 10 for that. Maybe I can trade it and get half of it back at Tower Records. Again, maybe not. PS I still have not watched, my DVD player started the evening watching another fantastic movie, The Chronicles of Riddick (Unrated Director's Cut). Woo freaking hoo.
