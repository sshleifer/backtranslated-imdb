This film is proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction. Ed Harris is awful. How could you play a built actor like Rambo to play the "Maestro"? He shows no credibility and overlooks Beethoven. Above all, the long hair does not look good at all on his head. The main actress misses all the subtleties necessary for her character. The shots are old and too conventional. The lights are closing the feelings of the characters. Bad casting and cheap direction. Pity! The only scene worth filming is the one where Beeth (I hope you do not mind that I call him by his nickname?) Turn the girl's song into a joke. Anyway, I hope Harris can find his way back to the real movie where he can really show his talent without hair.
