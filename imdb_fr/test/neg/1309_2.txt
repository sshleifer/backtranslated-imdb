Miscast, misdirected and atrociously written, this is watchable if you have an hour or two to kill or suffer from insomnia, but only. Robert Carlyle fully realizes his potential as a player of supreme mediocrity with a single expression of his repertoire (that of a chronically constipated football hooligan nursing a paralyzing inferiority complex), which he sometimes manages to modify slightly while flattering himself nostrils and breaking down. asymmetrical yellow teeth (to indicate anger, tenderness, grief, surprise, horror, hilarity, compassion, etc.). As "the best UK marine engineer" and the son of a university professor, he is also convincing as possible. my neighbor's cat. Tom Courtenay, all in melee, confusing and confusing each line, appears permanently under the eyes, and would no longer seem able to distinguish a flood from a puddle of his own urine if it were placed there. All in all, the British are attempting another foolish attempt to emulate Hollywood pulp at its best. The dialogue is a series of clich√©s poorly delivered; the action is disjointed; the plot is useless and amputated; and the characters, if you can call them that, are not even part of the two-dimensional fundamental sphere of their American counterparts.
