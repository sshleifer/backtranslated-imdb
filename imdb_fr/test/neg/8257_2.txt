It's a real shame that the screenplay of this movie has more holes than you can (intentional melody metaphor), because Kinski and Coyote - both extremely talented artists, capable of great subtlety and nuance - have a wonderful chemistry together and the always provocative Fairuza Balk did not hurt the mix. Jeremy Piven would have been great here too, if his character (and all the other characters associated) had not been written as a conspiracy. As regards the dispute in the main proceedings, the writers simply did not know how to create the guilty or innocent tension that suited the character of Kinski. They gave us confusion, contradiction and, ultimately, sincere hope. -Do not notice the cap.
