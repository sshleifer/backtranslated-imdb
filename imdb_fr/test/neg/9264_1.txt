After the hype around the film and after Surya called the film "PATH-BREAKING", I went to the theater hoping for something big. Boy was disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the descriptions of the movie are SO BEAUTIFUL! What woman would do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? A fool, a coo-coo? And what was the purpose of being in the rain with her child (Baby Shreya) after she and her husband had a fight? What was the purpose of this scene anyway? To launch a vulgar blow Maaja Maaja? Not only was the song not conserved aesthetically, it was simply not necessary in the script. NOT NEED ALL! Second, the first half had virtually no history. The first half was a FREAKING brake. Every scene in the first half of the film had no meaning for the true story of the film. And also, how did Aishwarya (Bhoomika Chawla) change so radically suddenly? And how did Gautham (Surya) and Kundhavi lead a happy life together after six years when they were so unhappy about getting married? And if Gautham loved Aishwarya as he claimed, why did DID even marry Kundhavi, even though it was his uncle's wish? WHY? That's the question you keep asking while watching the movie! And how far is the end of Aishwarya right? After all, she was Gautham's first wife? Krishna, the director of the film, claimed to have worked on the script for this film for two years, but his screenplay is full of flaws and leaves the audience completely irritated! Third, Kahna's imaginative fantasies about the awesome Rahman are simply disappointing. Surprisingly, Anthony's editing (usually superb) for the song "New York Nagaram" is nil! The entire song looked like a slideshow made on Microsoft Power Point! "Munbe Vaa", the chorus of Rangoli was lost to show Gautham PLAYING FOOTBALL !!! Who wants to see the guy freaking playing football during such a beautiful chorus?!? What's more, the whole movie needed only two songs. Munbe Vaa and Kummi Adi. The rest of the songs including "Machakari", "Maaja Maaja", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" are just not needed. Rahman's fine efforts are simply wasted in a stupid movie directed by an amateur director! Lovers of Rahman, you ask why Rahman continues to settle in Bollywood. After considering how his songs are illustrated at Kollywood, why would he want to stay here? What is even more irritating is that after Krishna decided to include Machakari in the film, the song was cut in half, which is really boring. <br /> <br /> Surya looks gorgeous in her new record, except those on the university scene and packs in such a performance. His expressions in all the songs in which he was presented do not really match the way the singer sings the songs. Did Jyothika even play in the movie? All she did was CRY! Do you want to call all those actors crying? One of his worst performances of all time! In addition, his new hairstyle does not suit him. She looked a lot better in Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu. His costumes during the song "New York Nagaram" are very far apart. Bhoomika Chawla is simply beautiful during the film and does justice to her role. The comedy of Vadivelu is ANNOYANTE. When you look at it, you want to be able to slap it. It is Santhanam who is the show thief during comedy scenes. And why on earth did Sukanya even accept to play such a tiny role that could have been played by anyone? And why is her makeup so heavy when she has the perfect complexion? A.R. Rahman's music is just awesome. "Machakari", "Munbe Vaa", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" deserve special mention. R.D. Rajasekhar's cinematography is correct and not as good as that of his previous films, although the landscape during the song "Kummi Adi" deserves special mention. Anthony's editing is really very disappointing. The movie is so scary and could be severely cut. <br /> <br /> The direction of Krishna is nil. The dialogues (A.C. Durai and Krishna) are too clear to be assimilated, especially the part where Bhoomika professes his love for Surya. The script and the script (Krishna) are horrible. The film moves at the least interesting pace. And Krishna's script is just filled with unexplained plots. <br /> <br /> And for God's sake, why was there so much publicity in the movie? Pepsi, Maggi, Suzuki, name it. Was the producer of the film (K. E. Gnanavel) within his budget or was he simply desperate? Overall, Jillunu Oru Kaadhal is a wet hangman. With a title like that one would expect a love story that warms the heart and cools, but you end up with a painfully sloppy love story. Really, really disappointing.
