This film started very well. the first 30 minutes are very funny and intelligent with interesting characters. This is the good news. The bad news is that the movie becomes too repetitive and becomes downright stupid. <br /> <br /> We get a Santa with "magical" powers with a lot of New Age madness. It's ridiculous and it's not the kind of "Christmas movie" I would expect from Jim Varney's "Ernest". a movie that I could recommend.
