"Built" Doris Day (as Ethel S. "Dynamite" Jackson) is mistaken for hope Ethel Barrymore and falls in love with the dancer Ray Bolger (as S. "Sam" Winthrop Putnam). Frenchman Claude Dauphin (under the name Philippe Fouquet) also digs Doris. Honestly?? What were they thinking? - This completely inappropriate musical presents Mrs. Day singing beautifully the title "April in Paris", among others. Certainly, there is nothing as good as his Columbia recordings of the time; and nothing approaches the magnificent "secret love" of Day. Although the material does not serve him well, it is nice to see Mr. Bolger play. Some music numbers are obnoxious. <br /> <br /> **** April in Paris (24/12/52) David Butler ~ Doris Day, Ray Bolger, Claude Dauphin
