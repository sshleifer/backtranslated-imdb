I loved the original P.H. and was a little satisfied with Bloodwings (II) and Ashes to Ashes (III), then I saw part IV. Oh boy ..... As an amateur of Pumpkinghead, I did my best to give Part 4 the most credit possible, but it's a shame. The battle of the wedding reception right from the start of the movie is a horrible mess for one thing. The scenario of Hatfield and McCoy is incomprehensibly stupid and clich√©. How did the producers get along with this tired old family war story? Wow, amazing. The acting, apart from Henrickson, is below average. The plot and the script are staggering. The editing and the cinematography are average, as well as the staging. I mean, the movie is not a total loss. As always: I love watching Pumpkinhead, I like to see Haggis the witch and watch the ghost of Harley in action. But the three characters had MUCH too much time on the screen. I thought Haggis and Harley would end up going to a supper club to eat and have a drink in the evening, as they were so friends in his cabin. The bottom line is ... did I want all the characters in this plot to be dead within 20 minutes of the start of the photo? How does Sci-Fi get these so-called "film production professionals" ?? I could do a better job writing a drunk script. I'm sure there was a limited budget and everything, but come on! See if you are a fan of the other three, but just once. And then go back and respect the two originals. Shame on you science fiction !!!!
