Although this story was well told, I found it too unpleasant. The main subject is child abuse, which is never fun to see - a sordid subject. Add to that a lot of blasphemy from the abusive drunken husband and a general speech from a little kid, no less - and this film completely upset me. <br /> <br /> Punks banging on the two little boys have also been described, another unpleasant viewing experience. The realism of the story takes a swan dip when one of the boys takes off on a homemade plane! Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The only positive and enjoyable aspect of this film is to see the pleasant, affectionate and touching relationship between the two younger brothers, played by Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello. The latter has become a familiar face over the next two years with important roles in Jurassic Park, Shadlowlands and The River Wild. Wood, of course, did not hit the market until ten years later, but he did a very big trilogy in The Lord of the Rings. These two children and the narration of an unbilled Tom Hanks are the only facets of this film that I liked.
