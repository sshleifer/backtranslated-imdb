... I can not believe that there really are people here who recommend this film ... It's such a slow selling point that leads to absolutely nothing. Oh yes, it's going somewhere, but you see it coming from several kilometers. Interpretation: really bad, maybe the bartender was OK. Montage: BAD! I suppose the editor was informed that "it took at least 90 minutes" because half of all the scenes could have been put in the trash. Music: Do not get me started, the ugliest part I've ever heard. Who is it to sing in the last scene to shout ?? Achievement: Oh my God, IMNSHO David Lynch is bad, but someone trying to copy him sucks even harder. Skip this one.
