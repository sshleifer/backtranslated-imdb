A comedy that cheats inspiring sports films, The Comebacks tells the story of a luckless coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a bunch of nice college kids and pushes them to the football championships. Along the way, this long-time loser discovers that he is ultimately a winner by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there is indeed no "I" in "team"! <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the unrated version for this movie. It was thirty minutes longer and I thought maybe it was better than going out, hearing that people hated this movie. After all, thirty minutes of extra footage can add a lot to a movie. Well, I was certainly wrong. It was as bad as the recent "Meet the Spartans" but it was thirty minutes more of torture! <br /> <br /> Seriously, who makes a parody movie of almost two hours ?! A parody film is short film because if it lasts longer, it would be exaggerated! Honestly, I like stupid comedies. Heck, I liked "Date Movie", "White Chicks", "Epic Movie" and "Little Man"! I guess when it comes to parody movies, it's a hit or a hit and this one is definitely missed. <br /> <br /> On the brighter side, among the many jokes of this movie, I'll say about six or seven made me laugh, even some who made me laugh out loud. But it does not say much. These scenes of jokes were followed by other scenes of torture and infidelity. <br /> <br /> I do not see how people would say it's not a terrible parody movie. In fact, there is as much product placement here as Meet the Spartans, there are so many dance sequences and jokes without laughing. Another thing I like in this movie is the songs. These are very good songs here. Overall, look at it if you like parodic movies. Ignore it if you like fun movies.
