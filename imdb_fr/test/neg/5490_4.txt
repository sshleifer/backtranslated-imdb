This film walks on a very familiar terrain - the confusion of art and reality in the actors' lives. There is nothing particularly new or interesting to say about this subject and is actually rather boring. The final scene in particular is endlessly tedious. See the audience crying in front of the "moving" game they see on the screen asked me "who do they think they're laughing at?" <br /> <br /> There are nevertheless good performances and interesting scenes, especially minor characters. Ben Gazzara plays an old, slightly touched actor, who receives a panoply of police applauding when they come to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken is playing a crazy wacko again. Remember his character "The Continental" on Saturday Night Live; an aging eurotrash satyr chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to put her to bed? He makes an identical turn in the film, chasing his young prey (male) around an antique table and covering it with champagne. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was both enchanting and irritating, but mostly irritating.
