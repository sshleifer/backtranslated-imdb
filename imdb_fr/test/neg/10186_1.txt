I warn you, it's a waste of time. I'm honest when I say it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just a Christian propaganda gesture! Do not throw away your life, do not see it! <br /> <br /> I think they made the film so that more people believe in Jesus or something, but it works in the opposite direction. The actors are all beginners, the story is fuzzy! <br /> <br /> I think this film is a work of the devil. <br /> <br /> This movie is just not worth seeing, so follow my advice and do not do it!
