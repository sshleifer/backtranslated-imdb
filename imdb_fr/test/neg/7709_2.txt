OK, this movie was far worse than the first and the first was bad! The zombie makeup was extremely wrong! The acting is very poor! And it does not really follow the first one! Looking at this, I kept thinking that the first was a masterpiece compared to this one. I would say: catch it on TV, do not spend your money on it! It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it's on the list. I started to watch it last night and fell asleep, so I looked at it today and almost fell asleep again! The plot was futile, I mean I understand the fact that a small military group is sent on a mission to collect the blood of the chief zombie and bring it back so that he can use it to save lives and stop the zombies, but they did it where everyone wanted to die. They did a lot of bad guys that were really boring. If you ask me, it's a scam of the residents trouble and not a good scam. The plot could have been successful if the acting was good and they really scared you to see what's behind the corner. With these zombies, my grandmother could have gone into this building and survive! on a 1-10 I give him a 2.
