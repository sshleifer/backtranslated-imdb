First: The recent campaign of this film is a huge hoax. Judging by the cover, you'd think it's kind of a scandalous movie about Kylie playing a character fucking, drugging, and so on. This is just a cheap market system. She is hardly there and does not do anything. The marketing here is incredible, and I am surprised that the filmmakers did not oppose it. <br /> <br /> The film itself was a huge disappointment for me. It looked like an episode of Sunset Beach directed by a teenager, Quentin Tarantino. And that's not a compliment, notice. <br /> <br /> I think that the weakness of the film is above all the story. He seems to be about nothing. Just about cool teenagers who decide to live "on the wire". The characters themselves, however, have a personality, but the film does not use its potential. As said, there is no story of substance here. He seems too elaborate on the cool dialogue and ends up looking like a colorful MTV advertisement. He really has that feeling. <br /> <br /> Still, I guess some people might enjoy it, but I would say there are much better movies like this one.
