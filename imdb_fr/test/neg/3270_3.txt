Every time I watch this film, blood gushes from my eyes. Yes, you read correctly: I looked at this miserable and nauseating thing more than once. <br /> <br /> Caddyshack 2 was wrong for many reasons: Harold Ramis composing a script and giving up his leadership duties, Rodney Dangerfield (wisely) moves away from the project because they do not allow him to To change the script, Bill Murray demonstrates excellent judgment and is not part of it, and a puppet is pushed forward as the star of a cast that deserves much better. <br /> <br /> I can not help but think about Dyan Cannon and wonder why she laughs and smiles all the time. The only conclusion I can draw is that she is the face of pure evil. Stay with me for a moment. She had to watch the film come together and marvel at the terrible anxiety it would inflict on countless future spectators who were extremely sorry to see this film. She may also have been extremely drunk. That's what I have to do now to get rid of my mind of the bad taste of this total failure. If I'm lucky, it will be erased forever. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie several times. I impute many to childhood and to the fact that I am a very boring and weak-minded boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility. Puppets may just be funnier when you're a kid. No, the Muppet show is funnier now ... guess I was just boring. Caddyshack 2 is that kind of rare movie that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you'll be convinced after the end credits that it could not have been so bad. It was. It is. It will only get worse over time. <br /> <br /> My reasons for coming back to this film are thankfully fewer and fewer. Randy Quaid is limited in his role as Jackie Mason's lawyer. His opening scene is not bad and brought out my only laugh. We see him a few more times, but he becomes as tired as the rest of the movie and comes down with unfortunate speed from an accidental amusement to a vacant lot. Randy Quaid is doing well, and this film owes him a lot, because if there was a reason to watch this movie other than as a tactic of torture, that was it. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's the trick of the movie. He has enough potentially endearing qualities for people to look at, to be horrified at what they have done themselves, but later, because their choices were so thin, they can only remember what made them really amused. Years later, they look at him without their knowledge and the cycle is repeated. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason bears a lot of responsibility for this film but, in all fairness, I'm not sure he deserves it. He's really trying, but it's impossible not to notice that he spends the entire film posing as Rodney Dangerfield. It's for whom the movie was written but I'm not sure he could even have saved it. In the end, it fails miserably by a terrible direction, a bad editing (must we count the errors of continuity?) And a recovery of the same story without the ironic humor or the heart that made the first film attractive. <br /> <br /> and scream up to three out of ten instead of two by Randy Quaid's bulldog determination. It's not even serious enough to laugh. I have certainly seen worse, but trust your memory - this one is a dog. If you've never seen it before, you've made great lifestyle choices and I salute your excellent judgment.
