I was expecting a lot of this movie (it was not an apocalypse or an 8 1/2, but high enough), and when I saw it on a cable, they were all broken. Let's start with the acting game (mediocre, almost mediocre, an astonishing waste of good actors and talent) and the story itself: Since when did a team of 5 men go on patrol in an area supposedly "hot" ?? ? Suicide? It's a big mistake, it's expensive for the film. Very good actors play very badly here, like Sean Penn, who recently repeated the irritating way of talking about "I am Sam", and Michael J. Fox, who misses a good opportunity to beat Charlie Sheen in "Platoon", just happening "average". But the most irritating character was Diaz (played by John Leguizamo, another stupid waste of talented director talent). He was a nerdy character, scared and insecure, even more irritating than Jar Jar Binks (if you heard him). The fight sequences are average, the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence, with Michael J. Fox stuck by his feet on a VC tunnel. De Palma has a weak job here, and if it were not for films like "Scarface" and "The Incorruptible" (these excellent films), I would consider him a "bluff" director: too much publicity, bad filming . <br /> 3/10
