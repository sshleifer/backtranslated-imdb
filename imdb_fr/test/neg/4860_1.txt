I clicked on Encore Mystery to wait for the movie I wanted to see, Island of Dr. Moreau. I only caught a few minutes of Shadow Conspiracy. An old man runs to join Charlie and grabs him by the arm. Suddenly, an assassin wearing a bright raincoat hits the old man in the head (with a side arm) across the street. After waiting for "C" to turn around and look, the "A" tries to shoot "C" and misses it clearly. "C" was a much easier target, the old man could not have run far. Duh! There is a chase and "C" is on an elevator "A" is on the roof, so he tries to pull the cable, which is parallel to the "A". He knocks and cuts the cable, impossible. Later, this time with a specialized rifle, the "A" lines up on the "C" at about 50 meters, but it's too stupid to notice a motorcycle coming in and banging the rider instead. How does Charlie get his roles? Dad goes to the producers and says, "Look, my child needs work ..." It reminds me of his stupid Sit-Com. All the actors are good except you, you have it. I usually have to support 2 or 3 minutes of this wait for C.S.I. to come up. Let's see, what can I do for the next hour. I know, I'm going to cut my nails! Much better use my time.
