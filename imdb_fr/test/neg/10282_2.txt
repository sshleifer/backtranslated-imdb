The series is at least partially falsified (so it's not reality, it's just a pretense of being reality), which leaves me at least believing that anyone without a scrambled face is a fake episode. <br /> <br /> The proof in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed There is already a film crew on the boat, even before he gets there, can be seen approaching of his boat. <br /> <br /> The actors playing the "ambulance officers" did not take off their shirt They were still injured so that they work on it, which would never happen. <br /> <br /> They also parked the ambulance in the parking lot and did not go to the emergency entrance (which makes no sense unless its fake and they would not be allowed to go there)
