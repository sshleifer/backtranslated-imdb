My wife and I watched this film because we plan to visit Sicily and Stromboli soon. Fortunately (or unfortunately), the landscape and the seascape (with tuna) are the only credible members of this cast. We were expecting a reasonable movie, well written and well played, but we were disappointed. His only grace is an extensive and remarkable fishing sequence, full of authenticity: flying tuna, nets, wooden boats with big oars and passionate fishermen, although superstitious. <br /> <br /> The film sequence is shifted, its dialogue elevated, and the action goes from stiff to completely "over-the-top". A scene in which Bergman points out that his macho, native and na√Øve husband, shows his ferret to an "innocent" (but apparently already dead) rabbit would be an ideal gift for a Monty Python skit. <br /> <br /> When the volcano was blown, we hoped for a merciful end to suffering (ours and casts). Unfortunately, the film continues to rage, finally shaking in a melodramatic and absurd end. Unless you really like old-fashioned tuna fishing, spread your effort.
