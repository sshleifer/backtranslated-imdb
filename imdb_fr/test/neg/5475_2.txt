Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance must have desperately needed work to have lent their talents to this turkey. A horribly confusing story about Satanism in modern Greece, Land Of The Minotaur (or The Men of the Devil) is a failure to a greater or lesser extent. There are few precious scares (always a slight defect for a "horror" movie, do not you think?); poor performance; countless scenes where characters go wild or refuse to stay in the safety of a group; and some rather irritating editing techniques that add absolutely nothing to the procedure. 17 years after The Flesh And The Fiends, I was prematurely excited about the prospect of collaboration between Cushing and Pleasance - but this film is not worth the excitement of a bit; it's a huge disappointment and rather a hindrance to his much more deserving tracks. <br /> <br /> In a remote region of Greece, foreigners like tourists and archaeologists continue to disappear and the local priest, Father Roche (Donald Pleasance) suspects that something sinister is preparing. He wrote to his friend Milo Kaye (Costas Skouras), a private eye in New York, asking him to fly to Greece to help him get to the bottom of the mysteries. Meanwhile, three other visitors - Beth (Vanna Reville), Ian (Nikos Verlekis) and Tom (Robert Behling), all of Father Roche's personal friends - disappear as they search the nearby Greek ruins. Milo finally arrives in Greece, but is at first uncertain about Father Roche's belief that the missing people were stolen for satanic sacrifices. Milo and Father Roche are also joined by Laurie (Luan Peters), the girlfriend of the missing man, Tom. Together, they discover the activities of a devil-worshiping Minoan cult, led by the terrifying Baron Corofax (Peter Cushing), exiled from the Carpathians. These crazy cultists have actively sacrificed their victims to a statue of the Minotaur. In addition, they can not apparently be killed by normal means. Father Roche must therefore use a variety of religious objects to fight against them. <br /> <br /> The country of the Minotaur should have been much better than it really is. The plot is so far-fetched and improbable that it has all the characteristics of a crazy camp cult / favorite. But the manipulation is just horrible. The director Costas Carayiannis has no idea how to relate the story coherently, so that everything progresses as if it were being prepared from day to day. He also does not know how to convince his interpreters to convince convincing performances, so that they are obliged to embarrass themselves, whether they are terribly martial (Pleasance, Cushing) or terribly amateurish (Skouras, Peters). What is worse is that the narrative makes no sense. Why would Father Roche seek help from a private eye who is totally flippant about his beliefs? How does Roche know that sacrifices only occur during the full moon? How can the Minotaur statue speak? Why did one of the sacrificial victims have the order, during a vision, to stab Father Roche, only moments later, before having the chance to execute it? And - the most disconcerting of all - why does Father Roche drag Milo to the other side of the world to help him when he lacks only a crucifix and holy water to get rid of bad guys? These questions, and many more, will come to mind during Land Of The Minotaur ... but, alas, there is no answer to bring. Frustrating, stupid and disappointing!
