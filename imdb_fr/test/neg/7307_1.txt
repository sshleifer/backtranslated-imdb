Really a big step forward in the perfection of painful cinema. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is bad. Acting (if you can call it that), lighting, sound, script (if there was one), editing, production, camera work, it's all atrocious. There is not one element that is well done. If I thought it was intentional, maybe I could credit the movie, but I can not believe people would leave to make such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth buying and presenting to your worst enemies. .
