This film was so bad, so cheap and so old-fashioned, that this movie was one of the most boring movies of the early 80's, at a slow pace, that I've ever seen. I like most of the cheap 80s horror movies, but I would not rent this one anymore. It made no sense. A family living in the woods invites their son, wife and daughter to spend time with them during the holidays and during the film for whatever reason, the mother and daughter-in-law do not get along well. We never know why until the end of the film, but all we see is that the mother has some form of ESP and her daughter-in-law has nightmares and flashbacks of disaster of what will happen. to the unfortunate victims of this "thing" that we have no idea what it looks like, all we see is a bright light signaling its approach and all we hear is an inexpensive interpretation of the voices of Dark Vadar and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies. Then, when we finally discovered what and to whom it's all that I did, it was laughing. This "killer" turns out to be a sort of extraterrestrial Japanese warrior of the Second World War who apparently came back to life to claim the mother and her family. And all the mother does is stand in front of the living room shaking, her hands on fire or something as if she is convulsing. This film is pathetic! Avoid it, it's not even worth renting.
