Wow, it was a real stink. This first sci-fi film has nothing to envy to the pure camp. There are so many mambo-giants scientists in the dialogue that it's laughable. The female character portrayed by Osa Massen is a conspiracy device allowing male characters to broadcast sexist remarks throughout the duration of the film. Look at this one with your girlfriend, I guarantee you it will boil her blood. The only good thing is the musical score that expertly builds the moods of the film. The special effects are rather crude but not bad considering the vintage of the film. With some good stars B in the main roles, the acting is not so bad. But the lines given to them must have been a challenge for them. The challenge of not laughing.
