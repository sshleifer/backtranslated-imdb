Nothing in this film is good. It's a predictable and stereotypical "romantic comedy" designed to force women to force their loved ones to watch. In other words, it's a predictable, chic film that is neither comical nor romantic and is extraordinarily forgotten. If you like to watch the same thing again and again, then this movie will be perfect. I was also forced to look at this with my g / f at the time and it is not surprising that we are no longer together. I enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch, so she just wants to see the same thing again and again just with different actors. Nothing good to say about this movie. The title says it all. 1/10 (a b / c I can not give him a zero.
