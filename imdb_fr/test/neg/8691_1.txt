Does anyone care about one of the characters in this movie? - Or what happens to them? - I doubt. This is the main problem: for a tragedy to work, we must be concerned about at least one of the characters and none of them inspires any sympathy or seems to have any quality that redeems. <br /> <br /> worked in the 16th century, certainly does not work in one can assume "post-apocalyptic Liverpool" if it was really what it was supposed to be. The problem is that post-apocalyptic Liverpool characters, while driving cars, using their cell phones and watching TV, have started speaking in Shakespearian - with a dialect of Liverpudlian. Oh dear! It's pretty bad, maybe you think - but it's often fallen into pure scouse - with comments like "heh lah are you a cockney?" And was it an announcement of Merseyrail during one of the scenes filmed in the subway? The good news is that in post-apocalyptic Liverpool, trains still work. <br /> <br /> The characters without exception are poorly drawn, in wood and look more like caricatures on the lines of Joker / Penguin Batman and Robin except that there is no real scenario strictly speaking - or if there is one - it is a scenario that does not work in a modern setting where half of the sets are dark and where "Blade runnerish" and the other half are fluorescent or just normal in the 21st century. . The costumes are also mixed with half wearing their everyday clothes (the Parkers are important in post-apocalyptic Liverpool - apparently) and the other half wearing the remnants of a disguised party? <br /> The film explores the ideas of lust, incest and revenge in the most senseless way - the tragedy is that this film was shot. <br /> <br />
