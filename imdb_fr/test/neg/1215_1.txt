It is amazing that such a film of yuppie anxiety mounted in clich√© was done in the first place. The characters are so weak, and the acting so uninspired, that it's impossible to worry about any of them - especially Brooke Shields. The temptation to move fast in slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this kind of music, you'd better rent "Singles" or "Bodies, Rest & Motion".
