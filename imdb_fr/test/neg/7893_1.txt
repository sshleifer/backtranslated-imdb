I'll be honest: the purple plane with Snoop Dogg at the helm is a fun visual gag. That would have been a decent concept for a 30-second ad, or maybe a 3-minute music video. But producers have committed the sinister historical concept of stretching 30 seconds of film in an hour and a half of film, and the results are predictable. The rest of the 89 minutes is filled with the typical range of racist and sexist humor and jokes about farts, offensive and - worse yet - painfully impossible. The worn plot screams under the weight of its artifices. It is better to avoid being drunk or stoned.
