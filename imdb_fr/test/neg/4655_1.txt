A Lassie film that should have been "asleep" .... FOREVER. Here's how I would describe this loss of time painful and tedious film. If poor in every way that it becomes a disorder dull and uninteresting, it is one of the more forgettable films I've ever seen. This is not even a feat as the movie "so bad it's good" or "so bad, it's memorable." The idea that Lassie goes wrong is intriguing, but it happens so little in reality things, and so slowly you feel your life is lost, sitting, sitting, watching the non-actors read their lines on scorecards waiting for their miserable paycheck. <br /> <br /> It's the hollow and hollow shell of a movie. Seriously, it's not worth wasting your time or your child's time. Unless you are both heavily medicated. That's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Avoid, avoid, avoid! He'll make you crazy barking! Hahahah, understood? BARK! Hahahahahahaha! <br /> <br /> Sorry, I had a difficult week.
