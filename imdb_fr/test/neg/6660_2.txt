The words can hardly describe this film. Bursting with ridiculous stereotypes, silly intrigue and mediocre music, this film misses almost every category. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the credits of the BDIM. This is not a Michael Dorn film. He is a secondary character in the grand scheme. <br /> <br /> An actor named "Prince" is also mentioned in the credits - which makes me wonder if it's the same artist who was once known as .... I'm not sure this movie deserves to be watched just for that. <br /> <br /> Big summary ... a group of teams ... we have kidneys ... we have $ 35,000 ... we have an "illegal substance" ... and one has $ 350,000. Add a bit of confusion and confusion about who should meet who, revenge on a catch, etc., and you will end up with this mess of a movie. movie.
