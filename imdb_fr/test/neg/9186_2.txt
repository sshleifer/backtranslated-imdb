"Wagons East" was a big disappointment for me. But what is saddest about this film is that it was the last role of John Candy (he died just before the shoot was over). There are only a few laughs in this Western parody, and for a comedy that does not cut. If you want to see a hilarious parody of Western movies, the answer is obvious. See the classic "Blazing Saddles" by Mel Brooks. Or if you want to see Candy in a much better material, see "Summer Rentals", "Spaceballs" or "Uncle Buck" (to name a few). These three films (as well as others) show us how much he was a comic actor. Unfortunately, "Wagons East" does not do it. What a shame! <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
