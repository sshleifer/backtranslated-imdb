A very, very, very slow and aimless film about a young man in distress and adrift. I do not know who was the most lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom came out. <br /> <br /> Attempt of artiness with smart black and white camera angles, the film disappointed - became even more ridiculous - because the acting was mediocre and the intrigue and lines almost nonexistent. Very little music or anything to talk about. The best scene of the film was when Gerardo tried to find a song that was trotting in his head. He goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sellers before finding the album. The cute scene promised, but she came down from there. The rest of the film lacks art, charm, meaning ... If it's empty, it works because it's empty. Wasted two hours.
