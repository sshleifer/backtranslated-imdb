This film made me think ... of how I could write about it without personally dispelling the director and all the actors, of whom I am proud, as an Australian, to have traveled here. down and make a movie. <Br /> <br /> But the film itself? Let me tell you a story .... <br /> <br /> I found this DVD yesterday in my local rental store and you had vague memories of critics at the time of the movie's release here. So I thought I'd give it go. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I decided to look at the "special features" before watching the movie itself, that's not what I usually do. Halfway through, the shooting of the "making of" took place, because I was tired of fearing the "are we not so great to have created such a powerful film with a scenario as raw". <br /> <br /> The film? Ugh. Full of clich√©s and development of pathetic character. Players? Congratulations guys, you are Australians and I applaud you. And, just as a football team is as effective as the coach who runs it, you unfortunately did NOT have a good scenario to work with. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that the film had in fact banalized as many subjects. that he seemed to want to cover. I have seen many critics here who speak only soap. Okay. <br /> <br /> Finally (and forgive me if I do not say that correctly), I was extremely disappointed that there was no optimistic connotation. Yes, we all know that life is full of difficult things, and yes, we know that things such as incest occur, but I really have a hard time applauding a film that does not contain a single joy. I believe a director has the responsibility to put it somewhere. Otherwise, the film is all about them and their feelings, they created it for themselves, not for an audience. <br /> <br /> Which, in my opinion, is the reason why this movie is not so good. The reports mention that the director wrote the screenplay during a 36-hour session the day after he himself tried to kill himself. It may have been cathartic for him to do so, however the film smells of indulgence towards oneself when you know the story behind why it was written. "I feel horrible, I'm going to write a movie about feeling horrible." (Note: I read the interview with Andrew Urban and I understand WHY Thalluri needed to write something to help him solve his problems, but I believe there is a line in the film that can not not be crossed - the line of making a movie solely for your own emotional needs, and I feel that this has happened unintentionally here) <br /> <br /> By his own admission, the Director has no technical experience and, unfortunately, this gives the impression that the film is nothing more than a media project of a dozen years. <br /> <br /> Regarding the recommendations that this film should be studied at school or that all teenagers should watch it - it is not sure either. Because there is a VERY dangerous line in the end. I, too, found myself in a place where I thought someone who was no longer forced to "face life" was "lucky", but as an adult, I fear that this line could influence a young spectator who was in a vulnerable situation. state of mind. Perhaps to promote discussion, but again, it does not reflect any possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, it almost indicates that there is still sadness ahead. <br /> <br /> I have not seen an elephant, but maybe I'll go get it, given all the comparisons presented here. <br /> <br /> Nothing personal here guys, I hope you can do another movie someday, and we all have to start somewhere, so forgive me if I was too hard. I am happy that you are proud of what you have created, which is ultimately what life is. This is not a movie that I would recommend though. <br /> <br /> Oh, I liked the way the deadlines often came up, thinking it was an interesting way to film. <br /> <br /> But the whole thing "It's the quietest you have to watch" - we already know it.
