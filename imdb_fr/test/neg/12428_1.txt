OMG, another bad film by Larry Buchanan. This guy did not learn to stop, did he? First, he presents us sci-fi sci-fi movies and lies about famous people, and he now exploits the Loch Ness monster as vicious. <br /> <br /> The plot is mostly about some southerners in the United States claiming to be Scottish camping in Loch Ness. Alas, on the fishing hole, oops, I mean Loch Ness Lake, there is a killer inflatable monster posing as Nessie, trying to kill people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that the MST3K team has never heard of this movie. Yes, it's as bad as that.
