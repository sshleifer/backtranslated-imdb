I only saw this film once, around the age of 14, but I was delighted that they made a film about the 45th Division. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that my two sons are members of the 45th, I would like to see him out on DVD. I may seem a bit biased, but the 45th Division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today. History still talks about other infantry divisions when it talks about the Second World War and Korea, but you rarely hear about the 45th. One of the scenes that struck me most was the Indian presence of Indian code code at work and the perplexed look on the faces of German soldiers when they did not understand that language. I am pleased that all Native Americans of the American Code get the recognition they deserve.
