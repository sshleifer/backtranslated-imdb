A guy, in the unlikely name of Shy Walker, is looking for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half. That's the whole plot ... with bad general action, of course. Walker wanders through a labyrinth of maize (maize? I understand! HAHAHA ... not funny) and screams "Girls? Where are you?!?" about 1000 times. For some reason, every time he passes a pumpkin, a voice sounds like a chipmunk starts to laugh (as if the pumpkin was making fun of him, yeah, all right ...). His daughters scream almost the entire movie ... even when there is no reason to shout (maybe because they are still stuck in this horrible movie?). Binoculars straight out of 'The Shining' appear from time to time. Most maize labyrinths look the same, so Walker's research is aging very quickly. Filmmakers realize that NOTHING is getting ready for this movie (even the music is repetitive). They try to make things interesting by rotating the camera very quickly, filming upside down, inserting smaller images of the same shot from different angles, using red lights to make the corn look scary and you turn the camera 360 degrees (at least I guess it was done intentionally, but these are probably only examples of making incompetent movies). Most often, when Walker walks through the labyrinth, you can not see his face. I guess the kid who holds the camera can not look so high ... This movie gives you a new appreciation of the original 'Dark Harvest' (which has nothing to do with this movie, apart from the fact that it also includes a corn field). Do not be fooled by the note R. Walker says three times the word "F" and we now have "a horror movie rated R". The scarecrow on the cover does not even appear in this movie ... and when you want the cheese scarecrows of the first movie come back, you know everything is going wrong! Instead, we have a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero (unfortunately, he is dressed the same way as Mr. Walker, I did not even know he was followed for a while). I understood the guy's identity in the yellow boots long before Walker (the film is almost finished when he puts 2 and 2 together, of course). The end of the movie hangs over and over ... and just in case it is not slow enough, there will be slow motion! The last sound you hear (apart from your own laughter) is a very poor sound. In case you do not know it, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. At least they have not finished with the promise of another sequel!
