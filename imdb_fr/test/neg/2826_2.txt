I wrote an essay in 1981, the year of my high school diploma called "The Last American Virgin". I also had a friend named Nancy who was the prostitute in this movie. Apparently, her daughter got her hands on one night when she slept at my house. a year later, I get up one morning and see the publicity of this film. I was 18 years old and based on experiences of my life. the film is a little different from my essay but it was taken. I did not have any proof about this, except for my English teacher, mr.Versace, who gave me an A on my essay.I let it pass and I never did anything to this subject.I have imagined what is going around. I still would not take action against anyone involved in this film. I just needed to get rid of it because I did not really talk to anyone except my closest friend and they agreed to keep it a secret. The same year, I saw Nancy in a market, she really had the nerve to ask me if I had interesting stories or scripts to watch. I guess that's what Hollywood is, getting stories where you can. It was interesting to see some parts of my life on the big screen though. <br /> <br /> ghost writer!
