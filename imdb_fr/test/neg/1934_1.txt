It's probably a cultural thing - the natives of this country have been conditioned to find that funny. I myself witnessed this phenomenon at an outdoor movie event, where this film was screened before the feature film. Most members of the aboriginal audience laughed, and no, it was not in a sanatorium or a delayed children's clinic, it was in a wealthy area and the audience was mostly educated adults. <br /> <br /> So, it must be possible, one way or another, to find that amusing, but honestly, I have no idea what it takes - maybe it is in the air or in the water, what prolonged exposure causes the disease. Something must be the cause, obviously, the only thing I can say is that I'm quite sure of what does not cause it: the film itself. <br /> <br /> There are no jokes in the movie. It's brain dead, stupid, insane, not funny, lame. In short, it's a waste of time. All Tom and Jerry are funnier, even funerals are funnier. <br /> <br /> Just in case you have the chance to have never seen any of the Stooges performances: these are three guys who behave, run, even talk like retarded kids, causing all sorts of chaos without foundation, without conspiracy, without real purpose, and without any real conclusion. It's like ugly Teletubbies without the cute costumes. <br /> <br /> Sitting in a crowd looking at this garbage can in this country can be pretty infuriating, because you feel like you're at a party with a bunch of So unless you be prepared to get drunk to make it bearable, or to bring with you everything that might make you think that watching three ugly old men behave like morons is funny, my advice on this is: stay away. Far.
