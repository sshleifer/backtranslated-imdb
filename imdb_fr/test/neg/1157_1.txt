The story of Ed Gein is interesting, VERY interesting. This film, however, is only interesting because it was made. The portrait of Ed Gein by Kane Hodder is so far away that it's not even the least funny. Ed Gein did not behave psychotically in public, he was very calm and collected, always extremely polite to everyone and spoke to anyone who wanted to listen to him. This is one of the main things that this movie did not show to the public. But the biggest mistake of this film, apart from an image, was never to kill anyone without his deceased mother ordering him to do so, which he thought was talking to him beyond the grave. He only killed the people his dead mother said he had to do because it was God's will and he felt a lot of remorse, although that did not stop him from experimenting with it. cannibalism and carry the flesh of people. I officially awarded this movie a "1" rating simply because "0" was not awarded to me as an option. <br /> <br /> I urge everyone to stay away from this movie. If you want to see a film that portrays Ed Gein with precision and does not try to tell a love story between a policeman and a fictional woman that never existed, I urge you to see the original film, which seems unfortunately not being on IMDb.com although I could be wrong, but I have not found it here yet. The original does not move away from real events and does not try to twist the story. I can understand telling the story from a different point of view, but this movie just tried to directly change the true story as such, which I find as awful as if someone had made a film based on on 9/11, but gave it a different twist behind. Or a film about World War II claiming that Hitler was a good man and that he helped fight the Nazis.
