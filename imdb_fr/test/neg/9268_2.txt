It may be the most ridiculous shit I've ever seen. Three unrelated stories about completely stupid and random things are sometimes interrupted by a bus and a boring monologue about the relationships of a stupid man. Christ knows why so many people got involved in this. Highlights: A man from the green fridge reading Jean-Paul Sartre, the dinner guest and his horsehair products, a woman unreasonably unreasonable in the third short film, suspecting an unfair playmaker to interest in its generic activities, Soufflantes. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that I have to use a few more lines, so as well to mention some other bullshit about the movie. The first film shows a man driving a talking car and obeying his unreasonable demands for no apparent reason. The only way to watch this movie is if you are blind and your personality and brain have other debilitating flaws. It's a bit funny, ironic, but also extremely tiring, as if you had to chew a long time on a stained carpet.
