I really thought it would be a good movie, boy ... if I was wrong! For a quick summer: grade B special effects grade B for the film in general. Do not get me wrong, the story was pretty good and not funny, so an adult accompanies him too, the "hero" is beautiful and most women will like it :-), not a full movie as it contains scenes fighting and a little blood <br /> <br /> but the way it's shot ... awful <br /> <br /> special effects-> would be better suited for TV-> on a show for children <br /> <br /> and finally ... send some actors to the theater school if they have already attended a course on site. <br /> <br /> Believe me, there are much better ways to lose 2 hours. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
