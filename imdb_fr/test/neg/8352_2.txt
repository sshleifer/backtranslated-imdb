Comparisons with the original series are inevitable. It's a pity that Diana Rigg left the original series in the 1960s because of the bad treatment on the part of the producers. MacNee probably regretted it as much as any fan - it's impossible to say how long the series would have lasted otherwise. Linda Thorson replaced very well and her episodes still retained almost all the quality and all aspects of the Rigg episodes - only Rigg / Macnee's chemistry was lacking. The New Avengers should have stayed on the board: a Macnee in decline, a boring Purdey and a hell who is this Gambit guy. Plus, the humor was forced and mediocre - sure, I only watched a few episodes, because that's all I could watch, but I think I got the idea. Try as much as possible, it is almost impossible to resurrect an old show in a new format or a new movie.
