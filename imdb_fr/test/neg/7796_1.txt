Think about the least worthy of a movie you can and it's 10 times worse. A woman must complete as many crosswords as she can in one day. We do not even see the questions and we do not think about words, we watch it struggle. The woman seems so anxious and in a hurry to do the crossword, but for some reason, she spends her time distractedly walking around the city to focus at home. The acting is horrible, the actress sighs after trying to think about the words, and we are completely in the dark. The New York landscape is beautiful but the film is too much and it ages quickly. The film plays as a student film rejected by the NYU. This film has no redeeming quality and I never recommend it to anyone.
