It's a student film and it's a piece of shit. I would use a much stronger language to describe it, but the criticism would not be published and the whole world would need to know, beyond any reasonable doubt, that this film really fears. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a difference rule used to measure the early work of an already famous director. He was kind of a genius we were too stupid to understand since he finally understood it today. I do not buy it. LOTR's first film "Bad taste" Peter Jackson is bad, and this "first film" of another famous director is really bad too. These "first works" are representative of everything crappy, from the budget to the scenario, through the actors, etc., everything is in the bottom of the basket. Do not be fooled by the big name. <br /> <br /> If you like to watch a handful of wrecks of 70s male hippies claim they could ever order a ship with the worst special effects you've ever seen, this is your movie. . <37449> I can not believe this thing won a gold scroll for the best special effects. It's a joke, is not it? Or a joke price? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch what this movie WISHES, it's rent a season or three of the Red Dwarf you fear.
