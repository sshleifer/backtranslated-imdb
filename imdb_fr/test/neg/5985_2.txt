If this is the conception of the author and director of a slice of life, they are clinically depressed. A film at best sad and moody, with aimless and ubiquitous characters who interact negatively with disastrous results. This film is presented as a comedy. What was so funny about losing your home after an allegedly premeditated arson or drug-related rape, the forced rape of one of the main characters. Does this art imitate life? Jack Black was slightly amused as a mountain man, weed grower. However, even this segment of the movie was plagued by pathos. What was the purpose of living in the middle of nowhere with an entourage? If Black's character was so paranoid, why was he making acid with a group of people straight from Woodstock? Is there no end to disconnected relationships, a less scripted scenario, and scenes transitions that lack coherence or logical chronology.
