it's a totally average film with some semi-correct action sequences that give the plot a slightly better look and remind the viewer of Van Dam's classic films. some parts of the plot are meaningless and seem to be added to save time. the final plot is that of a very basic guy who does not let the viewer guess, and the twists are obvious from the beginning. the final scene with the flasks does not make sense because they are added and seem to have little connection with the history of the character of van dam. not really worth looking again, a little disappointed with the final production, although it is obvious that it was shot on a small budget, some shots and sections of the film are of poor quality.
