I liked some of the characters, but our main role lay too much on a charming smile. I did not care about him. He makes bad choices and I do not care because he did not seem to do it either. He seemed rather unintelligent. There have been a few moments that have provided a chance for a human glimpse (the whale stage was interesting), but these are lost in the general unease of the film. The love interest was acceptable and the other characters were rather interesting, but the plot goes too much and leaves me sorry in the film several times. Finally, I wondered why I stayed so long. <br /> <br /> There are moments of lukewarm humor, but in the end, I did not care. I can not imagine that the film is higher. - 3 out of 10
