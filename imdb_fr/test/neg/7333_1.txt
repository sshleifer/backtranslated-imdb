A man wonders if his hunky colleague is gay. At a garage sale, he finds a rifle called "Gaydar". You point fingers at someone, pull the trigger, and she tells you how gay she is. He tries it, it works and he tries to know if his colleague is gay like him ... <br /> <br /> Promising idea ruined by a funny scenario (after a promising start) and acting terrible. The entire cast is overattacking and basically running their lines against each other all the time. It becomes boring and really embarrassing after a while. The saving grace is that it is short, that there is a scene stealing a cat (like to drop it from the kitten's bed) and Charles Nelson Reilly is hysterical in his little piece. But none of this saves the film. I can not recommend it at all.
