Here is a film that clearly sets out its exotica status with a public unfamiliar with its subject. <br /> <br /> A hybrid attempt of fiction and document, "Kadosh", falls awkwardly between the chairs. As a documentary, on the one hand, it is neither precise nor insightful. To realize its neglected management of details, one must not go further than the opening scene where it is obvious that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not even know how to put himself in his proper place. More generally, the tedious presentation of details (in this case ultra-orthodox Jewish ritual) by style is the role of a manual and not a good documentary; the latter should provide a principle of organization (a gestalt, if you like) to the viewer, so that he can emerge with a better understanding of the gaze. This is clearly not happening here because the ultra-orthodox ritual is made even more enigmatic. The director seems to have done a decent job explaining all this verbally during the film's release campaign. cinematically, however, this is a serious case of stuttering. As a feature film, he suffers from flatness, intrigue simplicity and brutality of the message. At times, I felt like watching a cartoon. (for example, the wedding night scene - without going into the details of angles, positions and dimensions ... well, technically, it could not be a realistic representation of the human sex, as wild as can be.) <br /> <br /> There are no subtleties in this movie. The clever manipulation of allusions, stimulating the viewer's imagination and his thought to take an active part in the cinematographic text, which, in my opinion, is a mark of good film, is totally absent. On the contrary: watching the film sometimes gave me the impression of being force-fed, with the same content already chewed and all too obvious. As director Gitai himself put it in an interview, it is actually an "architecture of changing objects in space", then coloring the scenes with the appropriate emotions when asked and to advance the plot on its appropriate and predictable route; but the spark, this creative spark, dark and unarticulated (because of "Kadosh" is supposedly a tragedy), that which projects on a screen with two dimensions the spell which transforms it into an extension of the world of the spectators, is missing without leave a trace. Perhaps a visual engineer's job, perhaps an unsophisticated ideologue; certainly not a true filmmaker. What I saw was a game of passion for animated topics rather than real live people. The game of actors, on the whole, has not been able to transcend the direct flatness of a forced idea (sometimes even tortured) in the cinema. A notable exception, although relatively minor, was found between the mikve lady and the mother, both played by the excellent Lea Koenig. <br /> <br /> It takes more than the strict respect of a winning formula (ie, a portion of exotica, plus a heartbreaking but simple melodrama, plus a popular, preferably politically correct, program) interest of my taste buds. All that is said is that during much of the film, I just got bored. Despite the novel, perhaps even a pioneering achievement of using an ultra-orthodox neighborhood as a film set, for which Mr. Gitai and his team deserve all the praise, I found "Kadosh" as well Nadosh (Hebrew for "banal").
