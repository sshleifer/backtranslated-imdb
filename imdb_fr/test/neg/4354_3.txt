I tried to watch this movie 3 or 4 times, but I just can not forget that everything is horrible. I'm sure it's a brave gesture to make Jack Palance the protagonist, but there is not a single fiber of my being that believes he can act, let alone act against the guy. <br /> <br /> Yes, I understand that Clifford Odets was a brilliant author, but it's not obvious here. This strange and forced mishmash of dialogue between hipsters of the 50s seems to hide any real meaning, which explains why none of the actors, even the good ones (Steiger, Ida Lupino, Shelly Winters, Everett Sloane) does not seem to know how to give his lines - it's as if they do not understand the meaning of what they said. And meanwhile, Wendell Corey and Palance are organizing a great contest to see who can be more realistic. <br /> <br /> The direction taken is amateurish and completely outdated. The physical interaction between the characters is as strong as the dialogue. <br /> <br /> And can we discuss this ugly set? He is so busy, ugly and artificial that he adds to the robotic and disconnected quality of characters, dialogue and representations. <br /> <br /> This film seems to suck energy. Looks like everyone overdosed Valium each morning when they arrived on the set. Rod Steiger and Shelly Winters have a pretty ugly movie, but this one succeeds. <br /> <br /> I can see that it could have been effective as a play on Broadway, where intellectuals and rhythms could have been happy to have appreciated the power of the plot and the artistic jewels of the pseudo-American dialogue. hip.
