Those born to Vietnamese mothers and GI fathers often found neither one nor the other. The Beautiful Country tells the story of one of these children, Binh, rejected by his rural village who then tried to find his American father. The film begins with lush and wild landscapes, but descends into ugly and boring dirt. The considerable talents of Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison are lost in useless and ill-conceived roles aboard the rusty cargo ship carrying Binh. He is a dying brother across the ocean with what appears to be shots of a rough sea. The city of New York features characters of hard labor and clich√©s. Although very uneven since the beginning, the great curiosity of this film is the last segment. Nick Nolte is at the top of the list of actors. I jokingly suggested that he would probably be in the final scene only and was not far from the truth. While the trip brings Binh to Texas and his father, the film takes on a serene and austere simplicity. A tenuous cohabitation unites these two men into a family of father and son. The ninety minutes of waste we just watched are rewarded with a deep and subtle performance of Nolte as they interact slowly. The credits rolled and I was surprised to see the names of Badlands executive producer Edward Pressman and Terrence Malick from West Texas.
