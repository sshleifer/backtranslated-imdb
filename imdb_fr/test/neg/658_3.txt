Compared to the recent blood film, HOSTEL, that this movie reminded me a lot of - I would say that See No Evil is slightly better, but not much. The intricate plot involves a handful of delinquents who are sent to clean up a hotel in poor condition for a shorter prison term. Children soon end up being killed by a religious psychopath who cleans them of their sins (I guess). The only thing I dreaded most about seeing this was the fact that it was played by a WWE wrestler, Kane. He ended up doing a decent job, considering he had only two lines of a word in the movie. There are some pretty bloody moments, mostly related to eye manipulation and a pretty memorable scene in which a girl is pushing a cell phone down her throat - probably the most effective disappearance in the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not say that this movie really shows us something new and that it is far from being excellent. I can not recommend it.
