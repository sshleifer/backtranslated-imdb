So, this ugly guy with long, wicked hair and his girlfriend end up in this house and they argue and argue about his old girlfriend. There must have been something scary, but I did not see anything scary at all. There is mention of a demon from the sea but that is not going anywhere. I wish it were, because it would have removed the tension of the jealous love triangle. The title of the film gives the impression that it would be a scary and exciting film, but it is so far from that that I could not believe it. I waited and waited until it ended and was so happy when he did it. He did not live up to the title, as he must be so boo hoo hoo. The cover had a cool image but I should not judge a lame film by its cover.
