After the opening credits on a black paper sheet with white spray stains sprayed on it, oh, all right, I'll be generous and call it a star field. A terrible-looking spatial model lands on a model field of terrible appearance. Three campers nearby are investigating. From the burning probe, a reptile that looks like an alien, the "Night Beast" emerges, OK, so I lied that it's a guy wearing a sleazy rubber monster mask and a space suit in silver. Campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast's laser gun, which fires horrible special effects on people. Cities Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith) is informed. He alerts his MP Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and gathers a group of men to investigate. Meanwhile, Nightbeast killed an unlucky motorist who had stopped by the side of the road for a leak. His two annoying children run for help. They are approaching a house, inside two young people are kissing, the girl says "people run to the house". The guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and emptied by Nightbeast, he also kills the girl. Then he manages to kill both children with his laser, maybe the Nightbeast is not so bad after all. Once the sheriff and his men arrive on the scene, they fight with the laser / the pet peeve. After perhaps the most exhilarating hand-to-hand fight in film history, only the sheriff, his deputy and a local man, Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel), survived. But Nightbeast is still alive, the balls seem to have no effect on her. The next day, the sheriff will visit the mayor of the city, Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman) for permission to evacuate everyone in the city. He refuses to say that a game he wants for the governor (Richard Ruxton) can not be canceled and he does not want to create a panic. The sheriff evacuates the city anyway. Two doctors, Steven Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Anne Firth) are attacked by Nightbeast before they can leave. However, they manage to make Nightbeast flee and survive. Together with the sheriff, his deputy and Jamie, they decide to stay and fight the stranger. Written and directed by Don Dohler, it must be an amateur film, made with family and friends, look at the credits and see how many Dohler people are involved. For this reason, I should probably leave a little time, but that does not always prevent it, nor excuse it to be a terribly awful film in all departments. He has no history or purpose, things end up wasting time, what's going on with Draco (Don Leifert) strangling his ex girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? This and many other scenes add nothing to the movie. The script has no logic either, why does the nocturnal creature stay in the city once it is supposed to have been evacuated? The special effects are embarrassing, just look at the effect when Nightbeast shoots a person with his laser, a computer effect of a spectrum of 80 would be shameful. There is not really a lot of blood or blood in it, a torn stomach, a severed arm and a decapitation, but they all look mediocre and predictable. If credit comes back to her, Nightbeast itself looks good to most. There is a sex scene between the sheriff and his assistant that we must believe, a music for which even a porn would be embarrassed and two really naked that make the sequence difficult to watch. The acting, photography, music, lighting and editing make it a real chore. And the worst thing about this movie? He commits the mortal sin of being boring and not amusing at all. Sorry Don Mate, but do not give up the day job! Certainly one to avoid.
