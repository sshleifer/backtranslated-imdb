This episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror, so far this season, Masters of Horror has produced a very good episode ... The Damned Thing ... it's still early, I'm convinced that the episodes will be better. I admit that the vampire episode was going well, but it lacked a solid scenario. The episode about the couple who catches the serial killer has started boring, but the last fifteen minutes have been really good. Although I am simply disappointed with the lack of originality and horror that the episodes of the first season had. Save this season, John Carpenter! I am convinced that Pro-Life will buy all the dull season so far. <br /> <br /> "You are an angry little elf!"
