This film should be renamed: Sex in the 70s In a part of New York called Greenwich Village and Chelsea. <br /> <br /> This movie does not talk much about sex in the 70's, other than focusing on the hypersexual environments of the audience. and private sex spaces in New York. I doubt that Manhole Bar is the symbol of real sex in the 70s and that this kind of sex is much more widespread in the film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the period looks like an explosion. And it is quite important to document the scene to which the film refers. But when it comes to calling this movie Sex in the 70s, the title is a little misleading. Technically, this is not an Oscar nominee, but his rawness is appropriate for the subject. <br /> <br /> Overall, an "eh".
