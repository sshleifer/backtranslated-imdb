This movie was terrible! My friend and I were so bored that we moved quickly into the last half of the movie just to see what was going on. It's the typical sport, it wins or loses. The only thing that seemed interesting from a distance was when one of the guys called someone Veg-e-tab-him. This will be a line that my friend and I evoke for years to come, reminding us of this colossal and old-fashioned clich√© of lost time
