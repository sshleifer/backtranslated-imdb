This film is as meaningful as an episode of "Ozzie & Harriet" or "Father Knows Best". An earlier copy of Reader's Digest (circa 1962) would better understand modern life, or the relationship between father and daughter, than this strange mix. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by Diane Keaton. She seems to be going through the movie while sleeping. (Given the title of the film, I realize that his was a supporting role, but even Martin Short had managed a distinct support character.) <br /> <br /> I can understand the lure of a world imaginary created in a good romantic comedy. But this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world. I'm afraid that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy.
