Mexican Werewolf in Texas is in the small border town of Furlough where Anna lives (Erika Fay), her best friend is Rosie (Martine Hughes) and she has a Mexican boyfriend named Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez) who is determined to hunt down a beast who terrorizes the city, kills cattle and many people, including some of their friends. Local Mexican legends speak of Chupacabra, an evil creature of myth and legend. Uh, I'm fighting for the moment because there's not much else going on ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Scott Maginnis I'm not going to bang around here and just say that the Mexican werewolf in Texas is awful, period. The script never mentions the word werewolf once and the rest of the time it refers to a chupacabra. In fact, I guess it was not really designed as a werewolf movie. The "werewolf" creature usually looks like a vicious dog, there's no reference to anyone changing during the full moon and actually attacking during the day a few times, there's no of transformation scene and in the end when is killed, he does not become anyone again. Honestly, aside from the title, there is nothing to indicate a werewolf movie. Even in this case, the title is a scam of the very popular An American Werewolf in London (1981). This is the kind of homemade bullshit I personally think killing the kind of horror. How long has there been a true classic of low-budget horror like Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween (1978) or Friday the 13th (1980) that have all been made on budgets of shoe ropes, maybe The Blair Witch Project (1999) but that's it all in recent years and shit like Mexican werewolf in Texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered like a classic. The characters are awful and things are happening around them, the dialogue is nil, the rhythm is horrible, the story is nil and almost sleepy and all in all, this movie is just shit, I I'm sorry but I do not know how else to describe it. <br /> <br /> The director Maginnis does nothing to make this film visible, there is an annoying cinematography of the type hand held camera that could easily give someone a headache and a lack of assembly which annoys and irritates to the same extent. It's not scary, there is no nudity, there is no tension or atmosphere and the special effects are awful. The monster really looks mediocre and it's no wonder Maginnis keeps him in the shadows or cuts his scenes so fast that you never see them well. The photo has virtually no color either: it is almost black or too saturated with oranges desert sand, which also hurts the eyes. The gore consists of fake guts (blink and you'll miss them!), A few bloody wounds and a severed arm, a big shot. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 300,000, I admit that the budget was low, but I simply refuse to accept the fact that there are many horror movies to small budget that make their meager budgets go far. It all looks like a movie at home, it has no style and is completely bland and dull to watch. The acting is as bad as you probably already know. <br /> <br /> The Mexican werewolf in Texas will probably force some people to rent / buy / watch him because he might wrongly think it's a continuation of John Landis' classic is certainly not the case and it's not even a real werewolf movie. Do not be fooled, it's awful and I'm tired of wasting my time and money in a homemade amateur shit like this.
