Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive, I call attention it's the trailer and not the cartel. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film is centered on a video that I play that was created by a countess to kill people and live forever are acceptable. <br /> <br /> First, absolutely, bad horror movie, the blood is more or less sparkling (spreading gossip), these scenes are bled they are the worst. /> <br /> But in fact (actually), this movie is really bad, but bad in every way. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone, trailer good, movie bad. <br /> <br /> I do not treat since (like, like) they spend (consume) money and time to make these movies insane and too bad.
