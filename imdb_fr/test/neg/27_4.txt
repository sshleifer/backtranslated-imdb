"Cover Girl" is a dull musical of the Second World War that contains absolutely nothing memorable, except for its song "Long Ago and Far Away". This film was released before Gene Kelly really took his artistic footing, and although his flourishing talent is proven, he plays mainly sidekick with Rita Hayworth. And there is the problem. Rita Hayworth is beautiful, there is no doubt. But it's just not a convincing screen presence. I've always wanted to love him more than I really do, and this film is no exception. She's just not a very good actress and she's not even a very good dancer. As beautiful as she is, she has something vague and the film suffers. <br /> <br /> Category: C-
