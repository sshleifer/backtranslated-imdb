I've had to catch this so-called "horror" movie on a late Friday night, I'd like to go to bed! Tell me .. Is a twerp wearing a raincoat on a high-speed bike 3 feet high supposed to convey a kind of fear? Not here, but Mi-low is still able to defeat the shit of the janitor (Antonio Fargas) who is three times his size (?) Uh-huh. And the end is so pitiful ... it only leaves you suspended with nothing to continue anything! I found myself wondering, "Is that it ???" <br /> <br /> Playing is about as good as in a low budget movie. The aforementioned Fargas offers a decent performance; but I conclude that Jennifer Jostyn is perhaps one of the worst actresses ever to have walked in Tinsel Town! Of course, pretty face, but bad game. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
