After reading the book Heart of Darkness, the film did not do him justice. The film is ashamed of the book, and anyone who has not experienced it will lose interest in history and intrigue because the film described it so badly. In the film, the characters and the scenery are just some of the mistakes that took place in the film. The director omitted many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever made. <br /> <br /> Of course, any book is better than the movie, but it was not even comparable. Joseph Conrad as a writer was brilliant in the vocabulary and skill of writing. The movie does not even begin to show that. Some of the most important and influential scenes in the book have been completely left out, such as the fact that Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. Moreover, when Marlow went to announce the news to Kurtz, she reacted differently in the film, rather than in the book. Another major difference is that Marlow saw the photo of the lady who was blindfolded at the end of the film, not at first, like the book. This influenced the way the audience viewed Marlow, and the film completely upset him. <br /> <br /> The book was so well tuned to the appearance of each place, but the film's scenery was disappointing. There was a pile of fake cheese backgrounds and to compliment, a bunch of bad actors who accompanied him. There was one exception to the terrible actors and it would be Isaach De Bankol√©, who played Mfumu. His character was the best. Although the film was not so good, I would recommend it ONLY if you read and understand the book very well. In this way, you can see what are the differences between the film and the book and contemplate them. If you have not read the book, I do not recommend the movie because it is a boring and lifeless mess. I loved the book, so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.
