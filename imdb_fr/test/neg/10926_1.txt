One of the commentators on Lil 'Pimp (dbborroughs of Glen Cove) clearly understood when he said the movie was really bad, but I was disapproved when he commented on the animation. <br /> The animation was not bad because of Macromedia Flash. It was a bad animation because it was badly managed. Flash is just a tool. In good hands, an artist can create an animation as complete and fluid as any Disney movie and, in the wrong hands, it can look as bad as what happens on the Internet, that's where Lil ' Pimp is from and should have stayed there. . <br /> <br /> Studios such as Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney and Warner Bros. create great animations using Flash (ie Puffy Friend Yumi, the house for Foster's imaginary friends, Mucha Lucha, etc.). <Lil 'Pimp was a poorly designed piece of tripe that had been made because Revolution Studios bought Media Tripp and Lil' Pimp was one of the included properties. Roth and his company thought they would make a lot of money by exploiting shit like Lil 'Pimp, and the simulacrum was perpetuated by its producer, Amy Pell. The reason for the abortion of an animated film in the third quarter is that none of the executives of Revolution Studios had the pragmatic brain to ward off Mark Brooks and Peter Gilstrap (they really did their best, but they did been overwhelmed by the head) and did not hire real writers. , directors and at least one semi-skilled producer. But they did one thing right: they hired some of Los Angeles 'best storyboarders, designers and animators, but as Lil' Pimp shows, you can buy the best sports car on the ground, but if you're a fool, wreck for sure.
