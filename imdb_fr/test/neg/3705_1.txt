This movie is probably the worst movie of all time. It's certainly the worst I've ever seen and I've seen MUCH bad movies. <br /> <br /> In this, nothing interesting happens in the film. You can literally start the movie, take a nap, and then wake up knowing that nothing has happened during your sleep. And I saw this film three times staying awake. I think I should be congratulated. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds as one would expect, according to a formula, without variation. Hunters capture a baby bigfoot, get killed by a parent and the nearby town enters a deadly frenzy. This is surprisingly boring for a version of Troma. <br /> <br /> So do not hesitate to help and ignore this movie. If you have to see it, you will understand why.
