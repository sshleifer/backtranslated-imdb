The game was horrible. The special effects, although exceptional, dominated the film. The writing was pathetic and the dialogue incredible. And the silly little love affair between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was out of place. <br /> <br /> But the worst offense to "Armageddon" was the total absence of scientific reality. "The asteroid is the size of Texas," says Billy Bob Thornton. Uh, it's 800 miles wide! Nobody in NASA even sees the asteroid until a meteor shower in the middle of the day wreaks havoc in New York? Suuuuure. NASA hires a drill team to join the astronauts and trains them in a week? Yes indeed. Someone brings a handgun on the space shuttle with them? Yes, it's realistic. And Bruce Willis detonates the asteroid with three seconds to spare. How Disney-esque! <br /> <br /> How was this movie? I rooted for the asteroid!
