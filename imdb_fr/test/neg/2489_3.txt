There is no real story, the film is more like a fly on the wall, dramatic documentary than a film itself, so this piece can be a spoiler in itself. Teen drama about 3 young Singaporean children (very similar to the British chavs) who play truant, run with gangs, argue, insult people in the street, get tattooed, do nothing, and so on. They usually think they are hard and from time to time scream hard rap songs to the camera. Filmed in MTV style, fast cuts, crazy camera angles, tight close-ups and animated interludes. The dialogue might have been clearer in the original languages ​​of Mandarin and Hokkien than in the subtitles and I have no doubt that some of the contemporary references in Singapore slip above the Western heads as well as the cultural and political context unless you are naturally aware of it. Singapore. This kind of teen film is perhaps a first for Singapore, but it has already been done and has been improved in other Western countries, La Haine (1995), for example.
