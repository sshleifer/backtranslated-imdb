Dr. Chopper begins shortly after the death of the mother of teenager Nicholas (Robert Adamson), but each cloud has a glimmer of hope. In this case, it seems that her mother owns a log cabin on Lake Tatonka. "Friendly place for happy people" she did not talk to him. Then Nicholas with his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsey Crisp) and three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) and Tamara (Ashley McCarthy) go there for an entertaining weekend. Unfortunately, things are not going as planned, the cabin turns out to be little more than a ruined shed and their neighbors turn out to be Dr. Chopper (Ed Brigadier) and his two nurses who kill everyone they meet to use them in horrible experiences ... <br /> <br /> Go straight to the video / DVD Dr. Chopper was edited and directed by Lewis Schoenburn and this movie seems to have a hard time getting over here on IMDb with some nice, harsh criticisms, while I think Dr. Chopper as a horror movie is rather worthless, I do not think some of the criticisms I've read are fully justified. The scenario that is taken very seriously is attributed to Ian Holt (whether he likes it or not ...) who plays a role in the film as detective Crocker according to the list of actors of IMDb although I do not remember no character of this name. , maybe he was one of the cops at first? Anyway, the basic story is correct, I guess although it's a little boring and lasts too long, it's a typical slasher rate with some sort of perverse character running in banging our distribution of annoying American teens, you know the situation now. In addition to some brief and undeveloped nonsense about Dr. Chopper's use of body parts to rebuild his deteriorating body, there is not much history here and the script seems to exist solely to invent situations that allow girls to take themselves first, Sequence where some girls have to complete an initiation to sorority home, topless, and there are even two or three lesbians here and one of them is seen without her clothes. Oh, and when I say topless, I mean they do not wear camisole, but they all keep their bra, so you might want to keep in mind that there is no nudity completely frontal at Dr. Chopper. So that's it, it's an average story that has a slightly surprising twist in the end that is wasted, is populated by stupid idiotic idiot characters that only exist to present gore scenes and girls in cheap bra. To be honest, I'm expecting a little more from my films, but maybe I'm just a little bit difficult. <br /> <br /> Director Schoenburn is OK, in fact, this is by no means the worst film I've seen although it still seems cheap. There is no style here, I did not think it was scary and there is no atmosphere either. The gore is restricted and limited to certain corpses and limbs cut, there is nothing new here or special effects particularly convincing. Dr. Chopper is also one of those films where the character's decisions and motives are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's a little rough, but reasonably well done with what was probably a very small budget, the forest. the premises are well insulated, although the officers' office looks like the front room and the two early nursing outfits look like stripper suits. The role play is good, it could have been better but I certainly saw worse. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper has a doctor on a motorcycle but unfortunately it is not enough to satisfy me, although it is a reasonably competent production, lack of real gore, nudity or decent plot makes it flow without a trace.
