This film should have been called "The Eyes of Alexander" and the Bogart concept should have been completely removed. The film began with a light-hearted approach to Bogart's legacy and comical moments with his surgery-oriented face, but after 15-30 minutes he's turned into a more serious thriller, where two sapphires the size of a palm, allegedly set like eyes in a ball headphone of Alexander the Great, for him, and seen by him, just before his death. Precious stones are therefore of great value not only for their quality and size, but also for their connection to the greatest conqueror the world has ever known. Being an expert on Alexander allows me to say that it's a complete fiction, but it's still a good movie. So the movie is about nonsense and falling with all kinds of hints from Alexander in the foreground and background (which I really liked), and ends with a dated shark attack ( we could not go to the movie in 1979 - '80 without a shark coming to threaten the public). There is a yacht named Euridice (the young wife of Alexander's father), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus? (It's been about 5 years since I saw the movie, so I do not do not remember all the details), Olympias, some street names, and many more. It was fun to watch the movie just to try to capture every detail of the background that the director (obviously an Alexanderphile himself) put on. In the end, the eyes are recovered and the camera is placed on a bed the credits scroll. A kind of beautiful ending. What would have been more fun if they had gone the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure? There were many, many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting, for example, the hand-annotated version (by Aristotle) ​​of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life, even at during his many travels across Asia (would have incalculable value if it were to be found today). Olivia Hussey (my favorite movie actress in series B) is killed much too early and should have been the main actress from start to finish, not the daughter of moms and dads ... although she herself is sweet to them. eyes. If you can find this film, it may be worthwhile to take a look at the historical film and see Olivia Hussey with an extremely funny humor, but a little more fun, but beyond that, I'll pass it for something more entertaining. <Br /> <br /> Yours, Nick
