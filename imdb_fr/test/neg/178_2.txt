I do not understand at all why this movie received such good ratings from critics - - I've seen dozens of documentaries (on TV) about the world of wine that were much better when (if) you look, think of two very annoying aspects of mondovino: first of all, the shooting is horrible and upsetting: for me, it was as if the guy behind the camera had just received the material and played with: a lot of zooms (nothing than to press the button for example - - I almost stopped to watch it because of that! Secondly, the interviewer (the director, I think) is not really relevant: he looks and asks questions like a scout, not like a journalist, even if the general idea and themes would have been interesting, too bad conclusion: overestimated documentary, maybe only for guys who know nothing about wine => not recommended at all (2 / 10)
