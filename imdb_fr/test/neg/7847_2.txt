A klutzy young man returns to the West after being trained in hospitality via Boston; he quickly learns that his friends living in old Spanish-colonized California expect him to replace the shoes of his late father - a romantic thief known to have kissed his victims after stealing them. The colorful but silly M-G-M production has a lot of talent in front of and behind the camera, but it never takes off. It might have been fun, a second-line material for Abbott & Costello, but Frank Sinatra looked lost and embarrassed in the lead. Poor staging hampers the combination of boisterous comedies and musical interludes (Sinatra is photographed singing at a given moment in a mirror, but one does not focus on his performance, but rather on the fact that star appears well reflected!). Kathryn Grayson is the governor's daughter who falls in love with Frank. Her high level of soprano turns her singing scenes into self-parody. Apart from the cinematography of Robert Surtees and the decent artistic direction, this "bandit" remains without kisses. * from ****
