Well, I think I finally saw my last Woody Allen movie! I read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie in the hope of having a good Woody Allen experience (as I have done in the past). Well, that was not the case. This film has nothing to offer. Even with the magnificent performance of the talented Sean Penn - this movie failed. One of the characteristics of his other films is the multiplicity of characters - variety, spiritual dialogue. This film consisted essentially of a single character - very dimensional. There was almost no laughter. It probably looked good on paper! I think the only thing special was the performance of Samantha Morton. Now, I will look for his films in the future. So, in conclusion, this movie was a major disappointment. >
