Conquerer of Shamballa shows what happens when the creators of an Anime do not understand what their fans want. As a fan, I did not want a 1920 film called Evil Nazi. What I would have liked to see is a real final confrontation between Ed and Dante, because we do not really know what she's become. I would have liked to have Ed return to his world much earlier and let him stay there to finally have the chance to be normal. You know, raising a family with a certain blond mechanic, that kind of thing. No, instead, I had a complicated plot involving Nazi mystics, Fritz Lang and about ten minutes of Al, a joke of a Roy Mustang Cameo and a single Armstrong joke, a short joke and no Winry hitting Ed with a key. Above all, I did not feel like Fullmetal Alchemist.
