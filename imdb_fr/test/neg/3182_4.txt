I rented this movie because I like watching movies with Lauren Graham. Well, she was the climax. All the others seemed completely separated from the painting. You looked around you who watched the movie with you, what? However, she made some clarifications, as she was the only normal character in the picture, which in fact does not say much about the movie. Personally, it was too far for me. However, I am happy to have rented despite the fact that I would never want to own it. I still think Lauren Graham turned out to be a strong actress and even though she thought she was not the main character, she seemed to steal the movie. My husband and I were happier and more concerned that his character ended up with Josh's character than we talked about the two main characters.
