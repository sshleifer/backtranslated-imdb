After watching Carlo Lizzani's documentary on Luchino Visconti, the expectations were greater before watching this film directed three years later by Adam Low. But the viewer like me became dissatisfied ... I was faced with a need for critical opinion, which I do not like at all, because there is no documentary that can satisfy all viewers . There are also no documentaries that will completely examine a theme But when I read the reviews already written on this title, I also felt a little confused. Sometimes people do not know what to criticize. Therefore, to clarify things, I will divide this film into two main parts that differ considerably: the first on Visconti before the career of his director and the last on the director Visconti. <br /> <br /> The aristocratic context, all the hobbies, the wealth that the young Luchino has experienced and appreciated are clearly presented. His efforts in horse racing are mentioned, as well as his relationship with his mother so disturbed after the divorce of his parents. We also have a very precise idea of ​​where Luchino was raised to the rank of real Count of Milan: an incredible wealth, nannies, cooks having access to everything, in a real aristocracy. For example, the splendid villa of his father in Grazzano and other marvelous villas prove it. Emphasis is also placed on Visconti's crucial visit to Paris in the 1930s, where he met eminent personalities ("leftists") who later influenced his style and artistic message. This clearly explains the idea of ​​a communist to aristocratic education (a contrast at first glance). <br /> <br /> However, the career part of his director, who started with OSSESSIONE during the Second World War and ended with INNOCENTE just before the death of his director in 1976, is poorly executed. His films are not well discussed. Why? Because very few people really have something to say. Franco Zeffirelli, the director, remembers the work on LA TERRA TREMA and all is well. There are also interviews with Franco Rosi. But later, Helmut Berger mainly talks about films like GATTOPARDO, CADUTA DEI REI, DEATH IN VENEZIA or LUDWIG. Although I loved the actor in the role of Ludwig, I did not like the interviews of his director. In addition, some thoughts that he reveals are not accurate in such a documentary ... There is no mention of significant works of Visconti as CONVERSATION PIECE, there are no interviews with the eminent Burt Lancaster casting. A mention on Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider should also be made. There is an interview with Maria Callas that sounds interesting, but it's only a short moment. Franco Zeffirelli, although I appreciate him as a director, makes fun of all that rather than saying something really precious. For example, he mentions the event how Visconti separated from him after years of service. Therefore, I say: simplified and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> What I find important here is the interviews with Visconti himself. As a result, we can have his own opinion about his works. For example, I very much appreciate the words he says about death, considering it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. He also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming LUDWIG. <br /> <br /> I think it is better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) by Carlo Lizzani than this document. Although it is shorter and more condensed, you will have a better idea of ​​the director. Visconti would be furious about it and the fury of his feelings reflected the emotions and the points of view of the stone population ...
