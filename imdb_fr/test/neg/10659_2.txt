The rhythm of this film is quite slow. It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (as we all know) and leaves 30 minutes to wrap up. The scenario is so predictable that you will know everything after about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I guess the movie is a movie about the world, but the movie is full of stereotypes that go beyond what's needed: <br /> <br /> Katie - A beauty who realizes that the look, boys and shopping are not everything. She realizes she can "feel" and "see the real world". To touch. <br /> <br /> The mother - a strong, nervous and screaming mother (a very innovative wow) who must be entrusted to a strong man. <br /> <br /> The father - patient and always understanding and cares for the incapable woman. <br /> <br /> The boyfriend who only wants to put himself in his pants. <br /> <br /> The comic Chinese clown who can not speak English properly and laughs. Thought, Hollywood abandoned these characters in the mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> The nurse who sometimes knows everything about moving to China is a true copy of The mother, that is to say a woman who does not know how to handle situation or knows something. <br /> <br /> The deformed Chinese girl who, with the help of us, Western, gets help and becomes a beautiful girl. Because in China (a third world country according to the film), they have nothing and therefore need our charity. Gah, wake up and feel what you're shelling. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a bit of poverty in China, but the description of the aid provided by Western countries (read USA) is so superficial and so happy that it ends is sad and revolting. Shanghai (where the film takes place) is the world's most expanding and evolving city at the moment. <br /> <br /> The Chinese father is so kind and good-natured that in the end, we wish ... to be a cowboy with a white hat ... <br /> <br /> The teacher ( Sean Astin) who has this story that really rips the heart (no) and that he tells without feeling. Why Sean? WHY !? <br /> <br /> etc. etc. It's hard to find a "real" person in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> This is nothing short of a good movie for Americans under 25 years old. 15. If you want to learn something about the world, look for example Hotel Rwanda instead. For a better life story or a mature movie, I suggest you watch the Italian "Paradiso Cinema" which won the best award of the best foreign film academy a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The only good thing in the movie was cityscapes that really capture some (not all) of the beautiful Chinese countryside. I went there and saw some of it.
