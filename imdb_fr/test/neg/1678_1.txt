Ok, I can watch almost any movie and I tend to have a real kick from Sci Fi Originals, but there was a major flaw in this movie that forced me to turn it off half a hour. <Br /> <br /> After serving in the US military, the film, including the military, raises expectations. At least some semblance of attention to military rank, military uniform and terminology is necessary if you expect the viewer to really benefit from the experience. "Bats: Human Harvest" had characters carrying the rank that turned in the wrong direction on the reverse and, later in the film, the time indicated was 11 o'clock, but it was completely dark. Even if the script was perfect and the dialogues spectacular, as well as the actors worthy of the Oscars, if the people who make the film do not pay enough attention to the film to take the trouble to look for the good way to display the military time Why did anyone bother to try to look at him?
