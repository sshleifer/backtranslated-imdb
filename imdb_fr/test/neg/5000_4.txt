The zombie movies are hot, I love them. I can not get enough. Why would I buy a movie of this caliber without explanation, I really like zombies. Surprise, it's not really a zombie movie; I can manage on a small budget, being fooled just annoys me. <br /> <br /> A group of horror film snapshots is held in a warehouse / lab / who-knows-what to escape a fire storm outside. Panic, screams, dim light and (possibly) zombies ensue. <br /> <br /> I feel pretty bad for the filmmakers, because it is obvious that they really thought of putting together something good; a serious and scary horror movie. It is not, far from it, a boring mess of wooden acts, tacky effects, mediocre lighting, excessive dialogue and excessive editing. <br /> <br /> The agenda does not go well after 10 good minutes. so that the characters sit down and begin to understand what is happening. The situation worsens after another 20 minutes and they are still sitting around trying to figure out what's going on. All this is littered with bad dialogues and bad dialogues. <br /> <br /> Finally, some get attached (not to a zombie, for example) and hope for a little flicker before the characters are settling again moaning (the only emotion that everyone generates) how bad it is. Me too guys, me too. <br /> <br /> Finally, the zombies are at the rendezvous, but no one looks at them anymore. I think there was blood and gore thrown in, but I was too busy praying for the credits to be noticed. And when the screen finally turned black, I felt even more deceived by the end unnecessarily inspired by the "Cube". <br /> <br /> I will give the credit of having made great efforts, even if it failed miserably. This and the punk were very hot if they were totally underused. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend it to anyone except movie students who are looking for "no-no" pointers. <br /> <br /> 4/10
