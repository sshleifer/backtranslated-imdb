OK where do I start? I saw a screening a few weeks ago and was shocked by the seriousness of this film. Of course, if you just love Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres (bad role) and you think they are the best TV shows on air, then you will definitely love this movie. Personally, I really like George's work and he has a lot of talent, but comedy is not his forte. Some people are natural in comedy and I'm sure it's great and fun to work with him personally, but comedy can not do it on the big screen. It was a cute movie but should I pay $ 12.00 to see it? H & LL no !!!! Now that I've seen it, I would not recommend anyone to spend their money. George, buddy, I love you but please, do not do any more comedies? This script is missing a lot, excellent concept, but did not do it.
