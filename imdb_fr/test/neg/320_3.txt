If you are looking for a cinematographic masterpiece, that's not it. If you are looking for one of those terrible movies that are so horrible that they are really good, then maybe it's for you. There are so many unintentional laughs in this movie that it could almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with the opening titles, which say "Jack-O", then add the word "Lantern", as if the viewer was not able to understand that the movie was talking about a pumpkin next to the giant pumpkin shown on the cover and in the opening scene of the film. After that, the film goes in about 20 different directions, none of which makes sense. Jack-o is everywhere, he's at home, in the woods, and yet he never seems to do much. There are some murders, but the long accumulation of these murders is so badly designed and constructed that you almost want Jack-o to attack his fury, your viewer. Other than that, the plot consists of the poor act, gratuitous nudity, and a ridiculous plot line. The role in this movie is among the worst I've seen in over 35 years watching movies. The boy who plays the main role in the film (the director's son) has about as much emotion as a corpse, and just about every other actor / actress is just as bad for many reasons as saucers ). But, having said all that, if you take this for what it is (it's a pile of smoking manure), you'll have some laughs from this movie. What I also found funny is that the directors of the DVD have seen fit to publish a "10th anniversary version" of this film (as if the original was not enough.) And someone really had the idea of ​​making a mini movie "behind the scenes" which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition (I do not know why) ....... I will give these 3 crushed pumpkins out of ten .. .
