The fact that this film is a good deal is a shame, but in the 1940s, it was pretty much the only type of movie designed for black theaters because of segregation. So while MGM, Warner, and all the other big studios were shooting extremely neat movies, tiny studios with tight budgets were left to their own devices. And seeing this film, it is obvious that the film was very energetic, even if it is a rather ugly film. Some actors were not particularly good (especially French), the scenery was minimal and the plot totally stupid BUT the film also had good music - from various styles ranging from classical jazz to rhythm and blues . This is thanks to many talented black artists but little known. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it was totally stupid and silly, but it always looked kitschy. I loved seeing Tim Moore ("Kingfish" from AMOS 'N ANDY) on the run, because he made the ugliest woman in film history (this includes Frankenstein's Bride and well others) - this is probably due to the fact that when he was not slipping, he was a rather ugly but funny guy. If the man claiming to be a woman really looked like a woman, I doubt that this movie would have worked too. Seeing this naughty man with a chewy face with a cheese wig ALWAYS being eagerly sought after by three suitors was rather funny. <br /> <br /> This film is not extraordinary, but from a historical point of view, it's a great way for young adults to know what America was like for blacks of that time. A time capsule very interesting and fun.
