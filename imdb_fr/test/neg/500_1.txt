I watched this last night with an open mind. Sorry to say it's always bad. First, the movie is too noisy and you can not hear what people are saying. The accents are bad especially Richard Masur. What does the French girl do in this movie ??? The worst in bad. Walken's makeup is strange. The Harvard scene is useless and useless. Kristoferson's character is incomparable and I wanted him to be killed and go away. Meanwhile, the character of Walken is killed too early and easily (despite makeup). The settlers are all stupid. ORGANIZE yourself bunch of cocks, people come to kill you !!!!! The character of John Hurts provides a bit of humor but that's it. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this excessive shit. The only good thing is that it ruined the director's career and killed United Artists. <br /> <br /> Still Crap after all these years.
