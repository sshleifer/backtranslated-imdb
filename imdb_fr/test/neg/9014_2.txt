Another little gray, horrible schlockiness of the Corman family. The first space capsule in a space crash lands on Earth (with some of the worst special effects of all time) and the pilot seems to be dead. But appearances can be deceiving. He is actually more alive than the rest of the cast, including an old misogynist doctor (who would also really, REALLY boring), a fat guy who seems to be cornered at the market with hair oil , another guy so dull he does not even do an awesome, scientific woman who never seems to be hurt or angry at the old man's patronage, and a female photographer with a Farah Fawcett haircut (pre-Farah , of course) and as alive as a dead duck. <br /> <br /> What are the names of these people? I think it was Steve. Apparently, all the actors, including the women, were called Steve. Be that as it may, the deceased pilot Steve proved not only to be alive, but also to be incubating extraterrestrial babies (or seahorses, shrimps or whatever) in his chest. The mother beast who implanted these small critters looks like a giant bald parrot with claws. Once again, I am impressed by the ability to laugh at monsters created by the House of Corman. Venus' space core in The Conquest of the World is still officially the worst, most laughable monster I've ever seen, but the Cormans still manage to stand up to the rascals. </ P> << br /> They also managed to respect their other brands; that is to say, a boring and confusing plot, long gray shots (thank God, Corman made most of his films in black and white, because his color always manages to look gray) at two or three places maximum, stupid and lame props and special effects, and a lot of dull dialogue. There are only two deaths in the movie (if you do not count the roasted parrot, an alien blood beast is extinguished at the end of the movie). I'm sure shouts of joy crossed the country when the alien tore up the old doctor's head and (apparently) ate it. Now he can speak in English and in memory of the doctor. He can also move the pregnant astronaut as if he were Pinnochio. <br /> <br /> The apparent intention of the monster is to rebuild his race using human beings as food and in giant bellies. There is a bit of confusion in the end (well, more confusing than usual, anyway) in which the creature tries to explain why it does, but that makes no sense. Something about how humanity is about to follow in the footsteps of its race and to destroy itself by something it will soon create. He never really said what it was. That could have been anything from toaster ovens to digital watches, who knows. Her baby guardian stabs herself rather than letting the alien shrimp crawl out of her body, and the oily guy (and the other guy) burns the parrot-alien to death with a Molotov cocktail. Ahh, the smell of roast chicken .. ..tranger. End of the story, in which the other characters go astray and leave their dead comrade on the ground rot. Oh, damn it, why do not you save the expense of a funeral? I'm sure that was what Corman was thinking, as he was trying to cut corners and make his scenes as cheap as possible.
