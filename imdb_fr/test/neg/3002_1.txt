The pretentious narration like this always uses the same technique: 1) Throw opaque and unstructured threads to disconcert the audience. 2) Only deal with "great" subjects such as life, death and God. 3) Make it look deep with scenes of life, death, sky, etc. 4) Trust an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt. 5) And finally, laugh until criticism praises criticism. <br /> <br /> This film is a pretentious, boldest false intellectual. Not only do these filmmakers answer no questions, they are afraid to ask questions to begin. The film is held by locks. The instructions are raised and abandoned awkwardly. Pop cultural references are bumpy and arbitrary. There is so little to notice that all critical hits will be missed. <br /> <br /> Critics who have found an intellectual basis for this film are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what about this movie. Good news: the filmmakers either. To try to answer profound questions about human existence requires mind, intellect, poetry and genius. Unfortunately, this film does not demonstrate any of these features.
