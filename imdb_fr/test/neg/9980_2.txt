Probably not the same version as most other reviews because there is not really hard hard sex. What do people mean by hard core sex? The kind of explicit hard core seen in movies featuring Traci Lords and "Big" John Holmes? In any case, it's really a mediocre film, I doubt that I've ever seen so many famous actors lost in a movie. The scenario is really poor and without intrigue, the staging and the cinematography are terrible and the assembly does not exist. It's really an absolutely awful film. You can look at it ten times and still not understand what it's all about. The only memorable scene is where people are buried to the neck and where a giant lawn mower comes in and decapses them. Yes, you read correctly, a film shot in Roman times has a scene with a giant lawn mower! <br /> <br /> Many years ago, a pirate copy of THE THING (1982 version) was making the rental tour on my island. It was copied to a rental cassette of CALIGULA, which means that the pirate version of THE THING begins with the first seconds of CALIGULA of the man and woman walking in the forest, the sequence of the title of THE THING begins. This led people who had seen the pirate gang to believe that the forest scene was the opening of John Carpenter's movie in 1982 and were very confused as to its meaning. That's what you get for renting pirate videos. But after seeing all of CALIGULA, I do not know what it meant either
