"San Francisco, Oh, wonderfully sorry city, thank you, God for destroying it and for bringing down bricks on our collective head, and for screwing up the oblivion of tens of thousands of innocent, obedient sheep Lord, who are so merciful in your heavenly manners ... "These should have been the lyrics of the title track of this film so inspiring and completely stupid. <br /> <br /> The film starts well enough, Gable discovering a Cinderella with a very boring voice but very popular in opera, and it spreads quickly to the celebrity. One of the many problems of our Cinderella is that it is interpreted by Jeanette MacDonald, who, if we "take the time" to look through all this facade of makeup and glitter of the 30s, realizes that she is a bit ugly. Too ugly to play this role, anyway. Still, Gable and everyone else went everywhere as if she was a damn good thing or something. Another problem with Cinderella is that her character is so humble, healthy, innocent, loving God, kind and generous - enough to make you throw up for an hour. MacDonald plays his role (certainly one-dimensional) with the kinds of "ahhh", "oh" and "ooh" that serve to annoy rather than make it sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Tracy was better and had better roles than playing this clich√© priest, with a heart of gold, loving God and who does not make fun of children (who box in his "free time" - as if the priests had something to do - how cute it is. Even the always reliable pinion is not up to its usual level; he is far too animated and his character is too selfless for someone who is supposed to be an ambitious Western "scoundrel" (though it is obviously the fault of the script). <br /> <br /> The plot is basically this: Gable and his rival Holt play ping pong with Cinderella - using it as a ball. How? Well, she works first for Gable (vocals), then for Holt Place, then she returns to Gable to return only very soon to Holt. (And, of course, both want to have him as a girlfriend / wife.) And if the earthquake had not interrupted this plot of table tennis, it's a safe bet that she would have done the same ten times, the little tasteless princess she is. <br /> <br /> There are many, far too many, in fact, musical numbers. It's almost as if they were trying to make the first "musical comedy disaster" of all time. What a stunner. The songs she sings in Gable's "seal" are acceptable, but when she starts screaming these shrill and annoying groans during the opera segments, I felt that my ears were attacked unfairly and unjustly. by the deafening fire of the enemy. In fact, there is an opera number that lasts 6 DAMN MINUTES. 6 may seem a little, for those who have not had the direct experience of Vietoperanam with such horrors of audio torture, but it's like with the dog years; The year of a dog equals seven human years. A minute of opera is equivalent to 100 minutes of Chinese torture (or a dog that is acid-urine on the leg). <br /> <br /> I thought it was a disaster movie, but rather an almost catastrophic movie. (I read that part of the dialogue of this film was written by a filmmaker SILENT-ERA Jesus ...) The melodramatic procedure, sometimes amusing, is interrupted by the true star of this film (to know the earthquake). only after well over an hour and a half. When Joe's earthquake finally shook the city and our characters were shot, I almost wanted to say "Thank God, death and destruction have finally arrived!" Unfortunately, Joe arrives too late in the film to save him from his growing mediocrity. the scenes of devastation are very good, but even the part of the film devoted to the earthquake is spoiled (pun intended) by a very annoying and religious end. You see, Gable, who claims to be an atheist from the beginning (without using the word himself), finally finds MacDonald alive - after searching for days - and suddenly he is converted to a believer because Cinderella is alive? !! So stupid! All that tells me is that the character of Gable is a stupid idiot. <br /> <br /> The film ends on a very stupid note, indeed. Gable, after thanking God for "saving" his daughter (and he does it on his knees), "finds" God (sees the light), and the little old devil in the movie, Gable, becomes a believer. What a terribly fearful end to America ... <br /> <br /> Of course, no one thought of asking this "God" why the hell there was an earthquake in the first place! The sad and unfortunate irony is that Gable ends up becoming a "sucker"; he had always laughed at the "suckers" who fell under the most sacred charm - namely religion - and he himself became one. This is what I call a triumph of the human spirit! Another irony is that the end should have improved Gable as a person, but I see it very differently; on the contrary: it only took one big Joe to turn Gable into a fearful, gentle, obedient believer - who joins the sheep family of the world. And as if this intellectual fall of Gable was not pathetic enough and disappointing, this very first "musical on the earthquakes" ends with a real shocking (take this word as you please), a choir of noble mass and inspiring of hope. Scene: Dozens (or hundreds) of earthquake survivors and proud and proud Frisco citizens spontaneously (or did God "arrange" it?) Sang together the title track in the hope for a better future, brighter and without a future. Alleluia! If you are a "sucker" for Hollywood sentimentality, do not skip this movie.
