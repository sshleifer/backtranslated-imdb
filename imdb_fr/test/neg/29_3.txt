Like "Singin" in the rain, "Cover Girl" has a trio of two guys and a girl.In 'Cover Girl', Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief.It matches the funny role of Donald Man. O'Connor in "Singin in the Rain." In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in "Rain," Debbie Reynolds is where the comparison ends. > <br /> While "Singin 'in the Rain" is a classic American musical, "Cover Girl" embodies mediocrity.The story is not very complicated.Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth)) is a dancer of Danny MacGuire's low-cost nightclub in Brooklyn.Coudair presents Rusty to producer Noel Wheaton, sponsored by a wealthy publisher, John Coudair, Danny feels hurt when Rusty starts arriving late at rehearsals at the disco and decides to close the club and to go on the road to entertain the troops with his sidekick, Genius. e, with Rusty at the altar with Noel, she realizes the mistake and goes home to Danny. They live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly is the least developed part of the film. All we learn about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton act like thirsty teenagers in front of Rusty and Phil Silvers delivers a completely awkward but not very funny shtick. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. This foreshadows what happened to him in real life. Anyone who reads her biography will learn that she does not like Hollywood, that she has a hard time living in a normal life that she could never have reached, but that she finally started drinking and drinking. suffer from Alzheimer's disease in the last years of his life. <br /> <Almost all of Cover Girl's songs are old-fashioned and not very melodious. Gene Kelly has only one really good dance number and it's the stage where he dances with his "alter ego". Earlier, the trio has another number that is a pale precursor to 'Make em Laugh' of 'Singin' in the Rain '. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way Rita Hayworth is put on a pedestal. A few decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. The two actresses later in their career would always try to find scripts that showed their acting abilities. They wanted to be known as "actresses" and not as "pin-up girls". Unfortunately, "Cover Girl" is an example of how Hollywood was exploiting women for profit.
