Combining serious drama with adequate comedy is tricky at best. The search for comedy in the Muslim world has been successful thanks to a hot topic and a fantastic scenario; not to mention the excellent portrait of Albert Brooks. But the man of the year can not be compared. It contains a messy message bent from forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The premise seemed initially very promising. Propose to the President of the United States a guy from the comedy news, Jon Stewart, and see what happens. This freestyle runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful TV personality who is driven to run by his audience. He is accompanied by his director Jack (Christopher Walken, CLICK) and his writer Eddie (Lewis Black). Seeming very unlikely to succeed, Tom Dobbs surprisingly wins the election. <br /> <br /> But did he do it? Eleanor Green (Laura Linney, THE ROSE EMILY EXECUTIVE) is a computer ace at the company that designed the new electronic voting software at polling stations. She finds a problem in the system that is quickly swept away by the company's owner and his dark lawyer, Alan (Jeff Goldblum, INDEPENDENCE DAY). On the verge of losing billions of dollars if the news came out, the evil men in the company decided to discredit and / or kill Eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone. But Eleanor manages to meet the President-elect, Dobbs, and finally talk about it (this is where the incredible love story begins to flourish). Dobbs goes to Saturday Night Live and explains everyone, retiring from the newly elected presidency, ending the careers of those who work for the computer company ... and saving Ms. Green's life. <br /> <br /> Does all this look funny? Comedy is firmly embedded in the story and is often tricky. During a debate, Robin Williams flames a few moments but is quickly suffocated by the gravity of his accession to the post of president. <br /> <br /> The message of the film is also interesting and questionable: this particular interest has candidates for the presidential election. I'm sure there's a lot of truth about that, and if you wanted to make a film about it, you could. If you wanted to do a comedy about you, you could. But the man of the year is not it?
