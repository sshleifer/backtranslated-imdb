Not much is happening in this movie. There are some crucial moments and everything else is about a crucial moment that took place before the movie started. The main mechanism used in the story is flashback. Flashbacks can very well be used, but they are not there. The indication is zero when blinking forwards or backwards, and there are only a few weeks to separate the events. The context when the scene unfolds is the only way to know when something is happening. It may be to add some mystery to some places, but it was rather annoying. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a 100-minute on-screen discussion about why things are happening and a lame questioning about right versus wrong, take advantage of it. If you're looking at close-ups of an essentially vacant look on Ryan Gosling's face for most of the movie you're interested in, you're in luck. Unfortunately, I find no reason to recommend this film. Oh, and as another reviewer has said, Spacey is really just a cameo, and plays with a disinterested detachment that you've probably already seen. <br /> <br /> *** The rest contains some spoilers, although some of them keep the big points *** <br /> <br /> First, the killing of the so-called retarded boy takes place before the opening of the film and we never learn what exactly happened. The implication is that he was killed to end the deep sadness that was communicated through the boy's eyes. There are not many other unanswered questions because the characters beyond the boy and the main character are very one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> As for what happens with the main character ... Another opinion suggests that he is crazy. I agree that he is not right, but I do not know if I would say it's crazy. It seems that the film tried to make it clear that he was either autistic, or delayed in a certain way, because he seemed really slow and unable to grasp the evidence. Either that, or they were looking for a neglected teenager with a detachment disorder and / or who was heavily on medication. As always, Ryan Gosling is good at conveying something to the public, but it seems exactly what has been deliberately left unresolved in this case. This film does not provide answers, just questions, but it was a film bad enough that I do not care.
