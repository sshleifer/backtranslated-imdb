"Curse of Michael Myers" is a very frustrating article to treat for a fan of the Halloween series. After a very disappointing disappointment in Halloween 5, the series almost fell in the lines of the plot, with a stupid devolution in witchcraft and a worship cult dedicated to Michael Myers. "The curse of Michael Myers" raises the blood and blood auction, but really represents a degradation of the integrity of the series. It's a shame, because it's the latest film for Donald Pleasance as a character of Dr. Loomis. Pleasance has good moments on the screen (precious moments if you're a fan of the series) like the very old and as he says "very retired doctor". Unfortunately, he died before the end of the film, and it is very obvious at the end of the film that the original climatic scene was never realized. From the beginning of the credits, Halloween 6 has more atmosphere of a TV movie than that of the horror film that began as in 1978. Any former student of Halloween should have demanded more from this film, ... Dr. Loomis and Donald Pleasance deserved more.
