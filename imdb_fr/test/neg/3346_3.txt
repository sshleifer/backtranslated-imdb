I really want to believe that the quote above (especially the English subtitle translation), which was actually written, but not spoken, in a rejection letter sent by a publisher to the protagonist, was supposed to be self-referential Cheek way. But if this is the case, the director Leos Carax has apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. They are all so terribly serious in their performances that I have to conclude that Carax is really serious about here, or has so much contempt for everyone, especially the viewers, that it can not be bothered to let anyone play the joke. Some authors succeed in making oblique and bizarre films because they do it with a personal and unique style (for example, David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a more subtle approach while incorporating surreal elements into the plot of the story (eg, Krzysztof Kieslowski and later, less strange works by David Cronenberg). In Pola X, Carax casts a disjointed disorder to the viewer and then challenges him to criticize him. Well, here it is: the rhythm is irregular and unstable, especially continuity is often suppressed; superfluous characters abound (for example, the gypsy mother and child); most shows are overworked; lighting is often mediocre, especially in the often-discussed sex scene; unrelated scenes are projected into the film without perceptible reason; and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> In order not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some edifying exceptions. I liked the musical score, even the cacophonous technophile music played in the vast abandoned complex in which the main characters fold in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol's "Factory" of the 60s? ). Much of the countryside photography was beautiful, an obvious attempt to contrast with the city's scenery. And even in old age, Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has it. His performance was also the only one among the main characters not to sink into the bath. <br /> <br /> It was an earlier era when I considered such films as "Pola X" more charitably. Experimentation is admirable, even when the experiment does not work. But Carax is not trying anything new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless previous films, and after several decades of watching movies and literally thousands of movies later, I just do not have the patience for that kind of non-original tripe and poorly designed. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, it remains to ask: with the exception of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, are there * some * directors in France who now know how to make a watchable film? Rating: 3/10.
