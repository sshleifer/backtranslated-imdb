It's one of the most horrible horror movies I've seen in a while. I wondered if John Ryhs-Davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to make this movie. Th Chupacabra looked like a cross between the Sleetaks of the land of the lost and the creature of the black lagoon. Plus, they should have used someone who was a little smaller than the legendary Chupacabra is much smaller. But overall, the movie was so funny that it was funny. Why did not the bullets and the electrocution stop the Chupacabra while the captain's kick-boxing daughter agrees? Watch if you are sick at home or if you feel depressed and need to laugh.
