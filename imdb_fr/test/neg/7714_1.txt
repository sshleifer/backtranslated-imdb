When one of the stars of a movie is Sticky Fingaz, you need to know enough to stay away. Stay away. HOUSE 2 is a bit the same, this time with zombies invading a college campus (man, how did that save money). As usual, the "zombies" are not directed and therefore speak little and do not give much makeup. They look like the zombies of one of those endless low prices of Italian zombies from years ago. That is, they do not look like the kind of zombies we know and love in George Romero and Dan O'Bannon's zombie movies. The people who fight the zombies are all non-actors who have the opportunity to shoot with guns and do little else. Some who have written here believe that the suite is slightly more focused than the original. All I have to say is that I'm glad the director of the suite has removed the 360-degree panoramas that ruined the first movie. House 2 is still a bit the same, which means nothing happens until 80 or 90 minutes. There is at least one room, involving soldiers struggling with a zombie football team, who could have been at least funny. It's not.
