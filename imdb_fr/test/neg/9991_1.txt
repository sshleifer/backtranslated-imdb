It is rare to see a film that strikes in all aspects, but "Caligula" must surely hold this title. I do not know what is more horrible; violence, sexual perversity, act or intrigue (or the serious absence of it). <br /> <br /> The two-and-a-half hours follow essentially the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar "Caligula" who sits in 37AD and shows the atrocities and the evil he allegedly committed while he was in power. The acting game is lifeless and dull - but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Knowing that this movie was sorely lacking in legitimate interests, the directors decided to present as many scenes of nudity and orgy as possible. But make no mistake, these scenes do not facilitate or divert the attention of the hideout of this film. The work of the camera is of poor quality, the dialogue is laughable. In fact, we should congratulate Malcolm McDowell (who plays Caligula) for keeping his face impassive despite such ridiculous lines. And then there is violence .... <br /> <br /> If you're about to see the movie, get ready. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not only by writing) but by disgusting acts of violence that have little interest or purpose except to repel the viewer. This is only the goal that this film has reached. One must wonder how the writers of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (to name a few) would please everyone. When it finishes late after two and a half hours, you do not remove anything from this film except some disturbing images and knowing that you may have witnessed the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> You have been warned
