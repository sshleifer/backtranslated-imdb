Okay, anyone looking to see a great work of art should NOT watch this movie. Sophisticated movie connoisseurs will undoubtedly be disgusted by the horrendous production values ​​and the fact that an excellent actor (Joseph Cotten) is paying a fortune. Mr. Cotten must have really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the movie was shit. The same phenomenon occurred with Dana Andrews, who appeared late in the camper and the terrible FROZEN DEAD. I know Mr. Andrews was a prey to alcoholism, but why did Cotten make that mess ?! <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it's a reworking of Frankenstein's plot. The first half of the film really looked like a serious but seriously flawed version of Frankenstein's original story. Then, inexplicably, they introduced a girl. It was not a bad thing, ... until then, they decided to stop making a horror movie but to make a very sweet pornographic movie! The change was dramatic and weird. It was almost as if they said "Okay, Mr. Cotten finished his scenes and went home, .... now, ladies, ... STRIP!" <br /> <br /> The problem is that at all levels, the movie is horrible except for the makeup of the monster. Although not great, it's still pretty cool to watch. But bad writing, acting and a budget of $ 17.46 plotted to make this movie a dull and awful film - a film so terrible that it should not be enough to put nudity instead perverts who are there.
