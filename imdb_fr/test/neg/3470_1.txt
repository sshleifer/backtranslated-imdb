Sorry if I disappoint anyone of what I'm going to say to this film made for the TV movie. But, I paid money for the film and this film is a disaster. The staging is really terribly bad. But, after looking at the information here, I realized that the poor quality of production and production could be motivated. Maybe they do not have a budget, but anyway, Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility had little money, but it was a success. The director of this film did a very bad job telling the story and the film could not even maintain a rational continuity in itself. He keeps shooting me out of the scenes. Maybe someone needs to work hard on the story / chart. The doubled sound is also terribly bad. My God ... Normally, I would appreciate all movies because they hide the ideas and imagination of an individual. but, this time, I'm just angry, "I really want to hit something hard." ... Do not do the job if someone can not do it best. Bad arts (it's not even art, what is it?) Really hurts people.
