Corey Haim will never be known as one of the great actors of his time, but at least in movies like "Licensed To Drive" he was rather in his element ... lowbrow humor. <br /> <br /> Dean Koontz's book "Watchers" was one of his most recent works and probably remains his finest to date. Unfortunately, this magnificent story of a shiny dog, a disturbed mutant and a genetic experiment that went wrong is horribly shot. The acting game is so lifeless, you might think you're watching a zombie movie. Only the dog gives a respectable performance, and if you want to see a decent movie about a dog, you'd better watch "The Incredible Journey", "Cujo" or even "CHOMPS" ... okay, maybe not "CHOMPS" <br /> <br /> If you have read the book, avoid this movie at all costs. If you have not read the book, read it and avoid this movie. You'll thank me later. <br /> <br /> The thriller, "Phantoms", is a bit better translated from Dean Koontz's book.
