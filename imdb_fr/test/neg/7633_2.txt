Rebecca De Mornay can be a beautiful and fascinating actress, but as for the roles she has set herself to play, if you can not say something nice ... <br /> <br /> De Mornay describes a woman who has had terrible traumas She has an affair with Banderas, whom we suspect to be (ou, what an originality!) a serial killer. She sometimes remembers Banderas's mother. the character of Tippi Hedren in "Marnie". But I would not count on it: Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago and many regents are desperately trying to replace him. The director makes every effort to replace a thriller with a unexpected end, but this ending is so far-fetched that it is absolutely impossible to buy it.The film includes the obligation "interviews with a serial killer" in the tradition of "silence of the lamb", murders (humans and cats), a double personality and an open end in case the crowd asks for more. Apparently they did not, and they were right.
