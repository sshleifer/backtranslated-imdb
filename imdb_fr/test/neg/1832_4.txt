1 st watched 24/06/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Stefan Rujowitzky): Thriller OK, but a little too predictable. This story is based in Germany, where the film is also made. He is a young medical student who is fortunate enough to attend a first school in Heidelberg and arrives when strange things are happening. Someone she met on the train and she saved, shows up at the school's experimentation table and suspects a criminal act immediately. She makes an investigation and the disappearance of her friend leads her to a secret society called AAA (and no, it is not Alcoholics Anonymous) that has something to do with the anti-Hippocrates oath and which is used to carry out experiments on living people that the doctor would not want. Normally, we will not be able to do that. She discovers that her grandfather (who was Dean of the school) played a big part in its creation and that it is quite easy to fill by the members of the school. It's an interesting story, but the problem with this movie is the speed with which the public is informed of what's going on, and then it's kind of a horror movie where the heroine is fighting the bad guy's group that brings things to a higher psychotic level. Although this film was shot in Europe, it plays in front of a young American public and focuses on the gore, the sex and the premises of the horror movie (it's really a big loss) and explains why he probably reported a lot of money and spawned a sequel, but does not do it. not necessarily make a good movie.
