Dear me. Where do I start? The father is not old enough to be the father of the girl. It goes to the camera in the first 5 minutes of the film. The favorite exclamation in this film is "Jesus Christ !!!". Zombies are agile, stupid and rare. Motivations are totally incomprehensible and a story does not exist. People "rush" to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 MPH. The world seems to continue as if nothing had happened, while it is the last days. Breasts appear for the sake of the breasts. Normally, such an approach would bring a bit of redemption, but the rest of the movie really disinterested me in the breasts or the future of humanity. There is a dog for no reason and a thin orange blood that turns the stomach. The general and his slogan: "Close it!" is the only buyback feature. For the rest, I sincerely hope that they acted well and that they committed suicide.
