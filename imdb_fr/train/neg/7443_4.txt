There were scary scenes, which I always liked more than gore, but otherwise, this movie was rather weak. Too many questions remained unanswered, and when they tried to explain anything in the film, it was still pretty vague. After watching this movie, I always seemed lost in many ways. It reminded me of Silent Hill a few years ago. This film was also unsatisfactory, but better than this one, because it was trying to work and the story made sense. This one, not so much. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, playing in The Abandoned was decent, but the film dragged on, and never really came to a satisfactory conclusion. As I said above, there were scary scenes, but otherwise, this movie was a mess. Sorry, I can not recommend it.
