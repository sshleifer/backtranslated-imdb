"Do not Drink the Water" is an incredibly bad movie. It is based on a 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen. It stars Jackie Gleason, the comic genius behind "The Honeymooners". The director, Howard Morris, appeared in several Mel Brooks comedies (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) and left his mark in the animation (among the characters he expressed are Gopher of "Pooh" , Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey). What was wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the principle is played too seriously to function effectively. Allen's original piece was ironic, which is why it worked on Broadway and in Allen's remake in 1994. The screenplay of RS Allen and Harvey Bullock defeat the principle to death and make too many changes to the original piece. To make Gleason's wife a head in this version while she was a stubborn woman in the original is just one example of why this does not work. <br /> <br /> The acting game is not much better. Gleason does his best with the material, but he can not save it. Gleason was a comic book genius, but also a good actor, as he showed in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain". His abrasive personality might have worked here, but the ugly script does not even give him a chance. Pity. The wife of Estelle Parsons Chief of Air will drive you crazy after 20 minutes. See how long it will take you to want to strangle him. It is also a shame because she is also an excellent actress, having presented two outstanding performances in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel" No other actor has been particularly successful. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated this film so much that he re-made the film in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) in the lead roles. They manage to get all the good grades and the film itself is a cartoon masterpiece. It's finally on the video after a long battle for rights. Go out and find this version. The original of 1969 is good, it is to rid the unwanted guests who stay longer than expected. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4 stars
