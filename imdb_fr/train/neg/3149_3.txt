As an independent filmmaker and a big fan of Edward D. Wood Jr., I bought this documentary thinking that it would finally put the clocks up to date on how Ed Wood was gifted and brilliant. <br /> <br /> What I had was a disappointing, contradictory, contradictory and egocentric compilation of bitter and self-growing hasbeans. <br /> <br /> Where do people remember Ed Wood Jr., do people really remember the guy's second cousin with the duct tape who knew someone who was found in Plan Nine From Outer Space? <br /> <br /> It seems that from the moment that there is a renewed interest in Ed Wood, these people come out of work "Wood"! Only to take bad shots at someone who gave them a chance when no one else would! After 50 years, I would suggest to many of these people to drop the fact that they did not get the $ 75 promised! <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain. In fact, that was all he was living for. You can laugh watching Ed's movies, but you know you're laughing with him anyway, not against him. <br /> <br /> But I'm moving away from the subject ... Let's go back to the film. If you're waiting for a movie about Edward D. Wood Jr., you will not get it here. If you want a film about old bitter actors, this is the movie for you!
