This is the worst movie I have ever seen in cinemas. It was just a compilation of recycled materials. People who get hit in the head are not funny. People getting kicked is not funny. After the third time, a guy was kicked in the balls, even the youngest member of the public no longer laughed. I got tired quickly. <br /> <br /> I went with my younger sister. She actually laughs at King of the Hill, but this cinematic masterpiece annoyed her. I'm not surprised. The story is pretty lame. A midget thief steals a big diamond in what was without a doubt the easiest flight in Hollywood history. Then he hides with a family pretending to be a baby. I know it sounds exciting, but that's the whole story. Repeat these two lines for an hour and a half and you will get the picture. There were many predictable jokes. I really felt scammed after seeing this. I did not expect much and I was always disappointed. I would like Keenan to engage decent writers to write jokes and / or his next script. It was even worse than White Chicks if it was possible. I saw high school plays that were better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I do not like my entertainment being muffled.
