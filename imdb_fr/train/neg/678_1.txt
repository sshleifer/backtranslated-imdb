All I can really say is that I am happy to have knitted socks while watching the movie, otherwise I would be very angry to have lost 2 hours of my life. The game was terrible, the plot was even worse. Some scenes meant to be serious made my husband and I laugh. I highly recommend this movie to people who like to create their own version of MST3K.
