Unfortunately, there was no 0 for a rating otherwise I would have chosen. This film lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of newcomer Aileen Quinn and the expert staging of veteran pro John Huston (father of actress Angelica Huston) are what made this so charming movie. Even the remake of 1999 with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this excuse for a sequel. Before making this film, Ashley Johnson was known for her role as little Chrissie Seaver on Growing Pains. She had some roles in the movies but I do not know who thought she had enough talent to make a film by herself. And by adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ridiculous! They could not have enough actors to play the main roles such as Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie, but they will sign Joan Collins to play a British lady? It does not surprise me that this film is as bad as it was. Critics were right not to agree with this film, even if it was made only for television, it was a poor result of an otherwise adorable movie.
