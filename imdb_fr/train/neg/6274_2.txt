I am generous in giving this movie 2 stars. the phrase on "did you even see the oz wizard" was the best part for me! with terrible writing and behavior as in this film, it is not surprising that many of them are supported by reality TV shows. do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royal baseball game, you'll be happy to have done it!
