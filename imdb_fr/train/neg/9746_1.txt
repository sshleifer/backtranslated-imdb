I remember this film, exhibited in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for the time of a week. Although it may seem incredible, and I can not give any explanation, this film was presented in a theater dedicated to ... high quality art films (ie Bergman, Resnais, Malle , Bu√±uel and ... The projected man). Few people have seen it (thankfully no doubt) and no reference to this very annoying film of SF can be found in the Encyclopedia Science Fiction Peter Nichols, nor to the author of the original novel. Very indicative. I remember, after all these years, without history, with a lot of special effects that actually seem ridiculous, nothing more. It seems that in some countries the duration is 90 mm. and in another 77 min. Well, it only means a little more pain.
