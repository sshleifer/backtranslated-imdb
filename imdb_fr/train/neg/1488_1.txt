I had to sign up for IMDb just to post a comment on how horrible this movie is ... my cats and a ball of string have a better script than this one. It's not the worst acting game I've ever seen, but when you erase almost the entire cast of the movie in less than 5 minutes, it leaves something to be desired. There was not a single "scary" moment in the movie, except when they were watching the movie "Halloween" on TV. All around, it seems like it could have been a good story, roll the credits and say that Chasey Lain was inside, it was a bit of a loss because I did not recognize her right away and her scene was already over. ' said 'oh yeah, here it is'. I'm so glad I saw it in a hotel and not paid for it, because I'd be really excited if I'd paid a cent to see it. Normally, I like or at least I find a redemptive factor in a movie, but this one is an exception. It's so bad that it's not even fun so good-it-bad ... it's just bad.
