This film was a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> I watched this film with a group of moviegoers, who have varied tastes in the movies and who always have an attentive eye for a work of "genius" (my colleagues on this site had the nerve to label this steaming pile ??); none of them found a single redemptive quality. We finished the film with a chorus of expletives that I will not reprint here. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the positive reviews provided here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins. After all, as one of these critics said, he financed the film himself ?? because no one else in Hollywood or anywhere in the world would risk a penny or their reputation in association with this film. Do not let the semi-famous actors that appear in the film draw you into his clutches ?? as Christian Slater admits in the peculiarities "making of", he signed the film without reading the screenplay or knowing the details (a madness that he will surely not repeat). <br /> <br /> I pity the unfortunate individual who stumbles in this quagmire of indulgence written, directed, produced and financed by a man too well-known to admit that everything he creates is not a leader. 'work (and if you do not believe me, I beg you google "Anthony Hopkins" AND art).
