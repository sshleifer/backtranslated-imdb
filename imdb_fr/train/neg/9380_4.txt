The last weeks of a dead woman's life are told in flashback. Like the vagrant, the film wanders aimlessly and rather aimlessly. Mona, the lazy, sullen, drug-addicted character, is not friendly and Bonnaire does not make it interesting. Even if some pretentious dialogues try to explain why Mona chose this miserable way of life, her motives are never really clear. The episodic nature of the film, involving random characters, becomes tiresome after a while, making it much longer than its reading time. It is also hard to believe that a seductive, homeless young woman would not attract men's attention more.
