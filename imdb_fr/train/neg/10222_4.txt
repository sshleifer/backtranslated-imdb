Aside from the wonderful cinematography done by the wonderful James Wong Howe on battle scenes, this film is a real joke. <br /> <br /> This is the second film I've seen in recent days and directed by Alexander Korda. The first was "Rembrandt" by Charles Laughton. It was so ugly that I closed it. I'm afraid this one is not much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson is as ugly as Queen Elizabeth. Maybe her performance as a virgin queen was good for the 1937 standards, but if you compare her to a Helen Mirren, it's absolutely not up to par. Robson spells out his lines in a robotic way. His message of fighting to the English troops is so dull in spirit. <br /> <br /> Even a dashing Laurence Olivier can not save that total boredom. <br /> <br /> The future woman Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she really does not transmit anything here. To think that Scarlett was 2 years later! <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that the story of the Spanish Armada is so boring in this film.
