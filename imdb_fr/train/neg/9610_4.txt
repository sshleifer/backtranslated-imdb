In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think all studios can create a western, with the exception of Warner bros. The few times they try, it's always ridiculous (except maybe because they're dead with their boots - a cavalry western.) I read that Humphrey Bogart, seeing James Cagney with that big cow hat -boy on his head, said he looks like a mushroom. True! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, too much of the twentieth century to be credible in a Western film. The story here was no surprise, and it did not help. Every 10 minutes, I guess I see Bogart and Cagney drop their small arms and put their hands in a machine gun to get away from the scenery of a 1930s black car.
