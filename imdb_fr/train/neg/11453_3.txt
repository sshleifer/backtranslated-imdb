This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I have ever seen. I hate these Napoleon Dynamite scams. Just face people's mute humor has already been mastered. Do something new for once. All these new comedies are just horrible. And coming out of SNL, Andy Samberg is not ready for a lead yet. I hope he can come back from this horrible movie. And the character of Will Arnetts is just bad. Hey Will, did you read the script? The plot is really the worst ever written. Now you tell me if it's weird. (this is the movie) Rod Kimble's father-in-law, Frank, is dying and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for the heart operation. Only for Rod to beat Frank in a fight and prove his manhood. Yes, it's the movie, you say, would like to spend $ 7.00 to see this shit! <br /> <br /> 3/10 just horrible <br /> <br /> -adam
