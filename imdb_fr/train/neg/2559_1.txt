Well, maybe it's the worst movie of all time, at least the worst film I've ever seen. They have tried these films of 666 children of Satan, the anti-Christ, about 1,000 times and none of them are good, and this is perhaps the worst of them. They think it will be a better movie because they use more fake blood. This film has no idea, the actors and the filming are terrible. I can not even say that at least 10 lines of this movie. Really nothing to tell but it's horrible. How they can make movies like these in their mind just can not understand that. It can not be a Hollywood movie, is it? Just do not look at it using your money more wisely.
