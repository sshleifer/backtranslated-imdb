This film was missing ... everything: story, acting, surprise, ingenuity and soul. Fifteen minutes later, I looked at the screen saying, "How can all these guys get together and think of themselves as friends (even without the girl)?" Another fifteen minutes, I prayed as much as possible Amanda Peet. When a bad film stands quietly, the mouth for the eyes is a great consolation. But there were not many! Cheated on all fronts!
