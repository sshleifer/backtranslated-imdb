The plot concerns the death of small children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the murders. During the film, he seems to have problems with his daughter. In the end, the serial killer gets caught. That's all. But before knowing who dunnit, you must see some terrible actor of all actors. It's amazing how much these actors, including Hopper, are so bad. I could go on like this, but without wasting a lot of time. Just do not watch the movie. I warned you.
