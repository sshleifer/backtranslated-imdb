Two qualifications in mind: I think in fact that Joe Don Baker can be good or even big with the right material and the good director (the remake of "Cape Fear", a small role in "Goldeneye", "Walking Tall"). And I even liked Baker in "Mitchell" because he played an anti-hero that was supposed to be incomparable. Yes, the coverage of MST3K was hilarious, but they took a lot of cheap shots for Baker - which he did not deserve - for everything to be alive and entertaining - he was adapted to the level and tone of the film, and he was the best of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The final justice" seems to be a little bit the same, but despite the exotic locations and the theme of "cowboy border justice", it is a little weaker than "Mitchell " And the main reason is that Baker's character, as it is written, is an idiot. The film claims that because Baker embodies the old frontier machismo, he defies his opponents in quick mano-a-mano draw contests. And because he's so beefy and macho, he always wins, even when he's hurt, hurt, outnumbered, and so on. <br /> <br /> It's a vanity that has a lot of potential (it worked for Gary Cooper), even if it condemns the movie to the movie status "B". But Baker is so stupid and obsessed that he unnecessarily challenges three villain's henchmen to a confrontation in a public market, with civilians everywhere. He could have followed them to the headquarters of the villain's leader (that's why he was following them at the beginning) and they would never have noticed it. Or, he could have gotten the set up and force them to surrender, and ask one of the henchmen to take him to headquarters at gunpoint. But no, he must be a hot dog of the Bush League and a macho idiot. He has a child taken hostage during the shooting that followed! <br /> <br /> This is a guy we are supposed to admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically like this. Most of the support actors are between OK (the henchmen) and pretty good (the bad guy and his father, who are two well-known European actors who just go through the movements, but they're pros and even annoying are decent). But through all this, Baker's character shoots stunts and stupid and unproductive mistakes that kill at least two relatively innocent people, as well as two bad guys who could have been carried alive without resorting to lethal force. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, since 90% of the film takes place in Malta or the Mediterranean, you will see many beautiful landscapes and many pleasant and exotic extras. And really, Baker himself is perhaps rather heavy and slightly dyspeptic, but he is not so bad ... certainly not the nightmare that this critical film (which Mike and the Bots in their hilarious cover) seems to think. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is good for the video wallpaper, but the viewer should pay no attention.
