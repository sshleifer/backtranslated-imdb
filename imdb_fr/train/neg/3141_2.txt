I just had the proof that confirmed my suspicions. A group of children aged 14 to 22 ride the "Titanic" DVD as part of a fantastic mega-home entertainment contract. Only two of them had seen it before. But they had all seen the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so much that most of them had the impression of seeing the whole movie. Shortly after the beginning of the epic, they began to worry. Some of them left asking the others: "Call us when the iceberg appears" More than an hour and a half in the film, only the two girls who had seen it before, were still there. They started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. A rush followed, they all returned to see the sinking of the Titanic. They gaped, emitting Oh and distant outs. So, as I thought when the film made its appearance. What is it? An hour and a half waiting for the bloody thing to flow, but what about the rest? Dr. Zivagho, for example, had a similar duration, but think about what's going on in this movie over the same period. In "Titanic", Leo teaches Kate to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the so-called cream of the crop in the ship's first-class dining room. Look at the historical details, if you can find them. The scenario is so thin that they have to introduce firearms and shots into a ship about to sink. The real shipwreck here is about film standards. All efforts are focused on special effects and opening weekends. The film has become the most profitable film of all time, so, what do I know?
