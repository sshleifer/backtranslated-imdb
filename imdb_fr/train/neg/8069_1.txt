"Soul Survivors" is the latest entry into the horror genre "Who's Dead and Who's alive". Two teenage couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, are getting ready to attend various colleges, but before separating until the Thanksgiving break, they attend a last meeting at a rave party in a church in ruins, at the suggestion of slut Annabel (Eliza Dushku, aka Faith, the other vampire slayer). The scary and unmotivated guys start paying too much attention to Cassie (the generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained and soon the quartet leaves the evening. Left in their sport utility vehicle, they are chased and then overrun by frightening and unreasonable men, who promptly and inexplicably carry out an intentional flight in the middle of the road, causing a nasty fatal accident when the sport utility vehicle settles on an embankment and dive into a river. Sean is killed (or is he?), And Cassie spends the rest of the movie coping with loneliness and guilt (she drove) when she's not haunted by Sean's ghost or pursued by these guys scary and without reason. A great unexplained inconsistency ensues as Cassie's mental state degenerates to the foreseeable conclusion. So who is dead and who is alive? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who really cares?
