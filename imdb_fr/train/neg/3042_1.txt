I am allowed to write 1000 words on this film, but one word might be enough: weird. My husband and I did not laugh that much admiring this really horrible movie. We kept looking at each other with our best "What is ...?" expressions. There is no way to properly describe this movie. The killer tomatoes were funny, but it's just sick. What kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film so that others can see them? What kind of spirit does the innocent children include in this strange film, and then condition it as if it were suitable for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa Claus, do not let him see this movie. Pre-teens can look - probably with "What ...?" expressions on their faces. If you decide to inflict this movie on others, you may want to give them some spice. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst movie of all time.
