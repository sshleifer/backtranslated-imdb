Maria Bello is always great. but it is only a cursed time lost, describing each character as a person to hate and exploit to make a film of an "interesting" story. Well, I hope they took it out of their systems. Unfortunately for the public, there is no intuition, no sensitivity, no context and really no humanity. everything would be fine, except that there is no humor, no horror, no context, and nothing constructive to say about the story he is trying to tell. bad things happen, you sit there watching that, you do not care, so what? In 99% of cases, the words "based on a true story" constitute an unintentional warning to the audience. it means that the director and the screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by certain events they have heard about somewhere. So they just show them on the screen and expect the "real" nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do it. work. I hope they had a good time making this movie. it stinks on the ice.
