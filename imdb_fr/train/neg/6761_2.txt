Let's be honest. Project film school, made without budget and without "real" actors, it is a pretty interesting film. As a product intended for an innocent bystander on DVD, it is a very poorly produced product. If I changed channels without doing anything and accidentally came to take this movie, it would probably stop my eyes and attention for a moment. As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I would get a good film product, that is to say a movie, I am deeply disappointed. It's a videotaped videotape, something in the lineage of the old 60s soap operas, but without that certain charm. Besides the lead actor, Mr. Redfield (who is also the director), the other actors seem to be either campus guys (a bit too old for that), or members of the director's house, who appear in front of the camera without the help of not only acting couches, but also makeup artist or hairdresser (a cap on a permanent fringe too large or a top hat on a mule is very far from the creation of the 1840s). Everything is filmed using a camera mounted motionless in a small naked studio, sometimes using a blue screen for external backgrounds. The synthesizer has generated an inspiring "period" score inspired by romantic karaoke and insulting the viewer's ears over and over. The film tries to be "dreamlike", when in fact they are just collages without design of these plans that were made to the editing (and believe me, the standards were not too high to start). There are interesting dialogues from time to time, but on the whole, it's a rather lame, two-dimensional production in more than one way, without any bursts of genius on the part of the director or the members of the team. That's how "artistic" films tried to look like in the 80s. Mr. Redfield does much better acting than the director.
