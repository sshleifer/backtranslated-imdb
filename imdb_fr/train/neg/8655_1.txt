What a terrible movie. It sucks. It was terrible. I do not know what to say about this movie but about DinoCrap, which I stole from a critic with a finger in the ass. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh .. It's not Roger Corman that I hate, it's that horrible movie. Well, really? But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics? Which is another thing, the CGI sucked aloud; I hate this movie terribly. This is without a doubt the worst film of Roger Corman, and probably also the most gay. That's it --- DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, I must have offended some nerds in those moments. It's just a horrible film ... 0 / 1,000
