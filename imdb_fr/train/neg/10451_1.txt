I am sick and tired of all these little nonsense that tell how this movie "rocked". It's pure agitated CRAP! Do not send a killer, it is much better to pass hundreds of aggressive and colorful snakes in a brightly colored plane! The only reason people like this movie is because they feel obliged. It's not "so bad it's good" It's so bad that I'd rather be stung in the eye with a pointed stick than being subjected to it again. Honestly, I thought it was going to be a comedy like a plane! A parody! I was wrong. It's all that "it sucks, get it!" Or Samuel A. Jackson yells, "Snakes on the plane!" Well, I'm sorry, I do not understand, it looks like a bunch of wafers has given more money to the film industry to make more money. movies like Triple X and Die Hard If you spend money watching a movie with the same people who bought William Hung's CD, always live in their mother's basement and smell the stench of the chair plastic sweat for days on the computer playing online games and watching porn, rush to the theater and ask a ticket (since I doubt you have a girlfriend) for Snakes on a stupid plane. To hell with movies like Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks, etc. It's no irony to watch good movies, it's the true decline of Western civilization. movie is a cult is an insult to the real classics of worship like Repo Man, or even Orgazmo. I have said enough here.
