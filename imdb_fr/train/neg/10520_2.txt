The angels who have a little fart have been banished from the sky and now reside in a British forest where they seduce and cut off teenagers. Talk about high concept. On the positive side, this little mother gives us Tom Savini, but as her field of action is limited to two minutes of screen, her presence of five minutes seems a little long. The angels roam the bare forest for most of the film, but even though they have the body of an angel, their faces resemble those of Joan Rivers on a bad day. The mediocre acting and the effects of amateur gore do not help and the night scenes inevitably recall the most famous film of Paris Hilton. So bad that it's really bad.
