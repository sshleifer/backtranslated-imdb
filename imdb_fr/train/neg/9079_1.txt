What are we talking about here? I had to see a movie different from you. I was so bored that I left the theater. What's up with this stuff? I only laughed once and not even so loudly. Anyone who has clarified this film should be out on the street and beaten. Usually, I always find something I like in a movie, but it's crazy. "Slackers" gives "Not another teen movie" a classic look. It ranks among garbage as "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory" among the worst of all time. AVOID AT ALL PRICES! I thought the studio would give money to people leaving the theater as an apology, but to my dismay, it did not happen. It seems like I will never see that money again or those two hours.
