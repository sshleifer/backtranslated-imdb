Disney people have a lot to explain. First and foremost, why was it thought that this content of lesser sitcom would make a film, even semi-decent. In the 60s game show, Martian's unique idea among us had not yet received the sophisticated X-Files treatment. The picturesque visions of little green men have long since been dispelled by projects like AND, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 1 to 3. <br /> <br /> All the charm of the property was mainly due to the endearing relationship created between fire Bill Bixby as Tim and Ray Walston as an unusual visitor. The vanity according to which the Martians have an antenna seemed then doped. Now, that sounds positively silly. However, Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Martin has metal appendages. At first, the antenna on a sign of the TV channel where Tim works is supposed to make us think "Martian"! When did you see a television with bunny ears for the last time, huh? <br /> <br /> Disney does not trust strange relationships or relationships and robs this movie with special effects that appeal to young people and include a costume called Zoot! Yes, you read correctly. The silver combination of Uncle Martin speaks. It's supposed to be a real hilarious knife! Figure again. I have stretch socks that are funnier than Zoot. Whenever the action lags behind (and is constantly lagging behind), computer-generated images are used to animate things. Tim is here played by the amiable Jeff Daniels, who can not (or will) do anything to save this bloating clutter. Zesty Christine Ebersole brings comic zeal to the role of her neighbor. Even Ray Walston himself is painfully involved in the procedures - all in vain. This extraterrestrial visitor died on his arrival. <br /> <br /> The incessant discussions on sitcoms that turn to the screen make me hope that the movie I DREAM OF JEANNIE will not feature a talking harem outfit. I pray that Samantha's cat in the movie BEWITCHED has no lines. I live in fear that I LOVE LUCY - THE MOVIE will proudly present a Conga CG drum named Bongo. <br /> <br /> Paging Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - take me to your boss.
