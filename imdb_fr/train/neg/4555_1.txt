This film captures none of the mysteries and intrigues proposed by the book. The main point of the book, ideas, are barely touched, leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is doing such a business and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> the development of the character is not good at all. No background or personal development leaves the audience indifferent to what happens to them, and the action sequences fall flat. <br /> <br /> The search for manuscripts ends abruptly, without any real explanation, not leaving no feeling of satisfaction as to the object of this research. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I have ever seen. It's horrible and a waste of time. If you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you have read the book, skip the movie and reread it. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the purpose of making the film was to discredit the book, it's how bad and ridiculous this film is. It's a shame too, because it could have been good if they had made the most of its success and they probably could have found a good screenwriter and good actors. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, READ THE BOOK !!!
