The film started strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as a plainclothes police officer, with his partner, Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott's practice, perhaps misinterpreted as a villain?) Committing robbery and murder. Deed refuses to kill the drug trafficker, staging a dirty cop's conflict with a conscience. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey and others) are well chosen and the film looks promising. <br /> <br /> The film begins to fail as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is presented. If I could make a good film that people will see many times, or a film where teenagers would go to see Timberlake once, I would choose the first one. Even talented actors have to work hard for their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of work can save him. I would have thought he would make a better show, considering that he's talented for talent for years. All he did in this movie was not convincing. <br /> <br /> It's not because a singer sells millions of records and stadiums that it automatically means that they can play successfully in feature films. Even N'Sync enthusiasts will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of talent as an actor. <br /> <br /> That aside, there are some intrigues, such as Pollack's Sniper ability and the murderous operation of the warehouses. This film had so many promises. Completely disappointing.
