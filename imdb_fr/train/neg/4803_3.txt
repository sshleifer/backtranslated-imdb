Adrianne should really have a life without Mr. "Brady". It hurts my heart and is one of the main reasons why I know I am more attentive to the series. It's a rather demented show, and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put into the field and analyzed to death. It gives them the air / the sound that they are anything but ready for marriage, and yet, I know that these disagreements are all part of life. I guess for some people it's an entertainment. If it falls in the next season, I'll be sorry for those who have nothing better to do with their lives than to watch this garbage. Although I would not be terribly surprised. can not even stand the commercials for this show! I hope they get enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera, week after week. However, the girl "A" has a hell of a butt!
