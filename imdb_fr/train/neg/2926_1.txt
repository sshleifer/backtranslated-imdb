There seems to be a bit of a curse with regard to gay cinema. Namely, happy ends are not very common. Beautiful thing excluded, homosexual movies tend to end in broken relationships or premature death. And some, like Come Undone, have just ended ... period. <br /> <br /> The creators of this awful stupidity have something to learn about plot, direction and timing. During the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself a little confused, and even more after the first glimpse of the character of Jeremie Elkaim doing a little psychological session. It seems that this film was reconstituted at random without any attempt of continuity or coherence. There is not really any way to know when you are looking at the present or some kind of ethereal flashback. Stephen Holden of the New York Times described the film as "... a shimmering beauty and a real reality". Stephen Holden, New York Times. Well, it seems that Stephen has invested in beer glasses before looking at them, because that's really not good. Due to all the praise received by this film, I was expecting something interesting. Unfortunately, the film lived up to its title. And at the end of the film (which provided no resolution, let's add it), it is obvious that the writers, the director and the film were all destroyed.
