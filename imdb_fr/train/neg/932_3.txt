I watched this movie and hoped that something was improving all the time. What's so great about a guy without emotion? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You never see Alex show his emotions to anyone other than his son. Yes, I know that's why his son is the only one to make him lose his temper (if you can call him that), I understand. <br /> <br /> Characters are not developed, relationships are not given enough time to be understood. In one scene, Sarah says that they will not fall in love, and the next time we see her, she will tell us that her death really upset her because they were so close? Logical synapses abound in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's like someone has been watching Boogie Nights and writing this part to mimic Little Bill. Even the scene where he "loses his temper" is the same as the one where Little Bill kills his wife, up to the facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at representing a man without emotion - been there, done that - can you say Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This film was not only lacking emotion, it lacked substance, a good script, developed characters and a plot. And it certainly misses my recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
