Can I give it a negative note? No? Well, let me tell you that this is the most atrocious movie I have ever tried to watch. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. The plot (?) Is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity. I rented this movie with a friend and, after about thirty minutes in the hope that everything would be better, we decided to "take a step forward" to see if things were getting better. It's never better. This film about a guy who gets kidnapped by these two girls seems interesting, but in reality, it's just a problem. Nothing interesting ever happens. If you ever get a chance to watch this, do yourself a favor, try "NEW OUTDOOR PLAN" instead.
