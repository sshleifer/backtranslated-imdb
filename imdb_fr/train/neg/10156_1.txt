His spelling is S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character flashed her breasts. It was pretty tight. Before and after that, the film explodes. The role play is like an electronic list and it shows well in the movie. Not to mention that the budget is so low that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person. Looks like the whole movie was shot with a camcorder instead of a decent halfway movie. The only other reason I liked the movie was that Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said a lot of stupid things that made me laugh. Apart from that, if you see this movie at Blockbuster, make sure everyone hides it well behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good should be evaluated mentally.
