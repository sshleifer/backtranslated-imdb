I'm sorry, but it's such a bad movie that it's hilarious. Football hooligans compete in a travel lodge? Suit? Shades ?! Alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he did that, it's as far from the truth as you can get. <br /> <br /> The cast was atrocious ... Gary Oldman like a football thug? He does not look scary, scary and does not even look like someone who likes football. And as for Yeti? What is going on? Suitable, gets in the shade and sits in a Travelodge to mock with childhood with "it's about the time to put on your diaper". Please. <br /> <br /> And the Yeti gang sprays the underwear of the ICC? <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone could even take this film seriously! <br /> <br /> 4/10. This is perhaps the most inaccurate representation of the hooliganism crisis of the late 1980s that I have ever seen.
