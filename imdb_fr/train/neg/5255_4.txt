Visually, this film is beautiful. There are delicious black comic moments. But on the whole, the plot is very clich√©, as is its apparent message. If you are a fan of extravagant violence in mainstream movies like hostel or seen, you will love it. If you are looking for something very high, avoid yourself. I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival 06 and I chose it only because I was looking for something disturbing. In the end, it is not disturbing. Just grinding and unpleasant to sit through. If you really want to be challenged, go see something like The Lost. If you want to be disgusted or tell your friends a really messed movie, then this is for you.
