"Sleeping with the enemy" is a predictable thriller "been there before" that never seems to find inspiration, no matter how the actors and the team try desperately to do it. I can not believe that a group of friends convinced me to see it in the cinema some sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> The complete lack of originality of Ronald Bass's scenario (based on Nancy Price's novel) did not help, neither the stolid direction of Joseph Ruben nor the very average performance of Julia Roberts. Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson do nothing to help. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say. Drop. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
