I went to see this film with a crowd of mainly "New Age" spiritual types, who, unlike me, enjoyed the film a lot --- although according to those who also knew the book (apparently, there is a book contains more of this nonsense), the film is not so good. So, if you tend to think of yourself as "spiritual", believe or at least can tolerate things like "aura" and "astral body" and do not be afraid of the frequent use of the term "energy" out of context. from physics or technology, you may like the movie, and will probably appreciate more the book on which it is apparently based. <br /> <br /> However, if you are primarily in contact with the physical universe, if suspending disbelief is easily exhausted by the senseless nonsense of the New Age and the intrigues that are based there, if in addition you have a low tolerance to the effects of cheesy light to denote the unfolding of spirituality, and perhaps even wait for a reasonable dialogue in wood, Here is my recommendation for you regarding this film: Stay. Absent. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about it. Tonight, this movie moved Dungeons and Dragons as the worst film I've ever seen in a movie theater (I do not count the movies I went to see in the expectation that they're bad, like Plan 9 , etc.). At the same time, the total number of films that I almost left was increased (D & D being the other). I do not release films, not even from this one, but I should have, when I saw for the first time the visual representation of an aura, because from that moment, the BS New Age becomes more and more thick. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a group of people joining old prophecies, seeking spiritual enlightenment and bringing humanity to the next stage of its evolution. Or something like that. In fact, they speak of this spiritual substance as the next stage of human evolution, which should make anyone aware of what human evolution is. The film is in shock with such problems. From time to time, people are addressing what they would certainly describe as an "other dimension", or perhaps a "different plan," to become invisible to those around them who are not yet reached enlightenment. Goodness. <br /> <br /> In the end, the director protects the audience by presenting the "information" that is the prophecy, extremely slow, so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better, more enlightened people . <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie? Some very beautiful shots of nature, and some support performances worthy of Elizondo and Almeida. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this film interesting or acceptable. It's really cheap spiritualism of the most naive kind, and unless it's your thing, you'd better do something else with your time and money.
