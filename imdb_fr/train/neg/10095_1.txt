Someone gave this movie 2 stars. There is a good chance they will need immediate professional help, because anyone who does not spend 30 seconds to see if you can not assign any star is literally scary. <br /> <br /> This movie is ... well ... I guess it's kind of a kind of horrible porn movie / snuff attempt with no pornographic or horrible content (except the actor, plot, history, sets, dialogue and sound). I mistakenly assumed that they were zombies. <br /> <br /> Looking at it is actually pretty scary in all fairness; you're terrified, someone will come and you'll never be able to describe what it is and they'll leave thinking that you're a monster watching home-made amateur torture videos or something. <br /> <br /> I'm so surprised that I write this review on my cellphone so I do not forget to try to lower the rating even further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same come out that I just suffered. <br /> <br /> I worst film I have ever seen and I can say (with the hand on the heart) that it will never, never reach.
