I like Seth Green. His appearances in the TH 70's show are still worth watching, but last night I felt the need to redesign the show. Four young singles inherit an apartment in New York City for which most of us would die. The grandmother had to be the heiress to have such a space in the first place. So I felt that the need for realism should have been highlighted. Anyway, the plot about the four best friends of this apartment was not credible. I would have been delighted if they had to move in with one of their parents, which would have been very humorous and dysfunctional about the set up of the show. There did not seem to be much humor in it. I'm just watching this because it falls before My name is Earl on a winning night on Thursday night. I think they should go back, abandon this series and start again. We need more family series involved. How about Seth and his friends settling at his wacky parents' home in the suburbs after the fire that burned them? They could have Dabney Coleman play the father and Christine Estabrook the mother and the dysfunctional siblings. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is endless and the network explodes.
