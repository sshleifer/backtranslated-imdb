When small budgets are going well, you will usually find that you get what you pay for and let me tell you that I did not pay much for "Frightworld" ... <br /> <br /> Writer / Director : David R. Williams tells the story of an abandoned amusement park, besieged by the vengeful spirit of a serial killer killed. Not bad as a premise, but executed with a multitude of low budget mistakes. The work of the camera tries to be too far from the audience, constantly using quick cuts to hide the fact that they really have nothing bloody or scary to show us. This becomes obvious from the start, as the new killer is introduced and we quickly realize that the role (of the actor) is the scariest thing that happens ... After a painfully long title sequence, we are brought back to modern times. the game stays the same. "Frightworld" generates a rather unique cinematography when projecting landscapes from inside the home entertainment, but with an extremely long run time, it can not save the film from its indie hell below average. <br /> <br /> There is a mediocre nudity, but not much for Gore, which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies. <br /> <br /> Fans of very bad B movies might find something of interest here, otherwise, do not spend a lot of money on it.
