Great CGI effects and Oscar-winning performance of Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is a one-time pony in this movie. How he got the Oscar for Best Actor that year was a crime for Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> This film is a peaceful and peaceful letter of love to the baby boomer generation, with a barely concealed right-wing bias, from Forrest's service in Vietnam to "resolution" with Jenny at the end. <br /> <br /> That said, it's extremely entertaining and an American movie from start to finish. I found some parts of this movie extremely offensive, Zemeckis makes this silly movie almost at the level of Gump himself. . Maybe that's what he was trying to say. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and ask yourself the following question: "What does Robert Zemeckis say about what makes a good American?" <br /> <br /> Forrest seems to have made the "right" choices and be "in the right place at the right time" over the past 45 years. Those who are mistaken according to the vision of the director seem to pay a heavy price. So, does Zemeckis say that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic quality, even AMERICAN?
