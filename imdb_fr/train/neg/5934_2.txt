I would not consider myself one of Leonard Cohen's biggest fans. He is, however, an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. By far, the most valuable element of this documentary is to hear Leonard's reflections on his own life and career. Warm and humble. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most musicians at the concert did not explain the nuances of Leonard's musical / literary style. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton were the exceptions, although Leonard attaches great importance to the interpretation of his songs by Rufus Wainrights. <br /> <br /> What has particularly failed in this documentary is the filmmaker's ability to allow the viewer to see who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians connect to him. Much is said in this respect, but the viewer is not attracted to Leonard Cohen's person. This gap is particularly evident in interviews with Bono and the Edge. They consider Leonard as a special icon, but can not translate their exact value of Leonard Cohen. The collaboration with U2 is a joke. The whole live recording looks like a rushed job. And as in all the film, only Leonard Cohen remains his role and can tell his own role. <br /> <br /> The entire editing and script is very much like an extramural high school project. The use of effects such as echo, slow motion or flashed images is misplaced. Part of the work of the camera is dismal. Part of the score does not recall the associations I expected. Sometimes it seemed that the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film. Perhaps a reference to his previous use of LSD. <br /> <br /> A little unintentional humor ... at one point, Leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre. At first, he can not remember the name of the genre, until he ends up saying it was punk, the punksters really caught his music. The next scene of the film is a live replay of "I can not forget" ... <br /> <br /> "And I can not forget, I can not forget I can not forget but I do not you do not remember who "
