Using looted images from Planet of Dinosaurs, this video (except stolen images) is about a group of people filmed in space landing on a dinosaur planet that's ... do not wait, it's really Earth . His five-minute sketch lasted 90 minutes. A little better than Chickboxer (another movie from the Bad Movie Police series), which offers a nostalgic home movie feel and stolen effects. This film is always a difficult task. It remains for me to think about the question: are we becoming so creative that we are now pilling old films, not only for the plot, but also for mismatched sequences? Obviously, low-budget producers are so desperate that they will really give us anything to take our money
