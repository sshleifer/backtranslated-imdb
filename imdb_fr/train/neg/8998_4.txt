Stephen Feinberg, who played the role of the proctologist and who was one of the scriptwriters of the film, died in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, a year later he had announced that he had been writer in Hollywood a few years ago, working mainly on TV specials. He asked me not to see 'Tunnel Vision', but it was too late, I had already seen it! In fact, I had seen it years before, when it was published. At that time, I did not think it was such a bad movie. However, seeing him as an adult, my opinion was somewhat different. Yes, it's a little childish and dated. Steve admitted that it was not a very good movie. That said, he was just a little proud of the drawing of 'The Proctologist'.
