It seems that the critics IMDb of this film were more taken into account than the sources. <br /> <br /> Here is an unpretentious criticism: <br /> <br /> Just when you think nothing is going to happen happens, it does not happen. <br /> <br /> Dress it up as you want, it's a dull film, full of uninviting characters who have very little interest. <br /> <br /> One to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you are as if deep, dude. <br /> <br /> This is not something to watch for your own pleasure though. <br /> <br /> Unless. <You are. <br /> <br /> Pretentious.
