I can not believe I lost my time with this movie. I could not even call it a movie. It was so bad with nothing to recommend. <br /> <br /> I like low-budget movies and strange movies, but this one bored me to death. Bad luck and bad play prevented him from being curious. You have to wonder what these people thought when they spent money producing this movie. I wonder what I was thinking by looking to the end. I recommend this film to anyone. How did they release this? Is there an audience that likes this kind of movie? There must be some because you can find it in almost any video store. But why? <br /> <br /> deserves to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, it's for you.
