Many other commentators here, including those whose opinions I respect, hold this slice of European horror of sleaze in high esteem. Personally, I did not like it at all. It is an incoherent attempt at an atmospheric period mixing sex and violence. Jess Franco at his best does this kind of movies very well. Unfortunately, the infamous operating filmmaker Joe D'Amato does not do it. D'Amato's best-known films are infamous for their high coarse quotient. This film, of which he is one of the first films, does not have the constant disgusting scenes of his most notorious "Anthropophage" and "Beyond the Darkness". In the end, it's an incoherent film that fails to engage the viewer. Without the sleaze factor either, it becomes very boring. As I said, other people enjoyed this movie, but I just found it as a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are some advantages for the film. Ewa Aulin ("Candy") is inside, she looks pretty hot and is often naked. However, the icon of the cult film, Klaus Kinski, is completely lost in a secondary plot unrelated to the main movie. He seems bored by the role and does not have the manic intensity he has at his best. The score is nice and there are some brief moments of funny gore. It's still a pretentious and useless movie that manages to be incredibly boring. (3/10)
