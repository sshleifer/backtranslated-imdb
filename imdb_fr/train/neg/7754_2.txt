The spoilers will be in that. The film could have been better if they had just had a script, a director and a different CGI provider. Not much, no? The movie has a man starting his own theme park ... uh ... a zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs ... uh ... Sabretooths and his name is Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. The scams do not bother me, because there are no original ideas for this kind of movies, but this one slaps you, there is even a head. There is even the thing "shaded head of the creature on the drawing". The Sabretooths, who are not according to Sabin according to Mr. Primal Park (just old killer cats), are rather junky but the ultimate achievement is what I call "Sloggy". Because, after eliminating a big cat, a hero relaxes a bit because there is only one left. Enter the weird feeding guy who says, Nah, we made three, the third being a monster who crawls with his feet forward. Great, groovy. A group of students is also on the island for a treasure hunt, a test to enter their cliques, whether they are fratis√©s or sorted (always thought it needed a short nickname). Of those who live, only one has completed his task, so I had a crush on that. Oh yes, the obligatory clique "The devilish capitalist must die" is in force with not one, but two of them! The death of Mr. Primal Park is the most laughable thing you can see in any of these movies: the toothpastes of a statue of Sabretooth are loose (Courtesy of Sloggy), shrink a few sizes and impal man at the throat. If I had escaped so easily. I like "Sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
