Nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing! This time, it's brought to you by the ever-inevitable Fred Olen Ray! As for the exploitation films, this one does not click! As a science fiction, it's just original! All we see is a naughty android female wearing a bikini to destroy the Earth and showing off everything that is almost bare to resist! Give me a break !!! If this kind of entertainment is your thing, why not dust off those old SI swimsuit magazines from the attic to change ?! It would have been a lot better if he had not put the sleaze factor at a very high level, but that would still not make it excellent. I would like to highlight another film called The Assault (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which looks like ALIENATOR's identity. This illustrates why first-class "femme fatale" action movies do not translate well in America. Sorry, guys!
