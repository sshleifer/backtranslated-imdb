I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was great on Top Model and I was really happy when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he looks like a good guy. But this show just made me sick! I am so angry at both of you for what happened on this show. I do not care they were of different ages, I know that age can not stay between love. But Adrianne, you've been together for ONLY SEVEN MONTHS. It did not surprise me at all that he did not propose. And I do not see the point in forcing someone to marry you before he's ready. If this is supposed to be so, then why not just enjoy each other's company and love each other, and let it come naturally? Turning an alliance into a ball and chain was totally useless, it's stupidly obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, you should be ashamed to break down and offer him anyway! You have experienced two failed marriages, how could you rush into another just because she has a crisis? I hope the relationship will last, but I really think the marriage has been rushed and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe they can now catch their breath and find the right reasons to get married as part of their marriage.
