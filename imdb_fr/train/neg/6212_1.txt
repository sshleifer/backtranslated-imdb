Previously, I thought that movies required intrigue, or some other way to worry about the story or everything that's going on. This film showed me that it was not necessary to have anything like that. <br /> <br /> I could summarize it simply. But IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was pretty. not convincing the least. The way the characters speak in the movie makes you think that it should have been over a few days, but there is no time to pass and I'm pretty sure everything will happen in an hour. If you're looking for fun, buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before you throw up. It would be a much better use of your time. Time you will never receive. Jurassic Park 3 was better than this movie.
