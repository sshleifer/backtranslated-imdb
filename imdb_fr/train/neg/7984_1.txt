Too many secondary traces without a primary. Too many hot buttons are pushed for no reason, they managed to stuff this annoying film, which says nothing, with all the existing dramatic elements: death, divorce, financial problems, parental problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug addiction, adoption, rejected love, travel problems, gender, intergenerational misunderstandings, robbery, legal problems, firearms, medical ethics, "deep and deep love"? One would think that it would make an interesting film, but God no? all these events are secondary to something primary that is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the conference "super-deep" (and super-long) to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense. Pity. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention: the actors, all, are very good. That's what kept me from turning it off. Too bad their talents were wasted. The film is well shot too: light, movement, etc. of each episode - everything is in place. It's just the meaning that's missing.
