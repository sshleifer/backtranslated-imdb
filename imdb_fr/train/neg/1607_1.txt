This "documentary" is proof that talent is used for petty purposes. The fact that it is financed by the Venezuelan government confers on it a lack of legitimacy in order to seek the truth about what really happened those horrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela, something that even us Venezuelans do not know for sure. <BR /> <br /> There are ways to lie, and managers like this lie both by omission and knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by the foreign public, who benefits from it. For example, * POSSIBLE SPOILERS *, they show pro-Chávez protesters shooting in a deserted street (why did they do that?) Saying they did not kill anyone, but did not bother to show the images we have all seen here, opposition protesters (and a journalist) falling dead or wounded on the other side of this "empty" street. They can not explain why the political police helicopter was the only one allowed to fly over Caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers who were on the roofs of the buildings near the presidential palace, which would show inefficiency being the security measures to keep the president. A few days after the "coup", the head of the military guard in charge was questioned in the National Assembly (our Congress) about why he had not acted against snipers and he said : "They were not there to act, the president," is that not a confession? <br /> <br /> There are so many other things, the fact that the highest ranking army announced that Chavez had resigned and 2 days later he said he lied because " it was politics "And nowadays it is the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Chávez government. <br /> <br /> I would need thousands of words to explain all the lies described in this "documentary", made for the purpose of image of the good old Hugo Chávez who governs the poor and the wicked rich who want it to any price, while 60% to 70% of people reject his government and that percentage includes the poor. <br /> <br /> I hope that those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version and a group of Venezuelans showing no less than 30 lies. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda is back!
