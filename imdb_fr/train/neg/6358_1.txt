Everyone lives in gigantic, perfect flats in Manhattan's larger neighborhoods, everyone tends to frequent expensive and exclusive restaurants where all the characters tell fascinating anecdotes and discuss arcane philosophy. physical effort and possible exposure to diseases, then of course, the main character feels guilty of his lust for the queen shiksa but pursues it anyway, sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing, etc. <br /> This tired formula, and the proof that Allen is not really a great movie artist. He looks like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a 20-year-old man who intends to tell the same old boring stories over and over again.
