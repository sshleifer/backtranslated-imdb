If I had not read his name on the jacket of the DVD, I would never have known that this rather youthful and old-fashioned musical had been made by a man so closely associated with the French new wave. In fact, the film is so far off that I wonder if, in the 50s and 60s, the authors of New Wave would have absolutely disliked this type of film - it is so ... so ... unreal. And, that seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but rather a very surprising thing. <br /> <br /> What I also found a little surprising is the amount of praise that some critics have given to this film - especially when there are many better French musicals out there . The songs in this movie were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotyped. If I had to see another rich person who was worried about the difficulty of being rich or getting a good price for a designer outfit, I was going to throw up. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that America's musicals, all French musicals are not gold. This film is not another film "The umbrellas of Cherbourg" and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I do not see many reasons to recommend it, if it was nothing but a banal curiosity.
