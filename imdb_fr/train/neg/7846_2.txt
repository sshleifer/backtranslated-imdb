You know, I went to see "The Hills have eyes 2" in order to enjoy it. I really enjoyed the original and the remake was quite fun. Obviously, they had more money to spend than Wes Craven had done for special effects the second time. Although I still prefer the original movie, the remake was done well and it was a guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, an excellent movie about popcorn for all horror fans. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to "The Hills have eyes 2". Dude, where should I start? The plot, or the lack of one, is as thin as paper. We are not really innovative here. The army has decided to monitor the area and all these people are missing. So what are we doing now? Let's send the National Guard to investigate. Hollywood style, we must make it the stupidest and the worst soldiers ever seen. Gee, I've never seen this premise before. In summary, the mutants kill the foolish soldiers one after the other, graphically. Once again, Nicotero's special effects are excellent, but kills, no matter how graphic, become boring and predictable. Honestly, it seemed to me that this film was designed to quickly raise money. It was bloody and graphic, but I found it predictable, boring and not scary at all. For me, it would have been nice if this film contained an original idea. We Craven and his son shared the writing tasks and he has been involved in many of my favorite horror movies, but unfortunately it is not.
