The summary sums up just about everything. It's not nearly as good as the original. With a script co-written by both Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time, he also wrote Aliens). Most of the scenes were written by Cameron and the political aspects, by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Sly was physically in the best condition possible at the time of writing this article. Rocky 4 looks great on steroids, depending on your point of view or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo starts in prison and receives the visit of Colonel Trautman who asks him to leave for a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon. He finally accepts and goes to the briefing camp led by Charles Napier, who plays a suit in Washington and tries to pretend to be old forces to calm Rambo. <br /> <br /> The mission is to determine if there are missing prisoners of war still alive in camps in Vietnam. Rambo was chosen because the camp he controlled was somewhere where he had already been a prisoner himself. He is told that it is not a rescue mission and that he is only there to take photos of recognition. <br /> <br /> After a bad skydiving attempt from an airplane, he loses most of his equipment, meets his contact (which turns out to be a cute woman) and goes down the river with pirates until at the camp. <br /> <br /> He discovers that there are always prisoners and saves one. While the three leave half of the Vietnamese army aboard their riverboat, they are betrayed by the pirates, but Rambo kills them all and forces them to walk to the meeting point after their boat was rammed and carried away with Rambo almost on board. <br /> <br /> Rambo is again betrayed and abandoned as Napier orders the rescue helicopter to be recalled. It is clear that Trautman returns to the base to reprimand him and that no other survivor should be found. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff introduces himself as a Russian colonel Spetznatz and Rambo is tortured and eventually escapes to be pursued by other Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz. By killing a lot, Rambo finally steals a helicopter and saves most of the prisoners to return to his base. <br /> <br /> He resists the urge to kill Napier for abandoning him, but destroys the Operations Center. <br /> <br /> A weak plot and a very weak end as Rambo walks away at sunset as a free man.
