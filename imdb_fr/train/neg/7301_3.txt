There is a big difference between releasing an original film, intense, at the edge of your seat, scary, gore-fest and do like the filmmaker Eli Roth and his team ended up with "Cabin Fever" and simply acted in this way . The film follows five university graduates in a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal, one after the other succumbing to this mysterious, fast-acting and devouring disease of flesh. He does not stay long before the friends light up, and can hardly stand each other, let alone want to be in the same neighborhood as they do. As disgusting as it may seem, there is a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked, in the hands of a less arrogant filmmaker. Unfortunately, we end up with poorly drawn characters whose only goal seems to be beautiful at first to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting, a screenplay worn to the point that blasphemy forces it to let the viewer tune the dialogue and several incomprehensible. secondary intrigues that motivate a little more than (in one case) an appearance on the screen of the director Roth. It's a sloppy movie in many ways! Avoid this devouring time.
