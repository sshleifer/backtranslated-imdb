The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released on video / DVD as a feature film) about the traitors of the 1960s, seen through the eyes of a white family and a black family. The first half of the film is based on Dutton's excellent performance as Reverend Willie Taylor and spreads the script equally between families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent and downright half-awful half. EVALUATION: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video / DVD output).
