Sensational. Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. had never influenced anyone? This pile of fuming donkey excrement is a perfect example. it gives "The violent years" to "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes Keith Richards' worst flashbacks look like my first night show. I've had nightmares, you know, waking up and sweating, it'll never be close to the visceral terror that Santa Claus brought to light in the seemingly pure soil of my very being. However, I can think of some evenings where this movie might go well. Plus, if you're looking for the perfect example of a Santa-Satan dichotomy on a VHS tape, look no further. Do not watch this movie because I have been informed that the MST3K version is now available. Move on Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
