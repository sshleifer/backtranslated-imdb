I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 mules. It's a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously, this movie is living proof that the formula works. If it's not broken, it does not need repair. An urban heroine, yet vulnerable, a martial arts master ex-police hardened with a heart of gold and a serial killer with "problems". Pure magic.
