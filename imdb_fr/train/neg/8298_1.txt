This movie was not very entertaining, certainly not as original or as good as a Christmas story. The characters (except the youngest) try to imitate the previous actors and fail. The hillbilly neighbors come from nowhere because they were not part of the first movie. It was really bad, it could have been good with the original cast, but maybe not because the story is so weak. Jump.
