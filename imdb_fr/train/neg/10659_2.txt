Filmatography: Excellent, beautiful angle of view (I do not remember having seen a movie recently, with good close-ups up to this one). I could have avoided macabre scenes with a soft camera. The photo of New York is good. I liked the angles upside down, especially (a different touch). <br /> <br /> Music: Not impressive. The songs do not stay in your mind even after watching the movie. Perhaps, I expected the same quality as "Anniyan". Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal must move slowly away from hard action sequences. His age and his belly appear really. In addition, he should avoid close romantic sequences. It was very embarrassing to see a mature / old star who was still trying to play as a scene of 20 heroes or more. Love can be expressed at any age. as we get older, you can still express your love from far away (without touching a woman too much, for example, the love expressed by Rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi"). <br /> <br /> Jyotika appears for the namesake in the film. I do not know why she accepted that. Well, that's not my problem, I guess. <br /> <br /> Others have only a small presence. <br /> <br /> Meaning: I was expecting Gautham to excel (or measure) to his other film "Kakka Kakka". He disappointed me. The film's release took a long time due to various issues. He slides into some scenes. A famous director has even escaped evidence. <br /> <br /> Overall: it's a good movie. Too many graphics. This is certainly not for children (and adults who expect some kind of "entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thank you
