That's what happened with Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, with The Lost Boys in 2008 and now with another 80s Wargame classic ... :( Why, oh why, oh why Hollywood will not learn Does it ever ... Leave them alone ...! They can not be redone ...! They fear .... We hate them all ....! .. <br /> <br /> Those of you who have not seen the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy, go rent / buy now .... !! The material may seem old fashioned, the special effects are not new, but it still beating this trash handy .... <br /> <br /> For those of us who lived through the 80's when hacking was sexy, the internet was something mysterious and your records were kind We now have the wisdom to avoid this film as a thermonuclear war! "Never before," a beautiful chess game "seemed to be the best their option ....
