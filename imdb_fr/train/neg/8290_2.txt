Alan Rudolph is a terrible director, without this special touch. For example, there was a shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists of the dental office that could have expressed the entire relationship between husband and wife. Rudolph wasted it. The camera is in the hallway and looks through the doors of the two dentists' offices. Dana and Dave are alone in their respective rooms. You have the idea of ​​their desolation and their isolation, but not much more. The lighting, the colors, the body language, the facial expressions could have been greatly improved. If I realized, I would have spent all day, if necessary, to make the shot. This is the beauty and power of the film: it can express so many lives, in seconds <br /> <br /> We could have improved the shooting of the toddler who walked in the puddle of vomiting. The child should have shown more fascination for the puddle, should trample and move his feet, should have his head tilted to look at the puddle with all his attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell did not deliver. He embodies a man not communicative, certainly, but instead of translating his inner turmoil into voice, gesture, body movement, the film is based on voice over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter-ego interpreted by Denis Leary.
