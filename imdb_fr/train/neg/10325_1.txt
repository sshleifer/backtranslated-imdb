This series is only getting worse. Wrong writing and just not funny! The premise is excellent, but the writer's lack of experience shines through. By striving to offend anyone, they end up insulting everyone. Now in the second season, the desperate actors have stopped waving their arms and turned to this condescending and awesome role-playing game, "Oh, silly you," which comes with a script that does not laugh. They roll their eyes and shake their heads as if to say, are not we crazy? Is not it funny? Well, no, it's not really. Gum disease is less painful. Not surprisingly, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian television. Go to CBC, you're supposed to be our main station featuring the best Canadian talent. Pull the plug on this amateur mess.
