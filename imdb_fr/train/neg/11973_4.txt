It's probably one of the worst French films I've seen so far, on more than 100 French films I've ever seen. Scenario terrible and very mediocre / unprofessional game provokes impotent staging. with all that the beautiful French western scenes and luxury music can add to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the main weaknesses of this film is that these two characters do NOT attract the public, I do not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> It amazed me to see how this film won the Jury Award in Cannes, man, I love almost every award-winning movie in Cannes, but not this one. A major disappointment for me.
