Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. "Munchies" is another Gremlins clone from the 80's. I'm not a big proponent of imitations. <br /> <br /> It was first of all the excellent "Gremlins". <br /> <br /> Then come the "creatures" very average. <br /> <br /> Do not forget the ugly "Ghoulies". <br /> <br /> But the complete pits will have to go to "Hobgoblins". <br /> <br /> Is there more? <br /> <br /> Now, the "snack" should be somewhere between "Ghoulies" and "Hobgoblins". In fact, I probably found it more entertaining than "Ghoulies", but I preferred the darker tone. <br /> <br /> From the start, he plays his crazy nature (which is better for her), but, because of this nature, the acting (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips) can be quite intrusive for you. it's enough to see cravings go crazy. This is where fun is. Especially light, because the story focuses mainly on cravings (hungry, excited and destructive) in a lot of so-called comic encounters (some times work) in the small desert town on the hunt. It's silly, but strangely engaging thanks to the fast pace. The creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed because they are basic dolls on which we do not care. The origin of their personalities is that they can really speak ... and with attitude. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and a feisty Nadine Van der Velde (who was in "Critters") were honest leads. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also appears. <br /> <br /> Fun and casual entertainment for the less demanding.
