I love zombie movies and amateur productions. And Meat Market 2 starts really promising with a nice tribute to the classic "Zombi" Fulci. <br /> <br /> So I leaned back and waited to be impressed. Okay, some makeups are perfect for such a film without budget and some actors (the vampirelady and the cook) really stand out, but otherwise there is nothing. <br /> <br /> I was not expecting a new Romero here but there is not a sequence in the whole movie that even has a bit of suspense or shock value. The director knows how to stage furrows and interesting eating habits, but now (after two passages), it's time to learn something more. <br /> <br /> In MeatMarket2, Gore rhymes with boredom - for me that's all. not enough - sorry. <br /> <br /> ** on *****
