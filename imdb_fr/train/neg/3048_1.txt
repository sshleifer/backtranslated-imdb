This is perhaps the most frightening Santa Claus ever devoted to a media, be it a book, an image or a movie. Santa looks like a pervert who despises children and the twisted story of bringing Merlin to help him defeat one of Satan's henchmen, Pitch, does not make things better. It's laughable, to say the least, with perverse effects, even for the 1959 standards. If a child watched this movie, he'd have nightmares and would never want Santa to visit him. They would be marked for life. Imagine the kid in "A Christmas Story" when he starts screaming after being put on Santa's lap. This is what would happen if the children saw this film.
