What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking? Was Hollywood responsible for this parody, or can I comfort myself by thinking that someone who did not speak English as a first language had completely missed the goal of Charlotte Bronte's classic? I do not think I can improve a comment I read below, so I'll just paraphrase it: "Jane Eyre is a great book, the writer should read it from time to time." It is true that the two main roles of this film have been misinterpreted. But pity the actors, because the screenwriter has left out all the best scenes. The dialogue that makes you understand that Jane and Rochester have a convergence of views and a shared sense of pleasure ... removed from the script. The marriage proposal, the fortune teller ... is gone. Allusions, half joking, almost sincere, to Jane, a fairy of old England coming to help Rochester in his despair ... eliminated. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Jane's interactions with the Rivers family. But it is unforgivable to have surgically removed the love of one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go in search of the 1983 mini series (?) with Timothy Dalton.
