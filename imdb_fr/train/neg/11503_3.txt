Quentin Crisp once said that when things are too beautiful, you are romantic. When things are unbearably dark, they are realistic. And when something gets ironic treatment, they are on the spot. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa, he falls into the second category. This director has obviously tried too much to make a Spanish film of the type "Ken Loach", without being able to capture the comedy, nor the heat between the characters, who raise the film of Loach of simply "depressing". Los Lunes al Sol, it's just that, depressing. Things are unrealistic. The ultimate moments of misery of the characters all reach the same climax and, if the dark history is not enough, Aranoa washes the story with a visually gray and filthy color palette. The movies were ridiculously overrated to the Goyas. A film that shows empathy for the weakest citizens in society, the unemployed at the ports, is not automatically a good film, even though I would be the first to sympathize with the fate of these people. This film only manages to make me grow selfless by their fate. In the 21st century, unemployed people in Spain do not live like beggars, and public transport bins have decent toilets. It is difficult to find a bar with so few guests and so little happiness. Leon de Aranoa obviously has no idea of ​​the Spanish working class and does not favor it. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene where men watch a football match for free was directly copied from a film that deals much more "realistically" with the subject of the trap of "poverty", namely "Purely Belter", which is by far more engaging, humorous, yet sad.
