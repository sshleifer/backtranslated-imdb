Honestly, I had high expectations when I started watching this movie, but it turned out that it was probably one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First, the pace is incredibly slow. This seems so much longer than it is (and it's not short). I am sure that when Jane Austen wrote the book, she made several pages of it, filled it with description and she does not intend to read. one day, or it may slip and lose its appeal, which "Emma" certainly did. Now, "Sense and Sensibility" had this slow pace defect, but at least he had sharp lines to catch up with it, as well as good performance! <br /> <br /> That brings me to fault # 2, which is of course, the acting game. Although I do not really care about anyone involved in this film, I'm sure they can do a good job, but I have not seen much in this movie. It was as if people were trying too hard to be spiritual, too hard to be "upper class", too hard to be British (well, some of them), so they all ended up as actors and not like people. . <br /> <br /> # 3. As I said, the actors only seemed to be actors and not really the ones they were playing. Maybe that's a good thing, because the people they played with were not very nice. Why did everyone like Emma, ​​for example? Of course, she was kind to the rich and handsome people in front of them, but she was a terrible gossip behind their backs. If her friends were "ugly", she did not even bother to go behind their backs. So, why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, "just to make her laugh?" Of course, the snob could not even do it right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow and her "Emma" has not exactly changed her mind. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I do not care about this one. I'm sure it's a charming book and everything, but some books are really not made for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
