I had two reasons to watch this braggart when it was broadcast yesterday on Danish television. First, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I was not disappointed. She was beautiful. Second, by reading information about the film, I had the impression that it presented an absurd humor that was very similar to that found in Philippe de Broca's films. On this account, I was unfortunately disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (apart from some witty remarks on the theme of the war) and the characters completely one-dimensional. In addition, the action scenes were made in a strangely mechanical and uninspired manner, without any dramatic sense. I kept looking until the end, but I got bored very quickly and sat there waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida.
