The jungle fever is too highly stylized, stereotyped and appears to be essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Although there is a lot of talent in this film, it is mostly wasted because his pieces are no more than decorative cameos. Moreover, instead of just showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing he is, Spike Lee has chosen to brandish it as a flag in the most groaning and irritating way possible. I went through most of the film, but I could not finish everything, and it rarely happens to me.
