Anyone who has seen Tammuz's Child Eaters knows that it's a director who can do better. Hope this is not a case of too many hands in the pot (Telefilm anyone?) And it was a case of second feature film. The characters are one-dimensional and overused. The landscape is beautiful and showcases the Pacific Northwest. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is excellent. Shot almost entirely outdoors, the images are crisp and beautiful. You can almost feel the wind blowing through the leaves. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie is as healthy as it comes, it just misses a heart.
