I know people and I did animation and graphics and the show is horrible! They are rich little kids who have no talent and have probably begged Nick to accept them! Alex plays the drums for a year, I played 4 1/2! The film is terrible and the show too! It's the craziest comedy ever, which is even the funniest I've ever seen. It's so stupid that it makes me want to laugh! It's so crazy that Nickelodeon would ever accept something like that and so stupid! They are so stupid and weird! I hate them and their show and think once Nick realizes how stupid it is to remove him with hope!
