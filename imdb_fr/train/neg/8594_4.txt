At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) tells Neil (Cillian Murphy) why she is constantly on the hunt for an adventure. She said "because I'm phobic". This means that she can not really go on with her life by doing certain mandatory activities. Well, I think his reason and the progress of this movie are very ironic. Because "Watch the detectives" is a nuisance of joy. <br /> <br /> Do some of these characters really make something exciting for once? Neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental store. He and his other geek friends usually frequent the store and watch movies together while debating their discussion. But Neil's life is completely gone when Violet enters her store. It's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. Anyway, after a few dates, they decide to see each other. The problem is that Violet is a person who continues to prank Neil and can not really do anything normal, while Neil is completely opposed to his. The question is. Will they be in love in the end? You bet. <br /> <br /> "Watch the detectives" is a clich√© of romantic comedy. And they aggravated the situation by claiming to be something else. From the first moments, we know that Neil is a rather laid-back guy who has not really engaged. And then, Violet enters the scene, looks all strange and boring. So, at this point, we all know that we are going to face all meaningless situations to find out how they will end up. Is it worth the wait? I would say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they tried to give something more to the public. "Watch the detectives" tries to talk about commitment. Observe how much people are looking for something they want. We knew at the end that the foolish things that Violet did are all the test that Neil is willing to do to win his heart (or something else). Well, I think it's completely bullshit. This film will end quickly enough if Neil said "Forget it, this girl is an idiot!" After collaborating recently with many great directors ("Sunshine" and "28 Days Later" by Danny Boyle, "The wind that shakes barley" Ken Loach and "Breakfast on Pluto" Neil Jordan, Cillian is a a rather odd choice, Murphy is making a film with one of Broken Lizard's comedians, Paul Soter, of course he's not bad (as usual), but such a talented actor should not waste his time in the like Lucy Liu is terribly awful like Violet, her game is a mess, I mean it's everywhere and so above all, Tony Montana would have been proud. <br /> < The last, but not least, mistake this movie was made is a completely irrelevant title, you just can not really connect a point between the plot and its title, and you'll end up thinking that In short, "Watch the detectives" is nice if you forget a film that could be e picked up on cable TV so quickly that you could not imagine yourself. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday Rating: 1.5 / 4
