I never thought that Yashraj's movie standard would be so bad! The film has an insane scenario that does not attract interest. <br /> <br /> Saif played. Kareena has improved her figure, but is still not a good actress. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. Can I say that the role was not good? <br /> <br /> There is still a good amount of cheap tickets. I was wondering if this should be the "comic part" of the movie. Is not it because the latest movies have failed that Yashraj's films should do that kind of mess? He has a story of so many good movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie.
