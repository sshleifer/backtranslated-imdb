As long as there was 3D technology (in the 1950s, I think), there was an animation made for that. I remember in particular a caricature of Donald Duck with Chip and Dale. I do not remember his name at the moment, but the plot was that Donald was working in a circus, feeding elephant peanuts and Chip and Dale were stealing peanuts. This was done to look in 3D probably from the 1960s. If you happened to watch Meet the Robinsons in 3D in movie theaters, they showed this drawing before the movie and explained the details of its origin. There are probably a hundred cartoons specially designed to be viewed through 3D glasses. This claim was a bad decision because it was not difficult to prove them wrong. On top of that, it looks like a bad movie.
