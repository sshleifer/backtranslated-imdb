There are so many things that are wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> For starters, the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed in five or even ten minutes. The film in general is (hopefully) already running, but it could have been compensated by paying a little more attention to the Wicked Lion (how did ignorance refer to "The Wiz"?) And working his subplot a little closer in the main plot. In short, the script had the basics of a good idea, but needed a bit of rework. <br /> <br /> Secondly, he could have done without rough humor. The original also contained elements that could have been missing, but at least that was almost an afterthought. Here, flatulence and urination abound. <br /> <br /> Third, the show is a little too self-conscious. The original series had enough, just like the first film, but here is a lot, much too much. The jokes in Brendan Fraser were just a little exaggerated (and why no mention of the "new Ursula"?). Other gags with the narrator, especially some late-comings, also go beyond common sense. <br /> <br /> Fourthly, a little more attention could have been given to the work of the CGI. In the first case, it was hard to say that Shemp was not a real elephant (except by his behavior, of course), but here the CGI stands out like a sore thumb. Ideally, the special effects should simply tell the story, whether good or bad, and at least they succeed on it. So it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. <br /> <br /> All this being said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is pretty decent. He misses Brendan Fraser's charm, but Christopher really fails in this comparison - he even managed to give George some personal depth, which should have been a major mistake in a film inspired by Jay Ward, but which does not was not there. Julie Benz as new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original. <br /> <br /> Most other performances were rather classic, not seeming good or bad.
