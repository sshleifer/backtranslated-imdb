This game has the (de) honor of being the first game I stopped playing in the middle and I had the impression to break into pieces and burn. Congratulations. FIRST AND LAST Tomb Raider I'll never play, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Intrigue: Just typing this word made me laugh. There are not any. There is also no development of character. We finally have a heroin girl who can take care of herself, who is not a mary-sue * who bips *, but unfortunately she dresses like a bitch and her chest is huge. They had to attract the sexist gamers you see. Anyway, all she does is go to the graves one after the other. Why she does that, I have no idea. I had subtitles and the TV as loud as I could and I still did not understand anything. The development (or lack of) for her, her two friends, and the wicked * were laughable. There will also be levels that you will have to cross that will not give you any indication of what you need to do next and you will literally be in most boring tombs as hell for HOURS trying to figure out what you are. supposed to do. There is a course (on two) especially with her on a motorcycle (believe me, it's not at all fun) and you'll be on for an hour with no save point in sight. This means that you are hit by the other motorist and pickup trucks that shoot you or hit a tree, you start the hike one hour. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: You know, let's get the levels very low Long, basically have no save points, have no story, no character development, do not give any variety in the game, have most of the music on the longest levels that are bleeding, and give no hint to the player so that he can stay even longer in one place instead of arriving at the non-existent plot. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: These sound like great ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs the development of the character, the plot or the game? <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry, sir, but these ideas seem to please the player. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Shut up Todd. You are fired. <br /> <br /> Game: she's just shooting. Of course, she can rock during shooting, jump shooting, or kick shooting again. But topple, jump and kick does not erase the fact that she is only shooting. BORING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: The intro music is extremely beautiful. I like listening to him. The music in the game goes from tolerable to want to cut your ears. <br /> <br /> Visuals: This game was created in 2006, I expected that the visuals overturn me. Well, I was blown away, but definitely. not in a good way. <br /> <br /> In summary: This game is a plot without intrigue, no character development disorder with a young woman dressed in unmarysuish (THANK YOU) to the head that crosses boring tombs for some boring reason (this that it could be I could not tell you) with unimaginative shooting gameplay. STAY AWAY FROM THIS B.S. !!!!!!!! There are two stars to have a woman who is not a damsel in distress (even if she is barely dressed) and beautiful in music.
