Let me first say that I like watching "bad" movies. It's funny how some of these films leave a more lasting impression than the really great ones. This film is bad in a disturbing way. This vehicle of Sam Mraovich's delusional ego is not limited to incompetence without talent, it has redefined the very meaning of words. This should always be the barometer of bad movies. Sort of the Mendoza line for the movie. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs, and stars Arthur Sailes, fighting the despised wives and evil Christian forces, while he and his partner Ben are "dead behind the eyes." The leaves fight for the equality of the spouses. As a libertarian, I believe that homosexuals should have the right to marry. Ben and Arthur do more harm to this cause than an army of homophobes. The representation of all Christian things is so ugly and hallmarked, the Mraovich trademark, that you absolutely can not take any seriously. Arthur's brother, Victor, the Bible annoying Jesus, is so horribly overwhelmed by evil / effeminate gaiety that you must ask yourself how he was chosen to play that role. That's because Sam "multitasking" Mraovich was also casting director. The worst is Sam Mraovich himself. When do you think that the main men speak pasty, bald and chubby words? Sam also provides lines like domino pizza, cold and generally fake. The final count: you are bad at writing, directing, playing and playing. This is the quadruple crown of Ed Wood. Congratulations, little horrible man.
