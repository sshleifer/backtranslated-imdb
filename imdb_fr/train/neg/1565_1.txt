The film uses a leading title for a lame story. Kill Kill would have been nice. The film incorporates taboo scenes to bring the viewer back to his chairs. The scenes are useless and agitated. The film is something a novice screenwriter could have imagined. Just a waste of movie props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this film when it is not worth 10 lines of my time, but I must insist that people know how to avoid absurdities. If people are counting on you to choose a good film for a movie night, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not damage it by subjecting yourself to this filth.
