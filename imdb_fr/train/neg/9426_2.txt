After the opening credits, there remains a black screen for about a minute. A minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower.Then she and two friends from school drive to a rock concert. After a lot of padding, they hit something and skidded on the road. They wake up in a cabin inhabited by an old lady in a wheelchair and her offspring. The murders are sadly very docile for a supposed Nasty video. The twist ending stupid and predictable. No one involved in the mess would ever do anything note again. So, there are still happy ends sometimes. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sara Ansley becomes topless, and Laurel Munson has full forehead on display <br /> <br /> My rating: D
