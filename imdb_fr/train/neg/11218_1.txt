This film is not worth the film on which it was photographed. The dialogue is flat, full of overused lines of clich√©s and delivered by amateur actors who sound like they're reading a screenplay for the first time. The unstable and fragile film style is an inexpensive imitation of the visual effects of the "The Ring" style. The characters do not even act like a normal person. For example, the character who searches for her twin sister at home wends her way through the front door, crawling around the house all scared and sobbing and she does not even call her sister's name once to find out if She is at her place. What? You might think she just buried her sister instead of looking for her. Far too many flashbacks about his childhood. Too many unnecessary flashbacks are the typical sign of an amateur director. It's really fun to see the many shots of the woman driving her car on the street, in the driveway, around the corner, here, over there, oh, side view, now seen from the front. Already enough. You would think you are watching a TV commercial for Solaris! Terrible film. 0 out of 100. I really pity those who have spent money making this movie or watching it.
