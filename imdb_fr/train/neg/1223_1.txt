What a weekend. Two days ago, I watched the first half of "War Games 2: Dead Code", now "While she was away". I'm trying to make a decision that was worse in terms of mental pain when I was watching. I guess "as long as she was out" was worse. <br /> <br /> Everything has already been said in other comments: unrealistic, illogical, etc. - the only thing I really have to add is that at one point started to feel more for the bad guys than for the woman because I would have recommended her for a Darwin award if she died (she was only looking at only the first half, so I do not know). Soon, I was at Darwin's two awards (if it's even possible) for his immense stupidity. <br /> <br /> And hey: Produced by Kim Basinger? So she did not only know the scenario but was also responsible for bringing us this waste of money, us people? I consider the human beings who waste huge sums of money are mean, because this money could have been used to feed and clothe a lot of people instead of hurting 80% of those who saw it at the cinema and giving 20% , who are idiots, possibility to show how stupid they are.
