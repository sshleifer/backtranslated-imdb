I can not imagine anyone in a million years wanting to see this movie. Not because it was one of the worst ever (but it was not), but mostly because he is about 20 years old and he is out of the ordinary. I was trying to find out where I had already seen an actor and that's what happened. So, yes, a child stops playing in the little league because he does not like nuclear weapons, which attracts the attention of the media and allows a quick resolution of the cold war. The end. A fantasy, certainly, but so crazy that it would make John Lennon blush. Since terrorism has replaced communism as a fearful religion, this film has no real relevance, other than an (innocent) look at these times. Writing, acting and the film trade are also poorly developed. The reason why I qualified him the same way is that I watched this film about 50 times at the age of 5 or 6 and still have a little place in my heart for that but I realize now that it does not cut quite mustard. So, if the law of big numbers is true and someone finally decides to watch this film, know that there are much better ways to spend your time, but also much worse. (I will abstain from a John Q. tirade for now.)
