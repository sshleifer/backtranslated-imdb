I can not believe this movie was allowed. These people should be drugged and hit with blunt objects. They should be tortured. This film is an abomination. It's nothing but the footage of the first film. Everything that is original is weird and makes no sense. It's like a kind of hallucination linked to drugs. As with nude pose therapy on a mirror. Moreover, no matter what the moron assembled, this shit did not even bother to watch the first movie, as they continued to call the character of Suzanna Love, Natalie, when it was Lacey. I wanted to shout that on the screen, "IT'S LACEY, IT'S LACEY !!!!". I give him a -50 out of 10. MY GOD !!!!
