This 1974 Naschy release is directed by Leon Klimovsky. A quick glance at the photos and promotional packaging might make you think this medieval adventure is between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> It's a strictly PG affair with tamed torture sequences, no nudity and little benefit. Naschy (of which I am a fan) struts like Gilles de Lancre, "antiguo Mariscal of the nation". Unfortunately, he is more ugly pantomime than anything else. We feel with this film that we have already seen (and all) done before. Strictly so for complete Naschy is only.
