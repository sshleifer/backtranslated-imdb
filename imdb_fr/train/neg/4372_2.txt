I LOVE Don Knotts, let me just say that right away! He is a huge talent and the best in what he does, representing a nervous, adorable and confused loser, thrown into a position of authority. He is fabulous in his role as reluctant astronaut Roy Fleming, but the film is rather boring, even though, as a child, my brother and I enjoyed watching this movie and its other films. It's always worth watching, but it's really a movie that kids will enjoy more. I would say it's 100% family and you can watch with your kids at a family party. <br /> <br /> As in all Knotts movies, there is a superb cast of beloved characters The actors and you can not help but smile when Knotts emits one of his shaky looks and speechless, no matter your age and your coat of arms <br /> <br /> From the perspective of adults, I think there is one thing to do: The capture of NASA in the 1960s is remarkable: all new modern buildings, hope, the optimism, the future! And I was surprised how sweet and studious Leslie Neilsen was at the time. The only criticism we have about this story is Roy's love interest, a rather worn-out and incomparable woman who can not give him the time when he gets a big shot - if you're like me, you hope he'll give it a boost in the end. Be careful, you'll whistle the theme song several days after watching, it's also catchy.
