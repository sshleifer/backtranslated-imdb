It's a mediocre and poorly made remake of the classic Parineeta de Bimalda. The story is based on the book of the same name Sarat Chandra and it is a distortion of the original. Well, we can appreciate a certain degree of creativity but not a fake creativity. Everyone's game is affected and the entire movie is a simulacrum. The choice of words by Shekar's father by abusing Lolita (Balan) seems cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scene where Shekhar (Saif) slaps Lolita is out of place with the flow of the movie and characters, is quite shocking to the senses and could easily be avoided. Similarly, the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite inappropriate in the film and a cheap gadget to attract the public. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its spirit, the work collapses. The song "piyu bole" is quite correct. The scene where Saif defends himself and rebels against his father is another source of money in the black cloud of this film. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves a credit. On these points, this film deserves 3 stars. The song and the dance of Rekha feel the artifice and it is a bet. The song is melodious but I remember having heard it somewhere before and if I'm not mistaken, the melody seems to have been plagiarized. <br /> <br /> Well, agreed times have changed since then to now. But then, this movie does not even reflect modern times. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when modern Bollywood filmmakers are increasingly obsessed with NRI printing and the conquest of the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such films do not end up belonging to India or any other part of the world.
