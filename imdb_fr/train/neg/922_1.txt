This film is exactly what you get when you really stretch on your abilities, it's like someone who has just passed his driver's license and then rides it in a Formula 1 Grand Prix (not to add, the Grand Prix of the United States, as everyone could get out because of dark tires and you could win), that's how this movie falls. Now, do not take it badly, I like B-Movies, about half of my collection is B-Movies but I do not think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe the seriousness of this movie. <Br /> <br /> The first part of the story (for a B-Movie) is not so bad, it has the potential to make a mark of B-Movie, did not talk about the potential of Friday 13 but its potential is none the less. But what really lets this film fall is the acting game, I do not believe at all in the slightest, it's like watching QVC except that QVC presenters tend to have a tan more intense . <br /> <br /> In summary, I would like to say that I have seen worse movies, but I can not.
