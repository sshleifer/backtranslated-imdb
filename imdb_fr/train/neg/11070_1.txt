It was really a bad movie. The character "Cole" played by Michael Moriarty was the main reason for this failure. The actor felt that invoking an incredibly awkward southern pull would make this character even more evil, but it was not. After about 20 minutes, I would have liked a speech therapist to appear, which would have added a certain sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) misbehaved - 2) unpleasant characters - 3) mine-razor line <br /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
