This film was shot in parks in Saskatchewan and Manitoba and once again made the world look at what is left of "Wild Western Canada". When Archie started writing his stories for newspapers; the idea of ​​the day was to tame the wilderness and to convert / absorb First Nations peoples. <br /> <br /> The film moves forward and asks the question; why would a well-educated, visibly talented Englishman become an Indian? <br /> <br /> Archie, as an English boy dreams of becoming something but grasping all the meaning of this dream is unique and priceless - no matter what it is. It sounds like a famous puppetry story, no. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I saw Archie become my living image of the "Indian cigar shop", a very wooden character and not at all real - very well done acting on behalf of Mr. Brosnan. He also represented the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist. Fullness and reality were not realized until he met and married his wife Annie. <br /> <br /> Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the English world scene, not himself but Gray Owl - a Canadian from the wilderness frontier. <br /> <br /> It's the closest Archie to become the prototype of the noble savage. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of Mr. Brosnan and the directors is both well done. I've been watching Gray Owl documentaries and I think it's a good big-screen movie to add to my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoiler - I thought the final scenes with Archie were going to meet the Grand Council of Chiefs were a great time in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful landscapes of Canadian lakes and real places of "Gray Owl". <br /> <br />
