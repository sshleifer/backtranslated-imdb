Not the best movies to watch nowadays. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and I expected it to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and the environment were good, but there was no story here. Not a single moment of fright. I was expecting a horror thriller, but there was no horror, no thriller. The only scene that scared me was during the chapter change scene with "Wednesday". There are many fragments in the film. Most things are left unexplained with nothing to tie it to anything. The story does not tell us about the women or the other scenes presented. It could be a good movie to watch in the 80s, but not for the 21st century.
