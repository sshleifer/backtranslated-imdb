Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically a smart movie. The actors are really good and the technical side of the film is fine. But even if the subject interested me a lot and I liked to think about religion (I am atheist), it was difficult to force me to watch the film with a bitter end and, in my opinion, a little funny. Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I do not know. That's right and so it's not advisable.
