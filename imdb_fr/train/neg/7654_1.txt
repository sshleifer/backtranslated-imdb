I remember reading all the horrible reviews for this movie when it came out. I wanted to see how horrible it was, but in three weeks everything was out of theaters. The only other movie to handle is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie was released on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it was. I could not think of the awful attention that this film received was possible. After seeing it, I can understand. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that this movie is not without nice clich√©s. At first, there is a beautiful picture showing that a bullet was fired from inside the gun, which, in my opinion, was great. And the way the monsters of this movie die is pretty cool to watch; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If playing badly was a sin, hell would have thrown Tara Reid right away, because she's incredibly horrible in this movie, it's unthinkable. And of all the roles, she plays the role of curator. Now, if she were playing a stupid, empty-headed sex toy, I might be able to forgive her how she treated her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll did not understand that even though he seemed to believe that if she removed her shirt from the movie, people would see her. He just did not realize that making him do that in the middle of the movie at the wrong time made the movie even more hilarious. And is it a Mexican song or something during the dry hump scene? I could not say. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the worst staging skills you'll ever see in a movie. I mean, I'd give an F to House of the Dead (and I would only do it for very few movies) but HotD would score at least a B on that mess. The film begins with a very, very long narrative that causes immediate confusion (and read by a horrible narrator) and from there, the cuts are really, really stupid. There is a moment when Slater and Reid look around a building that has been destroyed and the screen darkens. When he comes back, Slater and Reid shoot everywhere and suddenly, an entire army has joined them. Huh? <br /> <br /> And no one has bothered to check the mistakes of this movie. At some point, a team breaks the glass, but the glass breaks before touching it. Tara Reid's earrings change color in the middle of a scene and when Slater walks away from a dead comrade, you can see her start to get up. <br /> <br /> As far as history goes, I was really lost. Something in an old tribe liberating darkness and someone "leading the way" or something like that and all the evil monsters are popping up. It's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes (technology is so advanced here that no character should ever reload in this movie) that just get BORING. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie hoping to laugh how stupid it was. I did not laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very very very stupid.
