This film is easily the worst of the series. Although New Line may be limited to sales, they all know that the only reason it has yielded more money than the previous one was due to its end 3D. It was not that the 3-D was good either, because it was the 3D of the 50s with red and blue lenses (anaglyph). It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like. Beyond, this movie was so bad! Wrong scenario, bad characters, bad acting, worse staging. This film tries to push the camp factor almost to the point of resembling an episode of "Looney Tunes". <br /> <br /> Seriously, not for horror audiences, because it's nerdy and not scary, and not funny or fun for comedy crowds. A total mess with some very bad cameos who are still trying to play everything the camp does and be well below what they probably wanted. <br /> <br /> I remember most of us who had been fans of this series was praying for it to end at this point because of the seriousness of the situation. It's one of the movies that brought out the horror of popularity and that the public really wanted to laugh with a stupid comedy rather than see a good horror movie.
