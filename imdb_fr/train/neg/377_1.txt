Do not even ask me why I watched this! The only excuse I can find is that I was sick of bronchitis and too weak to change channels. :) It's too terrible for the words, the movie that is, not the bronchitis. The acting is deplorable, Richard Grieco considers him as a serial gun trigger and gunshot, with a penchant for defeating the cops. Nick Mancuso phones in a performance as a cop on his track and Nancy Allen manages to play the only sympathy role in the entire film. The scenario is bleak, dotted with clich√©s: "Are you ready, Pardner?" Richard Grieco purrs at each of his victims. Terrible. To avoid.
