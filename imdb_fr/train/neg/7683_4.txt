"The Cobweb" is an example of many examples of films that show strong performances, sometimes remarkable, but which are unfortunately broken and slowed drastically by a dark conspiracy and of little interest to the public. It stars Richard Widmark as a doctor working in a psychiatric facility whose life is falling into turmoil because of family problems and a rather ridiculous and overworked conflict that does not really seem serious at all . <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous. . It is time for the institution to bring new curtains for the windows of the library. An old woman wants her curtains on, but many patients want to make their own. And in one way or another, this ridiculous and unintentionally insane conflict erupts to the point that lives are in danger and families begin to fall apart. This is more like a conflict that would occur between very young children. <br /> <br /> The questioning of the logic of the plot and the possibility that it happens is so huge that one wonders if a real madman could buy it. Do not get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with playing. The cast that follows Widmark is made up of other major players, many of whom are nominated for winners and winners. And there is sometimes a moment in the film that works brilliantly, but it still excludes the stupid plot on the window curtains. Unfortunately, there are too many things on doggone curtains and so the movie slows down. Most takes are long and made from the point of view of the camera, respecting the slow pace and lack of interest in viewing. <br /> <br /> In a brief analysis, "The Cobweb" is an unrecognized movie and it becomes obvious. why, for the viewers, as soon as the plot is in focus, which is done quite quickly. It does not seem like much fun to watch and I tell you it's not very fun to watch.
