The stranger Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives in the workshop of the collector of antique scammers Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is the brother of Jack. Jamie does not buy his story, dominates Jack and ties him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack offers 100,000 US dollars each to protect him during a negotiation of the "Spanish Judges" antiques with a rich and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who accompanies his belated girlfriend who believes to be from Mars, to compose the rescue team. However, Jack doubles the collector and then intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece. <br /> <br /> The low-budget film "Spanish Judges" is a reasonably-priced film with an appalling conclusion that is wasting a good cast. Valeria Golino is incredibly beautiful but, with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, they are not able to save this stupid story. Moreover, the scenes supposed to be funny do not work unfortunately, and in reality they are silly and not funny. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All for money")
