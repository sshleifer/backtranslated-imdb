"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon, and a year later he came out of the jungle ... naked, it took him 45 years to get back." Supposedly "Keep the river to your right" is "a modern cannibal tale". In fact, anyone looking for a glimpse of cannibalism will unfortunately be disappointed. The first half of the film is more like a New Ginuea travel journal, praising mainly Aboriginal art. The second half is based on photographs of the Peruvian cannibal tribe, but that's all. Unless, of course, you are interested in movies from a Jewish wedding, or by Schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers. I'm giving up. Big disappointment and not really "a modern cannibal tale". - MERK
