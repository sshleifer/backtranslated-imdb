The only redeeming qualities of this film are the rather original death scenes. Apart from that, this movie is a big DUD. We have Kim Basinger, the besieged housewife slowly snaking into the local mall for the first 30 minutes. of the film, which adds nothing. Then the film regains some strength as it faces 4 punks who took 2 parking spaces on this busy Christmas Eve. They begin to prosecute her after abducting the local security guard who tried to help her. From there, the film worsens, much worse. I know it's just a movie and you have to follow the flow, but it's about 5 minutes. Good start and she can not hide or find someone to help her. Instead, she goes to a semi-built subdivision next to a forest. Typically, she does everything in her power to allow her followers to follow her easily. But now she is turning into a difficult mofu. You get the point. Never buy or rent this movie, no matter how much you like this guy. It's so illogical that you interrogate every scene. It's embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the cast, as well as the consumers.
