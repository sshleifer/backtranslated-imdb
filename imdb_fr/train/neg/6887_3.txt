Another movie "son who is not going to grow up", and just the other recent entries. Heder in another bad wig, channeling Napoleon for what, for the third time? Anna Faris is forgettable, as always; Jeff Daniels telephoned him from at least one other state; and Diane Keaton ... how come you become a typographer so late in a career? Do not disturb. Nothing is said here that has not been covered many times. I will say this; it's about a hundred times better than "Failure To Launch". There is very little fun in the movie, unless you think Eli Wallach's curse is funny. Ha, Ha! He is old and he dropped the bomb f! Tee, hee, hee. Pitiful!
