Okay, just by reading the title, you'd think it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did it. It started well but became so boring after the first half hour. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a mother who so desperately wants her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will do everything in her power to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's girlfriend is the embarrassing girl. She always wins the competitions, pushing the mother to "eliminate" her. After talking to a "typing man", the mother decides that the girl should be brutalized a bit. So actions are taken but she ends up getting caught. <br /> <br /> The casting is horrible and the film drags on for too long without anything happening. Do not waste your time looking at this. <br /> <br />
