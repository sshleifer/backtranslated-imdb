Yet another insult and slap to homosexual men. This lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend. Once again, we have an attractive "heterosexual" hero who, supposedly, can not interest any woman. Yes indeed! And we are also presented with the "friendly, attractive" gay friend who is actually a tall, bald and ugly old man that lead is supposed to find attractive. Even I did not find it attractive and I am a big and ugly old gay man (but luckily I'm not bald)! No matter how talented he is, he has been cast on a bad story and a really horrible direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from the movies, but he does not differ from the countless other hackers working at Hollyweed.
