Obviously, I did not care so much about Things to come (aka "The Shape of Things to Come") that most viewers. This means there is a good chance you will enjoy it more than me. Anyway, you may find it helpful to hear the film from another point of view. <br /> <br /> Directed by William Cameron Menzies, who had so much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director, It's a film adaptation of HG Wells from his own novel of the same name. To me, this helps to show why a great novelist does not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter. <br /> <br /> The film begins in 1940 in "Everytown", a London style. The war is getting ready and the citizens of Everytown are afraid that it will reach them. That done. And that turns into a multi-decade affair that basically destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies continue to advance in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath. We see two pilots, one broken down, facing the consequences of their fights. We meet a post-apocalyptic community led by a so-called warlord. We meet a man from a futuristic society in full swing. We see how technology is evolving. And finally, we went to the full realization of this futuristic society around 2036, where leaders discuss the benefits of sending a man to the moon. <br /> <br /> This may seem potentially very exciting, but just does not work like a movie. Structurally, the film is much too episodic and does not allow to link it dramatically. In the third segment, I completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters. I had barely been able to solve them in the first two segments. There is a constant stream of new faces. We will not learn anything from them. <br /> <br /> This does not help that individual segments, with few exceptions, tend to be misdirected and edited. They are also sometimes manipulative - one can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film. But perhaps in a contradictory way, the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally. <br /> <br /> In fact, a superimposed section is more like an industrial video / video promotional video. If we see plans for the construction of the futuristic city, with a lot of big machines, a lot of welding, etc. At one point, a guy who looks like an astronaut goes to the camera through some sort of futuristic glass. The music in this section falls somewhere between excessive and militaristic horror. I can not say that Things to Come is engaging material in dramatic terms. <br /> <br /> But the common cry for Things to Come is that it's a "film about ideas". It may be true, but there are some problems if you look at it that way. First, it still does not work like a movie, that is, as a visual and sound drama, and secondly, there are too many ideas presented here. <br /> <br /> The main idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations. It's a good thing to make a movie. It is also remarkably presumptuous from the Second World War, since things to come were scripted and filmed in 1935 (published in 1936). Wells has some interesting things to say about the war, some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film. For example, the end seems to suggest that another war breaks out or will occur at any time. The overall message seems a little pessimistic. Wells seems to show that war is simply a part of human nature that can not be eliminated, although it does not exclude "progress" - in fact, it may fuel progress, at least indirectly. <br /> <br /> That would certainly be enough for a movie. However, there are many more ideas here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the most poignant scenes of the film. This is a complex dilemma. One pilot shot down the other, but now comes to help him. But the pilot who was shot was carrying toxic gas that is now spreading across the field. They can not both breathe the gas without damage. A girl is coming They only have two functional gas masks between them. The pilot who was shot offers his mask because he is saying that he is dying anyway. What to do? It's not that this scene itself can be lengthened, but the ideas - the weird complex of helping each other and getting hurt in the middle of the war - are enough to build a movie. <Br /> <br /> Another example. In scenes depicting the so-called warlord, in the post-apocalyptic environment, there is a wicked contagious disease called "wandering disease". He turns the victims into something like drunken zombies. The usual procedure is to shoot the victims on the site to try to ward off the disease. This material is treated as if it were an afterthought. It's a good idea and deserves his own movie. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas. That was enough for his own film too. It's simply impossible to effectively manage so much in 100 minutes, especially when it's supposed to be the movie's knot instead of a dramatic attraction. <br /> <br /> There are, however, reasons to give things to come unless you have a visualization. If you're a sci-fi buff, it's a film of historical significance. Given the experience of Menzies, the production and sets are interesting, although the cinematography seems extremely dated. It is also interesting to see how Wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his "predictions". I particularly appreciated the means of propulsion towards the moon, which strongly recalled George Méliès' 1902 voyage on his journey to the moon. Do not expect too much to come.
