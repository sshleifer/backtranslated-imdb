The animation seems to have been done in 30 seconds and looks more like caricatures than characters. I've been a fan of Scooby Doo since the creation of the series in 1969. I did not think much about Scooby Doo animated movies (I'm talking about the TV series, not full movies.), But some of them were rather cool, and most people have found Scrappy Doo irritating, but this series is pure waste. As soon as I saw the animation and heard the characters (and I use this term vaguely), I started shaking. In addition, Mystery Inc. was a team and, without the entire team complimenting itself, it just seems to open a box of chocolates to find someone who has already eaten the best, and there are only those who no one do not want. What's up Scooby Doo was better than that. If you have a TV show on Scooby Doo, include the elements that made the series so long. All the characters and a quality animation. They need to put it back under the rock from which it comes.
