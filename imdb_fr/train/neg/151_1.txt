It's really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only reductive feature of this film is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever seen, I will have a proper answer. <br /> <br /> I think it's filmed on 35 mm, so it's already sticky like hell. I would not have bothered to comment but I noticed that some fanboys (probably related to the movie) had claimed that it was the best movie since Matrix. Let me demystify myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good in the film. All shouts ugly. The actress is ugly. The combat choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The fight scenes are incredibly amateurish. Imagine a girl waving her arms in a circle, helpless, and emitting weak kicks that would not hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director has just released the people from the street to give them roles in the film. <br /> <br /> I know that the director did not have much budget for the film but that better films had already been made with a lower budget. Unforgivable.
