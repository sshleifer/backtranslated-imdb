Whoo-boy, it was certainly one of the worst movies I've seen all summer. True, it was on Sci Fi, and I do not look much Sci Fi, but man, talk about an extremely thin plot and characters to two dimensions at most. <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped and exaggerated, the plot and the scenery were incredible, the vampires were less intimidating, more funny, the gore was not necessary, the special effects were horrible, and the end ? Well, the only thing unpredictable about the end was when suddenly the tomboy became a lesbian and started doing it with the female vampire, which, by the way, is not really that hot given the time that it takes about three seconds. you are closer to "What is hell?" then "man, it's hot." If this ever appears in reruns, God forbid, DO NOT WATCH IT.
