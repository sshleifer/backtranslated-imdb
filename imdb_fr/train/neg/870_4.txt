Towards the end of this thriller, Ally Sheedy's meager image of the last days is used creatively to create more than one terribly bad image. She is convinced that if a bad role like Bette Davis happened to her, she could wear it brilliantly. Unfortunately, I do not find many other reasons to see this. If you're wondering what Sheedy looks like in an old-fashioned pair of glasses (but why should someone do it?), Here's your answer. For the rest, the crazy woman hungry for sex by Sally Kirkland is really tiring, and even if you like this kind of thing more than me, you will have to admit that the tension decreases during these scenes. The drunk savage insurance agent brute is also unpleasant, but at least it's a small part. Among the main actors, Nicholas Walker inspires no sympathy for the fate of Paul Keller and his game is wooden. Dara Tomanovich is better and during her scenes with Sheedy, the level goes up a bit. Sheedy's meticulous and discreet performance (although she often seems to be on autopilot) is admirable in itself but out of context with the others. The sets are dull, the work of the camera is not distinguished.
