There is no more, I can say that say that this film was awful. All finesse is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was difficult to sell. But to tell the public that all Chinese people know the history of China without even studying it is laughable. It's like saying that all Americans know American history without studying all Filipinos, etc., etc. This is not credible. <br /> <br /> The story is hideous. Shin belonged to a monastery in China - later identifying him in Bejing. However, the first footage of the film shows that the map focuses on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to claim regions like Mongolia. But it's a separate nation and even "Mongolia" on the map. Did Disney studios fail in 5th year of geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial at best, yet she feels connected to him. His training is as old-fashioned. And, let's get straight to the point: everything about this movie is bad. It's serious enough to laugh and cry. The taekwondo action was over and unrealistic in many cases. <br /> <br /> The bad eyes thing was lame. However, the end left out would have been the only thing going downhill about it. They should have let the bad eyes end there. But instead, the evil is defeated. Yey! <br /> <br /> Overall, not worth the dog's time in the movie. Brenda Song should get along with another studio.
