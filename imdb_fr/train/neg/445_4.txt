What surprised me in this film (and not in a good way) is that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to boast of being the main historian of the Rosenstrasse theme, was one of the historians working on this movie, seen a lot of the actual events have been changed or ignored. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said that Von Trotta had said that he never wanted Lena to go to Goebbels, but in that case, why did she give the impression that this was what had happened? past? Why not show other possible reasons for the liberation of men, such as the Stalingrad disaster or the fear of the Nazis that the international press, based in Berlin, knows the event? <br /> <br />, why did the entire story play a role in the history of a weak family that has been repeated? Something as impressive as it could bear his own story! In places, it was as if the film had two scenarios that seemed to have little in common. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film failed in its objective, which was to draw attention to a little-known act. resistance, which is a shame, because better done, it could have had a major impact.
