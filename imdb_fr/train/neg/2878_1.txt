Do not see this movie. Bad acting and stupid gore effects. A complete loss of time. I was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and sexy girls. Instead, the director relied on animal slaughter videos to shock you, the observer. Repugnant. The murders are pretty lame, basically a strangulation. A woman that he stuffs worms in his mouth, another that he puts raw hamburgers on his face and strangles him. BTK = BTK chicken meat, new sandwich "killer" burger king ... ha ha. I do not think this film relies too much on real facts. I mean, he's a real killer of BTK who did not wear a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms. And oh yes ... a slaughtered cow's head too. Go understand.
