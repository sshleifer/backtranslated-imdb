1. Extraterrestrials look like stuffed animals and puppets while having arms that do not work. <br /> <br /> 2. The extraterrestrials have mastered intergalactic space travel, but they do not know how to open an unlocked safe door, but can push a door closed by five people. <br /> 3. Former security guards know how to get their hands on C4 and are waiting for the right time to use it, for example, when they are suddenly fired for no explicit reason. <br /> <br /> 4. Apparently, the training camp of the US Army, in the 80s, included several sessions of "fighting chisel", including the spin of death. <br /> <br /> 5. To impress your prude girlfriend, you must "save the world ... uh ... from the neighborhood" of the extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are sluts, openly or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. Disgusted nightclubs look like bad customers. <br /> <br /> 8. Waitresses "puffs" perform the duties of dancers for the Fontanelles (how were they admitted?) Who can only do bad dances of the 60s. <br /> <br /> 9. Army soldiers secretly dream of being Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. The grenades apparently have a setting for "flash-bang". <br /> <br /> 11. Being burned alive leaves only minor burns to the arm. <br /> <br /> 12. It seems that US Army Chiefs of Staff are still in the region and are not doing anything against the aliens in the region. <br /> <br /> 13.

Apparently, garden tools emit electronic keyboard noises for every use, not just in combat (tell me I'm not the only one to notice it). <br /> <br /> The truth is that this movie is bad. Period. There is not a lot of meat on the bone, and it does not do anything really well. Even average. It's just bad. However, I've seen a lot worse, and the rake fight scene is pure gilded comedy, intentional or not. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Jaws 4 was worse than that. At least the film has never been taken seriously.
