The murders in this movie is not that bad, but that's for sure. It's even worse than that. This is not even worth the wear and tear it could cause when you drag it into your DVD drive. <br /> <br /> Not even the wear and tear that it causes on your shoulders when you transport it from the DVD store, not to mention money. and the time you spend renting and watching. Horrible. <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand how anyone could say anything positive about this movie. It was just one of my masochistic tendencies that kept me from not stopping to watch, not to mention the pressure of my co-observers on the band. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is awful, the staging is even worse and the acting is absolutely abominable. <br /> <br /> I hope you do not see this as a spoiled pleasure, I would prefer to see it as a just warning: Do not waste your time looking at this garbage!
