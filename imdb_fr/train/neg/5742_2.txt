When I borrowed this movie from a friend (thankfully, I did not buy it), the package (which looked really bad and ugly) was printed "The ultimate horror of the vampire". After looking at it, I thought the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie itself. "The story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is pursued by vampire / zombie creatures. <br /> <br /> The lighting, the sound and everything make me think of my first attempt to make a vacation video over ten years VHS system otherwise worse. I gave the film a 2 out of 10 and only because the promotional t-shirts looked pretty cool. I do not want to talk about film students or splash movies in general, but I saw Braindead and I saw a student film with a budget of $ 20 that was ten times better than that shit.
