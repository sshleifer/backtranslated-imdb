This film is really bad. He plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s / 80s and places it in a school context. I'm not saying that urban crime was not a problem for many people or that schools were not / are not problem areas, but this vile room of exploitation takes the biscuit. Violence goes beyond anything realistically imagined, but in this case it is not a social problem, but a white student of the upper middle class is using it to transform itself into cornerstone of the crime of his high school. And of course, he knows how to play the system. Does this sound familiar to you? Yes. This shit is pure violent exploitation, a really nasty job. It is a disturbing brutality disguised as a social commentary. This belongs to the same category as waste like Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on. The only thing remarkable is that Michael Fox was so bankrupt at the time that he had to do things like that.
