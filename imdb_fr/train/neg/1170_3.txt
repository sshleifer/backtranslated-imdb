As a fan of Eric Rohmer's studies on contemporary gender warfare, I was very eager to see "The Lady and the Duke (The Englishman and the Duke)" to find out how he would treat men and women during a real war, the French Revolution. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful, each scene being conceived as a period painting, like a living painting. And I was expecting a lot of talk, as is Rohmer's style. But maybe Rohmer was retained in basing the screenplay on the writings of a real woman, so that was mostly like a documentary version of the movie "The Scarlet Pimpernel". A certain recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled children? I kept humming: "Marat, we are poor / and the poor are poor;" you can also choose an air of "Les Miz". <br /> <br /> I was not so sympathetic, because the central figure has to go back and forth between his hometown and his manor to stay ahead of the Revolution. . At one point, his maid claims that the pantry is stripped but manages to prepare a refined meal. I simply did not understand it, an English sympathizer who, in turn, rejects and defends her former lover and protector as he and the Revolution continue to change their political orientation; I think I was supposed to sympathize with his consistency more than his political machinations, like a character from "The Scarlet Pimpernel". Hey, the only reason she did not go home was her shame after an affair and her childhood with the Prince of Wales or someone else. <br /> <br /> Usually, in a revolutionary period, the relationship between men and women is changing, but I have not seen it here. Once, I attended a lecture on Herbert Marcuse that ended with a long question period; The last question, asked by a much older audience member than the other acolytes, the devil, she had gray hair, was "Why are the revolutionaries so sinister?" She was booed and Marcuse did not deign to answer it seriously - but that's the only thing I can remember from the whole evening. Rohmer demonstrates that the counterrevolutionaries are as dark and didactic. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 8/11/2002)
