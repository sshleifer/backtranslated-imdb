In summary, too long and filled with more subplots than Swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-writer says he wants to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two mixes mix like vinegar and oil. In addition, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. In addition, the film is not really realistic. Freedoms are taken vis-Ã -vis the legal system in terms of the engagement of French citizens against their will and the apparent ease of escaping with drugs in French hospitals. At home, I watched this movie on my big screen TV and I found myself screaming after the movie. Finally, towards the end, I quickly transmitted the last final speech that one of the main characters made to the son of his ex-lover. At that moment, the confused and absurd conspiracy was exhausting me: it was a dead lover, a marriage of convenience and a nutty ex-lover. Sometimes the plot is diverted to the families of the two main characters and then returns to one of them - Ismael or primarily Nora. At the expense of the public, the views are constantly changing Nora and Ismael, his ex-girlfriend confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films here, none of which are well developed. The epilogue does not really pack a lot of subplots and seems to want the viewer to believe that Nora will find his happiness, although, given his actual situation, the chances are equivalent to those of a snowball in hell . The actors do their best and are attractive, but that is not enough to overcome all the glaring flaws of bad writing, bad editing and lack of concentration.
