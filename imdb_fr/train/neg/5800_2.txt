As a fan of horror movies, I try to watch all the important news of this genre, especially those from my home cinema. And I can say that the "power of fear" (or "Vedma" as its Russian title) is one of the weakest films among them. First, it is not scary, even for a small child, it takes steps so slowly and so predictably that there is no room for real horror. Frankly, it's bad in every respect: a crazy plot (I do not know why the Russian producers / directors have decided to turn the classic story of Ukrainian witchcraft into a lame and ridiculous thriller of modern America. Agree with the previous comment - it does not flinch a bit) and the work of the actors terrible and corny. All the actors, including the main Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova who are quite famous in Russia, look like wooden dolls or something and it seems to me that they did not even bother to play at all. they spoke only their English lines without any expression. And in the end, I do not really understand why they filmed this film in English with Russian actors? I think it was their bad ride. At least they could engage some American or English actors in the lead roles to make them more compelling. The same thing I can say about the so-called "small US cities" that have been shot in Estonia and look like them. The only positive moment I found in the "Power of Fear" is visual effects. They are not excellent but rather good for Russian film. And the music is fine, at least it does not irritate me. That's why I give him two stars. All in all, if you want to see a good horror movie? Do not waste your time and money on this boring movie. And if you are looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror, I would advise you to find a copy of "Viy or the Spirit of Evil". It's really the fantasy film based on the same novel as "Power of Fear" but much, much better.
