I watched it in the tube last night. The actor involved first caught my attention. The first scenes attracted attention. Some funny, some sad. Good character development. I felt that the last third of the film had diverged. If it was not at the beginning of the movie, I would have stopped watching. I kept looking, wanting to know how he was related. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that this has never happened. I did not particularly like the extended period during which several characters spoke Yiddish (?). Was it the other shoe? <br /> <br /> Would I recommend it? No, I do not think so. Like other commentators mention a lot of the slang is dated (60 years old), but it was not too embarrassing. The end totally cut me off.
