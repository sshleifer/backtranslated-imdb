The premise, although not altogether ridiculous, was definitely ridiculous. What should have happened in the second meeting with Tritter was that Tritter simply had to be wasted. House hires a guy and demystifies Tritter. In real life, Tritter would have been harassed, the episode of the rectal thermometer would have been exposed in court, providing a motive and an opportunity, and hospital lawyers would have made it from Tritter and his department. He would be in jail as would any House harassing accomplice, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson and Cuddy. The lawsuit would have earned House a tasty settlement, enough to keep him supplied with Vicadin until old age. While Tritter was driving somewhere in a taxi, he was trying to rehabilitate himself by doing people good for two years, before people realized they had seen everything before.
