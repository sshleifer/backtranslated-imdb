A film so insecure about the safety of the creators hoped perhaps to use an original title of the black film, "Farewell My Lovely", thinking that the credulous would take it for a remake. The characters are so nauseating and unattractive that he deserved his cold welcome on the first outing. Time only adds to his absurdity. Having nothing of the cunning, cinematography, despair or despair of the classic black, he relied instead on a complicated and senseless criminal plot that would have easily resulted in several arrests in a few hours. As if that were not enough, he launched a totally sexless erotic attempt in which at least one of the participants had not bothered to bathe for several days. This only made this mess all the more painful to watch. Find a good classic black film of the forties or fifties instead of losing two hours to this failure.
