I see people writing about the quality of the film. It was horrible! The acting game was at best below normal. That brought in a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the film 7 times in theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to know more about the Titanic; why did it flow, what went through the minds of many people? maybe even a little plot. Does anyone realize that some people did not even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it took off? No, you do not see it because all you see is a rich girl who falls in love with a poor boy and he paints her naked (does that unwanted junk tell you at least that the movie was stupid? ?). <br /> <br /> I cried during a scene, however. The scene when they showed the water filling up in the ship. It looked like pool water! I think this movie made all this money and they could not even give a real appearance to the ocean water? incredible ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh, the band played while the ship was sinking .. just ridiculous. It was the worst film until Pearl Harbor won in the "Nothing to do with reality" department.
