A bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, my ... this is one of the movies, which does not even have a positive effect. Everything, actors in the story, stinks in the sky. I'm just wondering how low I.Q. You should watch this kind of movie and even enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Is there anything that is worth watching? Well, there is a lot of nudity, but it's nothing special. And when you think it could not get worse, you realize all the naked ladies looked like they were forty. Come on guys, where did you look for these actresses. In a retirement home, maybe. <br /> <br /> Anyway, leading actresses have some sex appeal and know how to show it. Once again, pity she's too skinny and old. Overall, ignore them. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
