A worn-out plot of a man who raps for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn out plot of an inside outsider who is finally ruled out. <br /> <br /> With such a remarkable result In this case, one would think that the film would exceed its rejected origins. But scene after scene, the drones undergo no change of intensity, no arc of character and no inexplicable behavior. <br /> <br /> The theme of homosexuality is totally useless - or on the contrary, totally unexplored. It seemed to be included only to move the viewers. When will Hollywood learn that having homosexual characters does not automatically create a more convincing image? <br /> <br /> A deplorable film. When will Lauren Bacall choose a good one? I was expecting better from her and from Kristin Scott Thomas. This one is not to be missed.
