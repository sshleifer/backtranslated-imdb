I shudder again at the idea of ​​NEVER seeing this movie again. <br /> <br /> I saw action movies. I even liked some of them, but this one is doing too much. <br /> <br /> Not only the worst male actor of all time (Sly Stallone) plays the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not steal the money while the plane is on the ground, to be much easier) that it needs a person having an IQ inferior to its smallest number to believe it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot does not really have twists, a child of three can guess what will follow. It's a set of clichés (kind of action), where Sly plays even worse than his other movies (he was even better in Rambo III if you watch this movie as a comedy rather than an action movie) . Now there is an actor who can not play A) surprised B) sad C) something other than his basic face. <br /> <br /> I would nevertheless like to point out that this film presents two factors that could please some people. The EXPLOSIONS are exceptional, but then ... you will see better on July 4th. The LANDSCAPES are beautiful, but then ... there are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see better landscapes in this way, rather than wasting your time on this film. <br /> <br /> Go watch another movie, there are hundreds, even thousands of best action movies.
