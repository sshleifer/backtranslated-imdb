There are not enough gay-themed movies and there are not enough movies to come out. Each is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production values ​​are high (the film looks good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks really good in a pair of jeans), it's a bad one. This is a period piece: gay life under an oppressive regime (East Berlin, 1989), a life that seems to be 40 years behind the west. In a way, we see our own story; what it could have been for gays in the '40s and' 50s here (it often reminded me of 'Last Exit to Brooklyn: the book, not the movie'). Ingmar Bergman. It is so badly edited that I wonder if the director did not do it at random. Yes, it is a miracle that this film was filmed and broadcast before the fall of The Wall and that the life behind the "curtain" was difficult for homosexuals. A good director could have shown all this without surprising the audience. A good director would have made me mark this one as one of the big films to come and not one of the failures.
