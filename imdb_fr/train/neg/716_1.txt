This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen. There is absolutely no scenario, the gags are only delays and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching. Throughout the movie, Fredi (oh my god, what a funny name, Ha ha) does not ask once how he went from flying to Middle Earth. There are a lot of stupid and totally funny characters whose names should sound funny. for example. Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I did not even smile once during the whole movie. The gags seem to have been made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's coat is stuck in the door (this happens about 5 times), then this movie may be for you. Another fun scene: they try to guess the code word for a closed door (do not ask why - never ask "why" in this movie) and the code word is (ha ha): dung. So, if you laughed at these examples, you might like this movie. For all others: Go to Youtube and watch "Lord of the Weed": it's a lot more fun.
