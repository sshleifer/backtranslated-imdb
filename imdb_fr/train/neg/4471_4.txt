The best I can say about this movie is that it was slightly fun at times and that it was a good time slayer. Unfortunately, this movie is so annoying that I wanted to slap those characters. It's the kind of movie that's so sweet, it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, but things get terribly boring when the dialogue is so nauseating. When the two tracks are not together on the screen, it does not matter at all, but be afraid during these frequent moments when the loving couple starts to talk to each other.
