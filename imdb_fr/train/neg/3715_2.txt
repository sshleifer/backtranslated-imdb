Black guy gets rich white guy, and this rich white boy seems to embrace hip-hop culture, and most of the "funny" moments of this movie unfold in this mood. The problem I have is that it does not work and almost never works. <br /> <br /> OK, no one expects Lance to take such a body and suddenly begins to behave like Charles Wellington. That would be too much to ask. I will grant that. But at the same time, it goes too far in the other direction. I'm supposed to imagine a rich white man singing rap and upset, playing as if he were a bastion of hip-hop culture, and that people just accepted it? And what about Sontee, who falls in love with him * as a rich White *, even if she does not care about his money or his power? It's so amazing that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> I simply could not suspend my disbelief and I could not finish the movie. I added an extra star because it made me laugh, even loud, a few times. But I just could not get over the thing of the "white guy doing hip hop" that has never been done so well in any film I've seen and who's trying it. It was not an exception.
