I was raised in a "very Christian" family since birth. I was saved before seeing this film and the rest of the series and watching it in a group of young people from my church. This film was very disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares for years. I used to stay awake in bed and listen to my mother's footsteps upstairs. If I did not hear her, I would go up the stairs to make sure she had not been removed. Every night I prayed so hard for salvation because I was terrified that Jesus was forgetting me. This is certainly not something I will show my children until they are much older, if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this film gave me.
