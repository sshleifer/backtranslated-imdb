A tramp gives a secret military a clue to a secret service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president. Nonsense. How did the buttocks know? The script then goes to a very detailed review of the operation of the secret services, but it does not matter. Most of this simply slows down the film. All the following lawsuits are the version of this film of tedious car chases of many movies. Then, after a lot of impossible athletics in which our hero overtakes and surpasses all his friends, we have a shootout at Toronto City Hall. Canadians are clearly identified by maple leaves, but how did they get there? Finally, everything is settled. But that still does not make sense.
