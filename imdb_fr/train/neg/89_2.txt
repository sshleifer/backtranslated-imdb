I saw the four films in this series. Everyone is moving away from more and more books. It's the worst yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book, it is titled after in no way! The directors and producers should have given it a name other than "Love's Abiding Joy". The only thing about this movie that looks like the remote book are the names of some characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names / ages / gender of the children are wrong. The complete story is nowhere in the book. <br /> <br /> I have a hard time serving Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is absolutely not correct. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family film, it's possible. It's clean. Do not look at it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope it will be the last film in this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies, I would like Michael Landon, Jr and others to get closer to the plot and the original story. The books are excellent and, if followed closely, they would make great movies!
