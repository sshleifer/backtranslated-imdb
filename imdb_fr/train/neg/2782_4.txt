I just saw the movie last weekend, I'm upset and disappointed. Basically, the film tells you that immigrants, especially those from the former Soviet Union, arrive in this country, take with them all they can from the old country, invade and take back what the Americans working. Which is a very bad way to see immigration and a much worse way to talk to people. It's essential. Another thing, the writing, the realization and the shooting are at the level of the amateurs of village. The actors did a good job, but it was not up to them to save that shit. Some jokes were funny, but most were bad and old-fashioned. I could not wait to get out of the theater, I want to get my money back.
