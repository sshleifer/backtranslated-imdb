Let's get straight to the point: this movie is softcore porn for the general public under a name that the studio draws from its weight of the American Pie pacifier. Period. <br /> <br /> The whole plot (and that does not mean there is still much to be done) serves as a vehicle to show the public more breasts and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you're a Tween guy and you're too smart to buy real porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise, the film does not have much to offer. <br /> <br /> The acting is mediocre, the development of the character is virtually nonexistent, and history is a silly idiot of nudity and excessive alcohol consumption. and pranks (none of them are particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> Go buy real porn if that's what you want to see, and if not, go watch a good movie. Animal House, Kids or even American Pie original are all excellent cinematographic works, which contain a high consumption of alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "It's not the quantity, but how you use it"
