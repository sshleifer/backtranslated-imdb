I had never read Gary Paulsen's novel, Hatchet, for which "A Cry in the Wild" is the adaptation of, so I can not make any comparison with the book. However, I will say that as a film, adaptation or non-adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters. <br /> <br /> Think of "A scream in nature" "As a less luxurious adolescent climber (Quincy, California, was he the only place he was filmed?) version of" Cast Away " . Jared Rushton is Brian Roebson, 13, a child driven on a small plane to visit his father, until the craft crashes over a deserted mountainous terrain, leaving him stuck for a while. moment and having to defend himself. <Br/> <br /> The film consists essentially of three parts. The obvious is the introduction of ten or fifteen minutes characters, namely Brian and his mother. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film (which actually consumes almost the entire film) is Brian "the hard way". These scenes contain no particularly amazing action, nothing more spectacular than many beautiful cinematographic images of a beautiful Yukon landscape. Nothing that can put you on the alert, no real encounters (except a sudden confrontation with a teddy bear), nor major dilemmas to initiate a kind of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen. You could even get bored briefly over time as we see Brian deal with his situation in ways that are primitive at first, then more sophisticated (using tools, etc.) for his survival. It's more like the ordinary time that happens if you're stuck in the situation, and that's about it. In other words, they do not care about Paulsen's words when they translate them into visual media. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the third part of the movie is his rescue. <br /> <br /> There is however a sub-plot that continually seeks to be known during this time. A conflict between Brian and his parents that created a difficult and awkward relationship between them. However, in most cases, this is only explained in brief, intermittent and minimal dialog rewinds, which are more like a background story for a video clip. In a few moments, the Jefferson Starship singer should start singing "Sara". In addition to what the viewer can draw from the implications, or guess at his own need to fill in the gaps in the story, we get a very underdeveloped story that was probably needed to take advantage of at least part of this movie and create a link with the movie. characters, whether or not it has anything to do with Brian's survival adventure in the third part of the movie. It's the flaws of the narrative that, through the viewer, has become stupid as he struggles to find out what these people are doing on the screen and, for me, almost finished up to the point of shouting on TV to say whatever thing and tell me more! <br /> <br /> It certainly was not, for me, a good adventure tale. But, for Jared Rushton fans, it was one of the last movies he made. So, watch it purely for nostalgia, if nothing else.
