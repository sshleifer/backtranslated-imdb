I think the scarecrows are scary, so it's a shame that this movie does not do more. <br /> <br /> A group of burglars perform an emergency parachute from a plane to a huge field with scarecrows. One of them disappears with the booty and the others chase him while he is attacked by inexplicably evil scarecrows. The game is martial and scarecrows unimpressive (when they move). On the plus side, the director finds a bit of suspense in the static scarecrows. As Alfred Hitchcock says, "A bomb explodes under a table, it's a surprise, we know the bomb is under the table, but not when it's fired, it's suspense."
