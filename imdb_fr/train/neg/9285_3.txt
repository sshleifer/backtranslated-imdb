Considering that I wanted to take a new movie on Jet Li and see some brainless and brainless fights, I grabbed this title. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie contains even more gunfights (ala Chow Yun Fat) but far from being as good), as the acrobatic fights of Jet Li and the company. So, it was disappointing. <br /> <br /> The fight against the taps was interesting and even fun, considering that it was something totally unexpected in a Jet Li movie for me, closer to the case Jackie Chan. <Br /> <br /> But alas, I would recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master, or even Enforcer for this disappointment. <br /> <br /> Note 4 for martial arts Note 3 for the score of the film
