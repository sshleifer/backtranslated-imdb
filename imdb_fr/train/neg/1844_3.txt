Personally, I think this show looks pretty cheap. Some actors are terrible. They do it and seem wrong. I can always say how that will end in the first 10 minutes or less of viewing, because they make it very clear. It's not very well written either. I love watching him to laugh. You know the saying "It's so bad that's good?" Well, this saying applies to this show. I also like to look to see if I'm right when I guess everything is going to end. So far, I have been right every time. It's like a little game I play. It's good when you're bored and you want to laugh at something.
