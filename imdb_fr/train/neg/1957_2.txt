I enjoyed this movie most of the time, but I still felt like watching a children's movie. Honestly, I think someone wrote a screenplay and then, during the shoot, decided to add blood, nudity and language. it was a big disappointment. there is what the magic of the children who exists in films like "baby" (the pig) or "angels in the outside field" that defeats the fairy of the devilish teeth believe. the parents end up believing that their daughter is able to see the ghost and use this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. when I bought this movie, I thought it would be a B-movie response to the terrible darkness that is falling; somehow manage to make a better movie with 1/4 of the money, but they do not do it. they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost at nightfall.
