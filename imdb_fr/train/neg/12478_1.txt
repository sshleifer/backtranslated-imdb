I had to give this movie a 1 because it was so bad, but do not make me believe that I do not like to watch, because I laugh and laugh, and I even had some questions. So, half the time, I laughed, half the time, I thought "what's going on?" or "why would anyone do that?" etc. I especially enjoyed the horrendous fog effects, the nude / combat / dialogue / nude scene in the 80's fashion and the way the warrior's swords beat in the wind as they ride. And there are some shitty model effects (these are not supposed to be real trees, are they?) And I still do not understand that guy they find in the cave, that 'is it? A friend of mine told me about these movies and I thought I'd try them. Basically, I liked the film like people like Ed Wood, I have no real pleasure in what the film should be, I look at it. in my hilarious way. So do not let this distract you if you really thought it was an action movie, that's right, I just loved it for other reasons. It's a lot, much worse than Evil Dead, so it can make you think as if you were wasting your life looking at it (which came to mind many times). I guess the best thing for most people would be to drink a few drinks, meet friends and laugh about this movie. It may be a little hard, but I do not think so, praise it and you will see. Yo.
