When this film was released in 1997, the "special effects" as they were were mediocre. They would have been dated even for the 1980s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s had a job identical or better than SFX. Admittedly, no one in the production of this film was looking for an Oscar. This is a wild departure from the usual stuff of director Fred Olen Ray, most of whom have the word "Bikini" in the title (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls from Lost Planet, etc.) and are little more than T & A movies, but here we are with a film rated "U" and aimed squarely at children. You must recognize the merit of its diversification! It was a minor cult film made live on video, which then resulted in some sequels - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career collapsed after 1982 "ET") plays the "Invisible Mother" of the movie title and returns for the future .. Russ Tamblyn (whose career has been in freefall since even longer since 1961 " "West Side Story") plays the evil Dr. Woorter. It's probably fair to say that most of the actors were at some point in their careers where they would be willing to work on almost anything to pay the bills this month - except maybe the young Trenton Knight as Josh he is rather revealing that, although he worked before this film, this child actor did not work after the sequel "Invisible Mom 2". Maybe the movie was cursed. After all, he was not so bad at For a child actor, he's pretty good - neither better nor worse than his more experienced co-stars. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, the effects of "invisibility" are at least nauseating, the staging is mediocre, the writing obvious and the acting nothing about which to write to the House. However, this film will undoubtedly be viewable for all children under ten years old. Most adults will probably want to make an act of disappearing on their side as long as it is running, and I will not blame them at all!
