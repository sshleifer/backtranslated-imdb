Have you ever heard that people "telegraph their intentions?" Well, in this movie, the actions of the characters do more than telegraph their future projects: they come to you drunk and make you a headache. This could be forgiven if the set had been better used or if the characters were more charismatic or more nuanced. The character of Embeth Davidtz is not mysterious, he is just wood, and Kenneth Branagh can not convey the brazen charm that his character was probably written to have. <br /> <br /> The essentials: a conspiracy, performances of a note, incomparable characters and "southern" grotesque accents used by British actors.
