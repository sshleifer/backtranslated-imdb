"SherryBaby" is a pretty painful and sordid melodrama taking place in Jersey. The story of a young mother who has been released from prison following a drug conviction. regain the love of her child daughter who is cared for by her brother's family. The only reason the film should be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well in the role and carries the entire film on her shoulders. This is not enough, however, because the scenario is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional focus is on the wrong place - I was constantly wondering if I was supposed to be sorry for the ex-addict and maybe for the future. as the director and the scriptwriter wanted, or about the innocent kid in the middle. Even the actor Maggie Gyllenhaal could not convince me that I should not worry about the child anymore.
