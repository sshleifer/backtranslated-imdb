speaking only as a movie, I did not really like it. not because there was no FX or because we only had one booth as a scenario for the whole movie, it's actually what made me look. <br /> <br /> I did not like it because the acting was dark, his "friends" are all happy and then they are crazy, but you do not know why; then they take separate roles, one is the believer, the other is the antagonist, but they never really make the point! Also, the lighting was horrible and I'm just mentioning technical problems. <br /> <br /> In a few words, I think the movie could have had a "ok, I'm out of here!" of certain characters. like the lady who does not want to hear her version of the Bible. <br /> <br /> about history itself, everyone is free to write what he wants and history is proof of his good writing and imagination. I credit the author of the book for that, so my 4/10. <br /> <br /> So, at the end, listen to the man's story, believe it or not, but do not spend all your time acting as you think him and be shocked by what he says, and at the same time move and make jokes as if you do not believe him. <br /> <br /> Consistency. <br /> <br /> thank you for reading;)
