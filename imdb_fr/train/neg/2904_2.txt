The configuration is so predictable that it spoils the movie, even if the rest of the movie was good (which is not the case). <br /> <br /> There is almost no chemistry between the main roles, and the stalker Steve Carell's behavior is embarrassing, not funny. It is hard to believe that the character of Binoche would be interested in him. In the end, everything is so beautiful and everyone lives happy forever. Is not this great America!
