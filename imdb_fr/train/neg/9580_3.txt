The former pack player and his handsome boy, Rob Lowe, play the lead role in a film taking place in a high security US jail. I had a presentiment that his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons, like Tobias in the first OZ series, but PROXIMITY is not that kind of movie, it's more like a "Man on the Elbow" movie like THE FUGITIVE . It's also a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn as a spokesperson for a victims' lobby group, but any intelligent discussion of how society should deal with criminals is completely ignored, the film degenerating into old shots of shootings and car chases
