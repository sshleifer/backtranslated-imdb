I had just watched an episode of this program and I could not even get to the end of the program. Every minute I watched this program and my IQ had to lose about 10 points. This is basically like a children's program but with curses. Even the cursing and insults she told other people made me laugh. Anyway, the story must have been written by a monkey and the people who put the script of this show to film must have been stopped in the spotlight and had no choice but to to film this delayed, disappointing and horribly played show. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she has really earned through this program and have some bogus lessons.
