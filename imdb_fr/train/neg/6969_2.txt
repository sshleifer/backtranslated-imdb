Blue Monkey (1987) or "Invasion of the BodySuckers", as it is called here in the UK, was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man being stung in a greenhouse by a mysterious poisonous plant !! !! The man is transported to the hospital, where this worm as a creature comes out of his mouth, of course, this turns into this insect monster and starts to break loose !! Despite the fact that Steve Railsback and John Vernon are in the film, I found it boring, with a flat and predictable scenario, uninteresting characters, cheap special effects and a lack of action! Horror fans do not really need to follow this rare movie, you will not miss a lot of confidence in me !!! I give this movie 2/10.
