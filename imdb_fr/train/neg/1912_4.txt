There is nothing new here. All the classic romantic comedy scenes, including the taxi that goes to the airport to prevent the woman from flying. The only thing that saves that is the action game of Alison Eastwood and some minor characters (Gabrielle Anwar who bluffs, who will visibly amuse you.) In happiness, and you will not have to go through the inevitable conspiracy pain.
