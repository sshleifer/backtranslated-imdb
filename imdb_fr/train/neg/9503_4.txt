Also known in a different form as "House of Exorcism", this messy little movie takes itself so seriously that it kills any entertainment value <br /> <br /> whatsoever. <br /> <The reservation concerns the European tourist Elke Sommer who has <br /> <br /> a chance to end up with Telly Savalas, who looks like the devil she <br /> <br /> saw on a fresco of the square. Sommer goes to a mysterious house in the country, where Savalas happens to be <br /> <br /> butler. There, she is mistaken for a dead woman and the real serial drama begins. The husband of the blind matriarch <br /> <br /> had an affair with the dead woman, who was the fianc√©e of the matriarch's son. The couple who summoned Sommer? <br /> <br /> Well, the woman gives the driver driving lessons in the back <br /> <br />, and the husband knows and does not care. . Finally, <br /> <br /> most of the actors are killed, Sommer drugged and raped, <br /> <br /> escapes, and the viewer is taken to his climax aboard a > <An airplane ... that must look like empty theaters in which this thing is <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The other version of this "House of Exorcism" contains scenes </ br> <br /> added involving a priest. <br /> <br /> The VHS copy of this one, from Elite Entertainment, is crystal clear and <br /> <br /> in mailbox. There are "extras" after the end credits; <br /> <br /> deleted sex and gore scenes. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mario Bava is fast and furious, but his scenario is awful <br /> <br />. There are half-cooked ideas, abandoned intrigues and <br /> stunning conveniences that only propel this thing <br /> <br /> one way or the other. You have life like dummies for funerals, the blind matriarch does not act blindly, <br /> <br /> and Savalas gets the same lollipops he had in "Kojak" (which <br /> <br /> haunts you, baby?). <br /> <br /> The project seems to have two name stars, then wrote the script <br /> <br /> quickly, something happening in Hollywood daily <br /> <br /> now. Savalas looks completely lost, delivering her lines hesitantly, and wishing her character did not die in "The Dirty <br /> <br />". Summer short, scream and pant a lot, but <br /> <br /> his character is a white, I use the term "character" vaguely. The only thing we know about her is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a really strange movie, and your reaction to this movie might depend on how <br /> <br /> you are in Eurohorror and Kojak. For my part, <br /> <br /> can not recommend "Lisa and the devil". <br /> <br /> This has not been evaluated, and includes all the extras at the end of the HSV <br /> <br /> copy, contains high physical violence, sexual violence, strong > <br /> bloody, strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content and adult situations <br /> <br />
