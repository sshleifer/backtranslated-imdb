This is a complete hoax ... <br /> <br /> The film was clearly shot in the state of Rajasthan, northwestern India. Look at the hunting scene - the vehicles are Indian; the writing is in Hindi - language used in India. The journey is through typical streets of Jaipur. Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The DVD Bonus filmmakers in the DVD Bonus movie seem to give the impression that they risked their lives by turning in Kabul and the surrounding area. Almost all their action scenes have been shot in India. The scene where they see a band singing around the fire is so wrong that they did not even think of changing it to an Afganian folk song. They have just recorded the folk song of Rajasthan. How can I know because I have traveled a lot in this region? They are about to move things forward. I challenge filmmakers to deny it.
