"Suzanne's Second Coming" is another of these surrealist films that tries to sound extremely sophisticated, but it just puts the viewer to sleep. As in other films of this type, the dialogue is limited. Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot. However, cinematography stinks, there is nothing to hold your attention. <br /> <br /> The video box indicates that this film is "one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen in a movie." Yes of course. It's up to watching events as stimulating as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking a mile and a half. 1/10
