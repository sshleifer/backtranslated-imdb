How can I start seeing a film that will soon be recognized as the "worst film of all time" by the "worst director of all time"? A film that could develop a cult because it's "so bad that it's good?" <br /> <br /> An analytical approach criticizing the film seems both useless and part of the band's syndrome. wagon - let's hit without fear of retaliation because all human beings on earth do it, and people who love the movie love it for the flaws we would have mentioned. <br /> <br /> The mediocre universal quality of the film goes without saying ... 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' is not without competition for the title of the worst film, it must therefore be very low to acquire the title and keep it, but I think this movie could go a long way. IMDb does not allow enough words to cite all the movie's failures, and it's much easier to locate the items than "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" produces. Unfortunately, these moments of glory are so far buried in the shadow of the poverty of this film and it is a task that does not deserve to be continued. <br /> <br /> My impressions? I thought I knew what I was getting into, I was advised to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one (I wish this suggestion was vodka cups). Despite my low expectations, "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" failed to entertain me, even at the level of "making fun of the bad movie". Not just bad, but odiously bad, as if Jobson was deliberately trying to make this movie a poetic yawn, but was becoming excessive and pushing poetry into our throat without making it deep, but entertaining. .. and supposedly Jobson has sincerely tried to make a good movie? Even after watching the promotional literature "Sixteen Years of Alcohol", I can not believe the sincerity of Jobson. Unnecessary and unpleasant until the end with a few moments of grimace / laugh (all the same, I'm not at all intentional) spiced up the film, and these few elements prevented me from closing the DVD. So bad is it good? No, there was just enough of "I can not believe it's a serious movie" to stop me from turning it off, and nothing more. <br /> <br /> Decidedly, a movie to watch with a group of bad-movie lovers. Get your own comment in progress. This would have greatly improved the experience for me. So bad, it's Mike Myers who comments in his Scottish cod accent as he turns, turning all that mud into a comic farce "Okay, man, man, pass me, annihilate wiskey dat gliss" .
