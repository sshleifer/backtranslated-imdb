It's one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Not just the story, but the acting is terribly bad. The dialogue sounds like someone reading the news. <br /> <br /> It's considered a comedy / drama / novel, it's not one of those things! It's a bit of action, that's it. There is really no comedy and drama at all. <br /> <br /> If you went to the movies to see that, I'm sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Almost everything you choose to watch will be better. It's pretty much an action / crime movie. The activity scenes were nil, and the crime story was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you're not really interested in a good story or good acting. And you just want to watch a "foreign" film to attract foreigners. So that could be for you.
