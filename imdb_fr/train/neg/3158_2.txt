It was really the worst movie I have ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely horrible through the whole movie, the hair is so bad! They speak like monotonous voices and there is no chemistry. The cover of the DVD does not even get close to what the movie is actually. Really, really boring. I had to advance quickly in some scenes because it was so painful to watch. I really want to know how we can think it's good? hahaha, they literally like to talk and say "yes" and there is no passion. I could not say at all that they were in love. I'm sorry but it was the saddest excuse for a movie I think I've ever seen.
