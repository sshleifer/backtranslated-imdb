*** Contains Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I found it surprisingly boring and rather superficial, regardless of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: since we must finally die, how should we approach life? In a "light" way, like Tomas; in a "heavy" way like Tereza; or should we find ways to not deal with this issue, like Sabina? How important is loyalty in a relationship? What part of professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? How much do we need to be involved in the political life and social problems of our country? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I have not read Kundera's novel, but after being dropped by the film, I will definitely: I want to understand if the story was ruined by the adaptation of movie (which I imagine) or if it was dull from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I do not share the favorable opinion of most of the positive comments that define the movie masterpiece. I just do not see the reasons why. What I see are a lot of flaws and a sample of them follows. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are launched and it is very difficult to understand what motivates them in their choices. <br /> <br /> 2) The "secondary" characters are there to fill the gaps, but they add nothing to the story and one wonders if they are really necessary. <br /> <br /> 3) I do not like how Tomas was imitated. Nothing is good for him. He is so egocentric and selfish. He is not human, in a sense. But when his self-confidence failed and he realized he depended on others and was emotionally related to someone, I did not find the interpretation credible. <br /> <br /> 4) It is highly unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a Communist country in 1968. In addition, the three main characters all have great success in their professions respective, which seems strange to me. a) how can Tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer? (b) how can they do so well in a country without all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed? 5) The false accents of the English spoken by the actors are laughable. And I'm not even the mother tongue. In addition, the letter that Sabina receives in the United States is written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments praised the film saying that Prague was beautifully rendered: I guess most of the film was shot on the spot, so it's not hard to to give the film a sense of Eastern Europe, and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague, it is not even difficult to give it a beautiful appearance. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the end sort of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far from the temptations of the "metropolis", far from the social struggles that live their fellow citizens, detached from their professional life, die in a car accident. But they die after realizing that they are happy, indeed. So what? If they had died unhappy, would the movie's message have been different? I do not think so. I viewed this as a cheap trick to please the public. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing in the film that is unbearably light is the way the director portrays the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you have nothing left. You do not feel empathy, you do not understand them, you stay in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated the "stop music in the restaurant" scene (which some reviews have praised a lot). Why did Sabina have such a reaction? Why does Franz agree with her? I really do not see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has a very bad character and a strong personality. That's all. What is so special and unique about it? <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, let me underline the fact that there are two scenes that I liked very much (which is why I gave him two). <br /> <br /> "The nude women's photoshoot", where the envy, jealousy and insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are admirably presented. <br /> <br /> The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza's photos, taken to inform the world of what is happening in Prague, are used to identify the people who took part in the riots. I found it quite original and Tereza's feeling of hopelessness and guilt is well described. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a tiny possibility that the film was intentionally "designed" so that "the types of Tomas" disappear love and "those of Tereza" will hate it. If this is the case (I strongly doubt it), then my comment should be reviewed in depth.
