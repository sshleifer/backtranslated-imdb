'A Smile LIke Yours' is a pathetic comedy that makes no sense. I do not mean that the story was complicated, but the whole plot is based on one thing: the desperate and costly unsuccessful attempts of a couple to conceive children. Those who have tried so much have had to forget the option of adoption, which is not a nice film. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson, a total contradiction with everything the women's liberation movement offers, showing almost no sense of independence. She is a rather boring character as a dreamy housewife with absolutely nothing in mind other than having children. Like a silly romantic comedy of the 50s, Greg Kinnear is her submissive husband who also has no personality, no independence and no interest from us. <br /> <br /> These are the two most boring and often embarrassing characters. It is difficult to talk about a comedy that should come with a lot of incidents and that should result from a couple doing everything in their power to get pregnant. Except they do not really do anything except go to a fertility clinic and spend a lot of money doing what they could do in the privacy of their lives (except this in vitro fertilization issue ). The plot does not allow any accident, because the couple does nothing to create a bizarre situation. They are just going to this clinic. So what? <br /> <br /> The purpose of secondary intrigue is to test the fidelity of the couple, the essential moral element of the story, because the couple is planning to conceive children together. Jennifer works in a new age store with her friend (played by Joan Cusak) and their job is to develop aphrodisias. Christopher MacDonald plays the role of the interested buyer and Jennifer is the promising negotiator of a nice price for the product of her friend and product. The sub-plot does not offer much to interest you (although Joan Cusak is rather funny in the restaurant scene). <br /> <br /> Danny (Kinear) is an architect who finds the opportunity to earn extra money to cover clinic, taking a job in Seattle, where his boss is the big seductress (another female character desperate and helpless) who tries to influence Danny (as stupid as he is) to have an affair with her once things are convenient with him and his wife (for reasons that do not bother me). Jill Hennesy is talented in the role, but her character is too predictable and too formal as an indispensable element to create a conflict with Danny. It's stupid and again, barely interesting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie itself is quite boring and barely funny (save the restaurant scene and the airline's flight). The plot offers nothing that really attracts attention. Even if the story concerned only two people trying to conceive, the writers could have understood several hilarious incidents to develop. Second, the main characters are completely boring. They are complete silhouettes of silent comedies of the 1950s with a happy woman and a helpless husband. Thus, even in the absence of worries in the plot, the characters themselves do not offer anything interesting, let alone fun. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusak should have been in the lead and someone else should have taken the role of Kinnear. Cusak would have even made an incredibly funny ugly story (as she sometimes does in her co-starring role here). It's definitely to pass.
