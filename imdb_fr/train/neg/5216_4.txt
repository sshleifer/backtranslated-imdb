'Metamoprhis' is the story of a dashing young scientist, revered at the local college, who is currently being investigated by financial providers. This forces him to take shortcuts to the typical melodramatic fashion of Bad Hollywood. <br /> <br /> My first thought after this movie conclusion is this. "Not good, but not bad, from the beginning to the mid-eighties." Of course, I then realized that it was made in 1990, which had almost reduced it to a "4", but I decided to keep it at the mediocre "5" it is. a few times, seems to be a good movie trying desperately to go out. The acting game, although not stellar, is mostly competent. You can even see occasional gleams of modest quality. Stimulation is a big problem with the movie. After thinking that I had been watching for 90 minutes, I realized that I only watched for an hour. The special effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be competent enough to get around this weakness. <br /> <br /> The main role, a slightly charismatic man who seems to be trying to channel the fusion of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me in particular of the character of Matt Dillon in "Wild Things". The heroine does a decent job, but does not stand out anyway. There is a role of "naughty girl" here, and the actress does what she can with, but it does not seem like much. There is a child actor that the director can not decide if he is morose, cheerful or just weird. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, stimulation is the film's worst problem, until a last fight against the villain can make a Power Ranger blush. It's bizarre and inexplicable, to the final scene supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious, saturated with any bad camera and suraction trick that can be compressed in about thirty seconds. watch the movie "Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack". Nothing that can bring you back and nothing to buy alone.
