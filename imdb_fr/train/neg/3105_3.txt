I can not believe anyone can do a comedy about a problem like homelessness. Of course, Brooks did not do comedy about the homeless. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence in these streets. The people we meet in this film are homeless in Fantasy Land, so the only difference between them and us is that they do not eat as often. Brooks' films have gotten worse and worse over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin.
