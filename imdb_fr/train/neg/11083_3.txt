This movie was late at night when I saw it. It was interesting at first but it did not convince me as a whole. I am not a fan of Tyson. In fact, I do not like boxing at all. It's barbaric, obscene and double-faced (on the part of society) that some have money to fight each other. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I felt that the beginning of the film was OK. The actors are fine, especially George C. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I do not know how reliable the film is. I have not read books or books about boxing or Tyson. I did not know anything about this man, but it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Over the course of the film, I felt that he had lost some of his charm and that I had lost interest. I managed to stay awake, but the last hour was not enough.
