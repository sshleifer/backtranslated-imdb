There will be a time when children will have grown up without ever seeing the one and only Bugs Bunny kissing (technically) another man on the lips. There will be a time when it will not be the season of ducks or rabbits. There will be a time when the devil Tazmanian will be nicknamed politically incorrect. <br /> <br /> But help me now, it's not that time. <br /> <br /> Nobody really wants an "EXTREME" version of our beloved Loony characters. Anyone in the marketing that comes up with "Corn Nuts: Corn gone bad" and "Extreme Doritos", it's obvious that this hellish moron should know that it's not because they have a degree in commerce or in advertising that it's not that they know Jack kids. <br /> <br /> I think they do a disservice to children by depriving them of one of the biggest and most iconic shows of all time. This show disgusts me, and it's not just a stale work of art or a terrible dialogue. They abuse good vocal talents, like Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo and so many others. It lacks style, humor, character development and especially heart. <br /> <br /> The show, like its reconditioned characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny) is only the shadow of his past, his beautiful self.
