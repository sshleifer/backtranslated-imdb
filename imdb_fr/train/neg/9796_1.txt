Ok, I can not seriously think of anything worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers must be at the bottom of the list. Can you think of something more stupid than five to six teenagers (who do not even behave like a normal teenager) dancing in identical costumes IN DIFFERENT COLORS TO ALLOW YOU TO DIFFER THEM? Fans, have you ever met a real person who comes up against a mental wall, gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting hurt? The Power Rangers are reserved for five-year-old boys and, believe me, I never liked this show, even at the age of five. <br /> <br /> I guess you can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. Teenagers ACT like teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually acts as a mentor, or not, as a teacher. There is teenage humor, even if the fights are lame, I do not hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Power Rangers are shit, but I would not want to. It would be an insult to shit. So, admit it, five-year-old boys, Power Rangers, it sucks.
