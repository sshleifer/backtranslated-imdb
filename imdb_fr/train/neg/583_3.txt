I bought this adaptation because I liked Anne BrontÃ«'s novel a lot when I read it a while ago and I particularly like BBC dramas. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be so serious: the whole series made me laugh a lot more than I was more moved than the novel. <br /> <br /> First, the music (and seems totally irrelevant in a period drama (it seems to have been written for a contemporary horror movie) and, as another commentator, I was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras were spinning and circling the actors, I saw some scenes filmed this way in "North and South" and it seemed to be going well there, but in The Tenant is really exaggerated and just annoying.The movements of the camera can not make the wooden game alive. <br /> <br /> Most supporting roles were difficult to distinguish at the beginning and the scenario was unclear, none of the characters were correctly introduced at first The little boy did a very good performance, he is very cute and is the best feature film of the film. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS The characterization of Helen Graham by Tara Fitzgerald makes her look cold e t lasts, leaving no emotion to pass. She does not seem able to cry at all realistically. I just could not believe Markham would have cracked for her and I'm not talking about the terrible hairstyle that was given to her. I could not help but feel sympathy for her husband! Want to be married to such a virago ... In addition, he was the only main actor that sounded right for me. Toby Stephens, I found it ok, Helen Graham's brother is not very good. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is difficult to adapt a novel that deals with subjects as dark as alcoholism and cruelty. In addition, in the book, what is hinted at and left to the reader's imagination is addressed with complacency in the television adaptation: making some scenes both coarse and comical (as when Huntingdon's eye begins to bleed ) and others too sexed for a movie. historical series! I mean, do not we have enough bedsteads in contemporary dramas?
