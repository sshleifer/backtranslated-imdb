When I noticed that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like, score! I admit that I was eager to see the movie. And I must say that the first fifteen minutes were both nostalgic. Then everything went down the hill. I did not expect it to be a mess of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo. They took all possible controversial topics and threw them into a stupid story. I was dismayed that Noah was involved in anything, especially his role. Nobody with a fully functioning brain would actually accept all this bullshit about the Vietnam War. If anyone really wants to know how communism was, sit down and read a book about it. And not one who praises or is against, just the harsh reality. <br /> <br /> I only watched a few scenes here and there only because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that's all that interested me. Everything else in this movie irritated me.
