Recap: Full moon. A creature, a huge werewolf, is hunting. Not for the flesh, not for the blood (not that it bothers me to take a bite on the way), but for a partner. He is looking for a girl. Not any girl though. The girl. The girl who is pure (and also a werewolf, even if she does not know it yet). Three, well, check that two cops (after the first scene) and an old bag lady are all that can stop him, or even know that killing and eating a lot of people around the full moon is a werewolf . Darkwolf, this powerful werewolf, is getting closer to the girl. If he gets it, humanity is doomed. Now the cops have to find the girl, convince her not only that there's someone, a werewolf, who wants to rape her and maybe kill her, but that she's a wolf herself. werewolf. And then they must stop it ... <br /> <br /> Comments: This is one for boys, teenagers. Many scenes with semi-nude girls more or less important for the plot. Especially less. Well, I guess you need something to fill a little while because the plot is (expected) thin. And unfortunately, there is only girls to help the plot to undo. We generally turn to two main themes. Nudity. Check. And then special effects. Hmm ... Well, there are some things you could call effects. They are not very special though. In fact, to be honest, they are very bad. The film seems to suffer from a lack of funds. They could not buy clothes for some girls;) and the effects are cheap. Some of the transformations between the werewolf form and the human form, obviously done by computer, are really bad. You might forget such things. But the Black Wolf itself is also very rude and you can never witness any killings. Just a few mutilated corpses after. And there is surprisingly little blood in a film that, honestly, should be soaked in blood. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what to say about actors and characters. Most of the time, they are doing well, but unfortunately, there are mistakes where characters (or actors) lose it. Some of these deficiencies could be related to the problems mentioned above. Like the weak effects, or the low budget (?). This could explain why there is little precious fire, even though the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain view (and does not move). But hey, when you're in danger, there's nothing that can save your life like a good one-liner ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that can not explain when the cop, Steve, the only one who knows how to solve the problem, the werewolf who escaped while the only thing he can be sure of is that the werewolf comes looking for the girl who is right next to him and he can not let her have him. But of course, this allowed the producers to stretch the ending a bit longer ... <br /> <br /> But I would not want to see any of the main actors / actresses make another attempt in another movie. <br /> well. To conclude, this is not a film that I recommend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
