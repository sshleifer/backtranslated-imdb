What the film does not answer is how much this war is a mistake (and most American wars have recently occurred only for the purpose of getting oil). So, let me ask you if an American soldier kills women and children regardless of the enemy, that's fine, but if the government accidentally kills their own forces with deadly chemicals while killing many civilians well, this 'is not? Your logic fails, sir. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 5 for solid performance and 1 for everything else, 3 in total.
