After reading very good reviews on this film, I thought to give him a watch and after being very disappointed with the film, I thought to give him my own criticism. This is the first time I am so naked with me. <br /> <br /> First, I would like to scratch the horror of the genre, which is by no means horrible or scary (except for a few weak attempts to blow you up, unfortunately, which has worked on me.) I would say that qualifying this movie thriller is a success, because I was not particularly happy either! The film tells the story of a spoiled mischievous girl who fainted several times. During these visits, she visits a house she draws. After each visit, she decides to add something to the house to make it a little more alive. One of the characteristic features is a sad little boy who is also sick in reality. By befriending the boy, she realizes that her imaginary world that she has created is actually better than the real world she is in. Until she adds her father constantly to the house, because of a bad draw, her father turns out to be evil and the boy has to escape his clutches. <br /> <br /> Think of it as an attempt to be a slightly softer version of A Nightmare On Elm Street, but more like a trip to the beach. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, my generous 3/10 will, hopefully, prevent at least one of you from watching this monster!
