The box cover of this movie is called Kyle Minogue, but it has the same fate as Drew Barrymore in "Scream". This is the first thing that makes this film lame; they try to market a movie with someone who stayed there for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course, we must have this feature in the film of young college kids who forget that a killer walks. To top it off, Molly Ringwald, famous in the eighties film for teens, is the star of this beautifully written film. It's a good career decision for Molly to get money to make a rotten movie in Australia so they do not get rid of the United States. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this silent movie is about a dumb horror movie that has never been finished because this dumb creature kills everyone in it. Throughout the film, we are supposed to guess who the killer is. Long story short, remember our girlfriend Molly, she saves the day ... or does she? <br /> <br /> This move is simply bad, praise it if you feel like torturing yourself or just breaking it on the fly. floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Do not spread the horror.
