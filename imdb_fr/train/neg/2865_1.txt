Generally, I do not do minus and if this site could I would give this movie -3 out of 10 which means that I really hated this movie. I thought Uwe Boll was alone in the dark and he was the worst I've ever seen but at least I gave him a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorff shooting nothing did not laughs, so I improved the notes a bit). If it was compared to Bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win the Oscar for best film if it was in competition. <br /> <br /> Now, the plot, this movie is about the BTK killer, which is good, but they could have done better. The beginnings seemed to be going well, but that's what forced me to move quickly because death is so boring. I like movies of killers and even if they are void, they could still have cool dead. I'm not a movie expert, but believe me, he would have shot himself if he saw that. Sorry for the hikes, but there is nothing good to say about it, because it looks like someone took a camcorder and filmed this ... this ... disaster. Uwe Boll, your movies are no longer on my list of the worst movies of my life, it took the cake. <br /> <br /> Well sorry, I could not explain the plot (if there was one), but it was the best I could. Now, if you do not mind, I'll crawl into a corner and go back and forth and remember how this movie scared me for life .... OK for life
