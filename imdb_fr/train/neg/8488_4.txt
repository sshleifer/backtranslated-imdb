This film should have been awesome, encompassing virtual reality, the potential of computers, communication with the past, the ongoing struggle to express your identity in a compelling society and Ada Byron Lovelace. But it's ugly, terrible if you consider the potential! The acting game - apart from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - goes from tolerable to atrocious. The construction of the plot is embarrassing to say the least - the modern-day programmer is a monotonous character, but half of the film is devoted to setting up her character. Ada finally appears to tell the events of her life. do not present an engaging story (Swinton almost gets away with it, though). She's never really known as a real person, it's simply an icon from a graduate student's history journal. <br /> <br /> Digital effects, like a digital dog and a bird, are derisory and distract 1997 and not 1985. And, finally, the script is just bad. Bad dialogue, often pretentious - especially the fights between the programmer and her boyfriend, which made me feel uncomfortable - characters cold and distant, and zero attempt to create a sense of astonishment. The programmer successfully contacts a person in the past! Amazing! But that does not seem to surprise anyone, and her boyfriend says, "Well, be careful." (Although we do not know then or later why this could be dangerous, and that never seems to be dangerous.) <br /> <br /> In addition, despite the fact that it is 'computer and Ada Lovelace and his love of mathematics, it is clear that no one in the scenario knew either mathematics OR computers - any reference to these topics appears as a complete gibberish that defies any suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> A scene, towards the end of The film is pretty good, a monologue of Tilda Swinton expressing her sadness at the fragility of life but her joie de vivre. Poignant, passionate and insightful, he seems to have come out of another film. <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed with this movie because it's a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult movie. If the subject interests you, you can rent it, but be warned. See Orlando for another much better review of genre roles in history with a superb performance by Tilda Swinton. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler / question: * * <br /> <br /> At the end of In the film, Ada asks that her memories not be preserved (in what I thought was the best scene of the film). But then, the modern programmer seems to do it anyway, transferring the memories to his little girl (hence the title of the film). Am I right in thinking that the programmer violated Ada's wishes without even fighting for it? Or is it another point of the puzzling plot that I interpret badly?
