It's very unfortunate when a movie like this is done. A lot of work and money have been invested in a movie that is at best amateur. <br /> <br /> The editing lags, there are obvious mistakes that could easily be corrected in a second take, and the soundtrack is unimaginative. So much could have been done with this video film. I think they ran out of time or videotape. <br /> <br /> The hand shots give off a distinct amateur feeling.
