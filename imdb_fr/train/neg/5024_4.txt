There is not much to say about this one. Gammera is a kind of turtle spit by fire. He is released by a nuclear explosion. He goes to earth and starts destroying buildings, tanks and other garbage (oh yes, power lines, I almost forgot). At the beginning of the film, he befriends a little boy and, instead of throwing or crushing him, he drops him to the ground. Sure. From there, we must watch this little pudgy face twerp present and run away, show themselves and run away, show themselves and run away. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this kid at a distance of 20,000 feet. Oh, well, the plot is to try to get Gammera to get to a place where he can be embedded in a rocket and fired into space. As usual, the monster is heavy and poorly coordinated (a guy in Gammera costume). The Japanese army (with the help of the Americans) uses enough ammunition and firepower to pay the public debt and, of course, it has no effect. They should know it anyway. We saw a lot of monsters stomp in Tokyo. Do not ask them because they can be fun, but it's really not very good.
