Set aside a rehearsal of Dr. House that I missed, and a Desperate Housewives (new) to watch this one. I do not know exactly what affected this film. I never thought of saying that, but I want to recover my 15 minutes of glory. <br /> <br /> Scenario, Direction, I can not say it. I recognized the stable of actors (the usual suspects), but I thought Herbert Marshall was an addition to the class and I sat down for a good cheese movie. Boy, I was wrong. Dullsville. <br /> <br /> My favorite passages: where the "office girl" does with the 029 keystroke and places the cards in a 087 binder. LOL @ "the computer". I would like someone to identify the next device - a 477? It's even before the time of this dinosaur. <br /> <br /> And we, the dinosaurs, do not have much time to lose.
