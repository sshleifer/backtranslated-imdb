The Blood III Camp is a significant improvement over Camp Blood II, as it sounds mostly in the right places and is a rudimentary plot. This time, they ventured a little further from the parking lot. The other two films were shot, which is a good thing, because you can not hear the cars pass by what is supposed to be a distant land. <br /> <br /> This time, there is a reality show and a fake clown to scare away candidates. This is not a new idea, I have seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same principle: the real killer, but at least this one has a plot instead of stabbing people at random. <Br/> <br /> Unlike the other two in the series, this one is at least good for some laughs. I liked the sound effect of a shot when someone gets stabbed early and how the micro-boom moves behind people like a ghost. <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone would want to create a third Camp Blood. movie, I would have thought it would be better to start over but they have at least tried it with this one. The half-naked deformed woman was a little too much for me, it looks like they tried to maintain continuity by hiring a whore who would undress for $ 5, as in the second movie. They still do not understand that a machete is used to cut, not to stab, but hey, it's a movie from Camp Blood, what are you waiting for? If you like shit movies, you'll have a lot of fun with this one.
