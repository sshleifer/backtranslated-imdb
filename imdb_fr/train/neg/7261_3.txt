This Anglo-Spanish co-production is one of countless films shot in Spain following the unexpected phenomenal success of Italian "Spaghetti" westerns. It presents, as is typical of these efforts of genre, an eclectic assortment of international stars: Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc. Ironically, this incoherent mess of a film is an eloquent example of the reason that most American film genres have become an endangered breed in the 1970s and are practically now (or is it officially?) off. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this film, not only because the western My favorite movie types, but also because it had all the qualities, including an intriguing principle, to be a good one - Not to mention the fact that my father had bought a pocket edition of the new TOWN CALLED BASTARD romanization facility! In reality, the only virtue of the film (if we can even call it that) is its pure eccentricity: for example, Stevens, who plays the widow to avenge the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband, sleeps in a coffin (!) driven in a carriage by his mute servant (?) Sutton; Savalas, as a bloodthirsty renegade, who at first seems to be the main villain of the film, is sent unceremoniously by his own Lettieri henchman very early in the photo; the villain of the play turns out to be Landau, who, in the first scene of the film, is seen plundering our legendary hero turned priest, Shaw! Fernando Rey, playing the role of a blind peasant, is the only one to identify the rebel Shaw who, in the end, turns out to have been only a front for ... well, never mind! As you can see, the plot is very confusing and it becomes foreign from there! The production team responsible for this film was also at the origin of other Western productions at the same time, such as CUSTER OF THE WEST (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972) ).
