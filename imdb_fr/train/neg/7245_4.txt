I'm not keen on The Pallbearer, it's not that bad, but it's very slow at the time. As the film progresses, it becomes a little more interesting, but nothing great. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a big fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but it does not bother me sometimes and she's fine here. The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like the slopes, you might enjoy it.
