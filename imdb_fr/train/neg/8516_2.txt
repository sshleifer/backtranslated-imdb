Last week, I took a look at Nielsen's weekly ratings, and there was Veronica Mars, supposedly "the best show you do not watch". <br /> <br /> Well, they're right to say you're not watching it. It has been broadcast twice and has been ranked 147 and 145 places out of 147. <br /> <br /> Translation: This is the lowest-rated program of all national broadcast networks ... and rightly so. I tried to watch it several times because of all the media coverage in which it was presented as a "big" show, a "realistic look" on life and all that nonsense. The reality was different. Veronica Mars is a nuisance. It's as unrealistic as it sounds, and it deserves to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only mystery is the reason why CW felt compelled to put on its inaugural program the lowest rated show of his memory, after two years of consecutive commercial and artistic failure.
