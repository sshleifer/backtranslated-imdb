Dane does his best and is at his peak: he screams and goes crazy, spills water on himself and rolls on the ground. Too much. Calm down, get together and make us laugh. I did not quite understand his comparison with comics and rock stars. Just because there are both on stage or something like that? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really interested in this when he was alive. He had some good jokes like the Burger King joke where people scream in training. I also liked the joke of Reese's Pieces. If Dane did not act so mentally, it might be funnier and I might have awarded a higher score of up to eight.
