I do not like to throw such lines, but in this case, I have the feeling that I have to do it: the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I've seen in theaters 5 last years. There, I said it. And now that I've removed that from my system, thank you for letting me explain why. <br /> <br /> "When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born, the spell is concentrated on death, and those who meet him will be consumed by his fury". This is the principle of THE GRUDGE and I'll admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, filmmakers do not go further. Those who encounter the "curse" are indeed consumed by his fury and that's all you get. You want more? Well, it's a shame. Some critics and fans point out that THE GRUDGE is meant to scare you. The problem is that when there is no real plot, scary images and sounds can only go very far. Director Takashi Shimizu, who shoots a film from George Sluizer and remakes his own original film, tries valiantly to create an atmosphere from the first hour. by repeating the same scene again and again, over and over again. This goes pretty well: <br /> <br /> - the person enters the house <br /> <br /> - something flashes near the camera and / or a strange sound is heard <br <br /> <br /> <br /> -a person will investigate <br /> <br /> -the sound will sound <br /> <br /> -the person sees a ghost <br /> <br /> -a screaming cry and / or a cat cry <br /> <br /> - Cut to black <br /> <br /> Even before the public has a hint of intrigue, this same scenario takes place five times during the first hour. The first time was actually a little scary. Each subsequent use became laughable over the course of the film. At the end of the film, my friend and I laughingly wondered if this scene would end "with a loud cry and a blackout". We have never been wrong. <br /> <br /> The film has no narrative plot, but rather a series of vignettes leaving the audience puzzled. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it's done right. The film jumps from time to time without rhyme or reason. I have not seen a film in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this narration technique hides any sort of mystery that a film could have had. If you already know that ghosts have scared two characters to death, how shocking is it that their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone? <br /> <br /> Obviously, the second US version of THE RING brought in $ 15 million the first weekend, THE GRUDGE is just a calculated imitation disguised as a real movie. The scariest thing about THE GRUDGE is that it won $ 40 million the first weekend and some consider it the "scariest movie ever". I wonder what happens to those who are consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE?
