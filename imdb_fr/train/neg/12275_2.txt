This is the case of a group of people who think they are so intelligent that they have a story that corresponds to the time. Do you remember the global political plots filmed in the years before Watergate and a little later? Most movies trying to save time for TV movies "So powerful, so incredible conspiracies" have in fact been trapped in their own navel gaze. <br /> <br /> I've never been a fan of The Conversation that I find as old as the other conspiracy groups of the day, but Coppola was loyal to his main character and Hackman was a very engaging actor in observe. I mean these conspiracy movies drown mainly in the pool of black hero characters. Many unanswered questions, a lot of dissociation ... Well, at least Bergman is needed to build a movie on such non-visual bases. <br /> <br /> The Next Man is a perfect example of his time: a political soup served with an idealistic character and a horrible conspiracy tightening his web around him. No part is interesting in itself and the whole is not better. In fact, you can tell how bad it will be in the first few sequences that accumulate "watcha who" murder without ever advancing a scenario. The greatest difficulty in the film is a pompous accumulation of scenes shot around the violence naively brought under the eyes of the viewer.
