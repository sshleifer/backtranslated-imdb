The invasion of the star Creatures would definitely be in the category "so bad that it's good" if the movie was not so sexist or racist. The fact that this is so makes it downright bad. <br /> <br /> It has the same kind of radical sexism that you saw in Queen of Outer Space, and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this case, the American Indians). that you will normally find in the thirties and forties. As for not being funny, the same gag of the cave is repeated well over ten times during this short film. Ray makes a good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but can not make it work for two impressions of Cagney in a row, nor manage a Peter Lorre when he tries it). There is really no production value per se, because "Star Creatures" make Rob Monster or Tor Johnson's Ro-Man from Plan 9 of Outer Space look like works by Industrial Light and Magic. <br /> <br /> This film was definitely one of the avant-garde of what you would call early independent cinema ... not artistic enough for these theaters and not good enough for anything other than the last one. footage of a night drive-in. <Br /> <br />
