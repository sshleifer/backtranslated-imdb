Chinese Ghost Story III is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantastic movies. The film offers the special effects that can be expected, but that painfully fails on all other fronts. The actors all play extremely stupid caricatures. You have to stay still in the layers to find their wacky humor, even remotely. The plot is predictable, and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow. Towards the end, the film begins to look like Godzilla's old movies, including grotesque, larger-than-life special effects and a ghost with a Godzilla head. I might have smiled if I was expecting a camp. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see what fantasy fans have to endure - in this case because someone thought they could pull a little more money making formula. They will not be able to do it anymore: the cash cow is now dead like a dodo.
