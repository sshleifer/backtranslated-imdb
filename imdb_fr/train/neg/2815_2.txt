Poor Robert Englund made another flop and at the expense of Tobe Hooper, who usually produces very good horror movies, but he rather failed during this one. Englund plays the famous Mark De Sade who, in the 17th century, was imprisoned for his obsession with pain and the pleasure of hurting himself as well as watching others suffer. The story is so confusing with the switch from one century to another and I did not really understand what was happening and what was the purpose of this film. All I saw was a young woman who was trapped by a strange lesbian who wants to keep her for herself. The young woman has become fascinated by this Arab with a lot of money and discovers that he is ready to kill and then Englund between a century to another claiming to be a descendant of the Sade and tries to kill her because she recalled Mrs. Momoselle (spelled what is wrong) or whoever it is in the photo above the wall of De Sades. The film was terrible, I'm surprised by Hooper for hiring Englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and laughable, especially the part about the eyes. Englund tries to come back from his blow "Nightmare on Elm St." using these needles to pull and go out to turn people's eyes off. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
