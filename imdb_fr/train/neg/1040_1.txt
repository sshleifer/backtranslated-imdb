I can not believe that this movie managed to get a relatively high score of 6! It's barely watchable and incredibly boring, certainly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Non-budgetary, it reminded me of the Star Wars I and II episodes of pure impression as you look at a total creative train wreck. <br /> <br /> This film must be avoided at all costs. This is one of those "festival films" that only the pseudo intellectuals like because they are so badly made that they think it makes it "different", so good. <br /> <br /> A bad cinematic realization is not "different", it's just a bad achievement.
