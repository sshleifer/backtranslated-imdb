I do not understand that. The film obviously has a very good budget. He has a very good cinematography. It has a good rhythm, a good editing and a very good staging. So WHY OH WHY did not they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so that it would not be so ridiculous and why? This film could have been good. Most of the time, it looks good and nice, but in the end, we realize that the movie was not good at all. <br /> <br /> I would say that it is a good production but a bad film. Too bad actually. <br /> <br /> And eels? Come, really!
