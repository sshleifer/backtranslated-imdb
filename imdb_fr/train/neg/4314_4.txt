I firmly believe that the best Oscars ceremony of the last years goes back to 2003, for two reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) The animator Steve Martin was the most spiritual: "I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore to put his hand in the trunk of his limo "and" I'd better not mention the gay Mafia in case I woke up with the head of a poodle in my bed "<br /> <br /> 2) The winners of the surprise: nobody has sent down Adrien Brody for the best actor (Real applause) or Roman Polanski for the best director (real jeers) but they have won <br /> <br /> The ceremony of Last year's awards ceremony was not too bad, but there were not many surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING swept the awards even though it was not the best of the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was much better), but what left the cover of the BBC down is that Jonathan Ross has received some of his sycophant friends and claimed they were hilarious when they were what but. So when I heard Sky cover British TV, I expected Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to make the connections, but we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh yes, I'm sure Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will be happy to go to Los Angeles to give their honest opinion on the winners and the losers. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock was not that bad, but it was not Steve Martin while the site seemed like a gym with seats installed! Not really a glitzy arena in my opinion. The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the "minor" Oscars awarded to the winners who were sitting in their place! There is no "minor" Oscar and, quite simply, because the prize is awarded to the best animated short film or the best costume, they are as well deserved as the best film or the best director. All winners should be able to get on the podium. What the Academy is becoming a group of arrogant snobs and I totally agree with the comments that say that this format is shameful and that without the surprises, it would have been perhaps the worst ceremony of the story. As for the awards themselves <br /> <br /> Best Actress in a Supporting Role - Cate Blanchett. No big surprise for a competitive category <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman. No real complaints, because Freeman is one of the most alive American actors. <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Jamie Foxx. Most predictable price of the night. Yawning <br /> <br /> Best Actress - Hilary Swank. Great surprise since everyone thought that Annette Benning would win a political success, but Swank deserved it and gave the best speech of the night <br /> <br /> Best director - Clint Eastwood. Big surprise because everyone thought that Scorsese was going to receive the prize simply because he had never won. In fact, I'm happy because if he did not deserve it for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, he did not deserve it for THE AVIATOR <br /> Best movie - MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Yet another big surprise since everyone thought that the academy would share the best director and best image, while I thought that THE AVIATOR's friendly plot in Hollywood would make a death certificate for Best Picture then that the controversial subject of MDB would have gone much further. Voters off <br /> <br /> These awards may reflect the fact that this year voters have decided to disregard Oscar politics and award rewards to the people who deserve it, they never did in the past. BEAUTIFUL SPIRIT beat the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for the sake of God! And long as the academy votes with their heads instead of their hearts
