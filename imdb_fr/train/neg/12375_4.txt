The good thing about this is at least cool: Almost no film on dance music and the club scene (if even made) hit the cinemas. And it releases a lot of energy, from music to Ibiza's performance. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that he can not decide what he wants to be. Although this is definitely a ridiculous documentary in the tradition of This is Spinal Tap, the designers also realized that they would not want to play the copier. However, the jokes fail a lot because it is not very well written and most of the characters are underdeveloped. And there is no bow in his script and asks that it lasts 90 minutes, so why not reduce it to 75 minutes? The production department and cinematography are still trying to save the situation (at Paul's house, for example). <br /> <br /> In a strange and unexpected way, Pete Tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of Almost Famous. In particular, the scenes with Beatriz Batarda offer a bit of power in the acting game. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's a mess that entertained a bit at the basic level, but you'd better spend a night in your favorite club.
