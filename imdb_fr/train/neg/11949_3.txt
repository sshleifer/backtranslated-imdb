This stupid comedy really wastes the talent of comedy. Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are notably misused here. I may have laughed once or twice during this movie, but in general, it's a boring movie, with a bit of stupidity for good measure. The premise, although the routine, was still not bad, but once the plot was set, the movie was going nowhere. Do not waste your time with this failure.
