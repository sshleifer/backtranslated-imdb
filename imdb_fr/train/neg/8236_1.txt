I can not believe it's on DVD. Even less, it was available in my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some claim it's a good movie, considering that it only had a budget of $ 4000. I find it funny. I would find this very bad regardless of the budget. <br /> <br /> Even more funny, I read the following in another review: "Drama apart, if you like horror and if you like something like Duel (1971). day with a little more history and some pretty girls, you'll love this movie. "<br /> <br /> What?!? It's a shame to compare these two films. <br /> <br /> I give a "1" because I can not give a "0". I just do not see how this movie could be entertaining.
