SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie and I did not like it. <br /> <br /> First reason: boring. There is almost nothing, the women sit down and discuss the seriousness of their lives and the lack of hope they have, smoke grass, read magazines, take care of their sick friend and cut out the occasional corpse. BORING !!!! <br /> <br /> Second reason: there are too many unexplained things left. Many scenes are devoted to a zombie hunter who kidnaps men at random, keeps them in a chair and questions them. Who are these men? How do they know anything about illegal activities concerning sick carnivores? Why is he killing one and leaving another? <br /> <br /> There is also this guy who, at first, also believed to suffer from flesh-flesh disease, but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting that he is not not quite what we originally thought, never explained! How is it frustrating? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found the women annoying, the uninteresting story, the tedious duologue and the non-existent action. In addition, the cover is misleading, because it suggests that this film will be cool when it is clearly not. I rented this movie based on the reviews of other people on this site. Although I respect the fact that some people have enjoyed this film, I will now make sure to read more than two critics at the bottom of a film. in order not to rent another movie, I regret to see.
