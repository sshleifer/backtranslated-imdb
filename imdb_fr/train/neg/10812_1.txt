What a pathetic film. <br /> <br /> I will not waste a lot of time talking about it. I always try to recover the few hours I lost with her. <br /> <br /> Let me just leave it with - Shaq does not have to be an actor or a singer. He is totally devoid of talent in both disciplines. It's a shameful shame that much more talented people are dying out in community theaters and karaoke bars, while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to get a meritless cast in movies and cut CDs. . <br /> <br /> the film was the pathetic no-pathetic that is Shaq.
