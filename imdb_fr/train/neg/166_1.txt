Okay, first of all, I did not sit down to watch the premiere of a "Star Trek" series to see a cowboy flying in space. Here is how a normal Enterprise episode works. <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds a nebula or something in its path and wants to take a closer look, but may destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 he sends a shuttle in the nebula and this one is damaged ... <br /> <br /> In all the episodes that I saw, all the problems occur because Archer's stupid mistakes. Oh, and did you preview an episode showing Archer and T'pol kissing?!?!?!? I had planned to watch this episode, but after that, I totally abandoned Enterprise and immediately went on television. Come on !!!! It's star trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> And also what was with the banana slug ?? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug, but had to leave it for a stupid reason. Okay, little con to bring you a slug in space but whatever. Okay, that's what I thought until they left him on a desert planet !!!!! A BANANA SLUG CAN NOT LEAVE IN A DESERT !!!!!!!!!!!! What stupidity are these writers <br /> <br /> Anyhow, just say that if Enterprise is running, do not look at it !!!
