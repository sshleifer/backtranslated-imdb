"Dead Letter Office" is a low-budget movie about two Australian postal service employees struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is mediocre and the links between the past misfortunes of the characters and the current mentalities are clumsily and too schematically represented. But what is most disappointing is that the representation is the life in the office of the film's title: there is no mechanization, and it's quite impossible to know what the staff really does to win its life. Admittedly, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this type of office has surely closed in the 1930s, if it actually existed. It's a shame, because the general tone of the film is poignant and ironic, and the scenario is promising: but few details are convincing. Overall, it looks like the work of someone who has not really experienced a lot of things in real life; a student film, with a concept and an outline, but unfortunately very little.
