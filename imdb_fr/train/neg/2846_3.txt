What a terrible movie it is. The only reason you will want to sit in this mess is the nice show of Miss Eleniak. Mr. McNamara's painful overwork, which sometimes became embarrassing, ruined what could have been a reasonable movie if the right actors had been assembled. Mr. McNamara is not Tom Cruise, the actor he obviously wants to be.
