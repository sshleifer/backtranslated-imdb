Even for the cocaine of the 1980s, it's pathetic. I do not understand why someone would want to waste celluloid, time, effort, money and brain cells from the audience to produce such behavior. If you're going to do a comedy, make fun of it. If you want to film rubbish like this, keep it for yourself. If you want to publish it as a joke like this: DO NOT !!! I mean, it was a joke, right? Someone please tell me it was a joke. Please.
