This is a movie about making a movie. Such films can be entertaining, but they need some substance to do it. It did not happen here, I'm afraid. Mr. Coppola has unfortunately not inherited the skills of his father (his sister either, who can however make films that we could watch). <br /> <br /> I wonder how this film could have generated such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: the main actor, supposed to be a director, is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same tone that whatever he says, the main actress has an expression on his face that never changes, the plot is totally segmented into bits with perhaps a single linking element, the film in the film idea must be more bland than the Paleolithic rocks ... That would be enough- he? I watched this movie. A walk with the dog is by far a superior entertainment to this incredibly lame movie. It's as if a plot by Fran√ßois Truffaut had been made by Dick Cheney ... <br /> <br /> Brazil, some other classic SF movies? You must be really joking ...
