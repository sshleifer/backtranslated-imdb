Is this the movie ??? Is this what the Indians are trying to show? I think it's an extra effort on the part of a sickly director to reject Pakistani soldiers and make them a country ... but what we know, the Pakistanis, know that we are still ahead of India in all areas of our lives ... not just armed counters. <br /> <br /> Well ... it's bad, filmed like Border's at the beginning of 1997 ... and the director and screenwriter has just tried to overcome the shame of the defeat at Kargil by the forces Pakistani armies, creating movies like these. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear: Whenever Pakistan and India meet, we will win ... !!! So Mr. Dutta is trying to make good movies instead of senseless movies like this
