"Scary Movie 2" is a disappointment for the Scary Movie franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good, but this one was rather boring and not very funny. Fortunately, they played their role after this one and made two other big horror movies. <br /> <br /> This film is about a group of teens being caught by their teacher on their way to a haunted mansion for one night. Things start to go awry and then they realize that they have to escape. <br /> <br /> This film is not horrible, but they could have improved many things. It's a little fun and if you like other Scary Movie movies, give it a watch - but I do not think you'll like it that much.
