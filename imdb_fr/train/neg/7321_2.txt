It may not have been my style, but the plot was horrible, as were Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable in the role of seduction here (while on marijuana, why should it be included?) This plot weakened considerably). Also the character of Farentino. It would have been better if she had had more respect for a relationship. Would the film try to say? not much.
