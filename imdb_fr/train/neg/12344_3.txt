Tense Comedy, a sketch-like magazine that was originally a vehicle to present the radio star at one time, Jack Pearl, but better remembered now as the American introduction to the Three Stooges. In fact, Larry, Curly and Moe are featured alongside comics Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his three stooges. Although the secondary cast includes Jimmy Durante (who is completely devastated by tarnished material) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience of the film is nowadays Stooges fans. Incredibly noisy and domineering, it shows how Hollywood had to go to achieve a certain level of blinding sophistication. * 1/2 of ****
