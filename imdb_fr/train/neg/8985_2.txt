Previous comments had encouraged me to check if this was happening in TCM, but it was a serious disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great, but does not spend enough time on the screen. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play known but promising characters, but the scenario leaves them in check. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the ego of Lee Tracy's character, who is at best an egocentric, physically and verbally violent. shake. The reactions of the "public" are badly thought out and unbelievable, making the "tricks" look like artifices of a bad writer. And it's hard to believe that Lupe Velez's character might please him. <br /> <br /> The scathing one-liners mentioned in another review must depend on the observer, because I did not even notice that an attempt was made.
