This is not the most useless animation experience, but we certainly can not admire it as much as wanting to be good. Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, it's the story of a mustang, later named Spirit (Matt Damon, who provides first-person storytelling), and his journey through the old west. Basically, he was born free among all the other horses of the beautiful countryside, then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse. He manages to repel all those who try to mount it. However, when he escapes from his cage, with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), they form a friendship, oh, and he obviously has a weakness for the Little Creek rider. Finally, after a few more escapes, pursued by Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and making a final big jump across a gorge, Little Creek leaves Spirit to leave and also frees his female horse. the house to their country and their horses. Also with Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Foreman Murphy / Railroad, John Rubano as a soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I was expecting to see the horses talking in this movie, but it's more like a Dumbo thing, and Bryan Adams's songs are not the most engaging, but it's not a terrible movie. He has been named the Oscar for Best Animated Feature and the Golden Globe for Bryan Adams' best song "Here I Am". Okay!
