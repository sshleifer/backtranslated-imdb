A group of extraterrestrials of human appearance who goes to Earth to eat, settles on a planet of prehistoric animals, where they all eat physédéliques mushrooms and are delayed. Padded with images of "The Planet of Dinosaurs" and horrible jokes, this is not to be missed. The acting is also atrocious, and although it is not as bad as "Chickboxer" (what film can be?), This is pretty awful. It's been 90 minutes that you play, it looks like an eternity and you will probably curse life so do yourself a huge favor and go ahead, skip this shabby movie, there's nothing here to see. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers are trying to sell this shit like an MST3K style by mocking the movie they had done a decade ago, and it works to some extent, but nothing could really be seen Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a rather low voice. /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: Comment for a joke, 17 Behind the scenes: a featurette; 7 minutes in the black featurette; Jessica Mills report; Gallery of stills; and original trailer
