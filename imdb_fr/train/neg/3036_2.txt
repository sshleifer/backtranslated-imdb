This movie was absolutely horrible! I can not understand how this film came to production. Nothing against the cast of the movie, of course, all this is the fault of the writing team. You take the old middle scenario - dance to get out of our poverty and misery - or STEP in this case. But this one does not have the appearance of a real plot - or at least one that could interest everyone. With actors speaking Canada in what is supposed to be an American set - this film falls flat. On a positive note, the staging was pretty good and the cinematography was also decent. It looks like the production budget was also very generous. My only request is for this team to leave writing and search for writers to help them bring the film's words to life. Net Result - How she moves is how she fears.
