Spoilers I guess. <br /> <br /> The absolutely absurd logic of the end ruins the whole film. I just could not get over it. And what's wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character? If I were suddenly crushed on a planet full of talking great apes, I would be like: "AAAAhhhhHHH !!! Run for your life! The monkeys have inherited the Earth!" But he's all like "talking about great apes, okay, then?" It's pretty jaded I would say. He must regularly deal with even stranger things. Apart from that, it's Rick Baker's best work to date. This film truly testifies to the progress made in the field of make-up of monkeys. 3/10.
