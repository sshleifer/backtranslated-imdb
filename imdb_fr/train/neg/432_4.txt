This film had the potential to be much more than it was. But not only does it fail, but it also provokes righteous and nauseating preaching. <br /> <br /> John Cusack is even more flattering than Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time, he is supposed to have a southern accent, which he visibly loses several times to each scene. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino is doing his shtick but seems to be going through this film and collecting a paycheck. As usual, it is good but it does not stand out. <br /> <br /> The secondary cast - take a look at the feminine romantic interest that adds little, if any, to the story. Speaking of history, a complicated story "who really loves," where Cusack is the mayor's self-employed boy who only has to look for the "right thing" to do. <br /> <br /> People do not act around here. The character of Cusack loses all credibility in the end, without revealing it, preaching and nauseating. The final scene brings out the penultimate deep stupidity. It is also completely inaccurate but I will not enter the law. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, in numbers. It sounds interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a film preached, proselytized and self-righteous for the last hour. Better a crap without brain than this pile of junk.
