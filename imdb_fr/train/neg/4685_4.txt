Until the last minutes of the film, I would have given the film a score of 7 or 8 stars. However, the end is so terrible and "Hollywoodized" that it completely undermines the 80% of the first movie. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they receive an order to fire their nuclear missiles. . The captain, Gene Hackman, is all for the launch, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is supportive of confirming launch orders first. The problem is that to launch both the captain and the 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington remains firm until it results in an armed uprising aboard the submarine. Finally, the error is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cool. However, here is the part that does not sound right. Once back on earth and in front of a reading committee, Washington and Hackman (who had just spent half of the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and are all friends! Huh ?! An end too commonplace for the film is worth it for me.
