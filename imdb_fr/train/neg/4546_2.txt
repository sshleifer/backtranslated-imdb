I just saw this movie and I did not read the book. The good thing about the movie is that, in some parts, it makes you think for a moment about the spiritual subject, the evolution, the tragedy and your part in the world. <br /> <br /> However, the immersion of the film is easily broken. and there is very little relationship between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book loses a lot in this version of the film. The events supposed to show that sincronicity is happening are almost unrecognizable. There must be a lot of reasoning for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more so to imagine that it has something to do with a bigger purpose. <br /> <br /> Illumination scenes are visually mediocre and do not create the best feeling she was supposed to have. Do you remember enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? Well, it's nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are poorly executed. Many scenes do not really develop the story, nor do they help to create an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The best actors of this film, namely Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow, can not save it. The first two seem to have had more scenes than their characters should have tried to save the movie, and because they were better paid, but it does not work. Most scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all. <br /> <br /> Jürgen is good in his scenes and sells like a pervert (as always), but the scenario does not help. all. The scene where he tries for the first time to convince John (Matthew Settle) to join him is a bad scenario. The execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly misdirected. The returns throughout the film can not even be commented. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film takes a lot of time, read the book! I have not read it, but it's probably a billion times better than that, it's true. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I had to write my first comment in IMDb.
