I could not watch more than 14 minutes. It's an excellent combination of very bad acting and very bad director. The shots used are disgusting, they broke the angle 180 degrees all the time. My head hurts, try to look at this load of "you know what". The dirt on the window of the "mystery machine" makes you see the light of the windows light ... boring. What else ... it's so badly framed all the time that it just makes you want to scream at this lady who runs it. I only made short films, but I'm pretty sure I'd be a lot better than making a feature film ... the story is amazing, just the long French kissing scene at the beginning tells you it's going to be pretty horrible. Try to avoid this kind of film at all costs, it will save you about 5 dollars for the rental, and you will never recover this hour and a half of your life ...
