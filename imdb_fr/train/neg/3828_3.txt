In 1976, the western was an exhausted genre and the writers of this film knew it clearly. Nevertheless, instead of putting the project aside and avoiding us from looking at it, they decided to do it. Apparently, needing an interesting thread to get the audience to come and see the movie, they decided to make it as violent as possible and as unpleasant as possible. Damn it worked for The Wild Bunch, so why would not it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch has a great screenplay, but The Last Hard Men is pure old-fashioned stuff. <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand what drew Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawyer who attacks a group of escaped convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation. <br /> <br /> It's a bloodthirsty film in which, every time someone dies, it's the details. This is extremely disappointing, in fact, because the couple of stars looks like an enticing prospect. There is also no sense of rhythm or urgency in the film. It takes forever to get going, but when the action finally comes, it is spoiled by the emphasis on wickedness. Overall, it may be the worst film Heston has ever made. I'm sure this is one of the productions he does not like to include in his illustrious resume.
