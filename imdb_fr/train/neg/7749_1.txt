This film should never have been done. Animation poorly done, beyond acting badly. I do not know when the people behind this movie said, "Ok, so good! Let's do it!" I was impressed by the horror of this movie. At one point, which might have been the worst, a computer-generated Golden Tooth Saber falls from the roof, stabbing the silly creator of cats in the mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The villain of the movie was a paralyzed saber tooth that was killed minutes after its first appearance. The other two manage to kill a handful of people before being burned and shot. Then there is one at random waiting for victims in the jungle ... which scares me for one reason. Will there be a second part? I hope for the sake of humans, everywhere in the world. <br /> <br /> This film was pure waste. From the power point, get credits until the end of the slideshow.
