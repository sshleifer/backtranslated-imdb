Sensational. Some movies leave me speechless. It was undeniably one of those movies. When I left the theater, not a word came to my mouth. I had only an incredible desire to bang my head against the wall of the theater to help me forget the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it did not work. Honestly, this movie has nothing to recommend. The humor was on the first level, at best, the acting was too ridiculous, and the plot was far-fetched. I pledge never to see another film starring Chris Kattan or another member of the SNL cast.
