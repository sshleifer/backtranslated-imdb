An episode of x-files does not generate excitement or contains anything boring to watch. A detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances. The deaths are related to the presence of a little girl who was present when the deaths occurred.Mulder developed a theory that a police officer murdered by his colleagues would come back to reincarnate under the name of little girl and would require revenge.Now no connection at all and seems to be only a randomly chosen person as being reincarnation. I think this writing was slightly lazy and that this episode ranks among the worst in the history of x-files!
