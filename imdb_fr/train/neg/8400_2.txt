Even the most ardent slipper lovers could not like the movie (I'm one of them), the stooges do not get any material to work with. It's really too bad, because it's the only feature film that the guys did with Curly, and this effort on their part is painfully unpleasant, when he could have had a lot of potential. Horrible musical numbers do not help anyone either. The short film they did with the same title has more laughs.
