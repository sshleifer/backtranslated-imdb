Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> False production values, dreadful story idea, bad scenario, mediocre scenario ... and I can not even find an adjective appropriately describing poverty The direction of Joan River is. I know there is a special place in hell for the people who financed this film; prolly just below the level reserved for genocidal maniacs raping children. <br /> <br /> This film is a train wreck. <br /> <br /> (Terrible) x (infinite) = Rabbit Test. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that it's not even funny.
