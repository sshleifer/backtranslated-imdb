This film was probably inspired by Masculine, feminine of Godard and I urge you to see it instead. <br /> <br /> The film has two strong elements, namely: unfairly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me the most is the constant flow of nonsense. Lena Nyman must be the most annoying actress in the world. She's so stupid and with all the nudity of this movie, ... it's unattractive. Compared to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced by stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that this stems from the difference of ideals between French society and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> A film of its time and place. 2/10.
