The book series "Wrinkle in Time" is my favorite series of my childhood. I have read and re-read them more than I can count in the past 35 years. The characters, with all their virtues and flaws, are dear and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful, magical and spiritual story that I love so much. To say that this film disappointed me would be a euphemism. <br /> <br /> If you have never read the book or books, I imagine you will enjoy the movie. The acting is passable, the special effects are well done for a TV movie and the story is interesting. However, if you like books, avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the Wikipedia page of the novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said about the movie," I was expecting it to be bad, and so it is. "<br /> <br /> Like another reviewer, I feel the need to re-read the book to dispel this film from my mind.
