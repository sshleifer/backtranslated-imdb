Although the film takes place in an "Ivy League" university, it was actually shot entirely in northern Arizona, mainly at Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, in the fall of 1976. I was involved in the theater department and most of the extras in the film are then members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely ridiculous scene in this film (if you know your geography of Arizona) that shows several members of the bicycle distribution going from college to a cove. We NAU know that the campus and said Creek (actually Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 miles from each other, and although the descent is downhill, it would literally be impossible to bike back on this same road!
