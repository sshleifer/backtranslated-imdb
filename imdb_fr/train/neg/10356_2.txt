(That may be a little spoilerish) I would like to start by saying that I did not watch the entire movie, and I could not either, because it was obvious from the first hour that I was going to be incredibly disappointed. This is of course the problem of making, what many think is an amazing book, and turn it into a Disney film designed specifically for television. <br /> <br /> A ride in time should have been an incredible movie a long time ago. He has a great story that could hook children and adults. In addition, it is built in quality suites. But this is not the way to go. The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to make a visual story sum up what was great with the book. It's a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely "psychic" because it was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W as an additional tension, there is enough tension in the story without it. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses ... it deprived us of what could have been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg, as it happens in the book. <br /> <br /> I could keep chewing for days about little things, but I also think that bigger things, like art direction was off. Take for example how they made Camazotz look like, with its strangely black sky. The goosebumps that appear in the book is that Camazotz could be the Earth. It looks like earth. There are people who look like humans. The sky is blue, the grass is green and there are children playing. But something is a little off. The directors chose to make Camazotz another complete instead of taking the lesson of the book and apply it to the general direction of the film. The lesson to be learned is that Camazotz could very well be Earth, that is, if we forget how to love. It would have been a lot more scary to spend a nice afternoon walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls at the same pace. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I did not watch the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney has ruined the end as well. <br /> <br /> Overall, an artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
