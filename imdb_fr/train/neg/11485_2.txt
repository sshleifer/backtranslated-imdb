Forbidden Siren is based on the game Siren 2 Playstation 2 (as many as 2). Like most movies shot in the video game, I would say that most do not translate very well on a different medium. And that also applies to that one painfully. <br /> <br /> There is a very long prologue that explains and posits the premises of the story and the mysterious island on which a writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, his daughter Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and his son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) come to live. The villagers do not seem very friendly and soon enough, wise advice is given about the siren on the island, which asks to stay indoors once it begins to moan. <br /> <br /> Naturally and slowly, things start to go. bump, and our brothers and sisters go on a mission around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this hostile island with its strange inhabitants. But in truth, you will not care what happens, because folklore and fairy tales are incorporated to further plot the plot. What really drove him into the realm of bad comedy was his involuntarily misplaced and out of the ordinary moments that drew pitiful laughs at his sheer stupidity until they were explained much later. It is one thing to try to present and present something intelligent, but another thing to do it in a convincing way and fill in the gaps. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it lasts less than 90 minutes - I think it's a horror movie phenomenon to have it a performance benchmark - it gives that feeling of almost two hours with his slow build up to say what he wants. Things are starting to get better in the last 20 minutes, but it's a classic case of too little, too late. <br /> <br /> What saves the film is how it changes course and its revelation in the end. Again, this is a device commonly used to try to turn a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little extra in the hope of seducing an audience. This has proven rather satisfying, but leaves a bad aftertaste because you will feel a little deceived. A twist will make you feel in two ways: either it raises the film to a memorable level, or gives you that hokey feeling. Unfortunately, the forbidden siren belonged more to the latter. <br /> <br /> The backup will be its cinematography with its use of light, shadows and mirrors, but I will also be explicit: it's still not worth it, so better to avoid that.
