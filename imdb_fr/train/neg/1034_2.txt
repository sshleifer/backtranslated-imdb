After the success of Scooby-Doo, Where are You, they decide to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that forever ruined the success of Scooby-Doo. They invented a new show with a new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo who made this show a total failure, probably for adults and children together. Scrappy was the stupid brave puppy who always looked ready to hit someone. Scooby and Shaggy were starting to be afraid of the bad guy and were also trying to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not need boring little nephews of bastard puppies. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they would either have to kill or never think about Scrappy. It was just poor, maybe your kids will prefer it!
