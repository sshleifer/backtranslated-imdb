The "Confidential" part was intended to take advantage of the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name, while the topic of the racket of work was part of the surveys of the day of the Congress. However, despite the distribution of a category A film and good story ideas, the film goes on for 73 minutes. It is a cheap production. It takes a little imagination to compensate for poor production values, especially from the uninspired director, Sidney Salkow. Some shots in broad daylight, for example, would have relieved the succession of sad studio trays. An elegant helmsman like Anthony Mann might have done something with this thick material, but Salkow sees it as just another payment exercise. Too bad Brian Keith's typical understated style does not work here, as if it were just woody and lethargic, but at the same time, the cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. presents himself as a drunken person with crazy eyes. Obviously, Salkow is not an actor. But you have to give it to Beverly Garland, that sassy little girl, who treats her role with verve and dedication characteristics. Too bad, she was not in charge. My advice: skip it, unless you like the ridiculous bar girls who do nothing but spill whiskeys in the typical '50s straitjacket style.
