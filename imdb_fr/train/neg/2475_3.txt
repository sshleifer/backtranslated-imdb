I was disappointed. the movie was a bit predictable and did not respect the hype plastered all over the box. That said, the characters were well developed, the myth of Windego was used in a unique place and the house was rather scary, but it just missed me. I kept waiting for that big AHHHHH or BOO! But that never came. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was plagued by poor filming of special effects mediocre. That's why showing too many bad things and not using the viewer's mood and imagination to create horror and suspense. Try movies like Session 9 or the Cube if you're looking for a low-budget but well-crafted horror movie.
