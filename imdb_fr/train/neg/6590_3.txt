The reviews I read for this movie were pretty good, so I decided to check. BAD IDEA! This is another film about a ghost to take revenge on a group of friends. The story is stupid, mix two parts of Ringu with a party of Prom Night, a pinch of I know what you did last summer, and add a touch of Single White Female - mix until now completely absurd . There is nothing new in this plot, and revisiting the clich√©s to which I am so attached has not even been entertaining. This film jumps too often to the past and, once I understood everything, I realized that it still did not make much sense. The characters range from healthy minds to psycho killers in the blink of an eye. Speaking of characters, these are all your stereotypical favorites - the greedy selfish advocate, the egocentric actress, the dreaded baseball star, the video voyeur, the bitter girl, the scary and silent girl, the nice girl "kinder than nice ", a fucking black cat ... and I did not care. Maybe a better writer could have made the movie work, there were some decent scenes, but overall, this movie was a disaster. I should also mention a certain "videotape" that it would have been impossible to film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst Asian horror that has to offer from afar, but it's still pretty serious. If you just want to see scary images in the dark, or if you just want to laugh at the actor, or if you just want to shout "you're stupid!" on a movie screen, or if you just want to have another Asian horror flick your neck when someone asks you how much you've seen - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those who seek a land worthy of the name go elsewhere.
