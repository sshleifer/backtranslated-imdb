Last night, I watched this movie on FX and, while watching it, I thought it might be the worst movie of all time. Bad acting, bad cinematography, bad sound, totally incredible combat sequences, stupid characters. All this makes the most ridiculously bad movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I was captivated by his blatant lack of semi-competent skills and I had to keep watching ... and they did a sequel!
