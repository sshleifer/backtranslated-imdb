One of the worst movies I have ever seen. My only thought was, "How can I get my money back from Hollywood Video?" It is not worth four dollars or any dollar. I think it was an attempt to rip off The Mexican, or Vin Diesel's movies, but it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The acting game was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors that they could not find anything better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We called the lines in front of the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the main woman was exaggeratedly exaggerated, worse than a caricature. <br /> <br /> Ignore it.
