The film was shot in 1942 and at the time of the Second World War, the film industry decided to take advantage of the presence of spies. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun to watch because of Eleanor Powell's fabulous dance. The late Miss Powell was certainly an excellent saboteur in every sense of the word. She is again paired with a very young Red Skelton. Both also played in "I Dood It." <br /> <br /> Moroni Olsen, who, 3 years later, was superb as the interrogating officer in "Mildred Pierce" reappeared as an officer asking Powell to deliver an item. The problem is that Olsen and his crooks are really Japanese spies. <br /> <br /> Bert Lahr is his usual brilliance here and he gets wide support from Virginia O'Brien.
