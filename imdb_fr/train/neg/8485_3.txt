Death scenes with guns shooting noiselessly at a character called Fiend. All this is tedious, slow and unimaginative. It was good to see the guy with the cape and the hunchback. Visually, it was scary and probably occupied the public of the time, but even in 1936, one would have thought that it would have needed a little more imagination and plausibility for such a film. I was always waiting for something important as people were making speeches and acting as if they were posing in front of a picnic in the office. And then there are these bullets as a previous commentator mentioned. Perhaps the best clue would have been to look for a water point in the pocket of a pair of pants.
