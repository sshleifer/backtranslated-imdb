The only reason I'm commenting is because I finally understood why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all did it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than the one they shot. Last episode of the death of our favorite nurse, grumpy and loving Jesus, Dr. Cox shaves his head. They had to show them out of order for some reason and forgot that they had dropped continuity. For shame, Scrubs. They have already made mistakes like this one. I remember when Elliot was trying to go out with Scott Foley and her hair was wet 2 seconds before the water hit her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show should intensify it.
