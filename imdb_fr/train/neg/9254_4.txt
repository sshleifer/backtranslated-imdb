Resnais, wow! The genius that brought us to Hiroshima Mon Amour takes up the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in bright colors. The opening voiceover with old inter-titles embellished was a good idea. Then, the opening of the camera opens (like the old cranks) on a black and white sign. The camera moves back (or rather rises), suddenly showing us the amazingly bright colors of an elegant table prepared for a dancing reception. All this in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> The music starts then. A rather banal and forgettable diddy, with an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls who shout nonsense that have no relevance to the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can not blame the subtitles). These characters go to the door and are replaced by more people who enter an even more forgettable song. Then they leave and Audrey Tautou finally appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes after the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Resnais wanted with a loss of time so musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to throw bowling on the screen and run away. I endured. <br /> <br /> It has not been much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We do not even see their faces half the time (Resnais seems too determined to show the expensive landscape to worry about people in front of the camera). People go up and down like moths around a lamp and we, the public, are unable to focus on a particular person or plot. It's like you're taking every episode of Brady Bunch in a two-hour movie. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me watch as long as I did (1 hour) was that I was looking at camera techniques, lighting and landscapes that were, I admit, excellent . But is it enough to hold your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I will try to look at the end. Aw, who am I kidding. I have more important things to do. I'm sure you too. Skip this.
