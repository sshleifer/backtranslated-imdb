Unhinged follows the typical plot of the slasher trend of the early 80's. Pretty Young Girls In Peril. I have to give up the film for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the first shots of the trip. You think that the production will be of quality. Watching "Unhinged" was like watching an amateur theater class warm up. Some of the most embarrassing, poorly lit, and long scenes occur as a result of an overdose of Valium. I was wondering why they did not just put the memory cards on the camera so the actresses did not have to change their eyes constantly. The two main girls were obviously chosen for their T & A factor rather than for their talent. Laurel Munson as Terry's main chick is as exciting as watching the paint dry. Two nude scenes for a teen thrill. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as a mad and scary girl and mother, the girls find themselves stuck in the competition for Worst Acting Ever. Long pauses, strange expressions, the emphasis on the wrong word, everything is there and makes the happiness of those of us who love bad movies. Scenes suddenly change with long blackouts to which you could drive a Mack truck. A flash of cartoon hangs on the shots without even bothering to show the sky. The eye shadows of the 80s assail the viewer. But you know, it grew on me. I felt sorry for that. I wanted to take her in my arms, kiss her boo-boos and improve her. The end does not make up for the damage, but I smile anyway. I have my own theories about "forbidden" hype and I hope everyone who chooses to watch this movie will do so with a lot of addiction and a sense of humor. Otherwise pass.
