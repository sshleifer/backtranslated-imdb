When I heard about "Down To Earth", I was very excited. I'm a big fan of Chris Rock, he was particularly hilarious in Dogma. But this film turned out to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not as good as his previous performances and the film was very poorly done as a whole. <br /> <br /> First of all, Chris Rock. He plays the whole movie as a comic routine. Obviously, it works well in the scenes where he's supposed to be standing, but in the rest of the movie, that's not the case. Even when he's talking to another character, he seems to think he's trying to make a crowd laugh. He had some fun moments, but they mostly happen during the stand-up scenes (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they're practically there to give Rock a person to talk to, none of them stand out. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was poorly made. The film basically has a plot of a joke: an old white man behaving like a young black comedian. Although I prefer movies with more than one joke, it would still have worked and be quite funny. The problem was that we saw too much rock and not enough old white. It's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy who tells Chris Rock's jokes, but most of the time, we only see Chris Rock, so it's not that funny. The few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy who talks like Rock are actually hilarious. If we had shown him more, the movie would have been a lot more funny. <br /> <br /> In general, a few bursts of laughter can not compensate for the fact that "Down To Earth" is badly played, and misdirected. This one was a pretty big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
