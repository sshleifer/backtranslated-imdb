What a crime ... <br /> <br /> You forgot to brush your teeth ... let's do a 30-minute show about it and ask some kids to make a noise and then make sure that the father gives them a lecture, What he has to do. <br /> <br /> But do not forget that Uncle Joey has to make strange noises and baked faces, so Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and jeans and look pretty for a few minutes, while everyone is talking about how mom would have done things if she was there. <br /> <br /> Yeah, full of crazy little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and a long story to build around her. <br /> <br /> Full House will not only annoy you to tears, but will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would.
