Daniella has some problems to solve under her attractive exterior. She begins to lose her mind when she discovers a distant relative (who she looks like) who was burned to be a werewolf. She gets a bit fierce when she bangs horny men and slits their throats. She ends up finding a man who helps to contain her inner beast but when others destroy their happiness, she extracts her violent and furious revenge. a good crowd movie. We could have a good time listening to the bad interpretation / dubbing / translation and the sheer simplicity of the production. But alone, he moves slowly but has enough nudity to keep you awake, barely.
