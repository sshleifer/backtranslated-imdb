This is, apparently, a film about multiple grief. As such, it should move viewers and make them empathic to the fate of the main characters. However, his post-modern irritating style makes him almost incomprehensible. The camera continually switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to another, creating a jerky and disjointed effect. Most characters seem to lead a life without purpose or structure, united by their professional commitments. (It is also credible that a man who has just been sentenced to death may want to engage in sex with a woman he has just met). The scenario (if there is one) is hard to follow. In summary, the overall effect is rather disappointing. Nevertheless, the acting is generally good and some scenes are quite powerful.
