A stolen train thief near Yuma frees his group and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for the murder of his wife (as well as a hidden gold reserve that remains hidden thanks to the scriptwriter). Attempting to bring the Western genre into line with the violence and brutality of the 1970s is not even in the same category as some of the new westerns from the late 1960s. It's incredibly simple and square, the characters women are only sacks and rape victims. As a former sheriff at the top of the hierarchy, Charlton Heston gives one of his laziest and least inspired performances of all time (he has a good time, trying to read a letter and looking for his glasses) . James Coburn, as a half-crazy half-breed, is also pretty much an auto pilot, but Coburn has the means to turn even the most terrifying dialogues and situations into something thorny and disturbing. It's his show all the way. * 1/2 of ****
