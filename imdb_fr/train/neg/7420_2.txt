a romance without feeling, a drama of problems without a point (or drama) ... This film is supposed to be all that and fails every time, as if it were not trying. Or as if the director / publisher / writer team was not really trying. The actors are capable - they need better support. <br /> <br /> One of the things that does not fail is George Delarue's score. Beautiful and moving. What a pity it is attached to this film. In a good movie, actors' words, movements, and music help to synchronize and improve impact. This publisher stuck to the music without regard for dialogue and movement. The love scene is particularly annoying in this respect: an insult to the talents of the main actors. <br /> <br /> Another element of the film is effective: the photograph of place. Including a moment at the Grand Central Station. I had guessed in advance what was going to happen; but the way it was filmed in this environment was breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Some commentators of this forum have pointed out that the assimilation by the United States of Nazi criminal scientists had really occurred during those years of fright MacCarthy. As soon as the film begins to take a serious interest in American society, it shifts to conventional romanticism. before any human feeling can move us, we go for a predictable (thriller) getaway. <br /> <br /> Just as the film insults the talents of the actors, it insults the problems that it claims (and fails) to take. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
