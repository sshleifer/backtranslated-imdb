After watching Revolt Of The Zombies with the future Oscar winner Dean Jagger, I was left with just one burning question. How has a society that created these ultimate war-fighting machines ever been defeated? <br /> <br /> That's the question you ask yourself if you take the time to watch Revolt Of The Zombies. Towards the end of the First World War, the French discovered a busy Cambodian cult where these undead to death with bullets form a brigade of monks who go above and dislodge the Hun. <br /> <br /> scares the living fecal matter of all concerned so that an international expedition is formed to discover how to destroy the secret of these zombies so that no nation can get their hands on and rule the world . <br /> <br /> But we got some dissent in those ranks. The first is the wicked Snidely Whiplash, Roy D'Arcy, who assassinates the Buddhist monk who has the secret and the second is Dean Jagger. Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac, as we all know, and he is determined to seduce Dorothy Stone from his rival Robert Noland. <br /> <br /> I think you have an idea of ​​how this will happen, especially since the birth of a zombie breed. do not conquer the world for a country. Dean Jagger as he got the Oscar for Twelve O'Clock High had to shudder every time he thought about this film and the terrible dialogue he was trying to give a spark of sincerity. <br /> <br /> Moral of the story, you could make an ultimate warrior with the potion of zombies and zombie singing, but you can not make a slave of ultimate love.
