It is a very serious production. The general consensus has always been that, although Princess Margaret may have been spoiled and pampered and rejoiced at the excess of luxury she has, she was a very beautiful young woman. This was the weakest point of production, the actress did not succeed in making it understood. It also appeared that the production budget could not go as far as a hairdresser - from the outset, the hair of Princess Margaret's character had a permanent bird's nest in an air of distress and seemed to have been dragged into a bush . The actor playing the Duke of Edinburgh seemed to have prepared his part by watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles. It was a joke. <br /> <br /> The production was a flaw, a clich√© and an embarrassing waste load. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
