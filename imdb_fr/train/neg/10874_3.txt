I just finished a marathon in this series and it has become scary to see its evolution. From fictional historical elements to O'Herlihy's dreadful emphasis in later episodes, the series collapses as it moves forward. If you're looking for low-quality WW2 general production fluffs, then I recommend season 1, but you avoid anything after that, it escalates into a soap opera, with a darker scenario and increased sensitivity. The old black and white movie is by far the best of any form of entertainment to which the name Colditz is attached, and even that is not what one could hope for.
