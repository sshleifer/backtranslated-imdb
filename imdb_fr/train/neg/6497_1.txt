In fact, I had high hopes in this film, so I took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best. About a third of the film, I just had to give up. Quite simply, the film is a mix of things that go on for no apparent reason and everything is disconnected. I love movies that make you think, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas gathered and never really connected. <br /> <br /> Do not think it's David Lynch, as some would have you believe, nowhere near this field other than a few triumphant visuals. To say that it is artistic to conceal the fact that there is no plot or apparent story is simply a way or justification of why you lost an hour and a half in the movie. The acting was good, but that can not save the lack of history. I agree with the comment previously posted ... "It's like being in someone else's head ... while they're taking drugs," in other words, nothing makes sense.
