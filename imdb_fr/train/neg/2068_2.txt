The Gospel of Lou was a major disappointment to me. The theater had sent me an e-mail telling him it was a great and inspiring film. It was neither awesome nor inspiring. Cinematography was rather uncertain with all the film. Many scenes were flashbacks that were done in a way that could not sometimes tell what they were talking about. Voices were often distorted for no reason. In addition, many people in the film were extravagant. The relationship he has with his ex-son is never clear. Plus, the whole movie has more than one meaning, and suddenly BAM is healed and inspires people. The whole film seems to show that boxing is one of the bad things in his life, making him live his life as he lives it, but when he changes, he does not leave boxing, he teaches others how to box. Thumbs down.
