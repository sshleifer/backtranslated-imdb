This movie was still another waste of time ... Why oh why do I keep renting shit like that? ... someone please tell me ... * sigh * Oh well. Back to movie: Zero Cube is probably worth it if you REALLY REALLY liked the first movie (as I did) and you just want to see what's going on in the last movie (hopefully) gathered just for keep some actors and screenwriters employed, so of course, this film is for you. But if you are looking for a good movie with a good acting and a fantastic plot ... * a diabolical smile *, then this movie is for you :-D .... OK, I'm lying ... At best , this film is nil. OK, I must admit that some elements were cool ... well ... cool ... and I laughed many times, always bad things, but I had fun all the same. :-) But all in all, the few things that are barely in the "ok" category are not enough for this film to be worth it. Unless you count "Manos - Hand of Fate" among the top ten movies of all time!
