I really would have liked not to write this review. I am a Christian, so I looked forward to seeing this film. It sounded great - a Christian movie with some pretty famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing (not that I buy the Bible code itself - you can make it say whatever you want, I believe it, but I believe all in the Bible). So I sit on the edge of my seat watching the clips, when the film starts and manages to destroy my mood in a few minutes. I had to bite my lip not to comment on the terrible writing and drama while I was at the theater (I would have been torn apart by people cheering rather clumsy but fundamentally uplifting scenes and breathless in front of what was incredibly obvious and predictable, scenes of tension, I'm sure). Once the final credits started rolling, however, I could think. I liked a lot of parts of the movie - mostly unexpected twists, really special effects (I do not count Visions, which were poorly done), and some interesting technical work - fades, backgrounds, type of thing . Unfortunately, I had the distinct impression that if I read the book of Apocalypse to a monkey and put it in front of a typewriter for an hour, I could have had a better script. And the music was more than corny (even for a Bond fan who likes a little old-fashioned music in action and intrigue scenes). So I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater - like the people who came out crying and gasping for the incredible feeling that it was - but I'm not someone who can be soothed by a writer who casts words on a Biblical Shell and slaps a Christian stamp. I need a good script and a credible dialogue before I can enjoy most movies, which I did not have either. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And that's the tragedy. When will we see intelligent Christian fiction? He must be somewhere over there ...
