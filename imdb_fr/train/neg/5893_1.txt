This film was fantastic, a fantastic movie, scary like hell. and I mean it made me panic as much as heartbeat and computer and omen, and so on. but with a good movie comes a crap ending no? RIGHT! this end of film was pathetic. I mean a ghost back in time in a chick house and he thinks now that I did that means that I can call him and that it will be the right time because she thinks it. right? false. my ass! I do not care if the ghost is Satan, it does not happen. it's a movie, yes, but most perverse films or rented movies like this are supposed to make sense, but that was not the case. it just showed us what I just said and people do not think about it. can anyone tell me why you did not notice this pathetic part? the movie for me ended at the hospital and that's it.
