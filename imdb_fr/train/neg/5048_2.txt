I tried. I really did. I thought that if I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance, I could enjoy his film. I know that after seeing O FANTASMA, I felt very sick and almost disgusted, but some critics were pretty good and supportive, and I thought, "What are you doing wrong? Sometimes it is better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without prior anesthesia to alleviate the horror of pain. I often wonder if it would be better to return to my childhood and ask my old tyrants to let me really have it. On other occasions, I often think that the world is really flat and if I get away from it enough, I'm not going to just get away from everything, but I'm going to fall into the water and something badly, Lovecraftian, will tear me up with its 9000 tentacles and squeeze life - and some fries from 1995, still in my esophagus - out of me. <br /> <br /> Is there a reason for Odete? I would not say at all ... just that maybe his creator thought that writing a story centered on his madness (which gives Alex Forrest the air of Strawberry Shortcake) not only looked scary, but she was completely exhausted. She first decides to leave her current boyfriend (in hysterical hysteria) because she wants a child and he thinks they are too young. Later, she attends the funeral of a homosexual man and - take this - to get closer to him, she pretends to be pregnant while insinuating herself into the life of the mother and the lover of the deceased. Oh, of course, she screams like a banshee and throws not one, but three times on her grave. And there is this ridiculous case that it gradually becomes "Pedro" that sums up a weak explanation like a tea that says that love does not know the genre. Or something. <br /> <br /> I would say she's as crazy as a cashew can, unsalted. But again, it's the director. And me, for having tried my luck. At least the men look good. Other than that ... not much to see here.
