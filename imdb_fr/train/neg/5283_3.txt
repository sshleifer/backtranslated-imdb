I was looking forward to the first screening of this movie since it was given to me on DVD at Christmas. After booking a special spot for that last night, I sat down to watch it with my daughter (aged 17 and a student in film studies), with chocolates of course, looking forward to it. We love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> After the first two minutes only, we knew we were sunk. The shaky camera shots and angles, the poor general cinematography, the stagings and the wooden performances had already left us speechless. Disappointed, we looked on. <br /> <br /> Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked weird and aimless, directly at the camera several times, breaking our hard-won 'fantasy of the moment' and engaging us, we're almost at looking for trackers. <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played the role of Captain Wentworth, did his best with the script and direction, bless him. I hope they paid him well, however, because he was practically drowned once by a huge wave that broke the dike, soaking him and his co-actor. They were almost washed away at sea. Health and safety would have had a day on the ground! Poor Rupert was left spitting sea water to deliver his line. Presumably, there was not enough money in the kitty to re-shoot this scene. Any sensible person would not have tried it that day. <br /> <br /> Other than Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance of Lady Russell, but her efforts were quickly counterbalanced. by the unconvincing portrait of Anthony Head of the boring Sir Walter Elliott. <br /> <br /> Towards the long-awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth seemed strangely grateful to Anne on a visit every two seconds after trying to avoid her for the majority of the film. It was as if he had developed a memory disorder that made him forget his reason for being. On the other hand, Anne ran, hyper-ventilated, pillar stationed in search of the good captain who, meanwhile, had managed to appeal to almost all of Bath, we are told, in the space of only three or four minutes, without even having perspired. <br /> <br /> None of Anne's charms crossed the screen. Indeed, we wondered what the charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen with Anne, simple and voiceless, and why no one, whoever, said anything, leaving Sir Walter about to shut his mouth. <br /> <br /> The crucial kiss, normally our favorite moment of the girls, was painfully shot from the outside. As they got closer, Anne continued to open and close her mouth, causing the screen to look like chewing gum before her lips finally joined. . Eww! <br /> <br /> The most pleasant thing about last night was the chocolates and the half-hour exchange of views between mother and daughter about the gravity of the film. <br /> <br /> What a pity to spoil a story so fascinating and engaging filmed in some of the most beautiful landscapes of England. <br /> <br /> Sorry Jane.
