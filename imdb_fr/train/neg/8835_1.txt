Before watching this movie, I read a review in which it was written that this movie could be one of the best movies of all time !? ha ha Scene by scene, the tension goes up well ... boring characters of this film. From the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy, to the killer running without warning (and who was the guy at the beach chatting with the little boy !?) .. things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this movie. As I watched, the movie seemed to go in one direction, but go nowhere else, but in a new direction ... and so on ... <br /> <br /> The acting game is awesome, but the writing is horrible. Every character, in every scene, says or does something so incredible, unrealistic and the reactions of other actors are just strange. The problems developed throughout the film are unresolved, which makes it a source of confusion and a considerable waste of time.
