I thought I read somewhere that this was Monogram's latest production, but whether it's true or not, it does not matter, otherwise it should have been. It's a dull and deadly affair featuring John Carradine, a little greyish in the hair, to pretend to be an older scientist who is experimenting with the help of his young apprentice (Robert Shayne) to bring the dead back to life . Whenever their subjects are revived, they seem to have a whitish face, like marble, while they are lying close to the laboratory table (big deal). Carradine manages to revive his faithful dog after his death, and the dog acquires an unusual ability to ghostly cross the walls (wooooooooohhhh). That's about all she wrote. <br /> <br /> For an ultra-economical monogram product, this solution uses at least one more sophisticated lab configuration than is normally allocated. The funniest joke in the film is that "old" Dr. Carradine constantly refers to his "young" assistant Shayne as "me boy" when in fact Carradine was 40 years old and Shayne was 45 years old. when they did it!
