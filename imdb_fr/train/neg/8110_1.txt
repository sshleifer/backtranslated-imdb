I think Phillip Kaufman read the Notes version of the Kundera novel from the cliff, and then started making this film. Okay, of course, it will not have the punch of the original. Kundera's novels are excellent because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to get in and out of the stories he builds. This movie does not even try! The sequence of a dream of Tereza, so essential to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and makes no sense. Also, and this may be a minor point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller (I know it's not a valid complaint, but hey). A perfect example of the Hollywoodization of otherwise fine literature.
