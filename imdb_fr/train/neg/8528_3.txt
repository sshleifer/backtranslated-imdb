What is written on the poster is: "At birth, he was given 6 years to live ... At age 34, he makes the journey of his life." Friend is an Israeli of American origin who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at the age of one year. At the age of 34, after love for his 22-year-old caregiver did not go well, he decided to come to the United States to face the doctor who said he would not more than 6 years to live. He wanted to show the doctor that he was still alive and weighing 39 pounds. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, although I have seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is brave to live when he can only move his left index finger, but why is he so angry with the doctor who diagnosed his illness 34 years ago? His doctor just told his mother that, based on medical history, people with his disease would not live long. What is the use of going to the old doctor's door? Why is the search for this old doctor in the United States a journey during his lifetime? There are so many things that could interest us in Ami's life: how can he do these animations with the movement of a single finger? How can he go through everyday life while totally dependent on others? How did he experience his doctor's prediction? How does he treat emotionally when others regard him as a strange creature? The film did not tell us anything about it. Instead, the filmmaker took a van and organized a trip to allow Ami to show up at the door of his former doctor to show him that he is still alive. I thought it was a joke.
