Elephants Dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community. And while this is a very interesting idea conceptually, it fails miserably in reality. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only redeeming factor. However, a huge problem with them is the excessive excessive use of light proliferation. It's horrible, although I guess it helps to give the film a dreamlike quality. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is the game of the terrible voice. While Proog's voice actor is at least half-skilled, Emo's voice actor is HORRIBLE. I imagine that when you have a virtually zero budget, you can not afford to hire real actors. It seems to me that they hired one of the animators to make his voice. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is not going anywhere. For me, it looks more like a movie "look what we can do" than a real movie. The plot goes nowhere and fails to really show an interesting point. The whole film gives the impression that it was conceived as an excuse to create interesting areas. <br /> <br /> Overall, it may be worthwhile to quickly download the official site, but do not expect nice graphics.
