This film seemed to be entertaining and interesting from his description. But for me, it was a little disappointing. Very slow and hard to follow and see what was going on. It was as if the filmmaker was taking individual pieces of film, tossing them in the air and making them stick together, no matter how they landed (certainly not in a sequential order). In addition, nothing important was filmed. I watched a lot of different Korean movies and noticed that a good part was well made and required a bit of reflection from the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood movie. But this one confused me. I watched the movie a second and third time and it still brought me nothing. I still do not understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey. If it was just to show a mundane part of a person's life, I guess he was successful. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can not recommend this film to anyone.
