When I saw this film on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Apparently, it was not. I do not know how this movie was allowed to appear on this site. FearNet is a site that features scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful from all actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The film begins with a man with a parchment on which is inscribed a signia. He breaks the seal and some disasters happen. The water becomes bloody, the oceans go out, the moon turns red, and so on. <br /> <br /> The female character was also annoying. Many things she had done made no sense. Like when she sees a piece of paper with a date. Coincidentally, this is the date when she should give birth to her baby and she starts to panic about it and begins to research and ask the religious what all this means. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <The two worst things that happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally handicapped man who claims that God told him to murder his parents and the end of Demi Moore's death after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul to it. <br /> Here is what happens. The mentally deficient is shot at and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore goes to the hospital after an earthquake and gives birth to her child. She touches her child's head, transfers her soul into the child and then dies. So, the apocalypse stops. <br /> <br /> Why does God suddenly have a change of heart? He gets furious when the governor authorizes the execution of a man with an intellectual disability, so he only speaks of forgiveness as soon as a single woman transfers her soul to her baby? <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty stupid. It is another religious propaganda of the world. The roles of Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and all the others are excellent. That's about all there is. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars. Good acting with a lot of nonsense!
