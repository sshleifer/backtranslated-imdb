I'm probably one of the few viewers not to recommend this movie. Thoughtfully mind-blowing like all of Ang Lee's work (every still image seems worthy of an impression), I was really disappointed by the film's incoherent rhythm. It was really too long. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in the Civil War era, Missouri, and speaks of a young man (Roedel) joining the ferocious forces of the Bushwackers, a kind of Confederate sympathizer renegades who lead the fighter-type gypsy with the Jayhawkers, their counterparts in the Union. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles, played by Skeet Ulrich, join the group after Chile's father is shot at close range and his house is set on fire, presumably by Jayhawkers. The story follows the adventures of Roedel and Chiles and their interactions with other victims of the war, including a former slave who fights for the Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright) and a military widow played by Jewel. <br /> <br /> It seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point, it turned to another subplot and left things underdeveloped. For example, the unrest among Roedel's group caused by the former Holt slave's participation in the Confederate cause is briefly illustrated by a conflict over ownership and protocol and then abandoned until a later stage of the film. A young criminal / executioner Bushwhacker hates Roedel and runs a lot of anguish and violence against him, but you never know why. Some characters never seem to surface. I think this is due to the fact that the film contains too much of it and that it deals with large amounts of history. <br /> <br /> The historical details were excellent. I liked to watch the accommodations, the furniture, the clothes, etc., and I thought that the main actors did a great job of humanizing the characters, even if they stumbled with the dialogue. Unless you really enjoy the story or are a big fan of Ang Lee, try your luck.
