This is not one of those criticisms about poor special effects or technology, or dating, problems that only the most idiotic people could understand, but rather a critique of the narrative, which interests most of we. <Br /> <br /> The plot concerns a combination of members of the German navy and World War II, and two civilians (the hero and the heroine), who are pushed together on a German boat and end up in a wild country of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The manipulations are not so bad compared to the standards of the film, and we know from the plot that the realism is not going to be high. This kind of film requires credible and friendly characters, as well as a semblance of reason in the actions. <br /> <br /> This film lacks both. For a feature film, only 6 characters are shown at any time, and 3 of them are barely examined. McClure's hero goes beyond "routine" and makes no sense, no matter the time. <br /> <br /> The woman seems to be looking for an answer to an enigma about the country of the dinosaurs in which she came, but the riddle is not really an enigma, and we do not care. <br /> <br /> Many failures in a film that should have been better, even for its time.
