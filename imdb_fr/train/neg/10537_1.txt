What can you say about an adaptation of Barbara Cartland? <br /> <br /> There are incredible actors in this film (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but they clearly record the benefits. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert participated in two other Cartland epics: Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks embarrassed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see an "adaptable" Cartland, that of Bonham Carter is the one to choose ("Chance of heart" - what title!) Gilbert is the weakest link in this field, but Bonham Carter is of a decent beauty and can of course play the main role, and the rest of the cast plays the game with the tongue in the cheeks (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)
