There seems to be an overwhelming response to this film, but nobody has the insight to criticize its methodology, which is extremely imperfect. He continues to propagate journalistic-style analysis, that is, he plays with the lack of public knowledge and prejudices to evoke emotional discouragement and an explosion of negative rants. <br /> <br /> Journalism 101: tell the viewer certain facts only in order to predispose them to draw predictable conclusions. for example, the idea of ​​civil war, chaos, looting, etc. was supposed to be an unexpected reaction to the collapse of government infrastructure following Saddam Hussein's demise: were not they all symptomatic of an already poor culture? doctrinal quarrels as a symptom of these veins of Islam itself, rather than a failure of the police to hold back and secure? Would they prefer that the United States declare the Marshall Act? I'm sure the newspapers here would have exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force. <br /> <br /> Apart from the analytic idiocy of the film, it takes some sidelinists and leaves the rest aside claiming "So-and-so refused to be interviewed ..." Yet, the hundred investigations that these people have already received undoubtedly answer the questions they would have asked. As vice-president, would you be interviewed by an author / producer for the first time, who was certainly already ready to misrepresent your comments? They could not roll Condi's tape to show his opinion and answer some of the questions logistics. Perhaps they have never watched his audience. <br /> <br /> It's far from being a neutral overview of the market situation. the land there. This is another biased approach of journalists, who are usually unthinking herds. <br /> <br /> Anyone wishing to comment on the war should have at least based his ideas on elements a little more reliable than NBC coverage and CNN commentary. these interpretations have the same vitriol that simply creates a new bipartisanship of those who want to think and those who want the media to say what to think.
