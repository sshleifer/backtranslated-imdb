It was the worst film I saw at the WorldFest and it also received the least applause after! I can only think that he receives such recognition based on the number of actors known in the film. It's great to see J.Beals but she's only been in the movie for a few minutes. Mr. Parker is a much better actress than the authorized party. The rest of the game is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unfriendly and therefore boring to watch. There is no real emotional depth in the story. A film about an actor who can not find work does not seem very original. Neither the development of the cop. It feels like one of the many video films I saw in the 90s ... and not even in the standards. <br /> <br />
