Dolph Lundgren broods and walks his way through this incoherent mystery / thriller that is not as cool as the box would have you believe. It's actually quite good here, but the story is a jumble of B-movie clich√©s (detectives, revenge, tycoons, prostitutes, S & M) that seem to have been invented as and when. The film picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent film of Lundgren, rent RED SCORPION instead.
