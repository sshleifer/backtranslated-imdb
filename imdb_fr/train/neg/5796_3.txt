I saw this feature film as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and was horrified by the childish graphic and sado-masochistic pornography that I witnessed. The scenario is hidden under too many graphic sex scenes - and none of them are erotic -, the more the feeling is sick. The director seemed to go for the shock value rather than explore the different levels of why these characters are like that. See if you can handle it - I still have flashbacks.
