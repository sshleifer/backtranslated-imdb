I borrowed this film from the library to think that it could be delicious. How wrong I am! <br /> <br /> It's such a bad movie that I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is so bad in the film that it is very painful to watch the scene with her. She's a pretty girl, but in this film she's not at all attractive, but I'll have to witness her clumsy attempt to seduce almost all the other main characters. It's so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> And the film's dialogue is so pretentious, and it does not have the humorous fact of making it acceptable. <br /> <br /> Totally a failure.
