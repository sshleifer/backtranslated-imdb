Camera Work - Why is the camera work in this movie so nervous? It's boring and distracting. Editing - The stills of the still images were too short. Many other scenes were too short too. Just flashes. His - the background music was too loud and covered the voices. We should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said. Does not anyone check these things and force them to do it again? Please reduce the volume of background music in the future. Is the adjustment of relative sound levels the work of the publisher, Julia Wong? The plot had too many ends. The baseline scenario had potential. I think the film needed more work. Was it precipitated? Maybe they ran out of money. Like many movies, the movie started well at first, but it fell at the end. I really do not understand that, you know you have the storyboard before it goes into production, so why are not all useless details supported in the storyboard? <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so critical.
