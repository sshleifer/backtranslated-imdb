Brief summary: This film belittles everyone he touches. It means you. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that I am not a purist and that it could have been funny for a few minutes. Imitations are not bad. But overall, it's dull and not funny. Some simple jokes are repeated again and again. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this film exists only to draw the last dollars of Laurel and Hardy, whose brand is now recognized. Producers can have no real consideration for their place in the history of cinema, nor for their talents. That's what offended me the most. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked it, so I'm also a failure as a parent;)
