Doc Savage: The bronze man is a horrible movie. Wrong writing, over-acted and just silly. That being said ... it's actually a nice film on a certain level. This film needs to be viewed in a group with a plentiful supply of cheap beer. It's one of those films like "Santa Claus conquers the Martians" or "Yor, the hunter of the future" ... too bad, it's almost good. If you have the right group of people, this movie is an explosion to watch. It's campy. It's funny. It has a Sousa theme. If you are looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> BTW, I've heard rumors that some studios are exploring the possibility of a remake ...
