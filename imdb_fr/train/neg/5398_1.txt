This complacent mess may have put Kibosh on Branagh's career as Shakespeare's film adapter. (Published 4 years ago, not a small adaptation since.) I just watched this on the cable - Holy God, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I agree with the feeling of a reviewer below who said this: to review something so obvious and sad is an ungenerous act that seems acute. That being said, I will take the risk, if only because * Love's Labor Lost * is the ideal reward for those who overestimated Mr. Branagh's leadership abilities in the past. Branagh has always been a rather ugly director: a resolutely literal mind; struck by the stars; ruthlessly ungenerous towards his fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but loves himself more, making sure he understands all the good lines). <br /> <br /> Likewise, it's sad that * Love's Labor's Lost * is barely worse than the endless, appalling, bloated * Hamlet * of 1996. In fact, this film may be preferable, only because it is about a third of its length. Branagh decided that it would be a good idea to update this bad Shakespeare work early in Cole Porter's career, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yada yada. So, he posits the thing in 1939, leaves about one-eighth of the text intact in favor of blatant interpretations of the Trenties standards (wait to see the actors mounted on cables to the ceiling during "I'm In Heaven"), and perform actors not known for their dance or singing (itself included). The result is such a surreal disaster that we are stunned that they simply did not call for a horrified halt after looking at the first dailies. I do not even blame the actors. To paraphrase Hamlet, "the scenario is the thing!" Nobody could get away with this hodgepodge: the illustrious old RSC are no better than Alicia Silverstone. Who could play this role? <br /> <br /> Branagh's first mistake was to think that * Love's Labor's Lost * was a piece that was worth filming. Believe me, it's not. It is an anomaly in the Bard's canon, written expressly for an educated coterie of courtiers - NOT the usual public for which he wrote. As a result, there are many precious word games (and TEDIOUS!), References to contemporary scholastic nonsense, parodies of * Euphues * Lyly. . . in other words, it is hardly the kind of material likely to appeal to a large audience. Hell, it does not please an audience already predisposed to Shakespearean comedy. The piece can not be staged without radically cutting the text and "updating" it desperately with a gadget that comes at hand. Branagh's second mistake is to think that Shakespeare's mash could be accompanied by a parallel drive of Gershwin marmalade. It was clear that the idea, or hope, was to make an Elizabethan exercise unintelligible, acceptable to a modern audience, by administering American nostalgic pop culture in the throat at the same time. But again, that begs the question, why bother? <br /> <br />
