I watched this movie a few times and never thought it was that funny, but it's still fun to watch and good for some laughs. <br /> <br /> It's about women working in a company and their boss is a fool and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine and trying to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> The action is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of those 80s stars who plays a good villain, not really mean, but simply unmistakable. Dolly Partin is adorable and fun to watch in comedy and his southern spirit really shines here. Jane Fonda is hello and does little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best in this movie, she has the funniest lines and made me laugh a few times, I must love her. <br /> <br /> I could recommend it to anyone who loves 80s comedy. I like the movie but there are things I do not like. It starts very well and the flow is good, then everything starts to set up at the same time and makes me less concerned about the characters. They all have fantasies about what they would like to do with the boss and, although "cute", I just thought it would slow down the film. As the movie progresses, the funniest things happen, and then again, it slows down, to finish quickly, too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but try if you have not seen it. I think that depending on the mood, it can be more or less friendly.
