This is probably one of the worst "want to be a low budget hit movie" to pay homage to the dinosaur genre. The movie is so predictable that you can go, prepare your dinner, go answer the phone or whatever, and when you get back, you'll know exactly what happened. The special effects are so mediocre that one would think that Lego bricks were used and that the "super fast" dinosaurs were so tame that a pet dog looks like a super predator. The acting game is overcooked. They make so much effort, but there is not enough character behind them to get into the characters and as for the scientist ... Yeah, all right, we know exactly what's going to happen to the blonde to the glasses. Stereotypic has been created for movies like this one. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest you do not be as serious as the actors and the team. And if you really like dinosaurs and you know everything about the world, do not look at them, you could break the screen - the facts are so far away.
