Honestly, it's easily in the top 5 of the worst movies I've ever seen. In part, because it is taken very seriously, unlike ordinary garbage, this movie requires you to get involved emotionally, to feel for the characters and to worry about the alleged conspiracy. <br /> <br /> **** MILD SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> There are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) Intrigue incoherent and totally no -sensique. 2.) Aggressive "MTV" camera on style background. 3.) Moronical characters and holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Let me explain. <br /> <br /> 1.) Apparently, when this film was shot, they could not decide whether or not to make a film about church plots, stigmas, or possession. So guess what? They combined them! An atheist is possessed by a deceased person, who then exposes the stigma to denounce a church plot. How an ordinary man is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained or even spoken. Instead of just saying what he means, he gives him the Stigma. WHY? Why not just spit it? Instead, we see scenes of screaming, loud voices, encrypted messages on cars and writing messages on walls. Apparently, this priest was also a violent man, because the possessed young woman also discovers one of the characters while speaking of this clich√©, "possessed" voice that we have all heard repeatedly. It also starts to be part of my second complaint, because every time the young woman catches the stigma, she also defies the laws of gravity by floating in the air and projecting everything and everyone around her as her own. they were in an earthquake? Why does this happen? Who knows!?! I guess the director thought he looked "cool". <br /> <br /> 2.) This film contains dozens of shots, in slow motion, of course, of birds coming from nowhere and flying away, and the most boring, of drops of water. The apartment of this woman dripping constantly! CONSTANTLY! Logically, the place would probably collapse with so many holes. To recap this complaint, towards the end, and for no reason, the camera cut water bodies dripping, in slow motion, in the opposite direction! WHY!?! I have no idea! It has nothing to do with anything, and again, I bet it's because the director found it "cool". <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters says he became a priest to explain holes in science. It does not make sense to me. I would think that going to church would be enough, but no, he must go through all the rigamarole to become a priest. I just do not buy it. Secondly, there are many holes in the plot, some of which I will develop below. To begin with, when she catches stigma for the first time, the scene ends with an unconscious, bleeding spawn. Then she is in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another approach is towards the end, when the aforementioned "scientific priest" character speaks to the mind who owns the girl. He says, "Take me as your messenger!" Quote not word, but you have the idea. His answer? "You do not have faith, only doubt!" So, because of that, he has an atheist! An atheist has no faith, much less than a scientific priest! And then there is the fact that the object of the conspiracy of this film, this lost gospel (of St. Thomas, I believe) is available in local bookstores. The characters are ready to kill to delete this document, but you can go to a bookstore and buy it. It may be supposed to unfold in another story, where it is not yet well known, but the film never tries to tell us, or even to suggest that it is an alternative event of the discovery of this document. <br /> <In closing, this film is terrible to a spectacular degree. This is my scam, and I feel the need to insult every opportunity I receive. I hate that. Final note: F
