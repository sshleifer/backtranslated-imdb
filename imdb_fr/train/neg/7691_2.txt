Student Seduction finds Sauv√© by Bell's elders, Elizabeth Berkley, on the other side of the office, attracting the attention of young and sturdy Corey Sevier. As far as I'm concerned, I can honestly say that none but one teacher ever did anything hormonally for me when I was a student. It was a Mrs. Diaz who was a music teacher in college. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher at my disposal that Elizabeth Berkley could have played anyway. <br /> <br /> Corey, who is as sexy as he is, is also used to following his path with women, whether they agree or not. The fact that it comes from rich parents reinforces this conviction. He escapes chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to maintain his GPA, she accepts tutor, but do not believe anymore. <br /> <br /> Thus, if he tries a rape and does not get an answer, it hurts his ego. When Berkley breaks the chains and reports the crime to the police, police officers who remember Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau's cases simply do not believe it. Sevier's parents have the means to get good publicity for their boy. <br /> <br /> Student Seduction is an abuse of language, even if there is one. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls, this TV movie was not an ascendant career.
