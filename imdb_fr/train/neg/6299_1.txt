This inept adaptation of one of Martin Amis's weakest novels fails to even make comparisons with other works like the Requiem For A Dream or something written by Irvine Walsh as he struggles to decide if it is a cartoon slap-stick or hyper-realistic hallucination. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully led by William Marsh in saturated hues, a group of school dropouts frequent a mansion waiting for the appearance of three American friends for a weekend of drug taking decadent. And that's all. With the exception of the ridiculous sub-plot ridicule that will soon become nonsense for an extremist sectarian group that expresses itself with the violent murders of personalities of the world elite, be they political or pampered. In the first movie, you know exactly where it's going. <br /> <br /> What does a talented actor like Paul Bettany do in this annoying boredom, poorly written? Made before his rise and Jennifer Connelly, we can be sure that if we had offered this trash, he would have immediately changed agent! To avoid.
