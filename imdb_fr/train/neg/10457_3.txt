What can I say? I'm a secret fan of action and horror movies "over the top". Especially when there is a lot of humor and innuendo, but I'm not a fan of Snake on Plane. <br /> <br /> This film presents three interesting aspects: ?? The comedy of the situation; ?? The horror; and ?? The novelty of hundreds of snakes being from an airplane. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is not written as a horror or a comedy, and there are only 1 or 2 points in the movie where you smile. If you want to get the impression of the movie, the trailer really represents the movie, a horror. <br /> <br /> Second, if you're waiting for a movie full of action and shock, you will not be disappointed. . It does not stand out from other movies, but it still keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Third, although the novelty of Snakes of a Plane does not disappear, you will leave the cinema aside. what did everyone do? "<br /> <br /> I know this movie has a high rating, but it does not do anything A) Lots of reviews were written before the movie was released and, B) The distribution of user ratings varies much less than normal 77% of users rated the movie as 10/10, while only 7% rated it 10 - Why such a gap?
