It is an anti-Serb propaganda film made for television. <br /> <br /> "Muslims are good, Orthodox Serb Christians are bad." <br /> <br /> Here is the message. <br /> <br /> Using "entertainment" to spread a propaganda message is not new. <br /> <br /> This film is very thick. Apparently, many viewers and critics relegate him. <br /> <br /> I know better. <br /> <br /> The Serbs, under the command of General Draza Milhalovich and his Chetniks, were saved 500 American planes shot down by the Germans during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Churchill decided to betray Milhalovich and place British support behind the communist Tito. Roosevelt followed suit and, after the end of the war, Yugoslavia was surrendered to communist Tito. <br /> <br /> And the American ally Milhalovitch has been stained by the media ever since. <br /> <br /> This The film is part of the anti-Serb propaganda campaign organized by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG), which culminated in the "war" in Kosovo, during which the Serbia was bombed by NATO due to false allegations of "mass graves" by the ICG. "In Kosovo full of" victims "of the wicked Serbs, the fact that there were no such mass graves and that Albanians (Muslims) had no reason to be in Kosovo from Serbia is a fact that most media will not print.I chose this movie because the description in one sentence on the jacket of the video seemed interesting. <br /> <br /> Imagine my disgust when I discovered that I had been tricked into praising another branch of the propaganda machine destined for Serbia. <br /> <br /> Instead of this propaganda, someone should make a film about the reluctance of the administration Clinton to speak frankly with Congress and the American people about his complicity in the delivery of weapons from Iran to the Muslim government of Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> I will not hold my breath while waiting for such a movie.
