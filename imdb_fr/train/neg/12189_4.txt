I'm surprised this movie gets such a high score, though if I had to use a typical 71 note scale, it's a c or a d, so maybe everything is fine, but this movie was just a typical thriller, except annoyingly slow and unrealistic. It's not a typical thriller that's realistic, but this one seemed to want to do it. However, the woman who was beaten did not file a complaint because she did not want to be questioned in court even though she would charge the man who broke her arm, beat her, and raped her for life. but also to protect the lawyer for whom she had feelings and for her family, and not just for random people she did not even know. There were other similar issues with the movie that would have been nice if there had been some kind of moral to remove from the movie but the few moral issues like it was right to try to kill / beat Kady before he did not do anything illegal presented a small side because Kady ended up being just a crazy bastard claiming revenge so sure that the lawyer was entitled to protect his family since waiting for Kady to have actually raped his daughter so that he could do something legally would be absurd. So now, I just lost more of my life for this silly movie, so please, do not see it, at least your life will not be at the size and this way, my two and a half hours have meant something.
