This film is essentially two hours of character Dafoe drinking - almost literally - to death. The only surprise in this movie is that you did not have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised. It was a sad waste of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this movie just sucked. Slow does not make the movie bad, it was just bad. The fragmentary plot mixed with artistic fights of anamorphic details are not coherent together meaningfully for a plot, except to highlight a gore that is illustrated from several perspectives, finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, it has made me sleepy. (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to watch the movie again - which was even more disappointing.) <br /> <br /> In general, I do not like to make negative comments or criticisms about the works of other people, even when they fear, but this film justifies one. It's just too bad that these big players were ashamed with this final result.
