I read very good reviews here on IMDb and I thought I would give a preview of this movie. Disappointed. On the positive side, the main male roles are good, and some interesting photographs but overall, this film does not convince. It seems that its importance is too great to try to say anything meaningful, but it is far too short and the picture is in an unconvincing mess. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films classified in the category of black films that can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> "A film noir is marked by pessimism, fatalism , threats and cynical characters ". <br /> <br /> This is the story here: 3 losers collide with each other with their collective problems such as mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness, etc. and together, they conspire to kidnap a child and foil each other. if the story was more limited to kidnapping than to the character of the kidnappers. I thought the main female role was out of its depth and introduced myself as an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> Despite some good times, I ended up thinking that I had wasted my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
