Misty Ayers had a body smoking, and that's all this movie was about. Pure exploitation film. I started playing a game with myself, counting the number of times they completed orchestral music. And of course, the music has nothing to do with the scenes. Example: enter a room casually and say "Hello" was marked with hunting music from a Roman epic. I would like to know why this film spent 11 years on shelves before its release. What I learned from this movie: The women's low-waisted panties existed in 1954. I'm talking about Sigourney Weaver in the original panties of the movie Alien. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes, Misty is taking off and putting on her clothes (except the bra and panties, unfortunately). Also includes dreadful dubbing, culminating in a "Attention! Godzirra!" effect.
