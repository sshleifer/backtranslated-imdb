The worst kind of movie. Basically, the declaration of independence of the United States was replaced by a plasma screen, which fooled the security of the museum for several days. Eh? <br /> <br /> The plasma screen that would theoretically run less than 2 seconds with this watch battery, assuming it has an internal resistance low enough to provide the necessary current, which it would not do. <BR /> <br /> That would be possible with a dozen big car batteries and an inverter, but this system would not fit in the case. Sorry to be anal, but it's not even close to being plausible. The rest of the movie was not much better and I wonder why the budget could not have been given to a charity or myself.
