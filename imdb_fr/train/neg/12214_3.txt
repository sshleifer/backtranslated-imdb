What I can say about this film is that it's great to see so many Asian faces. What I did not like in this movie was that it was full of stereotypes about what the typical racial characters would do in their role. The unsuspecting Asian who has to play with someone else to get ahead, White loves Asian culture and chooses to leave his white world for the country of yellow and the black taxi driver "who keeps him ". In addition, the product placement for coke, shanghai tang and donut dunkin was a little too obvious. The plot itself was fun, but I was thinking about how the story unfolded. Again, when we look at romantic comedies, we can not expect much, but we would have liked to be surprised at least once. Parents are the best part of the movie.
