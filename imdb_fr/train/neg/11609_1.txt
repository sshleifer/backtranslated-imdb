I do not come from America and I know what a "women's exchange" is. When a series came out of this name, I was thrilled to see some glamorous and glamorous sex moments of the program. But what I got was a real stupid sucking. The title of his title misunderstood me, he has no adult content, no nudity, not even vulgar dialogues (the Hallmark channel was projected and I think they edited / hidden this content for make it ordained). <br /> <br /> A show that gives an image of the current American / Western family, the overweight chubby peoples, polluted teens and the lives of their families sucking. In each episode, two wives / two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live in each other's house and change their family routine with their new rule. Sometimes it turns out to be good or more or less bad. In the last section, each mother is brought back with her husband and tries to conclude what she has done to the families of the previous days. This is the most important part of the program where each candidate fights to defend his rights. I was pampered to see all this instead of seeing cool adult sex stuff. I mean who does this program, more than the one who gave the name "Wife Swap"; it's better to call yourself "Mother Exchange". On the whole, it corrupts all the great things that the real exchange of wives represents! <br /> <br /> Women's Exchange = average reality TV show.
