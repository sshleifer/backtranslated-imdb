Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as a central character in the third film of the Home Alone empire. Four industrial spies acquire a computer chip from the missile guidance system and smuggle it through an airport into a remote-controlled toy car. Due to the confusion in the baggage, grumpy Mrs Hess (Marian Seldes) recovers the car. She gives it to her neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the arrival of the spies. Spies rent a house to rob each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car. Alone at home with chickenpox, Alex calls 911 every time he discovers a current robbery, but spies still manage to escape the police, while Alex is accused of making a joke. The spies finally turn to Alex, unaware that he has manipulated devices to intelligently trap his entire house. Home Alone 3 was not horrible, but probably should not have been created, you can not just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had fun roles, but I do not like when characters are changed in a series of movies, see at their own peril.
