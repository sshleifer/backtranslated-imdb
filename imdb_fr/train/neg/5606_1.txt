I think Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. I think he (the lady) is protesting too much. Everything seemed to me if the author tried to convince himself! He often finds secular works (writings of the same period but without any link with the Bible), but I can think of at least three spontaneous references which give a historical precision to the events contained in the Bible. Anyone can skew the data and prove anything they like, but that does not make it true. Customs change, word definitions change over time (look at English and German where it is obviously a common root) nothing stays the same, it grows and changes forever. The Bible contains many different translations, but the version of King James is the one I found to be the best for any type of research. In the King James version, you will notice that some words are italicized. These words have been added by the translators and can be deleted as well as the average of the verse changes. The writings of Christ's day were written without spaces, punctuation, paragraphs, and numerical verses. These writings look like one word and the translators have added all the above. For example, how would you read this: GODISNOWHERE do you read it as God is nowhere or do you read it as God is now here? Same chain of letters two entirely different meanings. This is why many Bible researchers use a "Lexicon" to help with translation because they provide a verbatim translation of the original, Arabic, Greek or Hebrew, depending on the language in which the writing was written. It is also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic, you can prove that God exists but you can not prove that He does not exist! In the end, I love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty. Talk about the ego! Put away the soap box, God bless Maegi
