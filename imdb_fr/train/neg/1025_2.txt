That's the only question I have left. Why was this film so bad when it had such a nice cast? Why was the writing so bad that it left the audience completely disconnected from the characters? Why does not it make sense? Why did the studio take a good base and "Hollywood" hell when all it needed was good, tell a smart story? Why? I do not understand why movies that start well turn into shit when they come out. I hope for Freeman and Spacey, who are winners, that this is never broadcast on the big screens of the United States. <br /> <br /> As a licensee in journalism, the whole story is utterly laughable. I just think that ... the script had potential, but the execution made a clich√©, and a horrible more. Just. No.
