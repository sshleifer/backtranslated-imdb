OH MY GOD .. THE WORST SH * T I NEVER SEEN - that's the main thought that came to mind just after watching the movie. And I really do not understand anyone with an opposite myth. Although, maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable. I'm talking mostly about the role of H. Graham. What was that??? In my opinion, it destroyed all the positive intentions of the producers. The character was played so affected and boring. Each time it appears, it reminds you that you are watching a movie and you are destroying a spirit of the moment, then a whole movie, because most of the time you can see its stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the movie. emotion. TERRIBLE, do not waste your time.
