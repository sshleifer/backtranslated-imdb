This film is awful. Give me the dentist at any time! Can you believe that one of the main TV channels here in Arabia had this as a Christmas movie! I can only assume they expect to entertain the crowds with Dudley Moore rather than that. The last time I looked at my hot water bottle, there were more actors, a better plot, more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid. Do not even watch if you are intoxicated!
