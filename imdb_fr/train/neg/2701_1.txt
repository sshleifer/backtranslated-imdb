First of all, yes, I'm white, so I try to expand slightly on the always delicate subject of the race ... anyway ... whites who hate blacks = BAD but blacks who hate Whites = OK (because apparently we deserve it !!). Where do I start? I wish I had something good to say about this film outside of unexpected comedy scenes: the infamous scene was Ice Cube and co. fight with neo-Nazis very big, very strong, really very angry and scary and win !!! the neo-Nazis were twice as big :), and the hunt! the hunt is priceless ... It's NOT a film about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not give ... it's a racist film that reaffirms all stereotypes of clich√©s, the white type that is gets fucked by a man. A roommate automatically turns into a skinhead ... just horrible. I regret never having seen it. <br /> <br /> Save your time and the appalling experience of a poorly written, misinterpreted, dark and clearly biased image, if you're into the subject, go and rent American History X, now it's a movie
