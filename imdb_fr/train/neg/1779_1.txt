It could have been a wonderful story based on the ancient breeds of cat characters, but it was not. <br /> <br /> This job could have been exactly that; wonderful and full of mythological references that have nourished my fascination. The main characters (Charles Brady performed by Brian Krause, and his mother Mary performed by Alice Krige) were poorly crafted, had no personality, and were neither friendly nor drawn. Even the character of MÃ¤dchen Amick (who played Tanya Robertson) does not fit this description. <br /> <br /> However, as I've said many times, when you adapt a Stephen King novel to television, you just have to take into account that his books are not written for television and his scenario. talent is sorely lacking in the fire and depth it exhibits as a novelist. <br /> <br /> This is another failed attempt to capture the magic of Stephen King, whether it's his novels or an original screenplay. Simply cut and paste his work on the small screen. His novels are completely built into the process and everything you create is a beautiful film. nothing less but certainly nothing more. His scenarios are random. Unfortunately, this scenario translation was a failure. <br /> <br /> Sorry, sorry, sorry, the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 1.0 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
