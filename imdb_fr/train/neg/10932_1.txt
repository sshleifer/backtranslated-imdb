What's really sad is that this is supposedly the highest budget that Halestorm Entertainment has had to work. Everyone involved must be fined for throwing waste, as all wasted celluloid is used for nothing more than filling the garbage. Not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes are horrible, but the work with the camera and the quality of the film are at best amateurs. The soundtrack seems to have been created on a type laptop. The worst thing about all this is that I sat through it all. I think just because I could not believe that I had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater in which I was watching had actually agreed to show the "movie".
