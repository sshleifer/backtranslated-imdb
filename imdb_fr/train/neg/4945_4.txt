Of course, this one is not really a blockbuster, nor does it aim for such a position. "Dieter" is the name of a very popular German musician, who is either loved or hated for his kind of actor and that's exactly what this film describes. It is based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen" written a few years ago but does not claim to be specific about it. The film is full of offensive sexual content (at least for the American standard) that is fun (not for the other "actors" of course) or silly - it depends on your type of humor or your "Bohlen" -Fan or not. Technically, there is not much to criticize. Speaking of me, I think this movie is an OK movie.
