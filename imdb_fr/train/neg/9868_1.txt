I have hardly ever commented on the movies, but I have seen the 5 laudatory reviews of this "movie" and decided to weigh in with my own criticism. One of my instructors received this film in the mail, mixed with his Academy Selection Officers (AMPAS, also called Oscars Voters), and was so impressed by the way this film was built so terribly that he brought it into our class show us how NOT to assemble a movie. <br /> <br /> This film has no plot, the scenes are horribly edited (often using fake image techniques in "24" style image), and the performances (especially the main role, which does not even manage to behave like a bad actress) are mostly odious. Someone really did not understand the purpose of an introduction, namely setting up the plot. There is no installation! Halfway through the movie, neither I nor the rest of the class knew what the movie was about. The foreground of the crane, which introduces a kind of murder, was never discussed, and now that I think about it, it was supposed to be a flash-forward, the rest of the film being a flashback but this cuts scene directly to the next without any indication as such. <br /> <br /> Well, I could really go on and on. At the very least, this film gives me confidence in my own ability to make movies.
