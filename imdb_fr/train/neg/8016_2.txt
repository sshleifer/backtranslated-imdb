First of all, this movie is GLACIALLY slow, and I can see most viewers lose patience in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film was one that, in my opinion, would form the basis of an excellent film; what was most lacking here was a conspiracy that would advance the underlying themes. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because in the hands of a writer like Lanford Wilson, I think the symbolism, like a mountain lion, invades the school campus could take on large tragic proportions without being too much heavy. <br /> <br /> I think, with a good scenario supporting the film, the same filmmaker, with the same tastes, and even with the same actors (who did not even really have the chance to impress me) , might have been able to present a meaningful and touching description of the pains and difficulties experienced by a boy who develops a powerful "crush" on an older boy he admires. <br /> <br /> However, I am sorry to say it without this foundation, and armed with a vague, tasteless and extremely uninteresting scenario, without any conspiracy in sight, and without any kind of sensitive structure (for example, after watching it, I think you'll find that you can not point to climatic scenes, but rather you'll end up enumerating "well, maybe that scene, or that one, were climaxes." . ") - the result is a trouble of 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, we are never really interested in one of the characters; their trials and difficulties are simply boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, surrealist drama and surrealist liberties become more confusing and confusing than improvements to the plot. I never really believed, for example, in the creation of "Leah" and I think that most viewers would be completely disconcerted by the conventional way in which his phone calls were filmed. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid this is not the case at all. What I will never be able to understand is why a film like THIS movie has not been redone by an enterprising filmmaker ... instead of all the mediocre remakes of movies that were super good at the first release! All he needs is a good script, written by good writers, and I think this film could easily become an unforgettable classic about an aspect of adulthood that is rarely treated in drama. All the elements that were so tedious and that looked so much in the movie (the messages written on the boy's belly, the scenes of "Leah", the fantasies of television) could be enriched if they were supported by a good STORYLINE. <br /> I see in a few comments that people talk about this movie as a "gay" subject, and I think that's a mistake. Clearly, the "crush" described is that of a newly pubescent boy on an older teenager, but Logan's character is far too young to have chosen a particular sexual choice. all sorts of stimuli, sexual and nonsexual, as one might expect in a very young boy like him. I believe that "beguinages" such as Logan's are common among young men who are growing up to have a strong preference for female sexual partners.
