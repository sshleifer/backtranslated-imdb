Unfortunately, it was lost. This film stinks from beginning to end. It was hard to watch because I watched Clarissa every day on Nickelodeon. I loved it. Then the next thing I found is that she made a gap in Maxim and she was gorgeous! I did not really hear about her until I watched this movie about an accident. I could not believe she would even let something like that be seen with her name everywhere. Everything was wrong, but we would still feel that someone somewhere on the team was really trying very hard to save a sunken ship. Too bad .. I hope she continues to play and I would like to see her with a real cast in a real movie.
