"Boom" has earned a reputation. With heavyweights Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey, one might be tempted to think, how bad could this be? Well, it's way worse than you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The sad and worrying fact of "Boom" seems to indicate the decline and fall of the aforementioned heavyweights. It's only the director Joseph Losey who, having plunged into the depths with "Modesty Blaise" and "Boom" (some may want to add "Secret Ceremony"), manages to recover and in 1970 creates his best work, the wonderful "Go-Between". <br /> <br /> The saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams. From the mid-forties to the early sixties, Williams has written a number of plays that have achieved classic status, residing in the theater repertoire around the world, many becoming highly regarded films. When William's muse abandoned him, probably because of his notorious abuse of substance, he abandoned him for good. Williams at its best is an actor's dream offering many unforgettable performances. (Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr were they always better than in "The Night of the Iguana"?) Taylor in particular shone in "Cat on a burning roof" and "Suddenly last summer". There is an anecdote in which Taylor would have asked John Gielgud if he would teach him to play Shakespeare, to which he replied "if you want to teach me to play Tennessee Williams". If Gielgud had seen "Boom", he would have stuck his tongue. Taylor just was not worse, turning against him to provoke performance. Despite the fact that her face is well photographed, she is resolutely podgy. In addition to the physical decline, from that point on, she would basically lose her credibility as a serious actress with a series of completely forgettable (and worst) roles to her credit. <br /> <br /> The same could be said for Burton. After his short theatrical fame, he won fame and fortune in Hollywood. But the body of his work from this point (1968) would be at least trivial. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward has long since ceased to be a force in the theater where his salon comedies have been replaced by likes of Williams and British "angry young men". He seems to have fun camping, but can barely entertain that of the man who claims such talent. <br /> <br /> The only member of the cast that retains its dignity is the young Joanna Shimkus, Ms. Sidney Poitier should be replaced by a career in the promising screen in a few years. <br /> <br /> "Boom" breathes indulgence; it's just out of control. A rather sad pointer to careers that went wrong rather than on a campfest as some have suggested.
