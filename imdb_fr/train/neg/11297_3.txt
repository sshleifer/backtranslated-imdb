Jenny Neumann (from the sex-exploitation film MISTRESS OF THE APES, the American slasher HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who plays a lead role in an Australian production. She is a virgin because she saw her mother having sex as a little girl, then she accidentally caused the car accident that killed her. Meanwhile, a black glove killer lurks in the theater, hitting people with shards of glass. <br /> <br /> *** MAJOR SPORTSMAN *** <br /> <br /> The killer is obviously Helen (she speaks in the voice of her dead mother, washes the blood from her hands after the murders and is seen killing a pedophile with a broken bottle like a little girl!), but it has a free heavy breathing POV camera job and hides the killer's identity to the end, as if it were supposed to be a big surprise. <br /> <br /> The entire casting seems obsessed with talking, having or wanting to have sex and, in one case, blackmail to get laid. There is a bit of nudity and blood, but there is no sense of continuity, the photography is murky and editing (by Colin Eggleston, who also wrote and produced) is terrible. The theatrical scenery of a slasher film precedes the film of the same name by Soavi and that of OPERA d'Argento (both better than this one), and Neumann is rather sexy.
