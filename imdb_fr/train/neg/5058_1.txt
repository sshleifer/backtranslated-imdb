(When will I learn?) The ecstatic critic of NPR made me think that this turkey was another citizen Kane. Please, let me empty the spleen ... <br /> <br /> I'll admit it: the decor, presumably in New York, has never been so ugly and so little attractive. It reminds me that the 70s were a bad decade for men's fashion and cars. And all smokers! If the plan was to depreciate the characters, he would succeed. <br /> <br /> For a movie to work (at least, in my estimation), there must be at least ONE friendly character. Only Ned Beaty approached, and I could not wait for him to finish Nicky. If a stray shot had hit Mikey, well, he might have pulled a shrug at the top. <br /> <br /> I do not remember hating a film so strongly. I guess I'm a rube who does not dig "art" movies. Never mind.
