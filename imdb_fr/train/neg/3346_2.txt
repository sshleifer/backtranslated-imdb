Cheezy action movie with Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a former military member who retired to a teaching position. But changes in the neighborhood and the student body frustrated him and he decided to hang up. Things get complicated when, monitoring a group of students in detention, thieves seize the school as the base of operations for the theft of an armored car. His Dolph against the wicked in a fight to the death. Jaw Chopping is back in the late Grindhouse era exploitation movies where villains disguised as punks and some of the bad women had shiny hair. What a stupid movie. It's an action movie that has probably been condemned from the get-go before the budget, faux decorations and the wrong direction of action are a nod to the producers. Look at what time late in the film, when the cars go through the school (do not ask it), they hit the security turret (do not ask because it looks more like a prison than a high school) and crush his barely built form does not look like it was in previous plans). What did the gods of the bad movies do? In fact, I'm puzzled since that was realized (?) By Sydney J Furie, a very good director who made films like The Boys in Company C. Has his ability missed it or is it? desperate from the beginning and he not even worth it? It's a turkey. An observable but a turkey nonetheless.
