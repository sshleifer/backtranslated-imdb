That's it. It's the good one. This is the worst film ever made. Already. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Remove the trophy and give it to these people ..... there is no comparison possible. <br /> <br /> Even three days after watching this (for some reason, I still do not know why), I can not believe how awful foolish this movie is / was. It's so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or anything that should ever have been created and introduced into our existence. <br /> <br /> This leads me to wonder if humans are really put on this earth to do good. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of film hurts us sincerely as a society. We should be ashamed. I really can not emphasize that our overall responsibility as people living here and creating art, is that we must prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's an embarrassment. I do not know how these actors, writers or directors of this film sleep at night, knowing that they played a role in the realization of "Loaded". I do not know what kind of disgusting monsters like to watch these types of movies. <br /> <br /> That being said, I love good "bad" movies. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARES. I tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad guys". <br /> <br /> But this ....... this crosses the "bad" line into a whole new dimension. It's awkward. It's the bad one where you know everything that's going to happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE they happen; and not just like a second or two before, I mean, after watching the first 5 minutes before. <br /> <br /> Every tacky "effect" editing is shamelessly used again and again to a nauseating point. I really do not want to see the "flickering" effect of the "drug addict" camera, or the skipping cups, the distorted cups, or the FUTURE EVEN EVER. It is meticulously boring, repetitive and only tortures the public. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be precise here, the most disturbing thing about this movie is that, given the production, it seems like a quantity of money Decent enough was actually put in these feces. Personally, I'll grab the director's shoulders if I saw him one day and shook him, asking him to run home and swallow two liters of Drain-O, otherwise I would do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever needed a new form of inhuman torture for our prisoners of war abroad, continue showing them this film in a padded cell over and over again. Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time. <br /> <br /> Stop these movies, they are just the vilest of all facets of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.
