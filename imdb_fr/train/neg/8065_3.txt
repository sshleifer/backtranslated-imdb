Steve Carpenter can not do horror movies. First of all, the cast was very bad for this movie. The only decent part was Buffy's very dark-haired girl against the vampires. This movie has no gore (usually a key ingredient in a horror movie), no action, no acting and no suspense (also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but he is so dry and dry that it's sad. There were some parties that were supposed to be funny (continuing the horror / comedy movies for teenagers) and no one was making fun of the audience. I thought this movie was rated R and I did not pay attention. I realized that he had been replaced by PG-13. Anyway, see this movie if you liked I still know what you did last summer. This is the only type of person who would find this scary movie at a distance. And seriously, this is yours Steve Carpenter, stop making horror movies. In this film, Scream looks like a chainsaw massacre.
