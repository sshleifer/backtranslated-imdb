Very bad. Very very bad. As a fellow who aspires to do, to play or - at least - to sniff the catering table on a film set, it's hard for me to criticize the freelancers who have actually produced a film of any kind. However, this movie ... oh my God. <br /> <br /> Realizing Frightworld is not aiming for anything other than cruel exploitation (an honorable thing in itself) and trying to make it conform to more conventional standards mistake. And to be fair, it's more fun than - say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not much. So, I'm not going to try to criticize, just let me make a few comments. <br /> <br /> 1) If gore is the goal of the movie, should not you be able to see it? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you hired three men, make sure at least one of them knows how to use the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror movie, your maniac must be more scary than a Smurf doll. . Hard I know but really ... <br /> <br /> 4) There are a lot of talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most you can rent really cheaply. Find one who knows how to frame a scene. <br /> <br /> 5) Having someone who knows how to use After Effects and other interesting programs does not mean he should do it every two seconds. <Br/> <br /> 6) Congratulations to the girls for taking off their tops, but next time make sure the girls with the tops are removed. <br /> <br /> 7) The editing should help tell the story or put a mood. At least in this kind of movie editing should sell gore gags. A chainsaw that suddenly appears in the stomach of a character is not frightening, it is neglected. <br /> <br /> Some good things. All the actors were not bad. Jack was very good and I loved Acid once she started to defend herself. There were beautiful pictures, unfortunately, they were projected on the screen without rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. I also like the moxie of Frightworld. Next time, now that they have a film to their credit, I hope everyone wants something better than Colman Francis. Improve at least Ed Wood.
