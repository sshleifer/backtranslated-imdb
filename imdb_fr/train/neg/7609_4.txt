Being a big fan of Corman's horror movies, I was expecting more from his western than I had. Well, I had a lot of fun. I almost laughed as much as looking at Mel Brooks' saddle Blazing. <br /> <br /> Admire the show of moving tire tracks in the meadows of the old west. You can waste time counting them if there is an otherwise boring scene. And horses seem to have gears too, considered fast chases. See also the queens of the bar room swaying in the traditional Far West lounge doing a number reminiscent of some 1920s fashion dance, decades before the style was invented. I hope the room around them will not collapse. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this chaos, the main actors are doing a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are really good. A special eulogy for them to have done their best with the material that seems to have been lifted for most of 'Johnny Guitar', but that does not really impress in the same way. But there is really nothing wrong with a ludicrous western like this one. Just like a very bad old horror movie, it might fail one way, but still succeed in giving joy. That's one of the reasons I'm interested in Corman's work and that's why I dare to recommend that you live this movie if you have the opportunity.
