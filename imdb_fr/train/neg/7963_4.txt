I'm a big fan of old horror movies and, since I'm middle-aged, my old man is a movie made before 1970, most of them shot in the 1920s to 1960s. not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with the exception of Creepshow 1, which I found awesome. I could remember stories there, but I really enjoyed the box-story monster with Hal Holbrook, and the one about the really clean guy was a good ending. All the stories were good though. So why did I love them so much? The characters had a correct development, the lines were very clear on who was good and who was bad, the bits of horror were enhanced by a big frightened face of fear and the funny bits were really funny! This sequel misses a lot of these elements or is totally absent! I write this only after watching it in part because the movie was a total waste of time and I disabled it to do other things like writing movie reviews on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get noticed, they tell you something ..... 4 out of 10. In addition, Romero's expertise is hard to find here, they had to have told him to mitigate it to a PG standard (I do not know what was noted, but it reminds me of PG), and that's not a good thing for a movie that does not happen otherwise. It is shown on the Encore cable channel if your dead (yuck yuck) to see it.
