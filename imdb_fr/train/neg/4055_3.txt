I read criticisms that you must have been a student in a very strict British school in the 1960s to understand that. That may be true. If so, this film is obsolete. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* ************* The end is as logical as all the anti-government and anti-corporation kids without having any better solution that does not flare the company up to a type of Mad Max type. <br /> <br /> Yeah, the main characters can leave, but they do not. The reasons they do it make no sense. There is not enough character development to explain why. What is meant by killing a group of innocent people is never explained or even hinted at. It is mentioned that the war is the final creative expression, probably the only revelation of all the characters in this film, and that makes no sense. <br /> <br /> The characters who make a series of murders do not fight the institution, they are just killing people. I thought they might have used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end, it would have had a greater symbolic meaning, but they did not do it. <br /> <br /> tl; dr - This film is a teenager's daydream to fight against the authority that torments them, although in reality they need it. He has no moral, symbolic or sense truth; this film simply shows the fantasy of killing teachers and people holding a "power" that annoys you. <br /> <br /> If you think a murder shooting / shooting in a school like Columbine or Virginia is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you do not like , so I guess you'll love this movie. If you are like me and you strive to make your life rather than blindly revolt (very blindly in this film) against "the man", this film is juvenile and boring. <br /> <br /> You can also say in part that the funding was lacking and that the story seemed to have a bit of attention deficit disorder. <br /> <br /> In the end, this seems to be a rough draft of what could have been a good movie, but no effort is made in dialogue, character development or morality so that's right. .. poorly done. <br /> <br /> If ... only I could recover my two hours.
