To say Funky Forest: The First Contact is a bad movie is a euphemism of incredible proportions. I can really get into a good artist movie, even a surreal and twisted catwalk like El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, because these movies really have something interesting to discuss when the credits begin. <br /> <br /> FFFC tries to be as deep and intellectual as ever, there is essentially no substance in this film. This film is badly done, the visuals in this film are not inspiring, the dialogue is worse, the musical numbers destroy this film. I laughed for GUITAR BROTHERS, but it was immediately erased by something completely useless and uninteresting. He has tried to be deep and meaningful in my opinion, but it is disorientated disorientated nonsense. Students in first-year cinema without a camera could create something more interesting. <br /> <br /> Guitar Brothers and the routines of stand-up between the skits bring back 1 point each, all the rest is only rhythm, pseudo-creative and heavy attempts. to be as good as the films of other real directors, such as Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and Jodoworsky. Leave me alone. I'm convinced that people who are crazy about FFFC are doing it because they have no idea what they saw, because it was just slight relevant statements mixed with stupidity and mixing until that you vomit on your own shoes. <br /> <br /> This film was an extreme disappointment. He just survived Survive Style 5+, a meaningful movie, combined with great use of landscapes, cinematography, catchy dialogues, fun moments, good soundtrack, excellent performance, rhythm and flow fantastic. FFFC presents exactly the opposite, a boring landscape (20 minutes watching a beach bland at night?) An all-white scene? Alien balls floating in a white space? A shabby school corridor, then ... a school corridor ?), Terrible cinematography, forgettable dialogue, nothing fun or humor, except the fact that you ruined your life for two hours, soundtrack, amateur performances, uneven, uneven, disjointed, and often flat performances , without any flow. <br /> <br /> Some people claim that this is what makes FFFC an excellent film, that it is every time so unconventional as its pure genius. It's just a way to caress your own ego, because "unpredictable" could be a good quality for a movie if it was not associated with "boring", "innate" and "terrible". Personally, I spoke to two people who told me that FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but a eulogy overwhelmed by an artist elitist forced them to watch the film again and then come back with a ... "Hey, it was pretty good I liked it". <br /> <br /> I'm going to lower my feet, this film is bad, I do not care if Roger Ebert says that this film is the best thing he has seen since lost his own virginity. "The Emperor's New Coat," I say ... this film is by no means an indication of other upcoming psychedelic / tripping movies from Japan over the last 10 years. Taste of Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies (even on a budget), and none can honestly compare with Survive Style 5+. Do not look at FFFC unless you want to make a pretentious pile of anything on a budget.
