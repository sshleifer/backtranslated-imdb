Can I get my $ 13.00 back? I would have rather looked at "Hydroelectric power comes to North America". Again. It's a movie with one voice. The same voice that comes out of every character's mouth, regardless of age or gender. To hear this voice again, I should charge at least $ 150 an hour. And I do not take insurance. It was strange to see Will Ferrell turn into Woody. But I do not think the imaginative cast is enough. We have to wait until they have a story before they bother to make a film. Unless he does it only for the money. And if so, why not just reissue an All-Rap version of "What's up Tiger Lily?"
