Looking at it now, it's still as sordid and sexist as I can remember. comes from a time when girls were "Dolly Birds" and basically male toys. It's hard to understand that this comes from Hammer Studios and is available on DVD when the good movies are not. Our nations are ashamed when the working class is described as a shy traitor or worse! The problem is that you can not help but be nostalgic for a Clippie on a bus. Try to keep the contents of your stomach when you see Olive in a down? A "naughty" nightie or something similar to what Shirley Bassey used to wear for a concert in 1972. Be careful, this movie shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo by a double red bus floor, which I was informed that it was not a Routemaster but a Bristol. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about looking at something decent, like Porridge or Dad's Army ... or a fly crawling against a wall.
