I do not know what Margaret Atwood thought about allowing this film to have the same name as her book. I have always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and I was very happy to hear that a movie was being prepared. I am aware that the translation from book to film is not perfect, but this film was the worst. The names of the women are correct and part of the story is correct but that's about it. I feel like I've lost a lot of my time trying to get through this movie. It really should have been a mini-series to tell the story of how it was written. <br /> <br /> The actors of Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well chosen, although I was initially skeptical about Mary Louise Parker. I only wish they had a better script, because it really had nothing to do with the book.
