OK, aside from the psychedelic background images, the information presented here was good. The music I could have done without (it's not bad music is that it does not fit at all with this movie). <br /> <br /> Regarding the content of the film, the director often evokes a lack of pagan perspective on the existence of Christ and a surprising comparison of the acts and events of the life of Christ in relation to the life of mythological characters / divinities such as Mithras and Dionyses. Then, he evokes the chronology of the origins of Christianity and presents an "acceptable" case, but not a case that blew me away. <br /> <br /> If the director sticked to the facts and pursued them, this movie were good. However, at this stage of the film, he dissociates himself into a group of personally gratifying attacks on Mel Gibson's "Passion for Christ" and a private Christian school, frequented by the director in his youth. During an interview with his former school principal (during which it appeared that the director had been mounted under false pretenses), I had the impression that the director was acting in a manner of child. He was asking good questions but, like the film itself, the interview turned into an attack on the rules of this private school, not for Christianity. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you are interested in information, look at the first 30 minutes or so, then turn it off.
