Released in 1965, but clearly filmed years ago, it is an inept crime melodrama, characterized by inept sexual exploitation. As usual for period films, there is a lot of undressing and dressing for no reason, supplemented by ugly music, annoying narration and clumsy editing. The caf√© scene sets the stage, as we exchange between characters to avoid seeing them speak. All we have is reaction shots to the off-screen character's voice! Misty Ayers, pretty woman of the 50s, undresses several times before starting the action. It is continually accompanied by what seems to be traditional music ranging from romance to Occidentian and homemade dishes, mixed randomly to produce, among other things, the most exciting cigarette lighting ever recorded on film. Watch as he taps on it! Watch as he hits the match! Will he inhale or be captured by the Apaches? Only time will tell !! The film tells the sordid story of how Sally goes to work in a brothel, cracking for a drug and not being able to escape. For some reason, we have treated some of the most bored and boring prostitutes ever in film, literally fingernails or knitting rather than entertaining clients. A stupidly lame comedy (boozy lady drinks milk by chance! Har dee har!) And playing in silent movies does not help. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, even under the Something Weird Video marquee. It's really a cinematic curiosity for those interested in the history of cinema - a very bad cinema.
