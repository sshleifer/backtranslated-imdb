It's obviously illegal. Pedophiles pray for this stuff. How did they manage to make such a film? This film is summed up in one word, SICK. Where do people come to make movies like this? As I watched the movie, I did not think they would allow this kid to say maybe 12 if he slept with this woman. Sorry if it's a spoiler for you, but I would have appreciated not having seen that. Where did the mental health of these people go? Maybe the authors of this film are pedophiles? Our society today is filled with all kinds of sexual predators who pray about children, but filmmakers do this kind of movies that only provoke this kind of behavior. I noticed that in a previous comment, someone asked if there was a version in which she was shown to them naked. He's a kid here, and someone asks for something like that? What is wrong with this picture?
