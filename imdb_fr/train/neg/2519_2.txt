In fact, I paid to see this film in the cinema. <br /> <br /> That would give a score of 1, but the fight scenes between the robots are going well, and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I realize that some movies have larger budgets than others. I do not have a problem with that. Unfortunately, sci-fi movies probably suffer the most with a small budget for obvious reasons. But one of the failures of this movie is that almost every piece of each set looked cheap and ugly. I mean, could not they even make it "beautiful"? <br /> <br /> The other big reason this movie is awful is the acting game. If I watched the movie now and knew what to expect, I could just enjoy it. I was expecting a good movie and I did not know how horrible it would be. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the experiment was completed in 85 minutes.
