After reading good reviews about this movie, I thought it was time for me to see it. Well, I do not know why I bothered. Basically, this family is given a clue that leads to a huge reserve of ancient treasures hidden by the Templars during the war of independence. Apparently, it had to be kept away from the British at all costs. First, why did the knights say that the treasure had been transferred from Europe to America? How did the character of Nic Cages understand that "Charlotte" was actually a ship? How can they understand all the clues and riddles in about a minute? And how can two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best-kept piece of paper in the world? These are just some of the plots of this crazy Hollywood movie that went wrong. Cage has been in big action movies - "Face-Off" and "The Rock" - so why did he fall into the trap? Is he getting too old ?! His character is really annoying - this "ordinary" guy steals the Declaration of Independence, passes thieves with rifles, escapes from the FBI and seems generally invincible. The whole movie does not really make sense and, overall, it was a disappointment.
