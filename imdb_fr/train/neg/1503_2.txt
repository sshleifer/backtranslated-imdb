it's incredible! Fidani (who was also a spiritist) was one of the cheapest directors in the world. This film stole the original title of Leone "Duck you sucker!" but tell the boring story of a Pinkerton agent against the killer "Testa di Ferro" (the improbable Gordon Mitchell, stuntman). Everything is poor and crazy in this pelicula filmed in the beloved landscapes of Lazio. The story is bad and crazy at the same time. Fidani was not capable and ingenious at the same time. In the story, there was a kind of madness and illogicality (like the discussion in the sheriff's house and the crazy appearance of Butch Cassidy!?!?! Terrible American night, absurd behavior, illogical plot, bad game actors and fleeting appearance of one of the most awarded presenters in the history of Italian television, Renzo Arbore Ah, of course: Klaus Kinski Yes, it's awesome and terrible, but I'm sure he only participated for money and to play with iron horses) 2 out of 10 but ... DO NOT LACK IT !!!!!
