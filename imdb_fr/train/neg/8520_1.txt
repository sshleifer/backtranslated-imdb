When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was airing in the United States, I was delighted. I then had the misfortune to look at the accursed thing. I love Mr. C. Beaton's books on the wonderful Scottish Constable. The characters in the book are fun and very well written. The powers that be responsible for this mishmash have apparently never read one of Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has something to do with the show. Besides the lack of familiar characters, I find the whole show offensively strong. It seems that the actors feel that they have to shout their lines and shout at them. If you like Mr. C. Beaton's adorable Hamish Macbeth, do not waste your time on this garbage.
