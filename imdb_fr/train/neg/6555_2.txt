So, the other night, I decided to watch Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or power, passion, murder as it is called in Holland. When I bought the movie, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was playing the lead role and I thought it had to say something about quality. Unfortunately, it is not the case. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot of the movie is really confusing. Two stories take place simultaneously during the film. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the film, I was waiting for the moment when these two stories would come together for the plot to be clear to me. But this is still not the case. <br /> <br /> 2) The title of the film says that the film will be about Natica Jackson. Well, it's sometimes. As said the film covers two different stories and the party on Natica Jackson is the shortest. So, another title for this movie would not be a bad choice. <br /> <br /> To conclude my story, I urge you to leave this film in its place, on the shelf of the store, in a place where no one can see it. By doing so, you will not lose 90 minutes of your life, as I did.
