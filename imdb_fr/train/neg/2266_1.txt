Ringmaster, the pathetic excuse of Jerry Springer for wasting a film that should be recycled because toilet paper has recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film. First of all, it was done. Secondly, people went to see him. Third, some people voted for the best movie ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, I'm 100% sure it would be a billion times better. Most shitty movies have their moment (even Godzilla had some cool special effects), the moment of this movie was when I left the theater with nausea. The only thing that could have aggravated this movie would be that Jerry Springer is the star. If I want to watch shit for an hour and a half, I'm going to dump in a can. If anyone does not despise this movie, I pity you, as well as your children and the children of your children. However, contrary to Springer's belief, I clearly do not tolerate children who have sex.
