The name of Nick Stahl, the young cast and the attractive cover of VHS prompted me to buy and watch this movie, hoping to see a good slash movie for teenagers. What shit! The scenario full of clich√©s, dialogues and representations are terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible ?? in summary, a total loss of time. There is no horror, no black humor, only an absolutely boring story, with shameful plot points. The film begins with six characters, or even three couples, who form a group of friends, but who are actually very nasty people who seem to be enemies and play a ridiculous foolish game called "Taboo". Everyone writing yes or no to certain taboo questions. That's it: no prior development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motivations and their relationships. Then, there are suspension points a year later, and the same group is gathered in a New Year's Eve party, insulting each other in a very sordid way. But the plot and twists are so ridiculous, predictable, mediocre, and unbelievable that they deserve no extra line in my analysis. A tip only: do not waste your time and money on this waste, you will certainly regret it. My vote is a (horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo ?? Jogando Com o Assassino" ("Taboo ?? Playing With the Killer")
