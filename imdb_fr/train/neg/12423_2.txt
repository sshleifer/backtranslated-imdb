Cage (1989) is another of those low-budget action films produced in the 1980s, largely thanks to films such as 48h. and deadly weapon. It features Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as veteran veterans of Vietnam who run a local dive bar. Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lou was shot in the head and is now quite sweet. Although he is huge, Lou has the brain of a child. One day, thugs throw their wait in the bar and Lou and Rebb beat them. But recovery is a mother. They plant the bar, leaving Lou and Reb without anything. That's until these two thugs come on the scene (one of them is a really nice guy) who has a plan in mind. <br /> <br /> The film is a waste of time. Maybe if they did everything they did and did a basic action film instead of trying to soften the gloom, maybe it could have worked. Alas, this is not the case and the public is left to hold the bag. Never mind. It's a shame because you have all the elements to make a good movie B. I guess I'll do more luck next time. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. <br /> <br /> xxx
