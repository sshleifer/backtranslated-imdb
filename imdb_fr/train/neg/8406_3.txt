A memorable line of a short show. After watching the episode where this line was introduced, my intramural fraternity football team started using the line to break our blockades in attack. Instead of Ready / Break, our quarterback said FOOTBALL and the rest of the team answered YOU BET! A fun way to break the crush that scratched the heads of our opponents because very few of them had watched the series. The use of this line has added a unique element to our season that I will never forget. That year, we had our best season in college and, to some extent, it was because of the fun we had to use that range. The show was rather dizzying, but it lingers in the memory of the 1977 Pi Kappa Phi intramural football team at West Virginia Tech.
