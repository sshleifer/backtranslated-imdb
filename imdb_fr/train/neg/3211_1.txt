And that falls squarely into the category of "incredibly bad" - that is, a drunken movie that students would praise for pissing off. I was at the science fiction film festival and all I can remember is a wave of hysterical laughter, wave after wave, at the first screening of this movie. Other critics will better describe the faecal nature of this film, and I felt so bad about the poor guy from the production company who had come forward, obviously to gauge the reaction of the audience. What he got is the science fiction equivalent of an audience of drunken students, and after a "serious" anime movie, I think it was "blue sky", the audience was 'dark mood, then this movie was opened and in a few seconds everyone the room was rolling in the islands. I will make a point on the most difficult parts; <br /> <br /> Scenario: The funniest and funniest part of this movie follows a linear and predictable route, away from the occasional bad thought. Waste, but eminently laughable. <br /> <br /> Animation: False, and put together, if you can support dull decorations and gradual disguises for heroin (I know I can!), so be careful editing where she "transforms" a Swedish peasant woman in LADY DEATH !!! <br /> <br /> Characters: If one-dimensional is painful, there is a brief history (with dazzling lines of dialogue) and there is little light on the motivation behind some of the main characters. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, if you have a captive audience and some drinks lying around (try to make sure they're 'alcoholic to relieve pain'), then drag this movie into the DVD and install you in a state of mind "mystery science theater 3000". There is no other motivation to watch this film than to make fun of it, and it's not a comedy. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM ALONE. It could be even more boring to watch solo than "New World" with Colin Farrell, because you will not be able to laugh at ridicule with a friend or two.
