Serge Farnel made a very precise criticism of this film in the review "La nuit rwandaise" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net) <br /> <br /> A criticism that shows how France was at the origin of all the situation of the United Nations in Rwanda. <br /> <br /> UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation as French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the genocide forces. <br /> <br /> The day before, ten UN soldiers were killed by the genocide forces. <br /> <br /> This is why the UN soldiers decided to protect themselves by driving behind the French trucks. <br /> <br /> In doing so, they renounced the Tutsis, which is unforgivable. of course. <br /> <br /> But we must not forget that the French soldiers organized this situation.
