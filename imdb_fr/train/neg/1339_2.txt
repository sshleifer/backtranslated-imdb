A sad and sad show is indeed The Munster's Revenge. The Munsters are brought back one last time (Fred Gywnne has received a huge paycheck to return to the role of Herman Munster) in this film specially designed for a pair of wax replicas of Grandfather and Herman, robots " terrorizing "the city as preparation for a steal from a mom's hiding place at an exhibition. With the police on their heels, the two old television icons are trying to find out who is really responsible for the crimes in order to clean up their names. We see them disguised as waitresses (a minor highlight in the film), grandfather turns into bat with wire tied several times (once, even flying in Transylvania with Herman evoking in a way or a other his miles for frequent travelers, I suppose), and a very boring parent "the ghost" sings and breaks the glass nausea constantly! What is saddest is hard to pin down: do Gywnne (in particular) and Al Lewis look so haggard in all the scenes and so indifferent to the material? Is it the hokey costumes of robots that have the school's production values ​​that are watching them. Maybe that's the ridiculous script. Sid Caesar is crazy, antics for the most part not funny. Or maybe it's seeing something that brought me joy and good memories as a child treated in a metamorphosis of K-Mart fashion. In any case, the result is decidedly disappointing and ridiculous, even for the Munster standards. For the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo fits perfectly in a very vacant role (although she has more cleavage than usual for a woman of her age and experience). K. C. Martell makes Eddie Munster, always so affable. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings as the aforementioned Phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd way. The film has a really cheap meaning about it, even for a movie designed for television.
