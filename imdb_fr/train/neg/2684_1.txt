I found the film offensive to Americans who lost someone in towers, to Americans in general. As a tribute to the horrific events of recent years, each director takes the opportunity to vilify old facts (which have nothing to do with a terrorist attack), criticize the political behavior of Americans or compare political situation different from the one they experienced. country having nothing to do or share with the atrocity of 11 September. Shame on them.
