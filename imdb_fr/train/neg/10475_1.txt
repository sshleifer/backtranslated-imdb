I am the wife of a young pastor and we took young people to see this film. We then spent an hour trying to explain to them. They did not get it and I did not like it. It is based on a concept that has crossed the three major religions of the world (the biblical code, the Torah code and the Quran code) and is so debatable that it is laughable. This is not a step forward for Christians in the arts, it is a step forward for those who believe that we are checking our brains at the door.
