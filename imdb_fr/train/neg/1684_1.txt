This is the case of Columbia Pictures "The Grudge". This cinematographic atrocity began when an otherwise well-meaning American saw a Japanese director do for the TV movie 'Ju-on' and was inspired to redo the film in English. This triggered a tsunami of bad decisions that went around the world until its fall in Orlando on October 21, 2004. <br /> <br /> The premise, and I use the word vaguely, involves a house in Tokyo haunted by a meager ghost mom who looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, with his awful acolyte, a second grader chubby, exuberant but diabolical. Is there anything more scary than a scary Japanese boy of 8 years old? Of course there is! Count Chocula comes to mind. To this whimsical group, we must add a mysterious black cat that I affectionately called Chim Chim. (Do you remember Speed ​​Racer?) As you have already guessed, they were murdered at this house of misfortune and now want to kill all those who enter the place. You see, as a Japanese detective explained, when a person dies of rage, his ghost seeks revenge on all those who cross the property boundaries, as defined by the county commissioner or something like that, I forget. <br /> <br /> The story begins innocently enough with the famous spy Bill Pullman jumping from the balcony to his death. I imagine Bill Pullman got this job because of his kids begging him to go to Tokyo Disneyland. Then we go to the rather interesting saga of nurse Yoko: "Oh no, do not go back there," shouts the audience, but alas, it does not take into account terrible warnings. About 30 minutes into the film, we finally see her American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar may have been a competent actress, but I could not help but think of Buffy against the vampires to such an extent that it distracted him. That's equivalent to having Jennifer Anniston in a movie about the adventures of six friends in New York. Try as you can, you can not stop thinking about the other project that made her famous. But I move away from the subject, Karen, the nurse is hired to replace the original caregiver who has disappeared after being frightened. <br /> <br /> She walks around, meets the ghosts, the coma lady dies and some other events happen. Looking at the blonde-haired vixen looking for clues, I almost expected her to find the ghost and remove her mask to reveal that it was actually the old man Gower, owner of the park. attractions abandoned! "I would have done well also if it was not to annoy the children and your dog!" <br /> <br /> Director Takashi Shimizu, who claims to be Ed Wood from Asia, made two unfortunate decisions about sound. First, he chooses to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed. This is a great way to eliminate suspense, as the public receives a two-minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder. Second, he gave the ghosts a weird guttural sound that looked like a gargling gopher. After the movie, I heard several people coming out of the theater to sound and laugh. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up being the only survivor. And of course, we learn that the fire she lit to burn the house was turned off in time for the next mandatory chapter. However, considering the humorous reactions of the public, he did not want a continuation but an apology. 'The Grudge' could be easily reissued in a comedy, perhaps it will be appreciated for its camping value. Apart from that, it will be the biggest cinematic thriller since Godzilla vs. Megalon. I would suggest waiting until the film arrives at your local discount movie theater where it can ridicule the audience it deserves so richly.
