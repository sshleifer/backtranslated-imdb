never ever look at this sorry apology for a movie. the way it is fired, lit, acted, etc. just does not make sense. it's so hard that it's hard to watch. lots of clips are repeated beyond boredom. there seems to be no "normal" person in the whole movie and the existence of the "outside world" is, well, that just does not exist. and why does this bald suddenly become invincible? this film is beyond stupidity. zero.
