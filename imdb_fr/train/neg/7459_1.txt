save your money and go see something else. this movie was such a shit. I did not want to go, but so I had to laugh at least once, NOPE. not a single laugh, it was also awful! Chris Kattan will never have a good comic role after that and "a night at the roxbury". this film is quite obvious, has no intelligent humor, and repeats itself again and again. listen to me and get away from this movie as much as possible!
