I rented this DVD and I feel a little bad because Dawson and Lugacy are so serious in the comments of the DVD. It's not exactly a bad movie, but it's one of those films that desperately wants to make a profound comment on human nature without realizing that its story is almost a genre. Moreover, the problem is a little simplistic in many ways, and the behavior of the characters often weighs on the belief. I would say it's a movie you'd get something from if you did not have a lot of film / television / literature / life behind you (to be honest, I saw almost exactly the same story in comics from horror). Otherwise, his remark was made before and more cleverly. And that brings us to the big problem, that it does not really have cinematographic interest apart from the point. The film ends up becoming a pretty bland film that invests in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and that it does not really pay off.
