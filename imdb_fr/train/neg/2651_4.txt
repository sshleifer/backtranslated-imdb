The first half hour of the movie was hectic and hard to know what was going on (unless you read the book - that I had not read). <br /> <br /> If you can stick to the first half, the second half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet anyway. <br /> <br /> The way it was shot made it look like it was produced in the early 80s and not in 2005. <br /> <br /> No remarkable moments, bland, but it goes on without bothering me. <br /> <br /> I would like to know why Keaton chose this role, his role would have been better interpreted by a player more at the level of other actors to keep balance.
