As a big fan of the original movie, it's hard to watch this show. The screaming decorations and the hard-lit decorations remove any style from this remake. The atmosphere is never there. Instead, it has the look and feel of so many TV movies from the seventies. Crenna is not a bad choice for Walter Neff, but his catchy wardrobe and swank apartment do not match the mood of the original, nor make him an interesting character. He does his best to make it work but Samantha bad choice. The English accent and Californian looks do not stand up to Barbara Stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal. Lee J.Cobb is powerfully trying to make Barton Keyes, but even his performance is gruff, without style. <br /> <br /> It's like being in the TV movie that it was and it reminds me again of a remarkable movie the original is.
