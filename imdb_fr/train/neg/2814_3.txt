1 st watched 26/08/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): A frightening but sadistic (meaningful) portrait of a parent of the Marquis De Sade performing the same sadistic acts and taking advantage of what his predecessor was supposed to do. This film by Tobe Hooper does not really differ much from his similar-style films, Freddy Krueger, with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) playing a double role (the Marquis de Sade and his parent). It also seems that the group really wants to attack Christianity, but ultimately loses its great sorrow, leaving an inconsistent aspect to the film. It could have been a lot worse if you took excesses of sex and violence, but they try to minimize that despite disgusting scenes. My last thought is to know why Hooper would like to make this movie. Obviously, it took a while to get really distributed, then the advertising must be crude and the name of Hooper in the title so we can hope to earn money with his name and his bloody. It is obvious that it did not work.
