I am easily entertained. I enjoyed "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and their many suites, even when most people found them unbearable. I even managed to enjoy most of Pauly Shore's films. There's only one film I've seen that I can honestly say it was bad ... and that was it. It's been a long time since I've seen it, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking, "It's a silly movie, why did I see that?" Honestly, it's the only movie I can not recommend.
