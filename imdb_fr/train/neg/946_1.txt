Why is this show so popular? It's beyond me why people love it. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. <br /> <br /> Because of its popularity, I tried to watch it more than once and I can not get through an episode. <br /> <br /> For starters, the role is horrible. Everyone is too boring to look at. They speak in an unnatural voice, use unnatural tones, and have non-natural body language. I saw better play in a play of the kindergarten. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's not funny. The plots are sad. They are neither creative, nor intelligent, nor funny. Should not a sitcom be funny? Why do not I laugh? <br /> <br /> Finally, what about the seventies? It's about as authentic in the seventies as "Happy Days" in the fifties. <br /> <br /> Oh and what's going on with Ashton Kutcher? Who threw this dweeb without talent? And now, he's making movies ?? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think it's a quality TV, it worries me.
