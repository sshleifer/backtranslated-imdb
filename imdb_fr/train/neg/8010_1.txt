I am very surprised by the positive comments because we were four to have seen this during a projection and we all went out. We personally felt that it was extremely slow to watch and that we could not go through the whole movie. And we really tried to stay with her. In particular, members of the group who really wanted to love him because of their personal experiences of sexual orientation alienation during the school years represented did not like him or did not identify with him at all. :( <br /> <br /> That being said, I'm delighted to see that this film has garnered a lot of attention among viewers and critics - it's the beauty of the subjective movie art :)
