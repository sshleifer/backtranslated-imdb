Since the beginning of the film, the director has the impression of wanting to represent something. What I mean is that instead of the story dictating the style in which the film should be shot, a type of movement he wanted to do, and wrote a story as a result. And he has failed very badly. I guess he was trying to make an elegant movie. Anyway, I think this movie is a waste of time and effort. The director has the merit of knowing the media with which he works. What I'm trying to say is that I've seen some worse films than this one. Here at least the director knows how to maintain continuity in the film. And the actors also gave a decent performance.
