I hated this movie for many reasons. In the first ten minutes of the film, I became extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this film were to save itself, at least for me, it would have to come out of the huge hole he had dug. . Unfortunately, this did not happen. The two prints of the film for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to be interested in what she would bring to the film. Subsequently, I simply felt disappointed with and for all three, even though there had been "moments" in each of their performances. I imagine that for each one of them finding their "moment" was a very difficult task given the incredible lack of character development and uninspired dialogue. Although the plot is interesting, the film as a whole is so poorly written, directed and edited that anyone's performance as an actor would suffer and be tarnished. The disrespectful manner in which he has been exposed to sexual violence and America's banal and insulting view of small towns are, I think, the two main reasons why this film failed. As one critic noted and I agree with him, the film is almost impossible to commercialize given its final form. I suspect it or at least I hope (for the good of the actor anyway) that there are real gems in the editing room. Sad for us, but if this is true, the actors can find comfort and feel more comfortable giving their talent and time to such a failure. Oh yes, and something else ... I only once wanted to see an American film that included sadly missing but wonderfully bucolic sets like the one in this movie where the main characters were not absent-minded and / or did not respect the rules campaign with soft drink cans, broken CDs and other items of this kind!
