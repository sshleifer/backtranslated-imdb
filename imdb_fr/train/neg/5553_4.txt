This third Darkman was definitely better than the second, but still much worse than the original movie. What made this one better than D2 was the fact that The Bad Guy had been changed and Durant had not been brought back. Moreover, there was actually an allusion to character development when it came to the villain's family and Darkman himself. That softened my heart and I gave this movie as much as 4/10, that is, ** / *****.
