This film is bad. I do not just mean "bad" as in; "Oh the script was bad", or; "The acting in this scene was bad" ..... I mean bad, because someone should be held criminally responsible for inflicting this uncontrollable pile of nonsense to an unsuspecting public. I will not even give him an explanation of (the plot?) If I can call him that. I can only think of one other occasion, in my forties, of watching movies that I found necessary for my spleen on a movie. I mean, after all, no one is going to intentionally make a bad movie, is it? Well yes. Apparently, this is the case ... and the culprit is the author-director Ulli Lommel. But the worst thing is that Blockbusters praises this to its customers! Be advised. Leave that shit where it belongs. Stuck on the board, accumulating dust.
