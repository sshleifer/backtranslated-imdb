A good cast and they do their best with what they receive, but the story makes no sense, the actions of the characters are inexplicable, and there are too many unintentional moments of humor, like when The man is killed by being pierced with phonograph records or when the witch is intoxicated and then hit on the head with a bottle, she catches her hostage and lifts herself up. The scene where the witch and her victim (played by the same actress) are in the house unfolds like a routine of three stooges, and the plot raises the following question: if the witch wants to own the soul of this other woman, why does not he? Does she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate pursuit? Do not miss: Christopher Walkin's glasses and his automotive explanation of the afterlife (paraphrasing): "The Egyptian Egyptians - they are small materialists, they expected the body to last all eternity, like a used car that you prepared, but the Druids, they knew you could not drive in life after death, you had to go out and walk. " The end is absolutely indecipherable. Looks like they just ran out of film.
