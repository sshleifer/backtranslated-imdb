The spirit of a geek murdered in high school animates a scarecrow who then revenge everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie really pissed me off. He has a beautiful monster, has good effects on a small budget, a certain atmosphere but manages to bypass the good things with the bad ones. Halfway through, I started to move quickly, then to go through the chapters of the DVD. <br /> <br /> The problems with this film are numerous. First of all, the cast seems to be about thirty years old yet they are supposed to be in high school. You do not believe anything from the start. The scarecrow, although beautiful, is not much more than that. He says dumb a lining and moves in a way more designed to be funny then scary. Is it a comedy or a horror movie? This is a problem that goes beyond the boundaries of much of the dialogue and configuration. It seems to be more of a clich√© than honest horror movies. I think the film was designed for a very small audience, horror fans who want to make fun of the genre rather than kissing it. <br /> <br /> Despite the beautiful monster, it's a movie to avoid. Even if you pay less than five dollars to the trash, you pay too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
