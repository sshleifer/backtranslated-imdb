What happened to the British drama? From John Major to Tony Blair, gender seems to have shifted from social realism to simple women-centered normative stories about huge domestic problems of friendly middle-class professionals. <br /> <br /> (Or maybe TVNZ Do not buy the right things, let this be what it is ...) <br /> <br /> The long career of the author in the soap operas probably explains why the dialogue consists mainly of obsolete clich√©s. Niamh Cusack's performance is strong in terms of significant looks, each being held by the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve. The gloomy looks, however, hardly replace the depth of the character, if the author has failed to provide this type of material to the actors. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's basically a thriller about a murder investigation; but it is not as important as the failure of the central character's marriage and his problems. Is the husband of Cusack's character a complete bastard? Will his son be completely traumatized by the breakdown of the marriage? To make these questions the central problems is not a sign of insight, but a profoundly narcissistic identification on the part of the writer and the director, with a character who should do his work. Lynda La Plante knows how. writing such things in such a way that it feels like it matters and involves viewers other than homebound neurotics; Obviously, Paula Milne is not up to it.
