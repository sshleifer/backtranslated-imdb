A chemical spill turns people into zombies. It takes two doctors to survive the epidemic. It's a film by Andreas Schnaas so you know what the course will be. Bad acting, horrible special effects, and no budget to speak of. The dubbing is ridiculous with a capital R and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write a word about this excrement, let alone the ten mandatory lines due to the guidelines imposed by IMDb. My original comment was limited to one word: Crap would not fly, so I have to revise it and say more about how bad it is. But I do not know if I can do it, so ... wait, I think I could have enough words or lines instead of letting this test pass. Which is cool, I suppose. So, in summary: this film fears the balls, do not look at it. <br /> <br /> My note: F
