It is unlikely that anyone, except those who love silent films, can enjoy one of the lyrical scores of the camera work and the loaded (but raspy) score that accompanies this 1933 release. the sound was generalized in 1928, there are no more than fifty words that tell the story of an unmarried woman who abandons her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods. <br /> <br /> The most vividly photographed scene shows the jealous husband who takes the young man on a tour of the city, then continues normally until he realizes that the man is the lover of his wife. In a frenzy of jealousy, he rushes to a level crossing but changes his mind at the last moment, losing his courage. It is probably the most tense scene in history that is decidedly slow and obviously artificial. <br /> <br /> HEDY LAMARR receives the kind of close treatment lavished on Marlene Dietrich by her discoverer, but her beauty The beauticians had not yet refined what she had been when she was transported to Hollywood. Her performance consists mainly of looking sad and gloomy while mourning the loss of her marriage, with only a brief glimpse of the smile when she regains her true love (ARIBERT MOG), the handsome young stallion who recovers his clothes after a swim naked. <BR /> <br /> The swimming scene is very brief, discreetly photographed and not worth all the heat it has apparently generated. The love scene, later, is also cleverly photographed with the kind of lyrical photography evident in almost all the film - with art. Symbolism leaves more room for imagination - it's the sort of thing others claim the film is a sort of lyrical masterpiece. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. It's disappointing, primitively rude in its sound parts (including the laborious symphonic music in the background) and Miss Lamarr is certainly lucky that Louis B. Mayer saw the film and offered him a career in Hollywood . He must have seen something in his work that I did not see. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this film was conceived as a silent film, the camera doing all the work. The discordant "workers" scene at the conclusion lasts too long and constitutes a discordant intrusion where nothing is necessary. He can not finish the film on the appropriate note.
