Synopsis of plot: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria Tunnel, is murdered with his wife by his associates. His twins, Chad and Alex, are separated. Twenty-five years later, Chad, a karate instructor in Los Angeles, and Alex, a smuggler living in Hong Kong, join forces to avenge the murder of their parents and rightly claim the tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sheldon Lettich have worked together, having already done "Lionheart". It is also the first of three films to play between Van Damme and his dual role ("Maximum risk" and "Replicant" are the others). The plot is a very simplistic version of the story of revenge, the film only involving the performance of Van Damme as a very different character ?? the rich kid and the tough guy, the hard cigar. In fact, Van Damme does not do a very good job in both roles, although his interpretation of Alex is slightly amusing. He is curious to be mistaken for brothers, with different clothes and different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung is a man of value for the bad guys.
