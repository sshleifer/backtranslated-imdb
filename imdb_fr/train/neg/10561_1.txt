I saw this film in its day, when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life, but also described your child as bastard. At that time of "single moms", this may sound very farfetched, but it was very true. And I'm not crazy about laughing at someone who stutters, either. Between these two problems, I had trouble finding this funny movie. At that time, I did not know who realized it or what a wonderful reputation he had. I knew who Betty Hutton was and she made me nervous because she was so frenzied. I loved "Bringing Up Baby", but I find this movie just embarrassing. I'm sure the punch in some church functions has probably been increased, but it's me who needs a drink after watching it again. The idea that the girl must be drunk to get married and become pregnant only adds to the misery. An entire city could turn against you in these circumstances. The result of this film is really the most fun part. Of course, shoot me, I do not like either "It's a wonderful life".
