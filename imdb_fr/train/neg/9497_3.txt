you have a strong stomach. Holden was 55 years old at the time, but he looked almost 70 years old and lived only 8 years. At one point, Holden said, "I am over twice your age." Ok, try the triple grandpa! The theme "old enough to be your father" for which they were running did not work. Well-meaning seniors sometimes end up with legal teenagers. No more power for them, but that does not mean I want to watch it. It is not a question of judgment, but the digestive tract. I like my food where it belongs. Lenz is fun to watch and cars, clothes, furniture, etc. 70s are worth it if the cable goes late into the night and you want to watch something that will allow you to go to bed. It would have been nice to see more girlfriends scenes from Lenz's blonde friend, the one who set up her guitar. Pleasantly spacey ... Who was this chick? I will try to find out.
