I made the big mistake of watching all this movie a few days ago. God, I'm still trying to recover. This film does not even deserve an average of 1.4. IMDb must have 0 vote possible for the films that really deserve it. A 1.4 is TOO HIGH. <br /> <br /> I had heard how horrible this movie was, but I really did not think a movie could be that bad, especially nowadays. I thought that all the horrible movies of the cheese gods dated back to the 1950s and 1960s. My god was deceiving me. Believe me, this movie is really bad. It's beyond horrible; it is beyond pathetic; it's beyond any kind of word I can think of. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like the best picture of the year compared to this movie. SNAKE ISLAND (which until now was the worst movie I have ever seen) seems to deserve some Oscars in comparison to this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I can not seriously believe that the writers of this film thought it was a serious legitimate effort to produce a Hollywood movie. It does not matter to be called a movie. In the first 25 seconds of the movie, I seriously thought I was watching a high school theater class trying to make a short film. Or better yet, I thought it was a live Saturday night skit. I mean, it looks exactly like that. The game is horrible; the film almost seems to have been shot with a 20-year-old VHS video camera. the special effects ....... well good Lord Bewitched of the day had better special effects than this movie. The scene where he is being fired at the door is beyond laughable and ridiculous. I mean seriously, my introduction to the actor class of 4 years ago at the university, we could all have created a better film than this one. And the worst part of the movie, where Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh my god, I almost woke up right there. I have a strong stomach, but wow it was horrible. Some people should never be naked, and he is one of them. The plot of this movie seems to go absolutely nowhere. They talk about legal issues that we never hear about again; Ben talks about going into a music you never hear about. Arthur says he is looking for a job and money for his studies. We then see that he runs a porn store. Everything about the movie is just horrible. <br /> <br /> It really does not have much to do with my review, but for everyone to know, I'm not a gay man. However, I support the rights of homosexuals and I think we should all be treated as equals. And I would support any homosexual in my church, unlike the cruel priest of this film, who seems to be talking about everything. (O IS THE F * (# * ing white out?) Hahaha But I did not want anyone to think I hated this movie just because it's about two gays. to see with that: it would have been just as horrible a movie if it was Ben & Jill instead of Ben & Arthur. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie to see if was as bad as they say, and yes, it was worse than I had read this: leave a warning to everyone: watch this film ONLY if you want to sit and laugh at the discomfort of some 21st century movies If you watch this movie and expect a good movie or some entertainment, I do not have any sympathy for you. <br /> <br /> Finally, how is it that there is 7 movies in the category below on IMDb There is no chance that 7 films are available that are worse than that!
