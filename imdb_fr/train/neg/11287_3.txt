It's a movie that has a lot to live on. The year it was released, legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it to be the worst film of the year and I had only heard bad things about it, especially a conspiracy to be too complicated. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the plot is a kind of red clutter and the film suffers even more when the word "plot" is used because, as far as I know, there is no plot in as such. There is something about Russian gangsters, a character called Pete Thompson trying to put his wife Sarah pregnant, and an Irish guy called Sean. How they all fit into what's called a "plot", I'm not sure. It's hard to explain the intrigues of Guy Ritchie's films, but if you look at one of his films, I'm sure we can all agree that they have one, no matter how complex, at first viewing. Similarly, a James Bond movie, although the intrigues are stretched with action scenes. You will have big problems thinking that RANCID ALUMINUM has any type of central plot that can be explained in a consistent way <br /> <br /> The review of the actors list sounds good enough for you to know which movie you are going to film . watching . Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and she is doing nothing to become incoherent. Steven Berkoff gives a bad name to an actor (and he plays a character called Kant that sums up the spirit of the film) while one of the secondary characters is played by a television presenter, probably because no serious actress would have been seen dead in this movie. <BR /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's totally forgettable. I saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching, I was going to write a very long critical comment warning people of what they let themselves do while watching, but now I mostly forgot why. But that does not change the fact that I remember not loving this shit immensely
