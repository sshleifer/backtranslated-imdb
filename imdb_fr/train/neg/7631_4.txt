I will not go over the obvious peterbogdanovichian flaws of TLPS. Instead, I'll take a look at the positive aspects of this oversized pygmy celluloid film. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich has managed to make a film that can be endured in its entirety. This alone places the film high up in the top of his lame filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich showed how some lucky friends can be unbelievably generous by sharing the fabulous body and breasts of Cybill Shepherd (her then daughter) with her male audience - not just one but twice. Brava! The undeniable strengths of this film festival nap. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS has barely a scene without stereotypical country music scribbling in the background. (Peter tried to make it clear that the movie was taking place in the Great South of the United States (as if it were not obvious), so he hammered it over and over again ...) What is this? advantage? request? Well, when the film finally ends and the monotonous country music finally stops massaging your tired eardrums, you start to feel a strange exaltation: "The movie is finally over!" It's pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives hope to all women who resemble Cloris Leachman. Hopefully they will also be able to catch a much younger and perhaps even more handsome boyfriend someday. <br /> <br /> 5. The biography of Cloris Leachman (which I am technically aware of not being part of TLPS) gives hope to all women who look like this, so that they may one day win a Miss Chicago beauty contest. (Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury.) <br /> <br /> (You think I'm joking about Cloris who won a beauty contest, huh? and then we'll see who laughs last ...) <br /> <br /> 6. The film was shot in black and white, which spared us the face of Cloris Leachman in his natural non-glory of origin.
