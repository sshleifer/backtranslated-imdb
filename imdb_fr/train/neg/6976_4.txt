Robert Altman's western downbeat, from Edmund Naughton's "McCabe", was neglected at the time of its release, but has attracted a lot of interest in recent years. Aside from a compelling city scenario, the characters here do not deserve much interest and the image is (intentionally) chaotic and unappealing. Bearded Warren Beatty embodies a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in a struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and participates in the organization of the first brothel; Once the profits begin to be profitable, Beatty is naturally threatened by the hard-core city-dwellers who want to participate in the action. For the film, Altman creates a winter and solemn atmosphere that gives the audience an idea of ​​the time and place, but the action in this dismal little town is limited - most of the story is made up of vignettes - and Altman's pace is deliberately slow. We rarely make a statement (on the contrary, in fact) and the languorous actors look at each other without concern. It is an image that goes against the goal, and yet, in a very offbeat way, he proudly wears defeat. ** from ****
