We do not have that on TV in England, but I've read it on the Internet on YouTube. It's stupid, immature and boring! This is from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel, I never had this caricature but I have to admit it better than that. The designer has not done anything for years. For Doug TenNapel, this is a parody of return and a record level! The story is about three cats who inherit a house and a lot of money from their old mistress who died. They are argumentative and continue to disagree over what they want to spend their money on. "BORING!" The animation is terrible. The main characters are supposed to be cats, right? But they do not look like cats! Just strange animals that look like monsters with big mouths, sharp teeth and dark circles! The human and animal characters are also drawn really ugly! The theme song is terrible and irritating! In addition, the stories are lame and are probably copied from old shows. It surprised me to see how this show got 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb viewers. Television is not really what it was! But now, most of them are stupid, cheap and boring. Some of you on the website may not agree with me. I'm sorry, it's a total waste of money and a total waste of your time. I'm glad that Britain did not tolerate this shit too much (oh yes, if you have the digital, you have to) but I do not do it, so that's not my problem! Losing! 2/10 (and it's very lucky to have it because I gave the worst to other shows!).
