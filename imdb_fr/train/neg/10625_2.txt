I am a Grade 11 at my high school. In my world news class, a child in my class had this video and suggested we watch. So we did it. I firmly believe that we went to the moon, since my dad works for NASA. Although I think this movie is the biggest shit I've ever seen, the guy who created it has serious problems. First of all, did he have to show JFK to get shot? And how dare he use all these biblical quotations? The only good thing about this movie is that it's a debate, which is good because in my class we have weekly debates. This movie did nothing to change my mind. I think Michael Moore and he should work together and make another film. Michael Moore's next film might be called "A Funny Thing on November 11th" or "A Funny Thing on the Way to the White House".
