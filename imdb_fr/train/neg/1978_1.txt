Pathetic is the word. Bad acting, pathetic scenario, insolent dialogue, music and hip hop ... what was going on with that? The director of this film is as bad as the movie he did. If someone had taken the time and effort to rework all this, he might have had a chance. I bet the studios are still trying to figure out how they could fail so badly. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... the Asian girl was not that bad either. These girls also wore the whole movie. If there had not been these people, I would have destroyed my copy of this film. <br /> <br /> If someone from those who have not seen it yet and who had the idea, do not waste your time ... you will regret it later.
