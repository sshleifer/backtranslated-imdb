The Little Mosque is one of the most boring comedies I've ever seen. They have the means to produce the easiest comedy shows for the most agitated viewers, which for CBC / Radio-Canada refers to 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. The jokes are all predictable and so deadly that I can not believe it. The performances are very agitated and out of date, but I do not blame the actors, because this kind of one-dimensional stereotypical characters is probably exactly what the CBC was asking for and asking for. A very lame show with bad jokes that they tried to present as "controversial". It's less controversial than other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer Report.
