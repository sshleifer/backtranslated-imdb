This film, although not totally bad, should have been filmed where the real events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska, was devastated by no less than seven tornadoes on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located in the almost tree-less Platte River Valley in Hall County. The filmmakers filmed in the tree-lined hills of Ontario and transferred the entire event to a non-existent city called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island have courageously survived this terrible night before being forgotten because of a bad film.
