When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical. Like "The Harvey Girls". It's not. It is a pudding that has overcooked, hit the ceiling of the kitchen, was removed and paved. No music and not a piece of time, but absolutely improbable. <br /> <br /> It begins with Patriarch James Woods telling the eldest of his three daughters, a small child who becomes Barbara Stanwyck, that she must keep the last name and at home. <br /> <br /> So we think it will be an intergenerational historical tale. And it is for a brief moment. This brings us back to the story of Stanwyck's fierce fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead against him? Why else? As we learned in a strange flashback sequence told by Stanwyck, she had already thought about being able to inherit money (for her sisters as well as for herself) by getting married. She hit a person she considered a peasant girl, who was actually a budding lawyer, Brent. <br /> <br /> Lest anyone think of his child, a young man about eight years old at the time of the main plot, well, you know ... They had a hurried marriage and during the very short period when they were together, it was conceived. <br /> <br /> One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young, who is played by Gig Young. The other sister tries to take him away. Etc., etc. <br /> <br /> It's an acute and uncomplicated mess - well done, but without a hint of logic or likelihood.
