Or listen, by the way. Even the soundtrack is boring. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is not the worst gay movie I've seen (regarding Concerning Billy), but it's located very close to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This thing drags and drags and drags. It's not that the plot is meaningless - it might have worked in the hands of a good writer. . . it certainly could have been a lot more fun. There is not a point of intrigue you can not see coming in ten miles down the road. The dialogue is flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to injury, he is full of unidimensional stereotypical gays. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film convinced me that the situation or the relationship between the two main characters was possible and even less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamics, in fact no evidence of why the sons loved each other. . . we are just told that they are in love. Hard to understand when they have nothing in common and they are not sexually compatible. They like the same book? Huh? <br /> <br /> The acting is not totally bad, but the pace is extremely slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch - slow, but without Jarmusch quality. In fact, it would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch's movies, avoid this one.
