OK, I knew it would be an F movie in an alley (well below the norms of movie B), so I thought, "Dude, I could laugh, so let's see people kill each other." Well, what I got could have been found in your local "Love Toy" store. Random lesbian scenes, very little fighting and no plot. <br /> <br /> For example, one particular scene that I remember (for its sheer stupidity, I've already seen some of the best porn on ABC) is where the two characters (I do not remember more of their names ... great movie, huh?) drive as they did most of the time, and the driver was tired of driving and stopped: <br /> <br /> Driver: "Let's shoot I'm tired, you want to take over? "Passenger:" Of course, I can drive for a while. " (Once stopped, the driver starts to catch the passenger's breasts) Passenger: "What are you doing, I'm not like that!" Pilot: "It does not matter, everyone does it sometimes." Passenger: "OK then." (Proceed to remove shirts, petting, fondling and fellatio) <br /> <br /> Now, the last time I checked, horror movies were not part of the Hollywood Video porn section (Unless you love S & M, you go elsewhere), and you do not want it to be in Blockbuster's mainstream videos. Do not mistake yourself; I'm certainly not one of those who hate porn, but I only watch it when it's appropriate and I certainly do not want to watch it if I'm looking for a movie in mainstream stores, because the one I rented was at one o'clock. from the two retailers I named (and probably from the other too if I went there). <br /> <br /> The worst film of all time, no one should praise it, it should only be bought for a public ceremony. If I could give him a 0, I would, but I can only give him a * of 10.
