In 1692, Salem, a devious child's lie about a slave's involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into a tumult. The costume drama starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not suffocating, although it is not a living description of contagious hysteria either. Worked by three authors (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead and Bradley King), the elements of the story are rather interesting (especially those of Hollywood in 1937). The melodrama presented here will not be tolerated very long. The biggest problem with photography may lie in the cast: Colbert and MacMurray are a poorly matched couple of lovers hampered by the witch hunt, MacMurray being a much too contemporary presence for these surroundings. * 1/2 of ****
