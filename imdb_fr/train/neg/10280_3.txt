Did HeidiJean really see this movie? A good Christmas movie? Not even close. Sad, bland and completely lacking imagination and heart. I kept watching this movie and wondering who the hell thought Carly Pope could play the main role in this movie! The woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely dull performance. Baransky was brilliant as usual and provided the only way to interest the whole thing. His involvement was probably the only reason why this project was given a green light. Maybe I was expecting too much for a Lifetime movie shot 15 days after Christmas, but I figured that with a different director and a JJ doing a new role with an actress, it could at least be sympathetic. .
