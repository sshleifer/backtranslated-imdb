In my book "Basic Instinct" was a perfect movie. Stone, Douglas, and all the minor actors played an exceptional role. There was wonderful photography, music and blackest black scripts. All this makes a movie as good as possible! <br /> <br /> This sequel is exactly the opposite, it can not get worse, a bad scenario and a lame scenario, associated with a totally inept attitude direction, it's really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that concentrates you a bit on concentration is the relatively short wait for the next scene which is an exact reconstructed copy of the original. These copies are so bad that they make you laugh and I laughed a lot in spite of myself, because it was like watching the demolition of a brilliant monument. The only good thing about this horrible mess is the excerpt from Jerry Goldsmith's BI 1 score. Michael Caton-Jones and the animator in charge of the script have even included the dialogue "It is not allowed to smoke in this room" in the scene of the interrogation and yes, she sends back her lawyer (who is now a lawyer)! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I saw this horrible movie that should never have been done! This damages the original, so it's serious. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure Mrs. Stone offered the best possible surgeons) can do a good job but obviously can not restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body also applies to the making of movies. There should be a law: never follow a perfect movie!
