I do not remember a movie where I cared less about where the characters came from, what happens to them or where they go. I realize Hollywood's biggest hobby is belly button watching, but these people are too despicable or boring to take time. For the sake of it, however, the discussion that followed the screening, under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series, suggested that the three women might have shown some redeeming features. I do not agree.
