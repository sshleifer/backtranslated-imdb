This movie only has a 1 because you can not give a scratch! If you have a weak stomach, do not look. animal rights people you do not want to watch either. it makes vegetarian people, I swear I witnessed that! the only interesting parts are the case and the fact that it is a true story. It's really really scary that this guy worked at ADT while he killed people! Still feeling safe when you insert this little code? I do not! He had access to all Kansas codes !!!!!! I hated the movie, it was not scary, it was mentally scary! Do yourself a favor and do not rent / buy this movie, I think it costs about $ 20 to do it, INCLUDING their paid actors in addition !!!!
