This is the worst shit I've seen recently. There is nothing good in this movie. The plot is completely stupid, the dialogues are meaningless, the humorous scenes have never heard anything about true humor. The actors do not play, the worst they do not even try. The script itself is a bit in the same category as Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this movie, the fighting. They are well choreographed, as one would expect from Hong Kong guys, and are the only reason to watch Prince of the Sun. Although I think the fights are just supposed to fill the void so that the screenwriter does not have to worry about the plot. However, this weak and absurd plot can prevent you from watching it through. Avoid it unless you are a fan of the dragon lady Cynthia Rothrock.
