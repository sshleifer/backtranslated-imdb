Oh, a story so familiar to the comedy about Paul (Jason Lee), a nice and discreet man who, after the night of his bachelor party, wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), a pretty blonde that he met the night before. After lying to his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair), he has to say more and more lies to hide his tracks. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most of us have witnessed a story like this at least once before ... in movies or on television. The film is very stereotyped and extremely predictable, with an end that you might see arriving one kilometer away. <br /> <br /> At least distribution attracts interest and keeps it on the go. Lee is just in the lead, and Stiles is very entertaining in a light comic role, different from the very serious roles she usually plays. Becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know, it's not really well written. At least one question remains unanswered: for WHAT, exactly, is Beck (formerly Becky's ex-boyfriend) Ray (Lochlyn Munro) being examined by the AI? <br /> <br /> And I did not like the character of Buck (David Koechner), Paul's father-in-law; he was a super-heinous fool who made me so angry that I begged someone to hit him. <br /> <br /> Add another debit: a free and uncredited Larry Miller comedy / actor, playing a grouch again (in this case, it's a bit justified - his character is a super minister) -conservateur). <br /> <br /> Not good at all, but as usual for me, I give it a three out of ten based on the efforts of the cast alone.
