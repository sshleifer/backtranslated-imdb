Tara Reid as intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... well, it's STEPHEN DORFF FOR Christ SAKE !!!! Personally, I simply want to thank these brilliant casting directors for their hard work and hard work. You are on guys. Here is an idea, humble opinion humble as a film becoming public but it follows directly your previous choices, a film on the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history invents a tablet to heal all diseases never known to man and get it Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton have to play. I knew you would like that. Seriously, you owe me $ 7.50.
