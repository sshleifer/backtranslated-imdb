The incredible Melting Man plays like an extended episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and a bit of nudity. I know this movie is a little ugly, but I found it impossible not to like it. <br /> <br /> The action and the scenario are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30 year old movie with a budget of $ 50 - the main character takes a while to melt, but when he does, it's pretty impressive; we also have an inventive death scene involving electrocution. It should also be noted that the music is scathing - a mix of absurd sensations. <br /> <br /> Notable highlights: <br /> <br /> Admire the slow-motion nurse who jumps through a glass pane for absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> Let yourself be amazed by a day in the life of a severed head. <br /> <br /> * Pay attention to the psychotic, cannibal and fusion humanoid. Called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Let yourself be surprised when our hero stops to chase the crazy madman for a bowl of soup and complain about the lack of cookies in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> This movie is just too bad for me to hate it. It's ugly and trashy but I thought it was a lot of fun. You could do a lot worse.
