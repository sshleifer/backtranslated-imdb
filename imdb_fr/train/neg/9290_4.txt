EVALUATIONS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Longtime detainee Twitch (Kurupt) is transferred to a prison harder than the re-opened Alcatraz. He claims that it is closer to his wife but his real motives are a little more grandiose. There, he crosses the path with Burke (Bill Goldberg), a bulky prisoner able to take care of himself. Twitch, although less muscular, has just as much mouth and is about the same. But there is a gang war going on between black and Hispanic detainees that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black gang leader is shot down and his finger points to Burke. But sh! T really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the Hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes hostage Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does not oppose the idea of ​​Under Siege 2 and only agrees to do so on the condition that the film company with which he was at the time his own movie), so even though this is a DVD sequel, the main role this time is Bill Golberg (Steve does not even appear in some archive footage of the first film that appears to the end.) But there's a reason he has not worked a lot since Universal Soldier 2 and that's because he's not really an actor, and he's not a star either. action that manages a character that begins with dark and dark cover, but subtly transforms into a standard hero knocking awkwardly at rest. In terms of support, veterans of the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, simply jumped at the opportunity for extra work. <br /> <br /> This is a film that has tried very well to copy the style of the original, with soft lighting, dark shadows and rap music playing a lot. He does that very well. Unfortunately, he can not fight against a hero without commitment, a cardboard villain and an apathetic story that manufacturers seem to have invented a lot as they go along. **
