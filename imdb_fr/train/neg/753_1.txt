Wow ... <br /> <br /> After reading online that it was published early, I spoke at the local Wal-Mart. It's been a while since I'm on the internet and I just bought the movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I guess what really struck me is the editing. , or the absence of. Time and again, characters (usually the narrator and whoever with him) are shown walking ... and walking ... and walking. I am not an editor, but I know you can separate a person leaving point A to show him to get to point B. It is not necessary to show almost the whole trip! Wow ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I felt a little sorry for the actors involved. They seem to have received no direction as to what to do in scenes other than looking frightened or looking happy, depending on the action to be added later. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <Why it was decided to do almost all the effects using the CG goes beyond me. Even ILM still sometimes uses thumbnails. One of the most embarrassing uses of the green screen in this film is the constant (last generic) precipitation of the same group of people representing citizens from different cities and towns, including London. Sometimes these people come and go without worrying about the angle of the shot or the distance to the camera. In one stroke in London, there seems to be at least two men over six feet walking right behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without a distracting mustache). Since GETTYSBURG, I have never seen such a fake piece of hair for the face. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why did Timothy Hines talk about this movie the way he did it beyond me? It's a turkey, pure and simple. On the benefits side (at least for me), it has provided some of the most authentic laughter we've seen in a long time.
