"Tapeheads," a funny and sometimes amusing parody of the video market, might have been the perfect comedy short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly into the absurd chaos involved. They play the role of two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own business, Video Aces, which produces hilarious videos for groups, parties and a death-bed star. It's unfortunate that filmmakers had to invent an obscure plot to gain time (shenanigans involving a dishonest politician and his henchmen who do not do much except undermine the film's prime strength and convey the musical culture of the film. film, late 80s). However, Cusack and Robbins create here some original: nerdy but cowardly, intelligent without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same wavelength, and they never go down. They are the real thing in boyfriend comedies. * 1/2 of ****
