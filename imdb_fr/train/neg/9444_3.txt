I'll only say one thing about Cat in the Hat ... as a children's movie and a good comedy movie, it sucks ... I've lost track of the number of terrible jokes in the film that not only was nil, but also did not exactly kid appropriate Oh and by the way the cat in the hat spoke was annoying ... as for the plot that I completely forgot. I do not know why Mike Myers joined the band, but I think the writers were trying to give him the tone that sounded like Austin's powers without the swinger conversation and that it was too successful. do not see it, it belongs to the bottom 100 .............................. the jokes are so ugly that it's funny
