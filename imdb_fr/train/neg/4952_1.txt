Okay, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series and even Batman Beyond. I even read a batman cartoon from time to time. So, as you can imagine, I was a little excited when I heard about this series, and then I was SEVERELY disappointed. This series is nothing. It does not even begin to compare with the original series. It's like a long TOY pub. No depth whatsoever. And what the hell was he with the Joker? Who, in my humble opinion, is the best villain of Batman of all time and they killed him. I wish I could say that his design was the worst part. In fact, I wish I could say that this series is not creative or interesting. In short (because, believe me, I could say much more), do not waste your time on this show, nor your money.
