This is available on a Dark Sky Films "Drive In Double Feature", and since I had just finished "Barracuda", I was watching that too. It's a film that is incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time. <br /> <br /> We start with two young women wandering the streets of a foreign city, but where are they exactly? They stop to look at the collars of a Chinese salesman and try Chinese-style clothes in a shop, but then we see Aztec dancers? And all the while, these girls are followed by two guys who end up giving up their stealth without having to chase them in a frantic race through the city and they finally catch them. <br /> <br /> It seems that one of the girls is carrying a coin on a string around her neck and these guys want to find the loot, and where did she get it? So, in the flashback, we come back to find out. And how did they know she had this room? Hard to say, really. <br /> <br /> Now, at the time, when these two women were 10 years old, they would go out with their sister and their sister's boyfriends on a boat, then stop to get some fresh air. They bring the boy back to his home so that his grandfather can come out and invite the "young ones" to have tea with his grandmother, but not everyone has tea at hand, Todd went back on board the boat to take care of the girls, then when they left, the boat explodes and when they come home, their friends mysteriously disappeared .. It looks like these "nice people" are raising their own vegetables, but they wait for the meat to be spelled and serve it with an herbal tea. <br /> <br /> But the girls and Todd left the island, but now they come back, escorted by their captors, and they are there to find the treasure, although no one has ever shown the girls where he was There seems to be someone else on the island too, and the hooligans mysteriously begin to die, one by one, and as there are only three, it does not take long. And there is even a kind of happy ending that will leave the viewer as confused as in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The two thugs seem to be speeding maniacs with anger problems and combined. without any ability to act, they are hilarious at the limit. The hillbilly family is also devoid of the ability to act, despite the fact that his grandfather is Hank Worden, who has appeared in many movies and TV shows. The action is confusing, the places are even more confusing and the island looks like Southern California. <br /> <br /> So what's this mess? I'm not sure, but it's definitely worth seeing once to be able to think (or say), huh? 4 out of 10, very strange.
