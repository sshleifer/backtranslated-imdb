I just finished watching it on TV and what can I say but it's the worst movie I've ever seen! I am embarrassed to be from Melbourne, where the film was shot. An evil game, amateur make-up effects and a really bad soundtrack. As for the plot, well, it's even MORE stupid! Some scenes have just left me stunned by the gravity of the situation. There is a reason they put these types of movies on TV late at night - because they are garbage! Avoid at all costs.
