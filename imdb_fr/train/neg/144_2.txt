There is no way to describe how bad this movie really is. It's a shame that I attended this film, this very tedious and predictable film. What's wrong with that? Play: there is not a performance that is as close as being less than normal (at least, they are all very pretty). Soundtrack (songs): "If we have Orgy on the soundtrack, everyone will know they are watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack (score): All right, but anyone with a keyboard can create an acceptable soundtrack nowadays. Do not even get me started on "What are you doing?" moments, here are some of them: the killer can move at the speed of light - the door opens, the actress turns, no one is there, turns, there is something sitting in front of her. The killer arrives with a drill, a big fat! The filmmakers have points to at least plug in, but can I really believe that the killer took the time to find the power outlet to plug it in? I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of Holy Grail and I mean "Where did you get the drill?" I could go on and on about the gravity of this movie but I only have 1000 words. I will give this 2 out of 10 stars. A star to make me laugh and another star for all the cleavage. Seriously, do not waste your time with this one.
