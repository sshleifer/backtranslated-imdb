I have always loved Fred MacMurray and, although his career was tragically shortened, I think Carole Lombard is fun to watch. Combine these two major and attractive stars, add extra players such as Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, create a romantic scenario, team up with famous director Mitchell Leisen and get a mediocre cinematic experience. Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) meet "cute" during her visit to the Panama Canal and spend the next few weeks in love. Skid is a great trumpet player, so he embarks on a musical career that, as one might expect, is meteoric at its peak. During his rise to musical fame, he neglects Maggie, who later inspires him to start again after hitting the bottom. Ah yes? This is the true Hollywood denouement, which does not happen too soon. <br /> <br /> Stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this film is so predictable and slow that it is difficult to watch sometimes. The first scenes taking place in Panama are so slippery that they seem to drag on and later, an alcoholic Skid simply wanders in New York. Fred and Carole are doing their best, but the tired scenario and the direction of the S-L-O-W do not give them a chance. Even the final scene, in which Maggie encourages Skid to be reborn from his ashes of alcohol and disappointment, does not sound right. <br /> <br /> This film should be seen once to watch some of the first shows of the stars MacMurray and Lombard. However, I guarantee you that watching it will take about 48 hours.
