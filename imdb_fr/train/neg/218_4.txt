*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story sounds great and if you've read the novel, you're probably expecting an intense and deep film that could provide insights into interesting and under-explored human relationships. <BR /> <br /> Of course, the script tries to do that, the director tries to do it, but the main cast fails miserably. Maria's play is so dry that she feels absolutely nothing, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes she seems nervous about the camera. Her only really exciting scene is towards the end, where she is dumped by her girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and worse, she does not seem at all natural. Maria had the attitude, even though she had been artificially pushed to become obvious, but she had it and her character received some credibility. And to make matters worse, we do not know her: where did she come from, how did she get involved in the lesbian relationship, how did this relationship evolve? We only receive some information from her parents and their relationship simply seems to be present: she has a content and an end, but no beginning. Like her partner Maria, she has only one really touching scene, the one where she strips Kiki of Maria's character. <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this film (apart from the owner, she plays very well there) who manages to prove her acting talent. He has the attitude of his character and it suits him. Once or twice, he seems to hesitate (the scene at his parents' meal, he tries to be obvious when it was not necessary at all). <br /> <br /> I like the story, Tudor Chirila is OK there, the owner acts and Puya delivers his lines with style, but that does not save the film. Too bad, the whole set had a huge potential and Romanian cinematography could have used a film on this theme. <br /> Curiously, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-nonsense feel (well, the interludes spoken of Maria are a good try in this direction) lesbian relationship of Maria and Ioana. I'm really sorry for spending money on a ticket, I would have rather looked in the comfort of my room.
