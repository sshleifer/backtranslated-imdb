This film is a loss of film stock. Do you think that the map of a military mission plan would be placed on an easel on a terrace in broad daylight so that anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom is visible? It happened in this movie. Do you think a DEAF person would actually be enlisted in the service army in Europe during the Second World War to serve in a "Negro" unit ... of cooking, supplies, burial, etc.? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that a black (and so-called intelligent) officer would choose this same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the Germans before the arrival of allies? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that Private DEAF did not understand that a German plane was approaching from behind and would kill him? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised if a group of American soldiers stranded in a barn on a farm that the Germans are confronted with would like to express their emotion at the sight of the German soldiers who are only fifty minutes away? They did it in this movie and left all the possible entries of the barn that the Germans could check without any protection. Would you believe that, on the airwaves and in plain English, the captain mentioned the rank of the general, if not his name, as a person with whom he spoke and that the general, in clear English on open air, has declared to be protected the next day? Perhaps they should have sent an emissary to indicate the direction in which the American attack would be launched, which would make the task of the Germans easier. This so-called movie should be placed on a list of the 50 worst movies. If that were the case, I'm sure it would be fine. Watch it at your own risk.
