2 stars for Kay Francis - she is wonderful! And she did not deserve this horrible tripe from Warner Bros. <br /> <br /> The principle behind this film is ridiculous and incredible in the extreme. Kay is a woman and a small town mother who longs for something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a great actor arrives in town and invites Kay to her hotel to talk about the possibilities, Kay tells her husband that she is going to the movies. The urge of a mother of her husband makes her husband believe that Kay does not tell the truth, and he goes out looking for her. He finds her with the actor in the hotel (they are just talking!) And he pulls the guy, who falls over a balustrade, lands the first face in a pond (lake?) And dies. Here are the two incredible premises on which the rest of the film is based: <br /> <br /> 1) the judge tells the jury that if it is determined that the man is dead * before * his head has fallen in the water, they must find the husband guilty of first degree murder. (Whaaaaa ??????I think hitting a man in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder at most 2, not the murder of PREMIER DEGRE.) Give me a break! But the plot required that he be found guilty of murder 1 so that he can be sent to prison for life, regardless.) <br /> <br /> 2) Her husband's lawyer, after conviction and pronouncement of painfully, tells Kay that it's all his fault. Her reasoning is as follows: if she had not gone to the actor's room, her husband would not have had to pursue her, hit the guy and kill him. He tells her she's the culprit, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the film only talks about Kay trying to gain notoriety and money so that her husband is released from prison and corrects the harm she has done by forcing him to kill the actor's guy. <br /> <br /> I can not even continue with this criticism. The film was too painful. Four years ago, at the time of the pre-code, you would never have surprised Kay playing in such a way! In true Kay Francis, however, she did her best to make us believe that this woman was a credible character. I attribute great credit to him for trying to give a little life and credibility to this thankless role. This character was far from the roles of Kay pre-coded and real life, Kay Francis. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this one! There are much better Kay Francis vehicles! (From my personal experience, I can strongly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery, Drs Monica and One Way Passage are also excellent, I'm sure there are some great Kay movies too, but I do not mention than those I've seen and can recommend.)
