Sorry, but aside from Kim Basinger doing a great job, it's one of the worst thrillers I've seen in a long time. The logic is set aside as 4 young guys terrorize this woman in front of a crowded mall, then shoot at a security guard. Yet, nobody seems to notice it. Then, instead of screaming for help or returning to the mall, she leaves and finds herself in the middle of the woods with the guys in pursuit. I can not even describe how ridiculous it is to see this woman fleeing four delayed thugs, wearing a red toolbox, shouting for God to come and help her, and then sleep with one of them after brutally killing the other. Please trust me, it's bad and a bit bland too.
