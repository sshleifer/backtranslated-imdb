no quality of redemption can possibly be expressed. I wish I could recover my time. pretty big skull face really smiles, shining on camera when the disease has already ravaged enough the misinformed scenario. I was "happy" to see all the characters who were dead or seriously disabled at the end, especially party revelers who drank the contaminated juice en route to the so-called sunset. Eli Roth shines at times, maybe ten, and exposes the theory that weeds smoke well in the woods, while others are really demonic when it comes to drinking beer. All in all, I found most of these things useless, although not without gratuitous violence and without enough nudity, happy to witness the disappearance of the cast, in a way, wishing that this trip would not never happen (probably should have been fired instead of watching TBS late night, ugh).
