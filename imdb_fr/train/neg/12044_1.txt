I went to see the movie "Troy" this afternoon. Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> Unlike public opinion and history in general, Greek men were not homosexuals. ALREADY. This was clearly established at the beginning of the film and strengthened every five minutes thereafter. This film is therefore safe for American men. <br /> <br /> Helen de Troy has always had a make-up and impeccable hair. She was superb in all her brief cameo scenes that, although many, were probably shot the same day, one after the other, with the director saying, "All right, now, be beautiful ... well ... OK, now looks scared ... good ... now looks depressed ... well ... now interested ... good ... now handsome again ... well ... "</ br> > <br /> Most Greek and Trojan men had British accents. Those with American accents could not act. <br /> <br /> The Trojans looked like the Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt does not blink. camera. <br /> <br /> Helen's biggest replica of Troy was, "They come for me." <br /> <br /> Troyan music is remarkably similar to modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's thighs go all the way. <br /> <br /> Achille had a young friend with whom he was very close, but it's okay. They were cousins. It does not matter what the story says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell a whole story with just one expression. <br /> <br /> The Trojan gods all apparently had Greek names, but their statues also had an Egyptian appearance. or like Peter O'Toole in drag. <br /> <br /> Greek men never touched unless they fought, much like the Americans. <br /> <br /> The thousands of extras of the film had exactly the same skin color ... Egyptian light, Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy only had three women. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of blonde Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who otherwise would have stayed out of the game. <br /> <br /> Despite their coastal desert, the Greeks had the worrying ability to find unlimited amounts of lumber to light fires, pyres, Trojan horses, and so on. British actors look ridiculous with Greek hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt changes his expression only when the sun shines directly in his eyes. <br /> <br /> The Greek soldiers argue constantly, but their outfits always seemed impeccable. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the Greek temples were still in ruins, even when they were brand new.
