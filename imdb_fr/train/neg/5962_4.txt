Paul Naschy has made a lot of horror movies. In terms of quality, they range from fairly good to unassailable waste; and unfortunately, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter. The plot is just the average story of a witch, a wizard or (as is the case here) a warlock who is put to death - but not before vowing revenge on those who have it done ... etc. etc. one thing leads to another, and very quickly, the executed warlock is useless. The plot is slow, painfully boring and the film seems constantly useless. The characters are full of diatribes and never serve the film in any way. Paul Naschy wrote the script and, if you ask me, he should continue to play because the dialogue is extremely banal and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil, provides a dull direction here, who likes the dialogue does not help to help the film. Sometimes shitty movies like this have a certain charm; but Horror Rises from the Tomb does not even have that. It is a painfully boring film that has little or no interest.
