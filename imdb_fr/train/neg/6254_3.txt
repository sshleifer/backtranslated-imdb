A friend of mine was part of the cast as an agent of the FEDS (a part that does not speak, if I remember correctly). He brought it on DVD so that I could see it. It was "interesting", but it looked a lot like an amateur movie. A well done amateur movie, though. Really boring and poorly written. It was probably fun to participate and be involved, but it certainly did not deserve a broad version. Maybe they might like Omaha, but this Californian girl was bored and frankly embarrassed by my friend's commitment. have a very interesting story, and good actors. I'm sure it was a great learning tool for them. I wish them good luck in the future and hope they can improve their film production.
