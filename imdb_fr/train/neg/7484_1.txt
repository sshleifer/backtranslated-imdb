In less than 15 minutes, my whole family wanted Goldi Hawn's character to die or at least Steve Martin's character to leave. At 40 minutes, we turned it off. We only try a few films a year and we are so boring that we can not even stand it long enough to make history. <br /> <br /> Normally, I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. and I remember enjoying the original Neil Simon. So, I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director of "What's the worst that can happen" and the writer of "Miss Congeniality 2", and I guess that's what we're achieving.
