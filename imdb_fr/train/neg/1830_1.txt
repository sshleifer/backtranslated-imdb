This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I am not joking. the next time that happens, I'll always be content to put my head against a wall. it would be nice for me to sit in an emergency room to try to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen rather than try to go through this movie again. <br /> <br /> I hope Black and Stiller will never work together on such a bad project. they are both good comedians, so I was shocked that it was so embarrassing. <br /> <br /> if they had to start all over again, I'm pretty sure they would decide not to do it. the people who put the money in front, must have lost a ton. not really, because the special effects (both) were terrible.
