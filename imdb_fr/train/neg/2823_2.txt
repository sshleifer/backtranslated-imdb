Well, TiVo recorded this because of Angelina Jolie. He had 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. The descent is fast. <br /> <br /> There are many things to do, even from Angelina. She is about 20 years old and plays at 16 years old. Three characters are supposed to be Italian. All others are Italian-American. The Italian accents were good, I thought. The young man is cute, says my wife. Everyone in this movie is a fat Italian woman. Even men. <br /> <br /> I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was called an excited doctor, it was a bad sign. The two couples who chase their children are like the four Italian friends. <br /> <br /> My wife would not let go of the remote. Let's hope she does not take any makeup, clothing or decoration tips. It was a sick and twisted combination of ugly and screaming. It was hidden. <br /> <br /> Cutting my left ventricle was not enough to distract from the pain of watching this movie. If this movie appears on your TV, do yourself a favor and instead move your head to the TV screen. You will be glad to have done it. "Hamburger: The Movie" is the only movie I have ever seen that is worse. Or maybe "deadly friend".
