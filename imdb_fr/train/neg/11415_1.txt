AWFUL is only the first name. This film is a piece of cliche scrap. A high school comedy set up in a military training camp. I'm sorry for giving this star it did not deserve. <br /> <br /> THIS MAY CONTAIN WRITERS: <br /> <br /> Almost everything is totally forced, unconvincing and unrealistic. The HEPO (Military Police) will not pick you up if you do not appear, especially not the day of your wedding. The actors were quite embarrassed during this scene, because the scene did not work because it was very improbable. You can feel it in their voices. Even if they were not such bad actors, they could not have saved the scene. <br /> <br /> Then the guy has to practice in his wedding suit. No, there was no time to give him a uniform first. Dude, it's an excellent cinematography! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There are also GIRLS in the camp - exciting - one of them is even a model, even if they do not look very pretty - and the baddest actress I've ever view. I doubt that in Hollywood they let her say a single line in a movie B. <br /> <br /> Ok girls in the army! Now, it's starting to be fun. The girls are even placed on the same floor, so you can sneak into their room at night! In reality, they would be placed in a different building a quarter of a mile apart by two fences with barbed wire. <br /> <br /> There are reservoirs we can use for a fun ride in our free time, and we have a lot of them. No, the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted. Nobody will notice the sounds of the engine, especially not at night. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of sex scenes and references, and all are under the garbage limit. We need these so that the sexually obsessed Germans also love the movie. Switzerland is too small a market for a feature film. Good game! <br /> <br /> A sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Surely, none of these facilities is ever locked. Military routines are as sloppy as possible. <br /> <br /> At the end of the brainless movie, mafia killers speak of revenge against the poor guy who tries to shoot him! Because he has deserted his fiancee! Of course I buy that, the Italians are like that - a jealous group (not). <br /> <br /> The perpetrators try to do it in broad daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not at night in a dark alley. Once again, the military training grounds (where there is live ammunition) are open to the public, anyone can drive or circulate freely. There are no guards or fences. <br /> <br /> The action is however prevented by the good captain who launches a rocket in the car of the Italians. The blast kills the killers and the enraged fianc√©e. Nobody in a distance of 40 feet is hurt when the car is crumbling to pieces. It's a COMEDY, do not forget. <br /> <br /> Okay. It's a comedy, I have it, and I can live with it. No realism needed. Filmmakers can easily get there if it's hilarious, fun, fun, fun, challenging. Unfortunately, it is not so. It's just embarrassing. A scam of American comedies without brains. These are at least professionally done without any amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It's pretty boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially for those who spend the whole movie as I unfortunately did. Yawning.
