the costumes, the dialogue, the historical precision are terrible. For example, Stacey Dash and the suspended scene. The noose was accurate (as far as I know), but this type of knot broke the person's neck. Mrs. Dash is left hanging at the end of the rope without any harmful effect until the rope is pulled. This type of step does not stifle the person, he kills it at the end of the drop. <br /> <br /> And just before robbing a bank (in a flashback), they stop in the street for a group embrace - with their headbands concealing their faces - this would have been obvious to the people of the street. <br /> <br /> The poor editing - it's a battery under this shirt and it is obvious that the clip of the "long journey" shows them along the path, then reverses the film. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that they keep the scene with the horse taking a shit - it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was shit.
