When I was a kid in the '50s and' 60s, everything related to Disney was by definition great. What happened? They can get all the actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. But despite everything, Disney manages to ruin everything despite its abundant resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but still ... they screw up! This film is shit. What's sad is that I suspect Disney in their arrogance of not knowing when a movie is good or bad. <br /> <br /> It's only because of the talent of the actors that I can even give him a 3 ten.
