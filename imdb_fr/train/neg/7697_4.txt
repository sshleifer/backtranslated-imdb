This mini-series is actually more entertaining than some others with bigger budgets and bigger aspirations. SOTD is somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" in the entertainment spectrum. If it was not so long (almost 3 hours), I think the kids would like it a lot. There is adventure, action, "cliffhanger scenes" and not too much romance or other "disgusting" stuff. When you're young, you're not too critical of rubber swords, role playing and repeating scenes. (At least two scenes are repeated identically in the film, as it was done in old-fashioned series to bring the audience to speed.) Finally, children generally accept the dialogue in American English that comes out better. from Asian's mouth. actors. (Not to mention the fact that many of the main roles are played by non-Asian actors.) <br /> <br /> I was going to give this film three stars, but I felt like the director, the producers and the actors . deserved additional credit for at least completing the project. This film is not art, but like painting your home, it took time, effort and discipline to do it. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not a recommended use for your time, but it might keep the kids having fun while traveling in the minivan. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes ... hey, IMDb! "Dialogue" is the favorite and traditional spelling. Your spell check seems to think that "dialogue" is the proper spelling. The "dialogue" is acceptable, but Webster and OED consider it an alternative form.
