The idea of ​​making a mini-series on the Berlin airlift seemed to me to be one of the most interesting German films. It's a theme that has not been explored much yet. However, the manufacturers of this series have it filled with clichés. It already starts with the DVD cover of the film, which is a direct copy of the cover of 'Pearl Harbor'. <br /> <br /> Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) learns that her husband, a doctor (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and after the war, she fights for her survival. She finds a job at the American base, gets to work for the coolest and most senior officer (Heino Ferch) in town, falls in love with me, gets pregnant and suddenly, her husband comes back. Come on !!! We have seen this once too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their role very well; Bettina Zimmermann never seems to really convince. For some reason, it still seems like she's a little too late to give the right emotional reaction to the scenes. It just did not work for me. <br /> <br /> The action scenes with planes and the air lift, we are sometimes exciting, most of the time not. It seems that unpleasant things always seem to happen to the same driver. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big fan of World War II films, I suggest you spend your money on something else: a chocolate ice cream brings a lot more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
