One evening, I was waiting for my friends to come back to the apartment and "Gymkata" happened to be on; I watched too much. It's really hilarious and horrible, really. Think of it this way: if in your work you had an idea of ​​something so serious and you were executing it in such a terrible way, how long would you last exactly? Not as long as this movie. It's a must, obviously.
