This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics. The scenario is ridiculous, the acting is excessive and it looks corny. The only reasons to watch this drama are the wonderful songs performed by Mangeshkar and the call of the curtain of the legendary Meena Kumari. Watching the actress, who was ill during filming and was drinking at the age of 40 shortly after the movie was released, has the same fascination as watching a train wreck. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, has written and directed, but does not have the skill to properly perform either task. Bollywood produced much better films.
