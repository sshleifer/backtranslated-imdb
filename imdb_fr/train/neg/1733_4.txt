SAPS AT SEA <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and white) <br /> <br /> > Suffering from "hornophobia", Ollie embarks on a "relaxing" boat trip, but Stan and he are involved with an escaped convict (Rychard Cramer). The chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> This feature-length comedy - a decent entry that unfolds as a mere imitation of the best work of Laurel and Hardy - marked the latest collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach. Episodic in structure, the film ends with an unforgettable journey in the ocean after the Boys are taken hostage by the evil Cramer (who kills a seagull to prove how hard he is!). The gags are acceptable, but inspiration is lacking, perhaps because of the recruitment of actor turned director Gordon Douglas, previously responsible for Ollie's first solo record at the time of sound (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but whose work lacks measure of pzazz. Just, but nothing special. Charlie Hall and James Finlayson, L & H regulars, make appearances.
