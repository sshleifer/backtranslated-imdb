There is no reason to see this movie. A good idea of ​​terrain is very poorly managed. In the middle of the film, everything changes and from there, nothing makes more sense. The reason for the assassinations is not clear. The game is terrible. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. He was excellent in the bedroom, but here he is terrible. Amber Benson Buffy must change character one day. Even those of you who love free sex and violence will be disappointed. Even though the movie lasts 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for this one), the DVD does not contain any deleted scenes, which means that they never care to fill in the parts missing characters. /> <br /> Do not spend time on this one.
