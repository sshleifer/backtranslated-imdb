Unless you are mentally ill or you are the most segal fan, you'll get tired of this horrible excuse for a movie in less than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot - Even for a Seagal movie, the plot is just stupid. I mean it's not just bad, it's barely consistent. <br /> <br /> The role - Incredibly wooden. Literally seen playing better in porn. Ironically, this film tries to take advantage of this audience, a "lesbian love scene" worthy of mournful grimaces. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - would not look great in a sixties sword and sorcery movie. <br /> <br /> Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other remedies, do not make the same mistake as me and buy this DVD, because you will ask this hour and a half of your life .
