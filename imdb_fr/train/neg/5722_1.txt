I would first like to apologize for my bad english. <br /> <br /> I'm not a HOSTEL-hardcore fan, but I still liked this movie. Live Feed, however, SUCKED BIG TIME! I have never seen a movie gore with a superb acting, but hey, who is surprised? The role in Live Feed was ... well, not here! I saw some comments because it had to be a school project or something. Okey, but not by media students or drama school. It was not classy at all! And what of the story? A really sad scam at the hostel. And what about gore? What about psychopathic torture scenes that are supposed to twist your guts and let you sweat? It was the most disappointing of the hole movie! Short, fast and without benefit. Rather as an execution than as a torture. Okey, there were buckets of blood, but it did not look real. The massacres and violence were more reminiscent of Braindead than the inn or one of the Saw movies. And Braindead was fun! Okey, I made fun of Live Feed a few times, but it was more disappointment than pleasure! <br /> <br /> So, instead of losing 80 minutes while watching Live Feed, look for ANYthing else!
