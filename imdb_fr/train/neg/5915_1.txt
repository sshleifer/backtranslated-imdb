I have seen a lot of movies from China and Hong Kong. It's the worst. No, the worst was 'Unknown Pleasures'. I watched 'Platform' last night and thought that Jia Zhang Ke's other two films needed to be better. Tonight I was disappointed again. I will not be watching 'Xiao Wu' tomorrow night because I just put the three films in the trash! Anyone who has given this film, "Platform" ten times out of ten, must watch more cinema! The photography was very mediocre: it was very difficult to differentiate some characters because of the lack of close-up work. The scenario was so disjointed that I quickly advanced towards the end, out of sheer frustration. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage any day. They are true masters of Chinese cinema, not pretentious crooks!
