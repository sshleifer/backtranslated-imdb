A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and mutates into the evil twin of Frosty the Snowman. Then starts a slaughter. Interesting plot It's scary. And it's scary. If you are five years old. Otherwise, it's a little tacky. I saw it on the cable and I'm glad I did not pay money to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget movie that can become a cult movie. I'm sure his fans are loyal somewhere. I'm just not in it. Although I do not like the film as a whole, there are scenes that I find funny. Like the scene of the bathtub and the post-explosion scene with reference Picasso. It was also nice to see the many ways the heroes are trying to kill Jack and he just does not seem to want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good budget comedy, but a low-budget horror.
