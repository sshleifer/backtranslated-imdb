I entered the theater with the intention of spending about 90 minutes pleasant to be entertained if not to be enlightened. I did not leave any entertaining or enlightened. This film does not know what it wants to be and ends up not being much. There are some fun lines and some incredibly pretentious movie references (The 400 Blows - for this character? Get out!). Although none of the characters are treated with much respect, the more than thirty gay men have the worst: all predators, fat, sad, lazy. If you're in the mood for a homosexual movie, check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. You will thank me. <br /> <br />
