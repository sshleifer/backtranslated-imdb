Let me say by saying that I followed watching this video watching Saw and after Bleed, Saw seemed to be the biggest horror movie of all time, although I thought it was only good enough. Bleeding is bad enough. The best part is to see the naked female cast. The gore is very wrong and too finished. It has fun but extremely predictable parts and I did not want to stay to see the horrible end. If I could, I would ban those actors and actresses, the only reason being that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) made more than a hundred videos and I also saw two other members of the cast in similar or worse films . They should not be allowed to continue this madness.
