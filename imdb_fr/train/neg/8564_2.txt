The film itself is so pathetic. He described the deaf as cynical about people. Admittedly, some deaf people are reluctant to attend listeners, but they are not necessarily angry, as was the case with Marlee Matlin. Deaf people do not go to the bar and do not dance like Matlin. Overall, the movie itself is more boring than pathetic. It's so boring that I'd like to think it's a cure for insomnia. If I have trouble sleeping, I can just go see Children of a Little God and watch. It will fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, it's a deaf guy talking.
