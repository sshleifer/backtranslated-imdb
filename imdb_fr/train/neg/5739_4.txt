A small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a lone avenger and a group of spiked survivors. <br /> <br /> Published in 1993, "Darkness" sparked some worship after his release. It's easy to see why - it's loaded (and I mean panicked) gore, and it's energy and excitement, like those found in other horror movies without budget like "The Dead Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback", is actually rather contagious. <br /> <br /> Although this may be true, it is unfortunately not enough to save him. The film was shot on a Super 8, the image is so grainy and dark, which makes things very difficult to see (it was great if it had hidden the terrible mule protagonists). Keyboard and Death Metal even more annoying (seriously, what's up with these horror movies without budget and the bad Death Metal?) Even if we do not expect performances worthy of a Oscar, the actor is always strictly amateur, because the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of being scared or threatened. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure fans of gorefests without budget will love this. However, everyone will want a little more meat on the coast.
