Welcome to a story of bad ghosts and someone's nightmare. This horror story finds a newly married husband (John Hudson) and his wife (Peggy Weber) haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found in their empty home and their lily pad. Is the husband really trying to make his fiancee already anxious? Or is the gardener with learning difficulties Mickey (Alex Nicol) who has been in charge of the manor's grounds since the death of his original mistress? This low-budget horror movie has a story that keeps you involved throughout the finale. The special effects are very bad even to the norms of 1958. I sometimes swear that the screaming skull looks a lot like it should be in a Godzilla movie. Comedian Russ Conway is also here. About ... the hiding gardener (Nicol) is the director of the film. You can see this as part of the AMC Monsterfest.
