Virgin is chosen to marry a rich man. The rich guy is urinating. Woman on boat loves sailor. Sailor urine. Virgin attends a rude common dinner. The man urinates at the table. Boatwoman does a striptease for little boys. The man claiming to be baby's urine. There is an underlying theme here. Makavejev is trying to say that he is trapped in the world. To say that this is a weird film is a euphemism. To justify the title, there is a scene where Laure, who speaks barely ten lines of the entire film, bathes in chocolate syrup. It's a sweet scene, but the rest of the film leaves a bad taste in the mouth unless we share the director's fetishes.
