Take: <br /> <br /> 1. a famous piece <br /> <br /> 2. a director with his own ideas that use <br /> <br /> 3. a copy of the set design a popular theatrical production of the play mentioned in point 1. <br /> <br /> 4. an actor for the main role - who has no idea of ​​the role he plays And you will get: "Hamlet, Prinz von Denemark "<br /> <br /> I listened to the radio play" Hamlet "with Maximilian Schell in Hamlet and I was very disappointed. I was hoping that the filmed version would be better, that Schell would at least have body language to emphasize what he was saying - nothing. Then the decor ... the minimalist design is not everyone's taste, but I like it when there is enough scene to set the scene and nothing more. Alas, it's on a stage, in a theater. It will not work in a piece-based movie with credible parameters. That the idea of ​​the scenery is copied from the theatrical production in which Schell was already playing the Hamlet ... let's say if it was the only thing for which to complain ... I wonder how Schell could get the role of Hamlet n ' anywhere in the first place and how everyone could allow him to play Hamlet a second time. If you have the choice to watch one of the sixty or so Hamlet-based movies, do not watch this one, unless you're masochistic, or really hardcore, or make fun of talented comedians.
