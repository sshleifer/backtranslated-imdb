It's interesting to see what Pierce Brosnan's career was like before Bond's arrival. In this thriller "tense", Pierce Brosnan plays the nice Patrick, who directs "children of ghetto" in "courses of confidence". He meets a woman who has a child named Eric in the mid-90s. The woman's drunken ex-husband soon arrives at the scene and starts messing around with Pierce. <br /> <br /> At one point, Pierce innocently produces "vegeburgers". The husband enters. Pierce starts making vegeburgers again. The husband then attacks Pierce. Small pieces of half-eaten vegeburger calls fall from Pierce's mouth. The fight ends abruptly without showing the result. That's what the movie gets. <br /> <br />
