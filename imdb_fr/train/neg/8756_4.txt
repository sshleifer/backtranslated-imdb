Russell Hopton played in many movies until his death in 1945. He made only 2 films and "Black Gold" was one (the other in 1936). Frankie Darro had a sometimes abrasive screen presence, but in that role he was playing well. He was obviously very popular on the "quickie" circuit - he made a lot of movies. In it, he embodies the son of an old oil rigger convinced that oil will soon be put to the table. Anderson (Berton Churchill) tries to convince the old man to sell, because he knows that the oil will arrive at any time. A geologist, Henry, arrives at the scene and helps the father of "Fishtail". He also convinces "Fishtail" to go to school regularly. Henry is watching Cynthia, the pretty teacher. It was the last film of Gloria Shea. She began her career in Olive Glea in "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). The father of "Fishtail" is killed when the platform is sabotaged and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his friends to justice. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson tries to persuade "Fishtail" to sell his oil lease. Everything ends well with oil hit and "fishtail" going to military school. <br /> <br /> It's good for a rainy day.
