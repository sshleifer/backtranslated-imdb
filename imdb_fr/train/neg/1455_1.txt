I have rarely been subjected to such absurdity in a film supposedly based on a historical figure. A horrible joke of a movie, I collapsed. Terrible, banal, deformed and strewn with true lies and half-truths. <br /> <br /> The famous Hitlerian biographer Ian Kershaw was originally to be a consultant for this film. However, he found the scenario so historically imprecise and ridiculous that he refused, and also demanded that they stop using his name as a source (it embarrassed him to think that people would think he was involved) . <br /> <br /> A scene shows Hitler beating his dog. There is not a source for that. Hitler loved animals more than men. It has introduced the most stringent animal protection laws in Europe, prohibits vivisection and animal testing. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film transforms his conquest of the Iron Cross into a joke, involving corruption. Lies. He has been rewarded for repeated acts of bravery over a long period. <br /> <br /> There is no historical record showing that Hitler has ever had sex with his niece. Not one. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, Hitler is portrayed as a mere fool in this garbage film. <br /> <br /> If he was even half as ignorant, demented and so thick that it was this absurd movie as in real life, you would not even know it ever existed. No matter, become the leader of Germany. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie was terribly horrible. <br /> <br /> Go to Downfall and give it a very big opening.
