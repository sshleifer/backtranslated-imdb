Drew Barrymore is an actress who has gone through bad times, not only in her career, but also in her personal life. After being a child prodigy, she fell into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality. Although she has recovered from this dark past, this film is a reminder of the worst days of Drew Barrymore. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an interesting premise, reminiscent of Brian De Palma's "Raising Cain"; with a plot dealing with the multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a thriller / horror. Barrymore plays the role of Holly Gooding, a young woman trying to rebuild her life in California after a traumatic event in her past in which her other personality apparently killed her mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, her past comes back to Haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life, ready to ruin her new found peace and newfound love. In the midst of chaos, her new boyfriend, Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), will try to help Holly deal with the demons of her past. <br /> <br /> Contrary to De Palma's underrated thriller, "Doppelganger" is for Most of the time, a mediocre film never fulfills its purpose, but also ends with one of the worst episodes of the history of cinema. Although Barrymore is definitely not at its best, she manages to keep her dignity with above-average performance. The rest of the cast varies, however, from mediocre to terribly bad performances, though Leslie Hope is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The scenario is full of clich√©s and the influence of De Palma is quite obvious. While the film tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line, the dialogues are dull and the wooden game is certainly not used for anything. It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons, and excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> The effects of makeup are made by the talented KNB and are really one of the few good things in the film. However, the bizarre overuse of effects in the totally out of context end reduces the impact of KNB's work and makes what is ridiculous in a different film that would be amazing. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is a film is not an excuse for its low quality, because with a better and more consistent scenario, it could have been an interesting film. Unfortunately, all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second. Worthy of the beauty of Barrymore. 3/10
