"The Crush" is a romantic movie that is quite pleasant for about 40 friends, for about the first two-thirds, as he tries to be a British "Sex and the City". <br /> <br /> I particularly appreciated the flipping of the trophy, a young man whose character is not very rich (to think about it, we did not see too much his physical skin and Kenny Doughty is interesting to see more). <br /> <br /> They certainly do much more business with a young man / an older woman than it was the opposite in the version of "Sabrina" (no movie I like) or elsewhere with the Douglas / Zeta-Jones or the Dion / Svengali wedding. <br /> <br /> Surrounded by Andie MacDowell, there are also familiar dramas and British comedies, such as Anna Chancellor, the language of madness. <br /> <br /> The plot turns in the end, very sensational. But it was only when the credits arrived at the end that I realized what could really be wrong. Just like in "Sex and the City", the writer / director is a man, here the first comer, Scot John McKay, and I think he really wanted to write a screenplay about three homosexuals, probably about their relationship with their lovers. and at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting film. The working title of the film was "The Sad F * cker's Club", which would have made it even more obvious with the gay club "Broken Hearts Club". <br /> <br /> (originally written on 4/6/2002)
