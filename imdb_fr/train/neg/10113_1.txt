I discovered that this film is rented according to the packaging. the zombie in the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you come to the movie and they are women with raccoon masks. zero special effect ... and even fight scenes you can see them miss 2-foot punches. What's funny is that Lommel plays briefly in the movie himself and that he's worse than the rest of the movie's shitty actors. The only thing I can think of is that Lommel is just trying to make a film as bad as people call it a "cult classic" ... However, I can not imagine anyone thinking it's one of the worst movies ever made. the real horror in this movie is how bad it is. I'm embarrassed to have rented it and swear never to see another Lommel movie!
