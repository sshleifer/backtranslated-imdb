A number of wives are mysteriously murdered while on the altar, and their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue. The newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious murders. She discovers that before each ceremony, the bride had received a rare orchid (supposedly of the groom) containing a powerful drug that had succumbed to them. Patricia is told that the orchid was first cultivated by Dr. Lorenz, who lives in an isolated area, with his wife. In reality, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, putting the wives in suspension and using their glandular fluid to keep his wife forever young. Patricia, with Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife), tries to force Dr. Lorenz's hand by organizing a bogus wedding, which eventually leads Patricia into the mad doctor's arms. This film had a very good opening, but ended up with too many shots and weak scenes. The distribution is correct, Walters and Coffin deserved better, but that's life. Countess Lorenz plays the role of Russell, who steals the show (even if it hurts Lugosi- who does not give one of his most memorable performances) playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many prima donna Hollywood today. Low and artificial end too. Ranking, based on B films, 4.
