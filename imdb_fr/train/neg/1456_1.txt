In simple terms, it is a simplistic and one-dimensional film. The title, The Rise to Evil, should tell you that it's not going to be deep or doing much with Hitler. From the first minutes of the film where we see the baby Hitler look diabolical with a devilish music playing scenery, we have a view of Hitler who presents his as a supervillian cartoony, apparently ripped to the right of a Saturday morning TV show . The film REALLY wants to argue that Hitler was diabolical, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil? In the end, to make him a character as perverse as monumental is both boring and confusing (one has to wonder how the inept psychic character of the film allows to ever persuade a nation to follow him or to be named the man of the year by Time). This film had a great opportunity to take a character who committed some of the most horrible acts of the 20th century and try to dive into his mind. Instead, he simply says, "Hey, Hitler was diabolical, I just thought you'd like to know ..." again and again. The great irony is that the film was again attacked for presenting a too sympathetic view of the character. Leave me alone.
