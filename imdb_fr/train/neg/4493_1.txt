I tried to delete everything that could be considered a spoiler. I also suppose that you have seen the first movie or at least know the basics, if it makes no sense, it makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Summary: This film beats the public over the years. head with philosophical speeches tired again and again in an attempt to pass the theme. We are bombarded again and again by questions of purpose, destiny and choice, and forced to endure the long and painful platitude sessions that contain them. <br /> <br /> Neo, out of the dream of the last film, now begins a period of realization of his own existence. There are many revelations in this film, about which I will remain vague, so that they do not look like mess. <br /> <br /> * If you are still worried about vague references to the film, do not do it. t read the paragraph below. * <br /> <br /> The strength and weakness of faith are revealed. The strengths and weaknesses of love and its temporary nature are also revealed. The interdependence of humans and technology, as well as our trust in technology are also revealed. The importance of choice and experience is revealed. Explaining more things revealed would go into too much detail, so I will abstain (as requested by the instructions for writing a comment). Btw, by "revealed", I mean hammered through our ears and our eyes like nails. <br /> <br /> Scenario: So, how do Neo and the gang go from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next? In short, they keep the faith and use and abuse action and balls too stylized, as if they were in fashion (and after this display, I hope that moviegoers and filmmakers will learn to appreciate a little subtlety and originality more). More on that later. In order not to spoil anything, I'll say nothing more than the promotional material has already done: Neo is still trying to understand Matrix, and he's looking for answers while trying to save humans, and Zion, while villains are chasing him. and his cohorts. The film picks up pretty much where the last one stopped. <br /> <br /> Action: While the martial arts, the action and the shooting were playing in pieces on par with its predecessor, the film focuses much more on the martial arts than cannon shooting, know, etc. . in the mix. The special effects are so often used and waved in the public's face that it gets really boring. I have discussed this film with friends and co-workers, and almost all have found some action sequences - especially the "Smith fight" we all heard in the movie - too long and tedious. It's a huge red flag for action fans, because the end of an action sequence should leave you wanting a little more, or being totally satisfied with the awesomeness that just happened. <br /> <br /> These fight scenes do not do either. . These are sequences too stylized, beautiful, wooden and uninspired. In the first film, there was a real sense of desperation in the action, a feeling that fighting was for survival, not just beautiful (which I honestly do not think they do in Reloaded) in black and white. leather. Check out Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie to remind you of the good fight sequences. You will not regret it. In addition, the "matrix capabilities" available to users in Reloaded are not consistent and their tasks are not in reality. The first movie had its inconsistencies here, but they were not too glaring - unlike Reloaded. <br /> <br /> Special effects are brought over and over again. Something anyone does, be it a jump, a somersault, a spin, and in many cases, just ask, is <br /> <br /> slow, timed or overemphasized by some sort of destruction. It is obvious that the W Bros had a lot of money to spend on this film, and they did so without any real restraint. Sharp editors could have really helped that, but the first film was so successful that the free reign was given, which brings us to. . . <br /> <br /> Character and dialogue: I have already said more or less that the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes. Actors can not really bring much depth to their characters when the storyline and direction move the face of the character's progress, or completely neglect it. The audience has at no time a nuance and a substance allowing him to contemplate himself the character. <br /> <br /> Keanu's performance is at best stiff. Keanu is good at confusing games, and that's about all he does in this movie. He makes a decent effort to show the passion between Neo and Trinity, but it falls flat. <br /> <br /> Lawrence is trying to do everything for Morpheus, from Moses to Henry V, and be as cool as a cat. With the scenario that is provided to him, he makes a noble attempt, but he also falls flat. <br /> <br /> Moss is not very credible either. His worried look is still the same, a little like Keanu's, and chemistry is not present, although they falsify quite well in their very physical scenes. <br /> <br /> Hugo has again brought his strange sense of being. an agent program, but he also suffered from the hand of the script. In fact, I really find him the most interesting character of the group, but instead of developing it, they give him an excuse for a huge fight scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is more than disappointing. if you had good expectations and alone, as an independent film (which is not supposed to be taken), it's always horrible. I do not see The Matrix as deep, but at least I see it as a scifibot pleasure that contains interesting ideas, good action, some amusing lines, and enough symbolism and illusions to entertain those who are attentive . Reloaded has failed in all these respects, and I really hope that W Bros will give us a better experience in the third installment. Certainly, I do not have much hope for that after this film.
