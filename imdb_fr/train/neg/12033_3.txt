Movie on a small town with an equal number of Mormons and Baptists. A new family settles in, announcing the crushed dialogue, the mediocre acting, the green jello salad with grated carrots and all the other "Mormon jokes" known to man. Anyone outside the Mormon culture will have trouble digesting this movie. Anyone belonging to the Mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there. You'll be better off watching other Hess movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) rather than trying to miss out on it. The acting is mediocre. Jared Hess has gotten a lot of quality films like "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite". I recommend both movies on this groaner.
