It is possible that a man named Sledge suffered irreparable damage to the floor of the cutting room. Someone might ask for a director position someday, but I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to take advantage of the western spaghetti market and brought a large number of Americans to fill the cast. outside. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow who wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> Garner is still considered an idiot because he is very good at the game. But he was serious and played well in movies like The Children's Hour and The Gun Hour . He can and has broken with his usual stereotypes. But a man called Sledge can not be considered one of his successes. <br /> <br /> He has the lead role in the role of Luther Sledge, a notorious outlaw, with his head bogged down. After his partner, Tony Young, is killed in a living room and Garner takes appropriate action in the manner of Eastwood, he is followed in the living room by John Marley. <br /> <br /> Marley spent time in the nearby Territorial Prison and it seems that gold shipments are locked up on a rest stop for people carrying the gear on a regular race. Garner gathers his gang for a robbery. <br /> <br /> This is where the movie goes completely by the wall. Usually, filming films show the protagonists who embark on a methodical planning. This was certainly the case in The War Wagon, cited by another critic. But in this one, Garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of the fake US Marshal Dennis Weaver and provoke a jailbreak in which the gold will be stolen. <br /> <br /> It was too hard to swallow. If winning gold was so easy, it should have been done long ago. But I will say for those who love the blood and guts of Italian westerns, during this break in prison, there is enough for three films. <br /> <br /> That's not all, but the outlaws stand out and we have another bloody party before the end of the movie. But at that moment, the whole movie lost a lot of coherence. <br /> <br /> The great singer of the 30s, Allan Jones, is mentioned in the credits. But for my life, I do not find it in the movie. Maybe a choir of Donkey Serenade could have improved the situation. <br /> <br /> It could not have hurt anyone.
