I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but judging by this writing and directing effort, he should keep his day job as a fellow actor. Like many others here, I do not know how to classify this movie, it was not scary or phantasmagoric, so we can not call it a horror, the plot was so thin that it could not be a drama, There was no suspense so it should not be a thriller, it's just a bad movie you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair witch project. People who liked this movie used words like "ambiguity" and complex and subtle, but they read something that was not there. Like witch Blair, people were scared because people assumed they should be scared and let it be said that it was terrifying. This film actually started well with the family "meeting" the locals after hitting a deer. It sounded like a modern day rescue, but for 45 minutes, (well over half of the movie), nothing happened, the family potted their vacation home which was very beautiful and dandy, but not the least entertaining. It was obvious that the locals would be involved in one way or another at some point, but Essendon clearly has no idea how to create suspense in a movie. Finally, when something happens, you do not even know how the father was shot, how he died (the nurse said that his liver was only grazed), and all the time, that wendigo spirit is apparently stalking. the apparent shooter in a very awkward manner. with special effects of 3rd year. The film is called Wendigo, but nothing is done to explain it clearly, the film ends confused and leaves you very dissatisfied, I would have taken 15 minutes to run, but I wanted to see if this film could be redeem. . It does not have.
