I do not know what this other guy was thinking. The fact that this film was made independently does not make it less terrible. You can be as big a believer as you want ... the majority of this film is unscrupulous. I feel that I have been insulted to have to watch the first 40 minutes. And this is not a small feat. Not only the acting is terrible, but the plot has never been developed. There are innumerable holes in history, to the point that you can not even call it a story. I have never read the book, so I can not criticize it, but this is the first review I've written here and its only goal is to save all viewers an hour and a half from your life. I do not remember the last time I could not even finish watching a movie. This one really takes the cake.
