It's the worst documentary ever released in Canada !!!! I'm glad to see that the guys did not make another movie. All they want is to make a movie and it's not necessarily the one they wrote. They keep changing the script to fit the person they are throwing. I could not get out of the theater fast enough when I saw him at the Toronto Film Festival that year. Please never see this movie.
