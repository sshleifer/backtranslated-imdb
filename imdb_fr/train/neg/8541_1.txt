Welcome to movie 17 on the pack of 50 Chilling Classics. Where we will see, it's true. Another film that makes no sense. Seriously, this movie had confused me so much in the end, I thought I was seeing "At dawn, they sleep." The plot seems pretty simple ... well up to 3 seconds in the movie where a girl would have killed a cat and then ... uh ... explodes? I have no idea what happened. and that was BEFORE THE TITLE SCREEN. It's really sad when I can not even say what happened in the first 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, she stars a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after throwing her other girlfriend about to take pictures. of something somewhere. so we get there but not before someone steals his jeep to drive it 200 feet down the road to a city. mistrustful? nah. so they decide to stay in this abandoned village with an old lady. and then blah blah happens and blah blah speaks. The guy with the mustache comes out in the fog for some reason even if the old lady tells him not to do it. He gets lost and then finds his way back. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention that it's all after 20 incredibly useless minutes that stayed in the house of a guy who looks like this guy with buggy eyes. Casablanca. Then they leave. There is really no interest in this scene. It's really just padding. if you cut it off, nobody would have noticed it or cared about it. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, it was actually the best part of the movie. expect. let me rephrase that. REALLY sadly it was the best part of the movie. because the rest is so confusing that I had to watch IMDb to see what happened. But of course, no one else knows, so I'm SOL. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the last 30 minutes of the movie were the wildest moments of the spirit I've ever seen in a movie. They dressed her in a dress, he was kidnapped, then released, he went home, then in the end, the witches are in the house and it ends? seriously. I've almost never been so confused in a movie. I mean, as bad as movies like "War of the Robots" are, at least they make sense. this film does not even make the temptation to be coherent. the end was as confusing as the end of "At dawn, they sleep" and the plot was much more boring. This movie gets a 1 just for the pure "I have no idea what happened in this movie". "Witch Mountain" receives 1 out of 10 confused movie viewer.
