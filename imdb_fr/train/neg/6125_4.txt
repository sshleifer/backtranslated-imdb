This is the best film the Derek couple has ever made and if you think it's a recommendation, you have not seen any other. There are the usual ingredients: it's just as badly played as their other efforts, we can see Bo undressing or auditioning for wet t-shirt competitions quite often, the story is just ridiculously silly and the movie is taking much too seriously. And then: Orangutans in Africa? <br /> <br /> But there are a few things to do. Bo looks great, the production values ​​(sets, costumes, etc.) are pretty good, which greatly improves the value of his camp. Strangely enough, it's actually quite funny, just because it's trying to be serious and fails so badly.
