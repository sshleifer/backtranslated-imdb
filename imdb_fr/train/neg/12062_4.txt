When we talk about great director / actor combinations, we do not usually talk about J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson. Probably because the production of nine joint ventures between the two covers the gamut from very good action entertainment to mediocre. Unfortunately, Kinjite: Prohibited Topics falls in the latter case. <br /> <br /> It's sad, because Kinjite could have been much better. But for my life, I do not understand why it was necessary to convince the father of the missing Japanese girl to get cheap jollies, because the love relationship in her marriage is exhausted. It might have been good for another movie, but it was useless here. <br /> <br /> Dramatic policeman, Charles Bronson is a Vice-cop who has seen too much in his work and who has strong prejudices against the Orientals. This part could also have used a little explanation. But he will have to overcome it if he and his patient partner Perry Lopez locate a captured Japanese schoolgirl. <br /> <br /> The time of Bronson in the Vice Presidents' Brigade told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. An elegant and murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some story. In fact, in the best scene of the film, Bronson made him eat a Rolex luxury watch and set his car on fire. <br /> <br /> At one point, Fernandez spotted Bronson and Lopez in a deli all night. his Rolex snack, he sprays the place with an Uzi that kills everyone except Bronson and Lopez. I really think this little incident would have had more than a couple of LAPD policemen after Fernandez. But that's another terribly huge hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> There is still a very difficult justice in the end for Fernandez. I wish the whole movie was better though. It was the last film of the Bronson-Thompson team and the last as director of J. Lee Thompson. He should have gone out with something better.
