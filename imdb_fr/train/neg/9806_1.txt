I can not explain my life in what is the popularity of the children's television show, Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> I never understood why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place, since the characters seem so stupid and not worth worrying about anything. <br /> <br /> The costumes look completely atrocious, like multicolored spandex that people wear to go to the gym. <br /> What exactly is the purpose of this show anyway, but for kids to learn to fight to solve their problems? What's going on with the abominable haircuts and clothes in this series anyway? Not to mention that this program continues to play on cable television, just to make money to teach children to fight each other when they do not agree on a given problem. <br /> <br /> There is much better entertainment for today's kids. are not as credulous as the children of the 1990s who watched this show. <br /> <br /> Oh, and what happens with homo erotic tension between the red and green ranger?
