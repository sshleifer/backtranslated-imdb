The film starts slowly when we arrived at the cinema, we thought it was pretty good but after about 5 minutes, we were all bored and we wonder what kind of film we came to see, I do not like this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. The best part of the night was when the alarm and the lights came back on, because the project failed because we thought we could all go home. it must be one of the worst movies we've ever seen. We were all bored with the spirit and most of the movie people were going RAN in the end because it was so bad. I'm surprised no one came out earlier than that. if you are going to see it, make sure you find a solution to keep you busy, better yet do not go see it at all.
