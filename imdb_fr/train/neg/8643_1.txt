A Blair Witch-War movie as disappointing as Bwitch! The title says it all, save your money and your time and use it for a good movie like "Once upon a time in America", "The Shawshank Redemption" or "Enemy at the Gates" (if you want to watch a movie "war "movie) etc. <br /> <br /> This film, if it was a baseball team and the major leagues were the pinnacle and Single A was the rookies, this film was then High School Ball. It was filmed as if it were a high school theater club filming with their daddy's old camera. Of course, they went to a hostile area (to make a movie) but I do not call it brave, here we say it's stupid! This is a pass all the way! Now, look at him and tell me what you think.
