About the time they released this movie on DVD. I know that some say that WB throws the release of this movie because of the movie The Dreamgirls. But, how can you rush the release of a movie that is in your catalog since 1976. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the release of this film on DVD, no particularity, no sound 5.1 DD. Come on WB, you can do a lot better than that. The audio and image quality of this film requires serious help. <br /> <br /> Apparently, WB did not spend so much time and attention on this film because it is a black film and my sales are correct. They could have kept the CD which, by the way, does not contain all the songs of the original CD. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this DVD for purchase? Yes, because it's a classic movie. But WB needs to add some extra features. Take notes from other films in the band, The Five Heatbeats or The Temptation, where you can see only the performance, and the sound of both is much better than this DVD.
