I did not expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternative choice when two other films were sold. Yet, I kept hope. It looked a bit like "Bride and Prejudice" (L.A. guy cracks for Indian beauty, parent conflict, blah blah blah). B & P was not perfect, but it was a nice movie, with good laughs and nice characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood Bride" had none of that. The acting game seemed about to become a number. The characters were so clich√©d that the story seemed to have been written by a first-year theater student. Technically, the sound really bothered me. There seemed to be a lot of dialogue dubbing. I mean a lot. I know sometimes it's necessary, but it looked like half the film had been shot in a closet and it was getting very distracting. <br /> <br /> Two stars, it's a little generous.
