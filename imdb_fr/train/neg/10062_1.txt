Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ @ ERS !!! How can you do this to me? I can not believe it ... this movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see it at the theater with my brother because my mother forced me to follow ... oh my god ... where do I even start? The plot sucked. The acting voice SUCKED. SUCKED animation. The end really sucked. If you liked this movie, YOU SUGGEST TOO. And for Futuramafan1987, who said it was the greatest movie of all time, you are a tool, simple and simple. This film is not a film for anyone, but ten-year-old teens with Game Boys who think Pikachu is God. I'm still crying today thinking about this horrible movie dung ... and then there was Pikachu's Adventure ... do not even get me started on that awful mess of film. In truth, it's one of the most boring experiences of my life. Do not go look at it at all costs. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: get out, find every copy of this movie you can and burn it. Burn them all, then rent a good movie, like Aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even Back to the Future!
