Christopher Durang had to be taught by a memorable nun because he simply can not give up the concept. The play "Sister Mary Ignatius explains it all for you" has been featured - at least in Hollywood - in exactly the same tone as Diane Keaton's lecture scenes here. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a satire, a bitter satire of a serenely confident, doctrinaire and very critical nun - and played by Lynn Redgrave, she was hilarious. But the film insists that we take this exaggeration with the greatest seriousness - while maintaining the same tone in the scenes "explains everything". The two approaches clash with each other and in the last twenty minutes, the film leaves the track, plunges into the throat and explodes. There are no survivors. It could have worked if the tone of the scenes with the four former students and their meeting with Sister Mary had been identical to those of the sister scene Mary. Or if the scenes of Sister Mary have been presented in a more realistic way. This way just does not work at all.
