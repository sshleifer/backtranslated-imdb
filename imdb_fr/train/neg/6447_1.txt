I bought this movie for $ 5 in a bargain baskets at my local video store for just one reason, Chase Masterson, but I should have crumbled the five movies, thrown them in a toilet and shot the hunt. The film is about twenty seniors who culminated in high school and met for the anniversary of the death of their idiots, who got drunk and went astray in the woods and died. The problem is that a reptilian monster chases them one by one. The game of actors is abominable, these worthless people have apparently been rejected in shows such as 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The staging was tied with a twelve-year-old boy and the screenplay was probably made by a thirteen-year-old boy. The whole game looks like someone from the backyard in Malibu. The people here who rented this movie are obviously friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this pile of garbage at all costs.
