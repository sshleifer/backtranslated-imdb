Do not waste your time watching this! Unless you want to study all the bad things, you should not do a good movie. I'm not one to see a movie again, but this one is personal. I lost precious time that they can not give back. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste time looking at this shit. If it was a student project, I should say it was not bad, but only for the first 15 minutes. cries, bad audio, bad video (a good cameraman could have made it much better). and yes, with the Blair-Witch effect? no budget? I was hoping it would be better, but it is not. Now, how the hell did he get a 4? 2 is more right but 1 to waste my time! I said my peace.
