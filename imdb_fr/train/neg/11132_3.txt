A documentary filmmaker, like any filmmaker, has to tell a fascinating story. Will Pascoe fails completely in this effort, collecting uninspired excerpts from Chomsky's wisdom during a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The film is shot in amateur and video. Pascoe's only effort to bring the fragments together is to periodically cast a blank title on the screen: "9-11", "Activism", "Truth". <br /> <br /> Blade. <br /> <Compare this with documentaries such as "The Corporation" or "The Fog of War" that create narrative drawing material from interviews, archival footage and film footage. In the end, each delivers a poignant and insightful message with skill and intelligence. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of the film is the nonchalant swirls of Chomsky's historical dogma, as well as the fact that the film lasts only 74 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting passages is Chomsky's account of his experience with national public radio. He describes the conservative media as more accommodating to differing viewpoints, while NPR's liberal dogma embodies the interviewees and severely limits the authorized messages. Yet another media that remains skeptical. <br /> <br /> This documentary is dedicated to Noam Chomsky's complete artists.
