This movie is a rotten and forgotten Sean Connery vehicle. The performances are generally bad, especially those of Capshaw, Fishburne and Ed Harris. Connery seems to be misunderstanding as a Harvard scholar. The film gets worse and worse. It is a third-order mystery that becomes extremely artificial as it unravels. The film squanders an excellent distribution. George Plimpton also plays a minor role in adding some gravitas to Connery as they debate the death penalty. Violence and the atmosphere are a third-order mystery / thriller that is a manipulation in the highest degree. The script and the direction are extremely poor. Connery's charisma and on-screen presence are the only virtue of the film. Manipulative, violent and ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid it.
