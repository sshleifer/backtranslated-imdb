I was expecting something for the film because it had a nice cast of stars and it's the return of the duo composed of Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because it was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credits in the beginning, I felt good because the editing was enjoyable. Well, the very first scene itself struck me. Then, the major disadvantage of the film lies in the action sequences. My friends and I were laughing watching these rotten fights. It was like Akshay against thirty thugs and all thugs even received machine guns! Whew ... you have to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are. <br /> <br /> The other thing about the movie is the story is far too predictable. It reminded me of some movies of the early 80's. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth the movie is that of the sexy Kareena, who looked really hot in this one.And for this, I give 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please ... please ... do not see this one thinking that it's is a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch that to laugh a bit at the terrible fight scenes. <br /> <br /> That's all.
