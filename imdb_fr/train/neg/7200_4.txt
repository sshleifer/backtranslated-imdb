I really wanted to love this film - the shots were mostly shot in Pittsburgh and the trailer contained some great photographs. But even for a filmed cartoon, it was a really bad movie. The continuity and rhythm were simply horrible. The best elements of the film are under the end credits, so it is interesting (or almost) to stick to the end (although, curiously, it takes a little over the last half hour). /> When Andy Dick has the best performance in a movie, you know there must be a problem ...
