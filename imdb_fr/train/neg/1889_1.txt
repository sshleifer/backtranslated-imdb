This film is by no means an entertainment, but rather a look deep into the darkest aspect of human behavior. Linking vaguely half a dozen stories of the worst types of depravity, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All the action takes place during a few very hot and sticky days during a heat wave in Vienna and the heat is perhaps the source of the anger and hatred of the film. For me, the security vendor has treated the girl behind the worst episode, followed closely by scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the apartment "dairy". You will be seized and I hope horrified by this film. I hated him, but I felt obliged to see him through. 1/10 for 'fun' 8/10 to show 'man' as it is sometimes.
