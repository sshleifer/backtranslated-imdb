Dewaana as a film goes through the usual clich√©s. The man and the woman fall in love and get married, the husband is supposed to be killed by a family friend who wants their family fortune, the wife remarries and surprise surprise husband No. 1 reappears. The film is reminiscent of Yash Chopra's Chandni and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan perform well. Amrish Puri as a villain follows the moves and is nothing more than a standard villain of Bollywood. Nadeem Shravan's music is superb, all the songs were brilliant. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through the movements.
