Sometimes when you finish a movie, you want to get a refund for the time you just spent. It was one of those moments. I almost gave up with only 15 minutes to endure ... and I would like to have ... <br /> <br /> The pace at which a man goes from a straight and controlled life to a life devoid of any twist irresponsibility could never be so fast. <br /> <br /> From a graduation celebration to the predictable end of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a man of privilege and culture is seduced by a woman, by violence and by the spirit which changes substances. Of course, the woman part is understandable when we observe the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But it is impossible to frankly understand the problem of drugs, violence and devotion to a person he has just met. <br /> <br /> Frankly, in addition to being able to stare at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no quality that redeems. Save your money, save your time ... do something else ...
