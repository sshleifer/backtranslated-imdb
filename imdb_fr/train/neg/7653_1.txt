First of all, I would like to say that if I had to honestly evaluate this film from 1 to 10, I would give it a -4. It's not that I'm a hard critic, it's just that this movie is SO bad. Everything that goes from the story to the realization through editing is awful. The story is not even half decent at the beginning (we can not expect much because it is based on a video game, which I was not aware of), but the realization and editing the have further aggravated. The film cuts at difficult moments and moves to scenes that have nothing to do with the previous ones; Some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, do not even make sense to be inserted into the story, as the characters show no feelings towards each other. You could go into this movie hoping to see a pile of shit on the screen for an hour and a half and you'd always be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie, you are wasting your money and if you pay nothing, you lose another hour and a half of your life. So do yourself a favor and do not look at it.
