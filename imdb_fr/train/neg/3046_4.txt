I saw this film for the first time when I was about 10 years old. My mother bought it from Kmart because it was on sale at $ 5 on VHS. She thought it would be a good Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. This film, however, scared me terribly. You may be wondering how a movie about Santa could scare someone? The plot of the film revolves around Satan who sends one of his sbots, Pitch, to Earth to try to kill Santa Claus and ruin Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon from hell to kill Santa Claus. As the sun rises, Santa tries to trap him on the ground when the sun rises on Christmas day. If Santa Claus does not go home to space, he turns into powder. Do not get me wrong, the movie is funny and quite entertaining, however, the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which happens at the beginning of the movie) is simply scary.
