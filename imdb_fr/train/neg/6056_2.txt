To be honest, this film is part of a series of huge disappointments ... most of these so-called "horror masters" movies are only terrifying in terms of their mediocre effects and their ludicrous stories. .. apart from Ron Perlman, all the other actors in this movie can not do anything to save their lives ... the shots looked like someone playing Bop-it under the micro boom or something, and they seemed completely unrealistic ... all in all, this movie is as scary as Home Only ... the only good masters are Cigarette Burns, Jennifer and maybe Pelts ... I do not know how these filmmakers can sleep the night knowing that they ruined the very genre that some of them actually understood ....
