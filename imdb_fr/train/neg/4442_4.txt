I do not know ... maybe it's because I'm Brazilian but all that was too much. Too much love for music, too many parties, too much contrast between the beautiful life of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad) and the aspect of the city shown by the director. Everything seems so wrong: families, relationships, music, "happiness". He's just selling a little taste of the fake Latin American culture. I must be honest: it seduced me a little, but who would not be seduced by this false life made of beautiful music, sex and parties? I'm not so stupid: what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer from diarrhea, deep sadness or STDs? I liked the scene with the phone call from the mother of Caridad and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spaniards.
