There is not a decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you can start anywhere. The guy who plays Sebastian fears too. He does not even look like Ryan Phillipe very much. More like Joshua Jackson. The other two girls are terrible too. <br /> <br /> Then the dialogue is also crap. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (about to have a threesome): If you can not beat them ... <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who said you could not? not beat them? <br /> <br /> Blade. <br /> <br /> The end contradicts the entire plot of the original. In the first film, it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons why Sebastian wanted Kathryn so bad, apart from being played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was "the only girl he could not have and that had killed him" ". It was a tease who liked to play with him. The fact that she never gave it to him increased her urge. Then, in this P.O.S., this implies that he MAY have it with a girl aside. What? And we do not even see sex either. This is implicit, which makes it not only stupid, useless and contradictory, but also useless. <br /> <br /> And in the first, Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love, making him lose. Even if he won the bet, it reduced his chances. Then in these droppings, he loses AND falls in love. So, she does not fuck the "losers", but does she complete it? Another thing: it is said that Sebastian has never been in love, so how do you call it with Virgin Girl? <br /> <br /> Then, in the end, the virgin girl suddenly turns out to be Kathryn's nasty lesbian lover (dun dun dun) and, as I said, they get into a threesome lame off screen. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several other conspiracy contradictions. Did the writer even see the first movie? A 5 year old can report his / her belongings. <br /> <br /> After the threesome, Sebastian slept with the blonde virgin, corrupting his innocent mind in the back of a limousine while Kathryn and Virgin Girl turned badly in lesbian Suddenly, Twist Plot sit down to forward, listen and smile maliciously at the camera. <br /> <br /> The end ... <br /> <br /> See Sebastian become the asshole he was in first could have made an interesting movie. I guess all that was needed for little Sebastian to get tired, it was a trio with two hot girls. Interesting.
