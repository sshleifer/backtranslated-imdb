This film is not very good. In fact, it's the worst Elvis movie I've seen. It has very little intrigue, mainly party, beer and fights. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I do not know why they made this movie. It could be said that Elvis was wasted too, he is much, much better in "Follow That Dream".
