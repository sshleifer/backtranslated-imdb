Why am I constantly doing this? I mean, really, it's right there in the title - "The Incredible Melting Man". What else can I expect? I have to admit that I'm an idiot for just about everything I see on the Monster HD channel, but the only reductive feature of this image would be the truly grotesque makeup work of the legendary Rick Baker. As for goosebumps, I'm going to greet this old geezer couple sucking lemons just before the lights go out. Now, they were really scary. <br /> <br /> Something I never understood in horror movies was why the victims of a monster were not simply running away from virtual annihilation. Like the chick in the cabin. You know, there was a door completely visible in the kitchen that she could have left at any time. The incredible Steve-O could not count much more than a brisk walk, so why not just blow in front of him? I do not know, maybe I'm missing something. <br /> <br /> This film gives the impression of an episode of "Tales From The Crypt", but "Tales" generally presents a cool or grotesque turn that often is not seen coming. It was a photo that you could not understand OR to go. For example, in a recent scene, you can clearly see that Melting Man's gaze fell into his head, so how did he manage to move for the rest of the story? I guess we are not supposed to ask. <br /> <br /> Eighty-four minutes, this photo was too long an hour and a half. When all was over, I was ready to pick up General Perry on his previous suggestion: "I could really have a drink now".
