This film was worth five shots on my "launcher card". I saw this while I was in Virginia in the mid-1970s. I saw it alone, so I was not distracted while watching it. It sucks. It was the most ridiculous and total waste of celluloid I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know other critics of the movie have found this great. I offer you this: if it was so great, what does it take at the box office? End of the conversation.
