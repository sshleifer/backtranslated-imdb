The lack of content in this film amazed me the most. First, I thought people would compare that to Rock On! but I'm really surprised to say it was worse than Rock On! So So So Horrible Ajay casting Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin, you have to make fun of me. The music was okay Khanabadosh was the movie track the rest was bad! Vipul Shah has not learned yet from Singh, this is King's critical comedy. Now Asin ... where does she come from? Sorry for the Asin fan, but she lost a lot of time in this film that is a very bad actress game; she did not look pretty at all! My final verdict will look at Aladin with your family instead of wasting your time here.
