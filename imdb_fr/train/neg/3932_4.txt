This little solid horror movie is actually one of Renny Harlin's best. The story is quite common, but the atmosphere is what makes it really alive; in fact, ghost story is almost an afterthought. The real horror comes from the decor of the prison itself, and Renny H. does not spare any detail to show us how bad the conditions inside are, this old ruined dunce infiltrated with rats (with a sadistic guardian too). !) usually in the main role, supported by very authentic looking prisoners (there are no pretty boys in this cast.) Horror fans should watch this one.
