My wife and I thought this movie was a watered-down and specially made for Manhattan Murder Mystery (BBC) television ... which is in itself a good thing, but not great. The story has little tension or chemistry between the characters, and not much intrigue. Woody Allen's character wanders in his mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson have little left to do. It's pretty disappointing, I must say. Ian McShane's role is just an extended cameo appearance. <br /> <br /> The first thing that came to my mind was "I wonder how much the BBC had to pay to Woody Allen to dislodge him from Manhatttan?" He surely needed this money and his call to expand their audience beyond the two-star youth market. I give this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it's an amazing background noise. If you want something to wear while knitting or sorting your stamp collection, it will do the trick. I would not pay to rent it again.
