Where to even start? The horror game? The absurd plot? The windfall effects? The characters completely detestable? The agitated editing? The Casio keyboard score inducing headaches ??? Embarrassing racist remarks ("Look, Charlie!", "Go back, Jackie Chan !!" ??? Constant misogyny ??? I have been a horror fan forever, and I have no problem with the current "torture" -thon "trend of movies, however, it is a badly made trash I think I suffered more pain by watching that the characters died in it! If you like girls being forced to eat penis jumped, really poor The soft core porn and lines like "I'm going to find that b **** and staple c *** closed !!" are smart, LIVE FEED is for you. <br /> <br /> As for me I feel the need to go wash my eyes with an oven cleaner to avoid seeing this movie again!
