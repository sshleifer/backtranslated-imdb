Someone had a good idea: Let Misty Mundae make her own version of Lara Croft, rated R, and shoot two guns not only in tight outfits, but also topless. It was indeed a great idea. The problem is that the people who had the right could not propose any script or budget to support it. As a result, we get a "movie" that barely reaches an average length by replaying several of its parts (often in slow motion) and that has apparently been shot entirely in a garage. Misty Mundae's call is always obvious: she is incredibly cute and has a natural beauty, girl next door. However, her two female co-stars here, with whom she shares a long lesbian scene, are far from her league. If "Mummy Raider" was presented as a Youtube video, I would evaluate it higher, but as a "movie" for DVD consumption, it can not receive more than 1/2 a * of 4.
