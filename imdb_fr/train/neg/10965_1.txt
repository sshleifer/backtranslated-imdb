In fact, I watch this movie as I write this. . . If the following comments "prove my lack of development as a true artistic filmmaker" then so be it. . . <br /> <br /> But. . . I thought (I'm still thinking about what I'm watching now) that this movie. . . To put it mildly, is very, very overestimated. Once again, very. <br /> <br /> It looks like a very bad student film made by someone with extremely limited resources. . . and who did not pay much attention to details. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go on and on about the different ways that I find this movie missing, but. . . well . . . I just do not understand (remember, I fully recognize that maybe I'm the idiot here - not the filmmaker - for not having had this "imaginative genius"). . . I praised this on a whim because the reviews were really remarkable. . . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
