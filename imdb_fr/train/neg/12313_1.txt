It may not be the worst movie Steve Martin ever did, but it was far from his best. Obviously, he did this shit for the paycheck. Dreck like that certainly does nothing to improve his reputation as a funny man. What he does not seem to understand is that when people go to see a Steve Martin movie, they expect to be entertained and not bored. It's a shame that he trained Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I do not understand why talented people do not understand the fact that people do not want to see them in ugly movies. If you call a movie a comedy, then it should be funny. It was not. The US military should be ashamed to be associated with this pabulum. Full Metal Jacket had more laughter than this miserable excuse for a "service comedy". Phil Silvers is surely turning in his grave.
