With a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high school student, 'The Art of Seduction' fails to deliver the romantic and sophisticated experience he claims to represent. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting: the main men and women are "swinging monkeys (or in the case of the female role, engaged)", but "The Art of Seduction" does not even try . Taking a candid look at the personalities of these two characters, "The Art of Seduction" avoids all that has bottom to found a thin and thin stereotype. <br /> <br /> "The art of seduction" is insulting - insulting to his characters, insulting men and women, and insulting the expectations of his audience. It takes terribly beautiful people we all know and plays their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them. Ji-wan is an immature manipulative bitch, spoiled. The spectator should love and forgive her faults because she is pretty. Min-jun, well, he's exactly the same. People are not nice either. The "humor" in this film revolves around the insane attempts of Ji-wan and Min-jun to outdo themselves in the honorable art of lying and manipulation. No character development occurs, and we never understand why Ji-wan and Min-jun are like that. We're just supposed to take them as they are, not ask questions - they're cute, and that's all that matters. The abundant references to the celebrity of the main actors of azn cinema cinema reviews can lead you to the superficial character of 'Art of Seduction'. <br /> <br /> If you are still in high school, if you liked Grease or if you are a victim of yellow fever, you may like this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite its tag "Romance", it's not a very good date film.
