Around 1979, when I saw this film, it became the first film in the middle of which I left. There is nothing worse than comedy that is just funny, and it's missing every time (although I can not speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about the sketches. Although I enjoy racy humor, if any, these sketches were unnecessarily vulgar. What was even more irritating was that this film was billed as Robin William's "first film," capitalizing on his new fame in the television series "Mork and Mindy." Yet, his role has turned out to be so minor that you can not even see it on the screen.
