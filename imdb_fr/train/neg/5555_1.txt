Normally, I'm rather willing to like low-budget movies, but Darkman III is so scary that I only feel contempt for him. <br /> <br /> It looks like a TV show, and very bad quality. one to that. The sets are sparse, the lighting is flat, the score and the effects are disjointed, and the camera is a film school 101. There is no plot, strictly speaking, the characters are one-dimensional and the actors doze . Most of the actors seem to be doing soft core pornography ..... In fact, the only reward I got from this mess was to spot the surprising strabismus against Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B ' Elanna from Star Trek: Voyager) without her bumpy Klingon head makeup. His complexion is twice as clear as in Voyager; either she has been bleached for this role, or darkened for Voyager. Very strange anyway.
