it's not bad, but it's not good. it's just entertaining. <br /> <br /> like a comedy that is supposed to be, it's awful. not a lot of laughter at all because every joke in the movie has been made a million times before. <br /> <br /> it's a shame because all the actors in the film are great, but none of them really do a lot. and the end is zero.
