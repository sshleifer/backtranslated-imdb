I must begin by saying that I am a great romantic. I really wanted to love this movie. So I write in my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment I felt watching her. The Leap Years tells the story of Li-Ann, filled with fate, who craves for the sweet Jeremy and who agrees to meet every leap year. A very romantic place, based on a brilliant short story and with a cast that does not give the impression of watching yet another film of Jack Neo. So why oh why is it so bad? First, I have the feeling that filmmakers thought they were shooting a music video because they chose to replace real stories and emotions with nerdy montages, predictable actions and clich√©s. I'm both upset and embarrassed to be one of the first to watch The Leap Years in Singapore, but those of us in the cinema would agree that our stifled groans during these zany performances say a lot. I was hoping to see a romantic film that would surpass Forever Fever, the best Singaporean romantic comedy to date, and The Leap Years is not even close to it. Some blogs have called it The Crap Years, which is hard but ultimately true. Do not waste your money or emotions as I did. The film will make you give up love forever.
