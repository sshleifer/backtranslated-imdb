I think it's my duty, as a horror movie lover, to make others aware of this horrible and very bad "horror movie". Do not waste your time and money on this movie, the acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst I've ever known and the story is awful. Nothing was good, we end up wondering why I look at this shit. The plot had so many holes and they never cleared up in the end, it was so bad, I do not know how such a terrible movie could be done. As I said before, I love horror movies and I was so disappointed. It was an 18, but you see little blood, no fright or jumps. Moreover, what annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the movie, which had no interest in the plot, like brother and sister kissing, why? is all I can say. Do not worry, there are many more great horror movies, but do not waste your time. Life is too short.
