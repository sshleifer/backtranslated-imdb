Mr. Perlman gives an outstanding performance (as usual). Unfortunately, he has to fight with a script and absurd decorations. <br /> <br /> Larsen is in "Die Hard" mode with singlet and curved muscles, I'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied grimacing and growling through his game. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Erika is very decorative (even if she is fully dressed!) and shows some signs of "getting" actor finally. <br /> <br /> SFX are generally poor in computer graphics and steal other movies. <br /> <br /> The shootings are pitiful - worthy of the team A <br /> <br /> Not worth the detour for Perlman - AVOID
