I do not think anyone sitting down to watch this movie would expect anything to appear at a distance like a classic ghost story, but you have to wonder when it's over if you've ever been scared. It does not really work at this level, but the casting is doing its best and the film is not aimed at a happy ending. The story tells the story of an American couple traveling to Kyoto, Japan for Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) to write a book. He takes his wife Laura (Susan George) and their daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Their friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure) who works at the American Consulate helps them find a house and he finds one that is haunted. About 140 years ago, in the same house, a samurai found his wife cheating on him. He kills both of them and commits suicide. Their ghosts still live in the house and when the Fletcher arrives, it will not be long before strange things happen. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Sometimes ghosts inhabit the Fletcher's bodies and begin to behave like the Japanese they were before and Laura starts flirting with Alex, which leads to an affair. Meanwhile, Ted begins to behave more strictly and after pouring soup into Amy's throat, he asks for help from a monk. Unfortunately, the ghosts force Ted, Laura and Alex to play their death scene as it was 140 years ago. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Kevin Connor, known for being a good television director, but he directed horror and sci-fi movies before and worked with McClure on some of them. Although it's never close to a scary or developing atmosphere, it contains two things that I liked. First of all, there is no sappy end where the couple hug after defeating the demons. Instead, it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of ghosts. Second, Susan George is in the casting! I've always been a fan of her even though she appeared mostly in schlock but her performances are always top quality. In addition, she usually appears nude, which she does here in two separate scenes. Although she does not have classic features, she has a unique boyish look and is one of the reasons for her popularity. But after appearing in movies as stupid as this one, I think that led her to leave the trade or work only sporadically. This is not a bad movie but it is never convincing and watching the ghosts rush when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a laugh or two. In the end, it's ridiculous and I hope George decides to resume his career.
