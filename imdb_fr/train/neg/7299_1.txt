Of course, I saw bad movies in my life, but this one was so bad that I got angry at the theater. I wanted to get my money back. I wrote to the director to ask him to refund my movie ticket. Of course, I have not received a refund (or even answer), but that's the point. On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a -42. Why did the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) stop running after being hit with a bat? Why did they hit the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the bat in the first place instead of splitting the skull of the good for nothing? The plot was thin, the film was full of obvious clich√©s and some parts made no sense.
