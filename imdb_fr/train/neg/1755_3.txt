This film is not devoid of charm and also shows a little heat, but in the end this effort is too vain and too focused on the main roles. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do all her time on the screen, but it takes too much limelight to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the overload of the scenario with the snapshots. The girl who secretly quits college, an elderly woman who has trouble finding a good job (and ends up having a pretty humiliating job), the network manager shady with her directional toys that goes for pomp, the journalist who rest for his convictions, etc. There is nothing wrong with any of that, that is, they are all firmly rooted in reality, but together they are just too much and leave us too much déjà vu and too much few surprises.
