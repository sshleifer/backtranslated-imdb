If you're hoping for something new, you've chosen the wrong movie. Who can think that a film that virtually reproduces its predecessors can be good. Maybe the producer and maybe the director, but I hope they were not serious when they did that. This whole movie is like making a DVD of great hits of the first 3 movies, but changing the actors. BHHAAAAD.
