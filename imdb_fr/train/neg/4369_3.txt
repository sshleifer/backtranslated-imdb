*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British-made "thriller" released in the United States by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius who must leave his research because his funds are exhausted. Karloff is forced to withdraw to France and start a medical office. It is proposed by a female accomplice who wants to get rid of her much older husband. She knows that Karloff needs the money. <br /> <br /> Karloff accepts the proposal and soon becomes the husband's personal physician. All the while, the woman talks in town with the local, not a good playboy. Karloff finally injects poison into the old geyser and starts. However, her son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the murder and discovers that the will has been changed. When he spills the beans to the wife, she goes crazy furious and even bites the hand of the son. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Karloff's nurse misplaced the hypo that Karloff had used to kill the old man. When Karloff discovers that he does not receive any money, he asks the woman to poison the son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the missing hypo. The analysis reveals a poison, but not in time, because Karloff removes the nurse. <br /> <br /> To summarize, the nurse escapes, gets the police and manages to save the son about to inject by Karloff. Karloff injects himself instead and dies. <br /> <br /> This film has some positive points. Karloff is possessed and plays the kind of crazy doctor he did in The Devil's Orders and The Man Who Lived. However, it is curious to see him walking stiff and slightly curved. We never find out why he walks this way. I guess the director thought it made him more sinister. <br /> <br /> The actress playing the wife at 2 speeds surpasses something terrible. She has a French accent. Even if she reacted badly, you always manage to hate her (or maybe you hate her because of her acting ...). <br /> <br /> A little below average for a Karloff vehicle. If you buy the VHS copy of Sinister Cinema, the sound is a bit unstable.
