I saw and loved the original movie, and I was expecting more than one remake. <br /> <br /> GOOD: The effects and makeup are good. No complaints about the score and the visual effects, they are adequate and the performances were correct (Tim Roth was excellent, the other directors were good and a handful of "supporting actors" played very well with extremely limited roles). The action scenes were exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> ADB: The escape from the city of the monkeys was terrible. The characters turn in circles, then suddenly, in the middle of the city, there are tunnels to escape. Plus, which way of escape leads by everyone's room? <br /> <br /> The story has been kept to a minimum to include as much action as possible. I like action scenes but the original movie had more substance and deserved more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the end was completely absurd as presented. Without seeing the inevitable result, she has no justification. <br /> <br />
