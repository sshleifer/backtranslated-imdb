**** MINOR SPOILERS *** As a bad movie lover, I had to watch hundreds of bad movies and yet, "Hobgoblins" stands out from all others in its own way. The classic villains such as "Creeping Terror", "The Powerful Gorga" and "Manos" are consistently bad from start to finish. Hobgoblins, on the other hand, start badly and gradually get worse. During my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene, I thought it was really a bad movie. I did not know that I had just seen the best of this movie. The film plunges headlong into celluloid hell during the painfully inept sequence of "Club Scum" which consists of a continuous chain of unadorned jokes. With this single film, director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves to be mentioned alongside Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst filmmakers of all time. How bad can be a bad movie? Look at Hobgoblins and do not be surprised.
