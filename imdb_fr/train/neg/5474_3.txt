To be honest, they did their best with a budget of five shillings and six pence, but the dialogue was more corny than 9 lb. of emmental and the CGI was a bit old hat now. maybe if some actors were not perfectly chiseled in granite, the film would have been a little better too. To say that it was horrible is bad to do this movie, if you want to see something totally execrable, you have to sit down and waste a few hours of your life looking at 'sickle', a mind so awful that it's Terrible, it's really good (many great alcoholic beverages are derigating however.) Whatever the path traveled, I have to take a look if you have not seen it yet, but do not expect anything like "Jurassic Park, the Lost World" or "Apocalypto".
