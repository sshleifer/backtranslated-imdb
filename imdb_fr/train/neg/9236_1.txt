I'm part of millions of people who see themselves as fans of Cary Grant, but I see no reason to recommend this film. I do not understand the cast of Betsy Drake and apparently no one else has. judge of the small number of films in which she subsequently played. <br /> <br /> Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was superb at chasing and capturing Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby. Here's the director or writers I've read about "goose bumps" Drake was, but I thought it was a description too sweet. Franchot Tone went through this one as if he had a hangover. A casting disaster is one thing. This film is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> This one does not deserve 10 lines of comments and I do not know why it's a requirement. Too bad, this one was preserved when many worthy films of the name are decomposed in vaults. <br /> <br /> Unless you want to torture someone, give them a place.
