We were served - a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'll admit that I'm white and have no practical experience in the "competitive world of step-by-step dance". to be exactly an authority on this type of film. By cons, I know a bad movie when I see it. <br /> <br /> And then, I just saw him. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Low-Budget-Vision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid ("A touch of pink"), "How She Move" tells how important it is to follow your dreams - even if these dreams include playing strong and irritating hip-hop music and dialogue, the average person would not understand if he had an international translator. <br /> <br /> I will try to give you a little summary of the "plot". First of all, there are two actors who look like LL Cool J who work in a car shop in Toronto (the mecca of racial diversity), but still have time to dance eight hours a day. <br /> <br /> There are a few other guys in this "team", including a symbolic white guy and a guy who looks like Denzel Washington in "Malcolm X". There are also two women in the film - one looks like Serena Williams and the other is Geraldine from the former "Flip Wilson Show". One of these ladies was expelled from a private college because her parents had spent all their studies in a drug-dependent brother or sister. The other girl, a member of Salt N Pepa, is not in doubt, it's just not good. <br /> <br /> There is another guy who looks like Eddie Murphy's Buckwheat, while another actor is an imitator of Huggy Bear. These guys are rival half-dancers. Obviously, this activity is very difficult, and they all practice for the big jam "Step Monster" in Detroit. <br /> <br /> Since I was unable to understand 90% of the dialogue (subtitles might have been useful, as in a Bergman film or in a Snow clip), it is difficult to explain what's going on, apart from the fact that there's a lot of talk, the daughter of Serena Williams (who never smiles, by the way) becomes an independent stepper (moving from group to group), there's some dance step by step and a lot of irritating hip-hop music. <br /> <br /> This is a typical story of misery to riches; a bit like "Rocky" with a very bad soundtrack, "Rudy" with an annoying rap music in the background, "Cry Freedom" without the laughs. <br /> <br /> But why should a movie - which could have had a big impact on black audiences - contain addiction, bad parents and a title that looks like a freshman saying move? br /> <br /> However, I was "moved" by this film, moved to leave the theater as soon as possible.
