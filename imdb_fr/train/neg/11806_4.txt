It was hard to watch this film and to be totally fair and objective since I am a big fan of the original 1944 film. For me and many others, it's one of the greatest black films ever made. Realizing that it's just a shortened TV movie and that most people have rejected it, I did not expect much, but you can not help but compare that with the movie of 44. Scene after scene, I found myself comparing what I was looking at and remembering how things were going on between Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson, and others. Now, I saw these famous actors playing their famous roles, replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was all over, I thought it was not as bad as expected, but it's not a match for the 1944 original. The two main areas in which this film intended to the television was not as good were (1) it lacked electricity between the two main actors and (2) being only 90 minutes away, they rushed on the story without having time to develop the plot. , characters and chemistry between these tracks. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and nothing was between MacMurray and Stanwyck like "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson", respectively. <br /> <br /> Where this reshuffle took place, it was in others like "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton." Cobb was great in the role of Keyes and Robert Webber in the role of Norton, head of the insurance company. It was also interesting to see that deadlines change: houses, cars, phones, dictating machines, and so on. were all in the early 70s instead of the mid-40s. Otherwise, the scenario was very similar, just rushed. <br /> <br /> However, only one viewing was enough and I will be happy to return to the original version for the rest of my viewing of this classic story and this film.
