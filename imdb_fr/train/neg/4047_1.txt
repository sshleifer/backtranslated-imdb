***** WARNING, MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS THAT WILL BE MORE DIVERSIVE THAN THIS. **** <br /> <br /> Here's a good tip for anyone living in the UK every time Channel 5 broadcasts an old 80s comedy late at night, read a book instead. I am currently recovering from a crisis, after reading some of the comments on this film. I'm really shocked by the fact that someone said this movie was realistic! All I can say is thanks god, the cold war has never degenerated, otherwise we could just as easily have left our borders to the Commie ... I found this movie terrible, but it can -be just my British perception of what makes a movie funny, who knows? But in all respects, this film is not only horrible, its teeth are terribly awful. <br /> <br /> I've never been a fan of Bill Murray, and his bullshit like that justifies my feelings for him. Do not get me wrong, I loved Ghostbuster, which was only made three years after this movie. But that just sums up Bill Murray. I can say without fear that I have not lost my time so blatantly since we witnessed the first execution of the Delta Force operation here, although these two films have more in common than you think. For one thing, they both have terrible action sequences from start to finish, and second. They are both riddled with cheesecloths everywhere. <br /> <br /> One thing, these guys are supposed to be in the "US Army". Yet they have the right to wallow around their camp, Willy Nilly, to seduce female military police officers and then imbibe them in the headquarters of the generals. Talk about chance! This movie is just terrible for what I'm scared. Now, do not get me wrong, I'm not a feminist sympathizer, but the fact that these two women really fall in love with these characters shortly after arresting them, letting them go for free ... Twice, that's insulting to the female race. The fact that a fat-skinned, greasy-eyed (Winger) and his unlucky companion, Ramis, can simply indulge in the MP's underwear, which they fall head over heels in love with, is ridiculous. <Br/> <br /> Then there are the training scenes, where you will meet the group "Phycho" who threatens to kill, without believing, whoever touches or touches him, followed by the overweight type ( played by the great and late John Candy) who claims he joined the military to "avoid paying $ 400 for anger management classes". Leading out loud, Murray pays tribute to the "Giant Toe" (WTF?) "Drill Seargent" who, honestly, could not organize a tour in a brewery, let alone his group of recruits. All that this scene is used to do is prelude to a host of fight scenes, with people saying "way to go to the mouth"! all the time, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> The scenes continue to show the group of labels of rags that are all chest on the assault course, which leads to a scene where one of them pulls violently in the air. passing birds with an assault rifle, peppering a watchtower with bullets. (Just like that, yes, I told you that this film was random ... It miraculously escapes an unruly too ...) In the end, the parade of passers-by, where the unfortunate team makes a magical turn in l two hours. (Tell me, Miracle!) Thanks to Murray's wise words, who then lead a military and military dance routine in front of a geriatric "general" in front of the rest of the teams. All this to the delight of their two girlfriends at the helm who really should have stopped them ... Everyone laughs. This bit is not surprising, however. He then chooses them to keep a new multi-million dollar prototype armored vehicle in Italy (which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with a host of gadgets inside), claiming that "That's exactly what this army needs! " righto ... <br /> <br /> Then comes the end of the week, when Murray and Ramis decide to steal this prototype of a very secret military vehicle to recover their newly acquired and somewhat hyperactive girlfriends in Germany. Captain Hapless (John Larroquette) discovers and leads the squad of new recruits on a recovery mission for this vehicle. What they take then a "bad turn" en route and end up in Czechoslovakia kept in Bosnia, where they are captured. (As if we had not seen this coming ...) So begins a rescue attempt by Ramis and Murray + Birds in the hand, where a big fight takes place, tons of hip shots and tanks. With their return as national heroes, humiliating the Russians by calling them "pussies", etc. etc. The end. It is true. No martial courts, nothing. They only stole a prototype military vehicle, drove it to a Warsaw Pact country and almost caused an international incident that could have triggered World War III! <br /> <br /> This film is really more fun than a diagnosis of terminal illness. I know it's supposed to be a comedy, he has all the good actors for that, but where the heck is it? Does Channel 5 delete these bits? The only reductive feature of this film is the repeated use of naked women taking a shower and Mud Wrestling. (As I said, Random) There is no point in dispelling the fact that this is a crappy movie, of course. This film should aim realistically at 9-year-old immature kids. Unfortunately, we have to look at it instead. 1 out of 10 stars - Total Tripe. My advice, do something a little more useful with your time. Like castrating oneself ...
