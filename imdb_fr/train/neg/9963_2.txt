I like Alec Guinness. And that says a lot after this movie. In fact, it is not bad in that. He just seems to stay away, be urban and his usual yummy self, but invest nada. It is obvious that the girl with whom he is paired is a featherweight, even as an inexperienced French girl. Sir Alec would not have chosen him when he was young and obviously is not very happy now. <br /> <br /> The interesting character is the brooding brother of the strange "Suzanne", another twit. "Donald" aspires to be a French Heathcliffe and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery. What dark secret hid behind that forehead? Was he in love with the mistress of the father? Why did he shake Suzanne's hair when she plotted to gather the different parts of this turkey on the estate? Or maybe he just had enough of his hateful game. <br /> <br /> The film would have been charming with Guinness and the "old woman" who remembered and saw Paris together. It would have been a beautiful story! Two beautiful people experienced in a beautiful city after the destruction of the Second World War. Why did not someone invent that? I suggest watching Alec Guiness in "The Card", a little known but worthwhile film.
