Oh hilarity! Oh joy! Another film that is so bad is good! Or so I thought. In fact, it misses the phase "so bad his good" and goes, unfortunately, directly to the "could have been so bad his good, but they ruined everything and made it bad". <br /> <br /> To start his way too long. Cut half an hour and it was perhaps more bearable. Then put in ridiculous plots like "the man who sabotages the mission to save the Earth, because he has all the food stored and he will be rich if the mission fails!". Duh! Or the conspiracy device "talking bomb" last seen in Dark Star. Guess what .... like in Dark Star, the bomb has a malfunction ..... hmmmm. Add a dash of "we can not act like a kindergarten game" and you have in short the solar crisis. <br /> <br /> A slight relief is to take in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants, as we have called it in this movie), whose only purpose in the film is to drive a kid into the desert and call his father to pick him up ... finally. Between driving and telephoning, Jack dispenses a lot of drivel, jerks and useless jabbering, but contributes little to the story as it is. In short, it is the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> My prize for "The most ironic line delivered unobtrusively" goes to Charlton Heston, who, when he meets his eldest son for the first time, comments that his son has looks a little "deformed" while he is standing himself, belly belly above the waist and desperately in need of a captain Kirk Corset. <br /> <br /> The meanest henchman, who has a bright white hairstyle that reminded me of Andy Warhol, for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> Apart from these hilarities, this film is hardly advisable. The end is a copied sequence (much shorter than) of the final sequence of 2001. <br /> <br /> Cheats to better enjoy this movie, if you're silly enough to watch it, as I did : <br /> <br /> 1. Whenever the bomb speaks, imagine that it's called Tarquin (Believe me, it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. Whenever Chuck Heston is on the screen and about to speak, preempt him by reciting a phrase from Planet of the Apes, such as "Take me off your dirty feet!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. Whenever the main woman looks stressed (most of the time), she still hopes that she will have an aneurysm and die soon. <br /> <br /> 4. During the interminable scenes "the ship breaks again", continue to hope that the technicians / engineers will talk to you about a Scotty-ism like "You can not change the laws of physics! " or such shit. <br /> <br /> Other than that, do whatever it takes to help you get through this one. I fell asleep midway and woke up to realize that I had not missed anything and that the plot (as laughable as it is) did not come forward. So, do not worry about giving yourself for a few, you will not miss anything.
