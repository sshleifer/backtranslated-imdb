This movie is a load of giant pants. Paul Schrader is totally lost in his own scenario. And his staging is about as comatose as possible without it slipping into sleepwalking during the process. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is Woody Harrelson, whom I like when he is properly launched. He plays "the walker", a homosexual man in DC who plays the role of social mate to the bored wives of Washington's elite. It could not have been more one-dimensional if it had been cut from a magazine and turned over on camera on a popsicle stick. His "southern accent" is this "off the rack" version that decrescendo from beginning to end of each line he delivers, as if the heat and humidity of the South still drained him of every ounce of energy that he had. It's monotonous. But, this is not the worst accent of the film. His "boyfriend", interpreted by Moritz Bleibtreau, tries to affect a kind of Middle Eastern accent so clumsy that he can hardly deliver the bad lines written for him. He is unable to roll his records despite the fact that he is German and speaks several languages, including Italian! It's a good reason to start someone else, do not you think? <br /> <br /> From the story to the scenario, through the film, the work with the camera, the performances of the main actors, this film is bad from the beginning to the end. The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to cross this film with dignity. In fact, all three are excellent, despite being trapped in a very bad movie. Unfortunately, no one could ever be good enough to redeem this series of endless flaws. If you like these three actresses, look at them differently. This movie is not worth your time.
