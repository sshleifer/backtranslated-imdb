In fact, Geico's top 50 commercials did not bother me, so I saw them and found them a bit twisted and fun, BUT SERIOUSLY! This is the BEST thing these people could imagine?!? This show is bad! It is bland and gives the impression of watching an episode of "The Office" with the characters disguised as cavemen (I know that many of you will hate me for saying that, but "The Office" does not do it just not for me). Ok, I understand: the poor slut is just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a shitty boss who hates him; the pseudo-intellectual who really has an intellect that barely works; and the dopey that just wants to be accepted, but SO WHAT !!! I have worked with these people and found them as boring in real life as I do on TV ... why would I want to lose another third of my week looking at more such candidates?!? Call your parents and ask them if they left you on the head if after thinking about it, you are mistaken still thinking that it is an entertainment.
