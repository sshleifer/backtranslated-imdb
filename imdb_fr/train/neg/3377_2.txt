Broadway's musical "A Chorus Line" is arguably the best theater musical. These are the experiences of people who live for dancing; the joys they experience and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer audition for parts of a Broadway choir line, but what stands out from each is the story of how his life brought him to find dance as a respite. <br /> <br /> The film version, however, captures neither the passion nor the beauty of the show, and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical because it is lifeless and devoid of all affection for dancing, anything. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was making Sir Richard Attenborough the director, whose management provided the right touch and rhythm for "Gandhi". Why would a sensible person ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a rather small place? <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the next problem. "A Chorus Line" takes place on stage in a theater without real scenery or limited costume changes. It is the least flashy of Broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. However, that does not translate well into a movie, and nobody really thought it. For this reason, the film should have plunged us into the lives of these dancers and leave the process of theater and hearing. The singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even offered flashbacks to their first ballet, jazz or tap dance class. Heck, they could have danced Broadway in their lively imagination. Still, the film was not imaginative, as Attenborough's total indifference to the dance and the show itself is evident in its nonchalant direction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are downright embarrassing as the dancers say. story to the director (Michael Douglas) if he wants to hear them or not. The character of Douglas hesitates to choose whom he strains his ears and to whom he has no patience. <br /> <br /> While the filmmakers claimed to be true to the nature of the play, some heretical changes were made. The very beautiful song "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love" - ​​a shattering stage number that brought the dancers back to their teens - was removed and replaced by the terrible "Surprise" song so bad that it was been nominated for an Oscar. Adding the insult to the injury, "Surprise" has simply taken over the same story as "Hello, Love" but without wit or pathetic. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to see this movie unless you want to have a lesson to follow. to do when transferring a Broadway show to a movie. If you want to see a movie version of this show, the next thing to do is Bob Fosse's awesome "All That Jazz". While Pit's daughter is in "A Chorus Line", IL is the Pit that should have been involved, as a director. He would have known what to do with this material, which deserved a much greater respect than this sad effort.
