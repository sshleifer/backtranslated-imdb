We gave up when George Clooney's character got his nails extracted. We were not worthless - after an hour of this drama, we knew what it was like. To say that this film was incomprehensible, boring and pretentious, it would be too much praise! How did people manage to sit in this pseudo movie with a confusing, slow and depressing pseudonym, let alone name him for an Oscar? Clooney looked as sick as we felt him look at him. What was he thinking? Oh .. and what was with these subtitles? Did we just have a failed DVD or was the original movie made that way? The movie was hard enough to follow without that too. I pity the actors, who obviously did their best with the available material.
