... well, put it in the DVD, lose an hour and a half of your life that you will never come back, and find out. <br /> <br /> Act? Which game? <br /> <br /> Production values? ...Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> History? Do not start me. <br /> <br /> After many years of posting on IMDb, I had never thought of seeing a movie so badly that I really wanted to get a score lower than this one. I always found at least one reason or two to see the merit - if only in the intention or effort of the author, director, cast or producer? <br /> <br /> In this case, they 'It's the same man (!) who really needs to understand, at least as this useless waste of videocassettes shows, that he has no talent . I mean it would be a reasonable excuse if it was the "production" of a young high school student for his first film class, but "the artist" mentioned behind this dreck was twenty-six at the time of this miscarriage. <br /> <br /> How did that happen? Who in their good spirit has ever written a check for this? Also, do not let the cover of the box fool you: there is not even something remotely resembling a good sex scene or a good "show" of the song on that cover. a second when this "film" had a redeeming value: the "talent" mentioned above is punched by his lover. I applauded! And, I learned something from this "movie". There are times when something is so bad that it's really funny. But not comically. it's just sadly humorous. Very sadly humorous.
