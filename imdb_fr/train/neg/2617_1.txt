This film was pure pain. Sitting in the theater for a considerable number of minutes, I wondered when the movie would begin. All configurations were in place; typical love story, the characters must overcome their disagreements, the villain must emerge, but none of this has ever been initiated. By the time these things happened, I was already bored and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes requiring immense tension and accumulation, it seemed that the necessary frames were cut. Children's business does not have to be like that. Children's films can be as fascinating and appealing as those for adults. The excuse, "Hey, it's for kids," is bull. I will take "sword in stone" every day. It was terrible. I feel that Disney will do anything these days. And as far as children are concerned, the ten years I've seen with that will fit ... pure garbage.
