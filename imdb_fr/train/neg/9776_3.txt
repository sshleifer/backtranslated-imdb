I do not know much about making movies, but good movies have to tell a story ... your characters have to start and finish their journey. In Last Exit to Brooklyn, they can, but it's not satisfying and I do not mean a happy end, but an end. <br /> <br /> Last Exit to Brooklyn, which takes place in 1952 during a very brutal labor strike, puts a number of son in the story in motion. Most involve some of the most unimaginable characters to have ever gone through a movie screen. But Last Exit to Brooklyn does not manage to bring these stories to a successful end ... some are left without end, or fly into a strange stratosphere for an "artistic" end. <br /> <br /> Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> A sad transvestite character (an important character in the movie), is hit by a car and killed. And that's all for him in the film ... he left for good, erased from the memory of all ... no reactions from his friends, his enemies, his lovers ... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another thread, the leader of stupid strike, without intelligence and secretly homosexual, his homosexual lover having been rejected by the work and discovered by the thugs of the district, he is trampled by the thugs. The scene that ends near the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the lampposts are very very similar to those of the Nazi death camps ... and the scene hangs over and over again ... and the camera goes down 'to the union leader's body, and he was crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course, that's all for him too ... erasing the brain ... gone. <br /> <br /> In conclusion ... no matter what the critics originally said in 1989 about this film ... This film is a depressing piece of mud. Avoid it. And if you are not, it really deserves the NC-17 ranking for its huge amounts of physical, emotional and sexual abuse ... Do not even let teenagers watch.
