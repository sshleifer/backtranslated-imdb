When I say "Doctor Who," you can conjure up an image of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee or perhaps Peter Davison. When I say "James Bond", you almost certainly evoke a picture of Sean Connery, while a handful of people think of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. But when I say "Sgt Bilko", everyone thinks of Phil Silvers. Unlike Doctor Who or James Bond, the role belongs exclusively to an actor. And this is the problem of this version of the film that you will want to watch the old show in black and white. In fact, the idea of ​​making a film version of BILKO without Silvers playing the title role is close to the sacrilege.
