This movie is really bad. It may be hard, but it is. It really is. Wrong writing, every vampire clich√© of the book is used and no sympathy is given to the origins of the main character ... that is to say ole Dracula. There have been some very good films about Dracula / vampire in the past, but that's not even one of the "terrible" niches. <br /> <br /> Choose a selection of people who seem to have abandoned teen-slasher movement, add a Dracula Lore dribble and mix into an intoxicating dreamy religious / surrealist tonic ... and you get a confused mess of a movie - Dracula 2000. <br /> <br /> I really do not find good things to say about this movie, as if it was not serious enough to produce it, they seem to have made Johnny Lee Miller an English accent ... What is the problem I hear? you cry ... well, he's English, but he looks like an American trying to make an English accent. <br /> <br /> Overall, you might as well tell your money (if you plan to buy it), or rent it, look at it and find out for yourself why it's so scary than the Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Although La La is pretty scary!
