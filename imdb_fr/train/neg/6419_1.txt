Think of the end of Grudge 2 with the following: <br /> <br /> - a man who repeatedly says the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar intersecting herself - and a terrifying mirror <br /> <br /> ANIMALS OF SEA SEA AND SEA ... yes ... <br /> <br /> not a good film ... I did not really appreciate it . The movie poster is also extremely misleading and I thought it was just to get people to watch it ... I can not believe I went there. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money ... watch Saw III ... a movie where writing makes you feel like you've made an effort. <br /> <br /> Im Mike and I'm out
