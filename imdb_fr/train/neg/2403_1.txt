Beat!!! I got this film because Elizabeth Hartman was there. I was disappointed to discover that she participated in two short scenes towards the end. Other than that, I basically touched the fast forward button all the time. A teenager goes on a trip to Romania with his father. He is bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf in the event of a full moon. He kills his father and his friends. About 30 years ago, but he does not age a bit and enrolls in a high school. There he meets a shy teacher who ends up biting and then takes children with him. This film is bad and I do not recommend it to anyone. Read more War and peace. Only Ms. Hartman did a great job. Discover a very young Bob Saget in this one !!
