Even Bob Hope, escorted by many high-level actors, can not save this ill-timed attempt at war comedy, as his patented schedule is unlikely to work. The plot involves a Hollywood movie star named Don Bolton (Hope) and his attempt to escape military service at the beginning of the Second World War, followed by his erroneous enlistment in a confused attempt to woo a colonel's daughter ( Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, and her assistant, played by Eddie Bracken, enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades involving training exercises filmed in the hills of Malibu, California. Paramount generously budgeted for this effort, calling on some of his best specialists, but the direction given by David Butler, generally reliable, was flaccid, and this must be attributed to a comic element missing from the script. A change towards the end of the film to create an opportunity for Bolton's heroism is still born with stunts and mediocre camera actions. Strangely, Lynne Overman gets the best replicas and this veteran master of sarcasm is doing very well. Dorothy Lamour is pretty and plays well too. It's always a pleasure to see and hear Clarence Kolb, his father, whose voice is unique on the screen or on the radio, but they can not do anything to save this film, cursed. as it is with an error in the script assignment.
