The problem I find with this title is that I'm not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or a film. A mix of both genres simply does not work and it leaves everything in the middle of nowhere. This is especially true since the director has chosen the extremes of what is supposed to happen in our daily life to make it an unconvincing documentary. If it's a thriller / drama, it's too monotonous and monotonous. In both cases, what is the moral or the message that the director is trying to convey to the public? What around us, there are people who mistreat others who want to be abused? That there are a lot of crazy people around us? So what?
