It's easily one of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen. It's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot plan. This movie is terribly slow and I got bored for almost every 98 minutes. Although the acting is at best mediocre, the most important problem is the script, poorly written, slow and laborious, with no real direction. From time to time, a strange mood is defined to be broken only by a line or a useless event. I'm not surprised that all actors are sick and vomit between shots. After all, they had to try to digest a terrible scenario. As a big fan of good horror movies, I'm always irritated that something as bad is done. Save 98 minutes, you will never come back.
