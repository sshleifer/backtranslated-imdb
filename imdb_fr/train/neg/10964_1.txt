I was unlucky to have seen it at the Sidewalk Film Festival. The sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the last nail of the coffin. As a fervent fan of Lewis Carroll's Alice Carroll books, I was very excited about the film's first film, which made it even more uncomfortable to watch. Normally I am excited about modern stories if they are treated well. Usually, it is interesting to see parallels between past and present in a familiar story. Unfortunately, this film was less a modern story than a perversion of pop culture. The adaptation of the characters of the original seemed youthful and was generally terribly annoying. It probably did not help that the actors were not very good either. Most of the performances were ridiculously exaggerated, which I suppose was due to wrong direction or effort to make up for a bad scenario. I did not laugh once during the whole movie. All jokes were obsolete references to unheard events that will inevitably lose their intensity over time. In fact, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is about to meet Alice, but even in this case, the score mimicked the work of Danny Elfman. In addition, I must say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance was horrible. It was definitely the low point of the movie. <br /> <br /> What a joke. Do not see this movie. After his conclusion, I was really angry.
