I'm the kind of person who went to the local library and read books about the Babbage Difference Engine while my classmates were playing football, etc. So, if there is a target audience for this movie, then I guess I would probably be included in that. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just have to watch it again. A previous comment mentioned not watching this movie while being tired. It may have been my mistake. <br /> <br /> I did my best to enjoy this film, but I liked some aspects of it, but overall, I found the film amateur and quite painful. <br /> <br /> Being a bit confused in computer science, I can not help but specify exactly when the film was shot and how the graphics used reflect this period (1997). After playing games from the era c.f. "Mind Grind" to cite an example, this film can not escape this multimedia explosion 16-bit color low resolution of that time. Now, fortunately, this has somewhat lessened in recent years in the world of gambling at least, to the benefit of the real game. <br /> <br /> Forced to watch this movie via a German satellite channel FTA (as I think it has already been broadcast on the British TV FTA, well not recently), I was slightly amused to see the note of the end credits. Gottdog (God dog) had 4 people working on his design. It may be a bad idea for me to be amused by this, since it has been ten years since the film was shot. Nevertheless, the final result gives a nice appearance to the graphics of the 80s. <br /> <br /> For the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like others, I agree that Ada deserves a film without the science fiction angle and that a simpler biographical approach may be more appropriate to cover the life of this remarkable woman. <br /> <br /> There are fundamental mistakes undermining my enjoyment of this movie. First, the underlying idea that it is possible to accurately reconstruct a kind of extrapolation from software-based intelligent agents, somehow lost from the information of the past, may seem ridiculous. <br /> <br /> We now know that a film does not predict the mechanics of all things over time (for example, winds). <br /> <br /> Okay, the Victorians may have adopted this point of view, but GÃ¶del's work in the twentieth century proves that no mathematical system can be complete, Turing's work on the limits computability, not to mention the theory of chaos and quantum mechanics, have completely undermined these ideas, which seem central to modern research. the software is supposed to work. <br /> <br /> Finally, clicking on the mouse to indicate "programming" is just as wrong, as previously stated. <br /> <br /> This film could have been OK, but at least a bit technical A scientific consultation would have given the film an essential credit in terms of credibility. <br /> <br /> I will not forget the movie, but like "Pi", it's clearly a unique job, but with too many fatal mistakes for me to really enjoy it, 3/10 of me .
