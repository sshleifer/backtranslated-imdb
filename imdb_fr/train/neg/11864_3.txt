the characters to scams without depth. you've seen all the characters in other movies, I promise. the script tries to be angry and obnoxious but fails miserably. there are times when the hangover meets the comedy of the super-followers, but the jokes come out of the left field, are completely forced and are almost totally ignored after being cracked. the hot chick is old and has no personality, she is just some of the girls in their early thirties, blonde with some soft ass and underwear wearing jokes unappealing. the attraction between Molly (the hot girl) and Kirk (Dorky's love interest) is barely communicated. the attraction is nowhere else it's a completely platonic relationship until a clumsy and predictable kiss occurs. After that, they are in a complete relationship and it's incredibly lame. the main objective of this film is not the relationship, but an unsuccessful attempt to make a super-nasty hot movie with a semi-seductive plot. I could compare that to a hangover, in its forced nature. I will not go into that. I could go on but it's just useless. but do not pay to see this movie.
