Spoken like a real crested gangsta. The story is no worse than any number of gangster movies, but never confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. It's not in the same league. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film is periodically painful to watch is all those Italo-Americans who chatter leaving bad lines of gangsta with an even more false accent. Pacino would have been great if they had just dubbed him. I could not wait to see Abrahams and Loggia, but their energizing accents spoiled the pleasure. <br /> <br /> Ah, the scenario is not too hot either. Don Corleone reportedly disappeared five minutes after meeting him, smiling and patting him on the back all the time.
