Normally, I do not have a problem with free cursing in movies, but this one really pissed me off. They only swore. For the whole film. (And, as someone has noted, catches cancer) It was boring, rambling and pretentious. I would not like if I were you. <br /> <br /> It's also not that I do not like movies that, like most people who love it, claim to "watch life". I love Eat Drink Man Woman, and all that happens in this area is that a multitude of Taiwanese people lead their lives. But I could understand them. I have never met anyone who has sworn as much as the "actors" of this film, and I was working on a construction site. So go understand. That said, William H. Macy made me smile. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid unless you like boredom.
