Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be part of this film and was forced to play a partially Mexican role, otherwise he would have been suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! After the success of "Dodge City", Warners probably tried to follow up with Errol Flynn and his usual list of friends, such as Alan Hale, Williams' Guinn (Big Boy), Frank Mc Hugh and the ever-present John Litel, but they have made a huge mistake in trying to portray Miriam Hopkins as a love affair for Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer to really make things bad, because she has proven one thing is that she can not sing. The story was not so bad, but with Bogie, it's clear he was a poor Westerner, lying on a modest budget, but in fairness the color would not have helped.
