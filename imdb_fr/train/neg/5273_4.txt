*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw a preview of this movie, I thought it would be at least a slightly admirable scenario. But like most of the original superstation movies, I was disappointed. This gullible family eventually crosses this "deserted" city to take a break and find this video camera showing these people doing all their gift and discovering that they all end up disappearing, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers the devil stalking. There are more gaps than I can count and they do not explain what is happening, how or what. It ends when the family suffers a car accident and is brainwashed or something like that (which is never explained). The next thing you know, you hope they will know how it happened, but it ends up leaving you completely puzzled.
