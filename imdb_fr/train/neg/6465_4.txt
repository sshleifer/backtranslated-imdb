This release of Charles is decent, but the performance is rather discreet. Marlon Brando stands out. There is a secondary plot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland who forgets to develop and it hurts the film a bit. I'm still trying to understand why Charlie wants to change his name. Every movie with "Charles" was pretty bad.
