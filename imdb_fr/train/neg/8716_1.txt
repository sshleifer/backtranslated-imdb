I do not know where to start; the acting, the special effects and the writing are as bad as you can imagine. I can not believe that the production staff has reached such a point that he said: "Our work is done, it's time to publish it". I'm just glad that the first two in the series have never been to the UK. In fact, I recommend you watch this movie so you can enjoy the quality of most movies. <br /> <br /> I do not know how other users of IMDb might find it scary when the "terrifying" dinosaurs waddle in the hallways with rubber arms
