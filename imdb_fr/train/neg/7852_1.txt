I am not a horror film buff, but my wife's nephews and nieces. So I saw the first movie. It was awful and tense, but not to my taste. Always good anyway. For similar reasons, at this point, I am exposed to a sequel. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is beyond the absurd. I can buy that disasters happen in the desert. I can buy mutants exist. I can even believe that the events could be so strange and strange that the military might decide to get involved. It's unlikely, yes, but I'm willing to suspend my beliefs. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, I do not want to believe that the military team responsible for the recognition of such a zone would be incapable of repelling mutants. As a member of the United States Army, I can assure you that even if new recruits lack the eyes and experience of seasoned combat soldiers, these recruits would be integrated into a capable team. <br /> <br /> An armed team The soldiers are not about to be taken away by some mutants with knives. That's how it works. Squad movements, much higher firepower and, of course, radio support, would ensure nothing less than total victory. I'm not saying that you would not make victims, but as soon as the region is declared hostile, military training will take precedence, no one will go alone, even to go to the bathroom. <br /> <br /> And if it were discovered that the area was so infested with hostile that the squad was unable to handle the danger, they would call it by radio. And believe me, their radios would not be blocked. If there was a chance that normal radios would not do it, the team would have a military satellite phone. If they could not log in every hour, a search would be called. <br /> <br /> To accept this film, you must accept the fact that our soldiers are incompetent fools, with incompetent leaders and an incompetent chain of command. While it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and a compass, our military forces are filled with intelligent, well-trained and competent soldiers. Mutants with knives are well below our ability to treat. <br /> <br /> Since the film's execution is entirely dependent on the impossible to imagine, the film does not hold water. Instead, we should believe that our soldiers, sailors and airmen are unable to cope with the lowest threats. <br /> <br /> As a veteran, I find the film insulting.
