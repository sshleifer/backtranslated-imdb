This film was awful. I had a lot of trouble watching this all the way through. I did not understand the purpose of the film. What was the purpose of this film? The soundtrack was bad, playing was bad and the story was not interesting. The two main characters of the movie were very boring and their dialogue was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among the members of the cast. I do not know, but I suspect most of the actors were novices. The film could easily have been reduced to about an hour and a half without losing the plot. This indicates how many unnecessary scenes were in the movie. I would have rather had a root canal during the two hours of the film. I want those two hours back! If you want to watch a good, fun movie, designed by a family-friendly Mormon band, look instead at Napoleon Dynamite.
