This is one of those movies that makes you want to spend the time you've spent watching it, and then to some, like the time you spent accidentally taking it, the time you spent going to the video store etc. <br /> <br /> First of all, the look: it's granular, it's a small budget. This does not in itself make a bad movie. But the way the film was filmed gives an unnatural appearance to the action, which is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Next, the story. 3 girls go on a girls' weekend. Of course, just like EVERYONE doing it on a camping trip, they stop on the way to look for earrings. When they arrive in the area where they are going to stay, they are stopped by Mr. Ranger Sir, who reprimands them for throwing a lighted cigarette out of the car during the fire season, and then drives them where they go. (an isolated cabin). Of course, 2 "cute guys" walk in their neighborhood, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are immediately seduced, but apparently, Bambi is loving everything with two legs. Mady is rather disappointed by this development because she was eager to forget her ex posing as a weekend - and be stoned against her, with his girlfriends. <br /> <br /> Oh, I almost forgot, there's an old nasty hermit who lives this way, maybe he's someone you do not want to be confused with, and the area and the hut in which they stay have a kind of "reputation". <br /> <br /> Then of course, sooner or later (unfortunately MUCH later), some of our weekend visitors begin to die and find various traps (although some of them have been a little below) and, of course, the remaining campers are naturally upset. No cell phone reception of course (who would miss the chance to check his mobile phone for reception in a movie?). Mr. Ranger Mister does not stop appearing and his behavior seems a little strange, but he said he would get help. <br /> <br /> There is a fantastic twist to this that you just will not want to miss, if you're still awake. Pray for you to wake up on an empty screen. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the production values ​​are terrible, and the company as a whole is lame and I find it incredible that it has even been published. Avoid at all costs, 1 in 10.
