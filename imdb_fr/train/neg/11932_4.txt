Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me. My friend showed me this film because he had seen Gruner in what he called a very good sci-fi film, Nemesis. Looking at this, we quickly found ourselves in the dramatic roles of BS, just to see the incredible action sequences. Gruner likes to kick his legs. And kick! haha <br /> <br /> The character of Gruner is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one in which he grew up. He finds himself watching the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join. in the Mexican gang that continues to torment his family. Instead of joining him, Gruner asks the boy to defend himself (against a gang ... too crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character who kills everyone (or blames him enough) and strives to rid his block of these gang members. <br /> <br /> The plot was very old-fashioned and easy to imagine. Gruner is probably not very well known because of his scenario if this movie was compared to any possible choice. This ghetto is a hell and I enjoyed seeing the motley characters cross it as if they had a chance against the Gruner character. The music was typical of action music (pianos and timbales, swollen guitars), which was not as bad as I sounded. The director really needed to continue the action instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a moment of family tenderness. <br /> <br /> Finally, I gave him a 4/10 because it was really an average action movie for Oliver Gruner, but the film's overall mood leaves something to be clear about what you just saw.
