Really, it's a terrible movie cheater. Its duration of 70 minutes is very well padded with archive footage. The others are undescribed exteriors and dull interior scenes. The exhibition of the plot is very poorly rendered. These are just superficial scenes somehow related. There is no theater attempt in stage selection, but the theater is communicated by the intensity of the actors. Do not ask. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns a rocket emitting a heat of a million degrees in orbit around the Earth at about twenty kilometers that threatens to destroy the Earth. It is a real-time threat that must be diverted if a custom-made H bomb can be shaped and placed in an experimental rocket in less than an hour. There is nothing really here to report, except the foolish speech of a scientist against the project, because there could well be a life on board and think about the scientific possibilities, but this discourse of the idiotist Liberal rule was well beyond this time. <BR/> <br /> What saves this film, more or less singularly, is the short film. I've never seen a bigger choice of 50s fighter jets in another movie. This is not a complete list, but only a few of the planes I've seen. There is a brief interception by a pilot flying alternately an F-89 Scorpion and an F-86. The first to jam the interceptors is the Royal Canadian Air Force at Hawker Hunters and the F-86 Saber Jets (or CF-13s built in Canada) and even a pair of CF-100 Clunks. <br /> <br /> Then, for some reason, we see B-52, B-47 and even B36 take off. More padding. <br /> <br /> "These Canadian jet planes are moving at 1,200 miles an hour." I do not think so, because one of them seems to be a Gloster Meteor from the era of the Second World War, the rest of the F-80s. Meteors press on the attack and one of them turns into a late F-84F with a flock of F-84 beginners to the right wing attacking in formation. <br /> <br /> There is a strange version in tandem of the F-80 which does not have It seems that it is about a training of the type T-33, but rather of a variant of the all-weather interceptor with radar in the nose. These are blurred in a snowstorm. <br /> <br /> An angle bridge aircraft carrier is seen about 500 meters away. It launches F-8U Crusaders, F-11F Tigers, A-5 Vigilantes and A-3 Skywarriors. The Air Force blurs F-86s, F-84s and more than F-89s you've never seen in your life, as well as F-100 Super Sabers and F-102 Delta Daggers. <br /> <br /> The F-100s repel their attack with so much stuffing. The F-89s unload their rockets in their extreme tip pods gently. The F-86s are on fire, an F-102 blows a Falcon, even F-80s (F-94?) With rocket pods at half wing. There is a very strange shot of a last model F-84 (prototype?) With an old straight model F-85 above in turn, a commercial of the manufacturer (Republic Aviation) showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the F-84 ThunderJet. <br /> <br /> There are other great archival images from Ottawa in the past, when Canada's capital occupied a large space on the road and particularly beautiful images of The Times of New York. Square during one of the civil defense exercises in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think we also have to take into account the idea that this was filmed in Canada, with the possible exception of the automatic tracking later seen in the image, the Pacific seeming to be in the background. The use of a Jowett Jupiter is somewhat amazing and there is a very nice TR 3 to see too. Canada had to be cheap and it was used quite frequently in the background. <br /> <br /> When it comes to storytelling, there's nothing better to recommend than the mystery of what Ellen Parker is. pointing to the end of the image. And she is definitely spilling someone. Could it be, R as in Robert Loggia? The director who dies before the release of this film? His career was his last credit? <br /> <br /> It's as if the newspaper in which the gift was packed was more valuable than the gift.
