Leonard Maltin, who often trusts, says it's a "charming novel" and Sanders is "gorgeous". Maltin must have confused this film with something else. Sanders is snide and funny and gorgeous, as usual, ?? you can imagine her adulterous talk: "Sometimes the wedding chains are so heavy that they have to be worn by three", but dull, wooden and dated describe this movie with more precision. The story itself, an autobiography in which Sanders is a thief of jewels, François Eugène Vidocq, who becomes chief of the police but can not resist the attraction of the beautiful jewels, is quite amusing, but he has the same kind of a hollow historical treatment in Hollywood that tarnished epics such as * Marie-Antoinette *, and certainly the deplorable * Forever Amber * (who screams for an elegant remake). Although, in his defense, Sanders tries powerfully to add depth to his character, it is for nothing. I am a fan of Douglas Sirk, but we are in 1946 and this is one of Sirk's first American attempts, which lacks many signature touches that would define his flourishing and heartbreaking flakes of flowers. Sirk is just starting to get wet here and has shot countless films over the next ten years, until he reaches the gold with * Magnificent Obsession * and sets to work, bombarding us with a feast of estrogen like * All that heaven allows *, * Written on the wind *, and * imitation of life *. But * Scandal In Paris * is not his best job ?? a relatively low budget affair with cheese sets and ineffective costumes.
