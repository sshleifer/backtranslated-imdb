Where to start? <br /> <br /> # 1 Amitabh's son, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30 years old. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has been in prison for more than 33 years ... <br /> <br /> A) Telepathically transmitted sperm home? <br /> <br /> B) Ask a friendly Pakistani guard to send it to him? <br /> <br /> C) They allow conjugal visits to secret Pakistani prisons <br /> <br /> D) All the above answers <br /> <br /> E) The producers had a little too much heckling at <br /> <br /> when they approved the scenario? <br /> # 2) Amrita Rao (Yum!) wants Khanna - he's yum, yum, yum ... and apparently he wants her - who would not want to, no ?! ... but, when his father gets fired, and then killed (I hardly think it's a "spoiler" because you have to be blind to the brain and not see it happen in the movie), he is rather insensitive to this catastrophe and with the end (metaphorically) of his hat, leaves it behind to save his father, no matter his loss, and says (paraphrasing) "God willing, we shall meet again" ... In big, it means, "I'm going to get my dad, my work is done, sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye!" - callosities even exceeding Hollywood standards ... <br /> <br /> # 3) There are so many holes in this awful waste of time called movie, that you can drive all the jeeps, trucks and other great stuff. Pass - really, total time wasting - Oh! There is a beautiful dance sequence (yes, only one - as in the dance sequence - whatever their quality), an excellent belly dance - but it's not worth it. Just watch for that. <br /> <br /> Rent Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan ever take theater lessons?) for better films about Indo-Pak conflict ... In fact, Veer-Zaara is damn good - 7.5 / 8 I would say!
