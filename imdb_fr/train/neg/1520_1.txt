Why did I lose my time with this movie? There was not a single joke or funny line. The slapstick was not even a bit funny. I mean really, a suction pipe out of control? Why was the name of the National Lampoon associated with this film? Even the Christmas holidays were better than that (I actually thought the movie was a lot of fun). <br /> <br /> AVOID LIKE PLAW!
