I entered this film hoping, from the hype, that it would be insightful and edifying. Certainly something more than a cheap promotion for the group "Wilco". <br /> <br /> Instead, we complain a lot and we complain about the "process", a dishonorable and undoubtedly unilateral description of a member of the group. who was kicked out by the leading singer / songwriter of the prima donna, a heartbreaking confession of the friend of the fallen member - for about 18 years - claiming that "friendship had run its course", and this sneaky story and unconvincing the label "hurts their feelings" by dropping them, only so that the group can immediately receive 50 offers from other labels (oh, the tension ... not!) They tried their best to make believe that c was a tension, but I suspect everything was made of smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that did not exist. It does not even take into account the long periods when many of their most recent songs are jostled, without a script, a preview, or even a decent job in cinematography. Attempted attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable prospect of life made me sick to watch. <br /> <br /> According to the film, this band sounds like a bunch of little vile babies who search for a voice they do not understand and think they are a kind of guardians of the art of music, which they are absolutely not. And I thought the music was nil, and I could not even understand the lyrics because of the whispering style of the main singer. <br /> <br /> I give him a 2/10.
