Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, The Big Blue, Dogville) directed and interpreted this strange film which constitutes the second part of a kind of trilogy. I may be wrong, but I do not think this movie is part of the Dogma 95 manifesto, although it really looks like it. I'm not really sure what I think about this movie. All actors are good. They offer very good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is kind of interesting. But I do not know, there is something in the movie that I do not like. The sex scenes are way too long. It goes from an interesting piece of art to an erotic crap, I do not know exactly where it is. Of course, it's not a bad movie, but I will not suggest people to see it or tell them not to watch. Do as you like. If you feel curious and open-minded, try it, you might like it.
