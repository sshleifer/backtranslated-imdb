I agree with everything Calamine said! And I do not always agree with people, but what Calamine said is very true, it's time for girls to move on to better roles. I would love to see them succeed because they were a very inspiring couple and grow up and I would like to see them grow as people, actresses and in their careers as much as in their personal lives. So, producers, please give girls a chance to develop something that is a little different, move them in a new direction that recognizes them individually and their talent in many facets. This film is commented not so bad, but as I saw later in their films, their films are identical to those of the plot and typical typography. When In Rome is good for younger generation audiences, but adults who were kids when babies were babies want to follow the successes of twins. So I think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds, maybe they're like the sixth sense, the time, the chocolate, that kind of film - not to say to have serious movies for them, humorous movies also yes, but rather see them in different roles than they did in their latest movies like this one and the New York minute. (Note: I come from Australia, so forgive my strange spelling as if you recognize the s instead of z)
