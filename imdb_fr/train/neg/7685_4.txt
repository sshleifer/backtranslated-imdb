Confusing melodrama based on a story by William Gibson, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark leads the posh, upscale rural nervous asylum, where his wife unleashes the battle with self-proclaimed queen bee, Lillian Gish, and Widmark himself sees the wanderlust of newcomer Lauren Bacall, who is restoring her life after death her husband and child. Facetious and confused, located in an indiscriminate place and time and with a love story "David and Lisa" hidden in the stuffed mud. Widmark and Bacall have good chemistry together, but this script gives them no basis to build upon. For exactly one hour, most of the dialogues have the theme "What to do sheets hanging in the library" (this thread is not used for symbolic purposes, but rather as a thread that is not a mystery!) . The photo hopes to show people in conflict that disparate people meet when they do the same job and that everyone thinks their opinion is the right one, but unfortunately, Minnelli's twisted way of unveiling this stew is neither informative, nor uplifting. ** from ****
