A young genetics professor practicing basketball conducts research on the genetic sequence, using human fetuses. He hopes to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He lobbied to stop his research because he has not published yet. The university has a hard time justifying its funding (I think). <br /> <br /> He makes a test injection on a monkey, who dies quickly. He then tries himself. He begins a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy; She had demanded the results of the research. <br /> <br /> Initially, it seems that the injection has no effect, apart from a new force. He realizes then that he has had a memory loss and starts to remember what happened. In addition, he begins to look very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> Since the film is called metamorphosis, it ends up changing. You will not believe your eyes - neither what it has become nor the absolutely rotten costume that the actor wears to describe what he has become. Incredibly, there is another change in store - the end of the movie is really, really nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film has for us is that Laura Gemser is in it, but she has a very small part. <br /> <br /> Previously, I had already seen the video box with a sculpted plastic form glued to the lid of the box. Perhaps there were even electronic elements at once, perhaps eyes that light up (the eyes of the main character sometimes become green in the film). The copy I saw contained a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had retained the plastic, which had been removed. The novelty hide-and-seek, if it still had one, would have been the only reason I would have kept this movie; I get rid of it permanently.
