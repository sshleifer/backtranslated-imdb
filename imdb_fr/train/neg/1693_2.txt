My husband and I went to see this film, being the horror moviegoers we are. Two hours later, I found myself wanting to get my money back and my time. I was so disappointed. The teasers in this movie basically contained the best points of the movie. The film was nothing scary except good timing for surprise entries, etc. I found that most of the "scary" parts were more comical than anything. After watching other films based on the works of Japanese writers, I must conclude that what is considered scary in Japan is not scary here in the United States. My advice: if you're a fan of real horror movies, do not worry about going through this one. I can not really say that I would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rent to you.
