There is one good thing about this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! Sorry to be so direct but it's the truth. Too bad she did not do nudity. That would at least make this mess tolerable. We see the breasts of another girl but she is far from Lola. And man, Armand Assante is he old or what? The man looks like shit! "Consequence" is the usual B-Movie you expect. The story had potential. It's as if they had good ideas but did not know how to execute them. Cinematography is simply horrible. Ugly! The staging is uninspired and the end result is a bland thriller with twists and faded actors. Lola Gaudini is great as a vixen, but she does not even save "Consequence" garbage and not funny garbage, but stinking garbage.
