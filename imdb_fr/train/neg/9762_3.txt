Alan Alda plays "Sports Illustrated" writer George Plimpton, who has already been invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Rather wan, unconvincing drama curiously tempered with fantasy. Director Alex March is interestingly interested in this material by filming it almost documentary (with macho comments) while giving the story a touch of capricious fantasy; However, by bringing out the cinematic brilliance in this configuration, he turns the main narrative into a clutter. Alda's underhand and unattractive performance is another handicap, although the secondary cast is filled with real pro-athletes (and Lauren Hutton, Alda's girlfriend - how fantastic is that?) . * 1/2 of ****
