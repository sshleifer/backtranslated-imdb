A highly implausible, incredible and incoherent Spanish production about ... well, let me see how close I am to it. The film begins with a woman having a cat killed by a girl. She then begs her lover to take him somewhere on vacation. He calls to work and asks him to lose his vacation time and she says he will pay for it. The relevance of this statement is to let guess the end of the film, because this guy, swarthy photographer, sees a beautiful Patty Shepard, queen of Spanish horror films, taking her bikini top momentarily to take a picture, ask for lunch, then to his assignment to Witches Mountain - for reasons again, we never know. Before they leave, Patty has to stop at home, "strangely", singing echoes in our hero's ears. Again, this is never explained. The film continues with these two people who stop in an inn, go to the mountains and finally understand why this mountain is called Witches Mountain. You know, this film has several aspects that make it better than a bad movie. There is a certain atmosphere, some character actors are really good (especially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman), the main roles are at least adequate, and the highlight - although it makes absolutely no sense - is well choreographed (literally) with witches in white bras and long black hair. It makes no sense, and it's a huge detractor for me. I could watch the movie ten more times and I still did not know until after the first viewing. This is a major problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious film from the long line of inexpensive and atmospheric European horror films that have covered this decade. If you can draw more than me, you will have more power.
