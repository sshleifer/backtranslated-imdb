Looking at horror Euro, and especially the films made by the cult luminary Jess Franco, I realized that we should not expect a conspiracy that makes a lot of sense. However, Franco went too far with this film; and despite a surreal atmosphere and the reputation of the film as one of the best of the director, Succubus is unfortunately a really horrible film. I must admit that I saw the American cutaway version, which lasts about 76 minutes; but unless it's just the logic that has been cut, I'm sure the longer European version is just as boring. The plot has something to do with a marauding woman; practice S & M and talk about garbage, and it's really boring. There is no gore and the sex is dull, and most of the running time is occupied by a boring dialogue and despite the fact that it is a short film; I had a hard time going all the way. I must say that the places are beautiful and that Franco knew how to use his surreal atmosphere. but the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is undoubtedly a talented director who has directed some classic films - but it seems to be the one he won for his money, and overall I recommend skipping it to see some of the most interesting from the director.
