You can give a pass to JMS and the boys on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the movie is still under normal. Do not get me wrong, the B5 series is by far the best TV series of all time, but if I was a member of the executive who saw this movie, I would not have ordered the show. I do not like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are ridiculous and there are tons of clich√©s. The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately set the show on fire and the show was amazing. If you are a fan of B5 and have not seen this movie, watch it. If you are not a fan of B5, do not worry ... you will not want to watch the show.
