When I saw this movie, I did not believe my eyes. Where were these hilarious creatures, garbage muppets with big, pointed teeth, really scary? Or where they were designed to laugh well (I sincerely hope so). If you watch carefully, you can even see the channels using them (better, drag them on the screen). The whole thing was pretty funny and scary and I had a good time watching the movie because I was amazed by its general inability to have a single positive role. It's a big joke from start to finish and I think this movie belongs to a new category: So amazing you'll laugh from start to finish. (I will not even try to comment on the actor or all the other things)
