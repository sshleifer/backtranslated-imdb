Just because a person is under 10 does not mean they are stupid. If your child likes this movie, you'd better have it tested. I am always amazed how many people can be involved in something that goes wrong. This "film" is a showcase for digital magic AND NOTHING ELSE. The writing is horrible. I do not remember when I heard such a bad dialogue. The songs are more than miserable. The acting is mediocre, but the actors have not received much effort. Who decided to use Joey Fatone? He can not sing and he is ugly like a sin. <br /> <br /> The worst is the obvious. It's as if writers do their best to make it all as stupid as possible. Great kids movies are mean, smart and witty - movies like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and The Witches, to name just two of them. But in the continued weakening of Americans, more and more people are flocking as Finding Nemo (yes, that's right), the recent Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and huge rubbish like Red Riding Hood.
