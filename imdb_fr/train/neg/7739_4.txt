Do you remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest Hollywood star because he made good movies? These days make me think of a memory more and more distant. <br /> <br /> While "Hollywood Homicide" is nothing terrible, it is a banal and surprisingly boring routine movie. This is a comedy that is not particularly funny and an action movie that is not particularly exciting. An overabundance of subplots can not hide the weakest of the central plot. <br /> <br /> At least, Ford seems to have more fun than his latest projects and he is able to make the film most of the time. Hartnett agrees, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford when it comes to chemistry. <br /> <br /> In total, "Hollywood Homicide" is a fun diversion, but hardly. Take off Ford, and it's not even that.
