Ok, the promos promised a comedy and few people went to watch it. The first release of 2006 is not a bad thing, nor for the current year, because the first and the last films have almost all flop except GHAJINI and some others. /> <br /> OK to come to JAWANI DIWANI <br /> <br /> Summary in brief The film is about Emraan Hashmi doing his usual work sadly, it's annoying this time after rehearsals. He has an irritating Hrishita Bhatt and a flop Celina Jaitley <br /> <br /> Cringeworthy dialogues, comedy scenes, mishandled dramas and many loopholes <br /> <br /> The direction is bad Emraan Hashmi is boring here, but luckily he is becoming major, but after FOOTPATH ​​and MURDER and decent work in a few more films the actor took a back seat and the filmmakers focused on his kisses and his image of womanizer who unfortunately lost her touch after rehearsals Hrishita and Celina are bad Mahesh is horrible
