In the many films I saw Warren Oates, I came to a definite conclusion, here is a talented individual. I saw Mr. Oates for the first time in the 1960s television series Stoney Burke. From that moment, I followed his career closely and I thought he was destined for big roles. That's what happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah introduced it in a film entitled "Bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia". Of course, his biggest fame was his magnificent role in "The Wild Bunch". I always thought he was quite capable of bringing a certain kind of magic to a character, that is, until I see him on that flop. The film is called "Chandler", a tribute to the iron fists of the 1950s created by Raymond Chandler. Because, in the synopsis, it was a question of a hard nose, Private Eye, that interested me immediately. However, I sat patiently throughout the film and found it to be a boring, uninteresting, slow, twisted and confusing saga that, if it had a theme or plot, had to be left behind. in a dark room. Together and with some of the best Hollywood stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this film had enough power to reach Mach five. or. As a result, one of my favorite actors found himself stuck in a poorly built vehicle that never took off. **
