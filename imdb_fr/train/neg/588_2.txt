I am forced to write a review of this IMAX feature as a way to warn others to save money. Almost every episode of "The Human Animal" by Desmond Morris or "The Nature of Things" by David Suzuki could have surpassed the content presented. Not only does the director not manage to use the incredible stock of IMAX films from 65 to 70 mm and its gigantic presentation screen, but all that is on the screen is extremely impressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned above. Viewers discover a pregnant woman, Heather, her husband Buster, as well as their niece and nephew. We follow them for about forty minutes while they eat, sweat, listen to music, and so on. Although we have access to scenes from the human digestive system and learn about babies' natural diving reflexes, are we really getting to know most of the primary school graduates? Are we even distracted by the transatlantic Heather? Do we care? Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see an IMAX feature, I suggest the highly photographed "India: The Tiger's Kingdom" or the technically thrilling "3D Space Station". Believe me.
