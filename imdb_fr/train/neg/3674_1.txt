Note: I'm going to reveal a key part of the plot, but if you've looked at the DVD jacket or any other promotional material, you'll know it already. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have been written by an eleven year old who is not very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that the UN and the NSA seem to be leading the show in Hungary. Forget the fact that when these secret service agents master someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute, they do not wear protective gear (not even gloves). These are jokes in the context of this film. In the scientific world of this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity goes awry. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the characters in this movie do not behave (with a few exceptions) like human beings. Almost every time a character responds to something, it's inappropriate. The love story (of course, there is one) gives the impression that the soap opera texts look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can not believe we lost a free movie rental on this.
