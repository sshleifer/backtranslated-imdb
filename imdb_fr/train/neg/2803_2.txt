Given the limitations of this film (the entire film in a set - a music studio - about 5 or 6 actors in total), it should have been much better done. If you have these limitations when making a movie, how can the lighting be so bad? And the actors were awful, they spoke a little below the actor in Clerks, except that it was a nice film, without substance. Well, it's tried, but it really failed. <br /> <br /> He tried to be auto-referenced in some parts, but the replicas were misinterpreted by the actors. And the main character of Neal, what a pathetic loser. Clearly, 10 people in total made this "film" and they all knew each other. It was probably a real rock band, but unfortunately, these people have no idea of ​​the seriousness of the situation. It was done in 2005, but they all look so naïve that it smells of pre-grunge times. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I did not pay to see this (Starz on Demand book again!), but it was under the title "The Possessed" and not Studio 666, no matter what you do for the title, it can not help. It could have been a much better movie done - there is no excuse for this bad movie when you have the obvious limited parameters that filmmakers had when they did that, working within those boundaries, you should do the things that you can control and things you can work with the best you can. Instead, they thought that mediocrity would be enough. And this music video, wow it was bad, I got started quickly. <br /> <br /> So, 2/10 is right, if you're in b-movie shit, I guess you'll see that.
