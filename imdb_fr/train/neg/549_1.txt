I can not believe that the Indian film industry is still producing third-rate records such as Waqt. For starters, the scenario is totally implausible ?? his spoiled son is ejected from the family home to teach him autonomy. So, what is he doing? He quickly wins a national talent show by jumping stars in front of a jury (honestly, I'm not kidding here). Meanwhile, his father dies of lung cancer, but the secret guard for his son, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous, to see his new grandson and make a new giraffe with his own hands . <br /> <br /> The acting game is worthy of the name in its meaning? ?? none of the main actors in this film have attempted to act convincingly. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively unaffected by the concerns of the real world. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the main losers of these awful movies are the smart viewers. who made the mistake of seeing such a movie. Actors, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will always be revered as gods by those who have only blind faith in Bollywood.
