Not that I do not like children's movies, but it was a tearful one with few redeeming qualities. Mr.J. Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be incredibly funny, but not lucky in this movie. It is sugar-coated sugar and will not please people over 7 years. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek instead. 3/10
