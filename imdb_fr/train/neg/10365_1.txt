Terrible. This thriller should have been buried. What shit. Terrible writing, the characters are less than credible. Horrible Schlock !! Stick B stars in a terribly written outlet to try to give it some credit, but it fails miserably. If I did not have to write ten lines about this movie, I would have given him a word review, he starts with "sh" and ends with "it". <br /> <br /> End horrible, delayed. Who writes this shit. The end of this film is so artificial, weak, it's as if they did not know what to do with this story, or they ran out of money. Probably because of the number of cameos in this movie. It's a good thing that these actors are endangered because it would be a career killer. It's a good thing for them that hardly anyone sees it. At least nobody important, like future investors. It could have ended in a thousand different ways, but as things stand, I feel frustrated at my precious time. return.
