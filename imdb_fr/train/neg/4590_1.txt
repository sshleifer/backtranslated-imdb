Anyone who has studied physics or cognitive science will come out disgusted after 40 minutes, as my wife and I did. The ignorant masses could be distracted by the hand-free arguments and the absurd "conclusions" drawn (without even an attempt at logical reason) from a real science. I am offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of "science". I can only conclude that the authors took a book of quantum physics without understanding a single word, then watched The Matrix about a thousand times and then proceeded to write this film. <br /> <br /> For example, The Washington DC Crime Experiment was conducted by the Transcendental Meditation Program. A brief search will reveal the science of their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
