This series is interesting to watch as a MST3K feature, but for the current audience, that's it. I was really surprised to see that the year was manufactured in 1952. This alone makes it a solid (humble?) 2 item in my book. The used cars do not even look contemporary, they look like the ones from the '30s. It's basically Cody (the salvation of the lonely world? Sheesh speaks of an insult to everyone, like the army), Anyway, it's Cody in her nipple-stealing suit against Graber and Daley, two silly henchmen who carry handguns and an occasional pistol. pretty lame in its own right, enjoy. If you want to watch a very good movie like Flash Gordan, it's filled with attacking rockets, a good evil enemy and pretty women, it has NO of it. And Flash was created about 15 years before this shit so you could give it a little slack. Something made in 1952, that bad, deserves a 2. Nuff says. Give it a 6 if you look at it like an MST3K episode, these guys are having fun with that; a tweak of nipples here, a tweak there and I fly! And now, as a bonus, I bring you Commander Cody's song, as it was originally sung by Joel and his two character robots, Tom Servo and Crow, aboard the love satellite for the eighth episode from The Enemy Planet: <br /> <br /> (Singing at the very beginning of the credits); <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) YOUR CODY OF COMMANDER LOOKING ... IT IS THE NEW CHARACTER OF THE REPUBLIC, <br /> <br /> IT IS IN TROUBLE WEEK ... BUT IL IS SAVED BY EDITION, <br /> <br /> JUST A FEW OF ITS NIPPLES ... SENDS IT IN ITS MANNER, <br /> <br /> A HEAD OF POMPIN AND A PACK OF ROCKET .. .. WILL SAVE THE DAY, <br /> <br /> (JOEL SINGING) HIS LABRATORY IS A BOXING RING ... WHEN BAD PEOPLE COME FROM THE MIXTURE, <br /> <br /> SOMEONE ALWAYS IS ALWAYS REUSED. .. AND CODY MUST FIX IT, <br /> <br /> HE BOOKS HER TEA TO THE COFFEE D'AL ... AND MOLES ON SONS, <br /> <br /> IT BAT THE CROS AND THE FLIES WITH HOOKS ... AND TURNING OUT THE FOREST FIRES, <br /> <br /> (CROW SINGING) <br /> <br /> BAD MECS, LOOK AT ... THE CODY IS IT, <br /> > <br /> YOU WANT LIKE HIS HAIR HE IS IN HIS HELMUT ... AND BECAUSE WE CAN NOT THINK A GOOD RYME, <br /> <br /> IT'S THE END OF THE CANDY THE COMMANDER'S HEAD . So it's time to sit down with a granite testament, <br /> <br /> AND LOOK AT CHAPTER EIGHT, CAUSE IT'S THE PLANET OF THE ENEMY
