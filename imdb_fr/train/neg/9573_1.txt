Not quite off the wall in a good way, but totally stupid. "Killer Tongue" is a disturbing mix of science fiction, horror and supposed comedy. This is tantamount to a stupid and totally incoherent movie. There is very little dialogue, mainly because the script, if one exists, is complete. I would not even say it's strange, but rather as "total nonsense". This film is certain to disappoint and you have been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this, and if you do, the pungent smell will linger like a rotten fish .................... ...... ..................................... MERK
