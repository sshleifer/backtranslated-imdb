For those looking for a sequel to the finest South African miniseries of the 1980s, that's not it. Nor is it a historical drama. It's more of a dreary fantasy that has nothing to do with Shaka's history, but simply uses its name to give some cachet to Sinclair's silly story about an African superhero mingling Jesus, Lincoln , Superman and Nelson Mandela. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are moments of laughter, as when Shaka breaks the cross on which he is chained and kicks a serious butt. You know, as Jesus would have done if he had not been such a jerk. <br /> <br /> That's right, I only saw the 98-minute version, but I can not imagine that twice as much of this shit that would have been better. <br /> <br /> And what kind of name is Mungo ?!
