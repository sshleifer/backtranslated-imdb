I ordered the film in Korea because I was an extra and I wanted to see how it would have happened. <br /> <br /> After watching it, I can say that I am ashamed to have had a part of it. I feel embarrassed not only for myself, but for all those who participated in the making of this British mockery. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, the film is predictable, tedious, dull, monotonous and cringe to the point that, several times, I turned away from the screen, incredulous. Until you see the film, it's hard to see how romantic comedy can be unromantic and unconventional. <br /> <br /> It's not just a bad story, but a bad movie. In a scene, you can actually see a runner or assistant director show the S.A. when to erase. I will publish details about this in the "Goofs" section. <br /> <br /> However, it filled me with emotions (disappointment, rage, embarrassment ??).
