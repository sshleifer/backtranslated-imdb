This movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to commit suicide. I think this movie could cause serious brain damage. The main characters are Kevin, Amy, his impious conservative girlfriend, Kyle, a dork in red shorts who likes sex on the phone, Daphne, a skinny, horny girl, supposed to be "cool" and who does not care how dress up, and her boyfriend too sex, Nick, an army recruit capable of making innuendo from anything. No, I'm not a pervert, it's REALLY how the movie happens. The movie itself is a sex scam of the 1986 Gremlins, except you'll never find a trace of Gizmo anywhere. No, these Hobgoblins, triggered by Wimpy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), make someone's wildest dreams come true, then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed it. Finally, they find themselves in a striptease club, where the biggest dream of Amy, the nerdy, is revealed. She wants to be a stripper! Look, I watched this movie via MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot laughing at this wreckage of the cinematographic train and it made me bleed with both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had. I do not give you a plot anymore, because reliving it gives me that great desire to drive a fork into my brain. Moreover, it is not as if there is a plot that deserves to be mentioned. They should put a general warning of the surgeon on this film.
