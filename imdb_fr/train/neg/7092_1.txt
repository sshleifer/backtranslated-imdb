<br /> <br /> This film (and not a movie - clearly recorded on a cheap cam-stringer) is perhaps one of the biggest stinking movie bombs in history. Warning: the packaging announces the film as an erotic exploration of sex addiction. The movie does not explore anything and is no more erotic than watching one's own warts. The script is useless and sinuous, all elements of the plot serving as segways between supposed sex scenes. However, even the sex scenes are lame. Aside from the first, they last about three seconds (again, my version may have been cut) and ridiculously filled. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent movie, you do not want it. If you are looking for a titillating sex movie, you do not want it. Whatever the goals, desires or perspectives of your life, you do not want to watch this movie. How they got Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski and Ed Begly to act in this stink bomb is an extreme puzzle.
