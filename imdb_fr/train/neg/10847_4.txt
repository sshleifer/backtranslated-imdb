The director's version, the one I saw, was very long for this type of film. Almost two hours is way too long. If you have a choice, certainly opt for the non-director cut. <br /> <br /> The main plot is almost not repeated, the film is essentially made up of several scenes of murder, which are related but the feeling is that they are only shown to fill the film of violence splashing. The connection is only revealed when the last part and the lack of context annoyed me well before I went. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie, it does not work. You never get the feeling required for the characters because of a mediocre game and the general disposition (the character is presented, 15 minutes later, the character is dead). This strong side of the images lies in the splash part.
