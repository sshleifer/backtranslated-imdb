Basically, there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet and his parents are arguing all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than a soap opera ... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. <br /> <br /> OK, first of all, when you're going to make a movie, you have to decide whether it's a thriller or a drama! As a drama, the film is watchable. Parents divorce and argue as in real life. And then we have Jake with his cupboard that totally ruins the whole movie! I was expecting to see a film similar to BOOGEYMAN and instead, I watched a drama with meaningless thriller spots. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 just for the dialogues well played between parents and offspring. Regarding shooting with Jake: ignore them.
