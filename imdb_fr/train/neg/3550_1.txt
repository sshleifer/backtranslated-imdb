I'm leading a group to stop the exploitation of comedians and I've just spent the last two months listening to horror stories about comedians trying to audition for "Last Comic Standing". If they do not have a GOOD agent, they will not even have the chance to audition. Thus, more than 80% of the actors who appear are rejected before being able to show to anyone that they have talent! If they go to an audition, I'm told it's "predetermined" if they have a second chance. Viewers do NOT see the best comics in the United States. <br /> <br /> If the comics reach the show, most of them do not receive IMDb credits. I know because I made the credits for the 6 seasons of "Last Comic Standing" and I am not paid to do the job of producer. It's really a shame. A month ago, I asked Facebook "Last Comic Standing 7" why producers did not give IMDb credits and I was banned from their Facebook page !!! I am not a comedian, so I have no personal interest in that. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like to see someone being exploited and that's why I helped the actors. The actors are operated on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a BIG THREE network. The managers must be ashamed to authorize this exploitation. <br /> <br /> Watch this video of a comedian who has been victimized: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
