beyond the fact that fools exist and that there are religious fools. <br /> <br /> The characters basically do not make sense most of the time. <br /> <br /> The film has no beginning, middle or film The film begins with a young man, in the unlikely name of Hazel Motes, who apparently returns from a passage in the army. <br /> <br /> He goes to a two-storey house that is in a state of extreme disrepair, with recessed windows. He enters the house, walks around and finally writes a note that he gets out. This scene does not succeed and we do not learn about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> You never know exactly which house it is, or where people left, but it gives us the impression Noisette probably lived there at one time. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to town. Why - we do not know. Once in this city, he writes a name and address he sees on a wall in the bathroom, and goes to this woman, who is a surprisingly big prostitute. He sees her for a moment and then, apparently, he does not see her anymore. Like everything else in this movie, it is useless and useless. <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch is trying to make friends with him, but Hazel is not really interested, though they constantly cross each other. <Enoch is about as crazy as you can get. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimpanzees are and talk to them insultingly. <br /> <br /> You never really know why Enoch behaves as he behaves or why Hazel behaves as he does, beyond the fact that Hazel had a frightening overdose of ancient, fundamentalist religion by the intermediate of his grandfather. <br /> <br /> Enoch then becomes fascinated by a man wearing a gorilla costume and manages to take it. suit of him and then walk in it. <br /> <br /> Hazel, who is wrapped rather tight and who seems to be in a rage at the constant limit is doing some street preaching. I had the impression that he was trying to free himself from the lies of the religion that had been instilled in him. <br /> <br /> He has had several meetings with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions never really make a difference. Point, and there is no plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, Hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins to hurt herself. <br /> <br /> It's a very strange film. Interesting about his curiosity, but other than that, he has absolutely nothing against it. <br /> <br /> The distribution does a remarkable job, but this film completely fails to provide a point of view or scenario. <Br/> <br /> The movie also contains characters that occasionally turn around the word N with no connection to the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
