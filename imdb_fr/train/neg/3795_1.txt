I really wanted to like this show. Really, honestly. <br /> <br /> For the first time, homosexual viewers have their own version of the movie "The single". With the help of his obligatory "wizard", Andra, James, a well-off handsome thirty-something has the chance to love himself with 15 suitors (or "companions" as they are called in the show). The only problem is that half of them are straight and James does not know it. If James chooses a homosexual, he embarks on a trip to New Zealand. If he chooses a heterosexual, a heterosexual earns $ 25,000. How can this not be fun ?! Take my hand, let me wander: <br /> <br /> The most glaring problem of this show is the bachelor himself. James is your typical and successful young gay man, with a beautiful smile and a beautiful body, the one to which you would probably want to take a look at your local bar before letting yourself go to greener pasture. Why they chose to embody James as the ruler is beyond me. God knows, there are so many other warmer and more lively homosexual men who are dying to be on television. <br /> <br /> In addition to his rather average physical appearance, James is as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. Even so, he has this arrogant and condescending aura with condescension. However, if James stood against a white and white wall, he would blend in perfectly. Honestly, I do not remember one interesting or remarkable thing that James said during the series. It is THAT boring and forgettable. In fact, one of the comrades told him that he did not feel connected. I thought it was the best part of the show. In addition, James speaks with extremely annoying finesse. You speak feminine or masculine, but do not use transition tones in the middle of sentences ... so painful to pass through. I hated him so much throughout the show that I kept thinking, "Please, pick a straight guy and humiliate yourself and humiliate yourself with your dog with an unhappy look" <br /> <br> /> Then we have the suitors. A remarkably bland band of men who do not seem to care about what's going on. Just as tasteless, they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to another except: "Hey, this guy has blond highlights or curly hair" Again, surprisingly ineffective casting decisions seem to be the focus of this show . Although it may be used to type casting roles, it would have been much more fun to watch than these amorphous drones. However, in all their banality, they still manage to eclipse James (which is not so difficult to do anyway), slightly. You know you have a problem when some of the contenders are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man. And the fact that pretenders seem to have more fun around EVERYONE than with the leading man? Very sad. <br /> <br /> In addition, I just thought that something identified on the bulletin boards really seemed to me true: straight men are all hotter than gay men. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm not saying that all gay guys are ugly and boring, in fact, I found them very cute. It's just that all in all, it's BLAH compared to the men you'll see in shows like A Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or The Bachelorette. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I hit early. during this show. I can accept a main character as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept the banal and apathetic suitors, but PLEASE, for God's sake, entertain me a little. No chance. <br /> <br /> If you expect dramas, intrigues, sexual sensations or strong emotions, you will be severely disappointed. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the contenders can still have a boyfriend in New York (what a scandal!). As exciting as it may be, I guarantee you that this is the ONLY thing that resembles by far any conflict on this show. I can easily discern who's who (it was not difficult at all, I was wrong only once.) This show accumulates so much of his chips that he can not deliver anywhere else. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing James & Co's observation of these exciting activities such as learning western dance, shopping for gifts, visiting a petting zoo and gay karaoke. YAWNING. Of course, you have occasional topless dancing, but no matter when everyone is boring anyway. This is one of the main problems in the series: NO ONE seems to be having fun - she is looking at the motion trying to give the impression of having a good time. And you really can not blame them, because the events are all incredibly devoid of imagination and lame. <br /> <br /> Finally, the physical aspect is not there. There are no hugs, no hugs, no kisses (!), No attraction of any kind. It's just "Ok, it was a boring appointment, I'm going back to my ugly, ugly and unpleasant Sydney Operahouse (a little kiss on the lips), CYA." This series is so ridiculous that it's ridiculous. I can understand that they do not want to play the perceived indiscretional nature of homosexual men, but let's move on to something else. People who watch reality TV shows will want more than quiet hugs and short kisses. This show refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> Sorry if it was long, but I felt that these were problems that needed to be addressed. I congratulate Bravo for having first presented a show of this nature, but the incredible incompetence with which this show has been treated is astounding. To sum up my three points: Boring + Boring + Boring = going to do something else. You will have more fun waiting at the doctor for an appointment, at least they have interesting magazines there.
