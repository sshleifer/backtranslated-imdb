As has been said many times, "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is NOT a remake of the sequel (usually ignored) of Wes Craven's 1977 version, published in the mid-80s. But wishing to give this Following postmodern Diminishing Returns, Craven himself (a double threat alongside his son, Jonathan) decided to shoot a film of the same quality - in plain English, HORRIBLE. The former music video director, Martin Weisz, takes the reins of Alexandre Aja and is clearly outdated. One wonders however how someone could have created a movie to watch from Cravens' Screenwrit 101's writing. Not only the characters (in this case, a bunch of National Guard kids sent to investigate the tumultuous hills of the original remake) are completely odious and prone to really boring genre traps (played without irony). ), but they constantly make jokes that are not funny. Having found their total incompetence during a training exercise, their fate against repulsive and stray cannibals is painfully obvious. Only this time - as in the original sequel to the 80s - the script is so simplistic (barely existing, in fact) that any potential subtext is abandoned in favor of rising repulsive shocks (we are entitled to a -Murder delivery combo at the opening credits, plus a free rape for those who did not eject the DVD mid-way!). Even the mutants of this release are monsters with no personality or memorable status. The makeup artist FX, who seems sticky and chewy, seems like the rest of the movie, trying to hide his face from embarrassment. I really groaned at the "surprise" at the end of Aja's excellent movie, and the producers literally went bankrupt at the end of "Hills 2", setting the stage - preparing VERY sluggishly for the stage - for a third installment ... However, Cravens and Weisz have created a film that is such a cynical bastardization of what made the 1977/2006 versions so popular that it would be difficult for them to find an audience after this insulting slap.
