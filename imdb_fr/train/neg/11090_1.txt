This film seems to have been made for television. For years, I have been waiting for a movie to be shot on Rubin Carter, because I loved to see boxer at old MSG, and to see this movie was very disappointing. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Washington, but he was awful and boring. There is really nothing good to say about this movie except that I liked the song.
