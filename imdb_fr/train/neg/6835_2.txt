I do not see how those who like even Van Damne could like this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie really begins with some promise. I would say that the action scenes at the beginning of the film are excellent. The action scenes with the family division trying to save the twins are a good start and a good introduction to the main story. However, the movie is all the way down the hill. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice if the director had kept the basic principle. That is to say, the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus acquire different skills. A brother is supposed to be qualified in the martial arts, but the other brother is supposed to be qualified in the firearms. As it is convenient when the time comes that the brother who has never picked up a firearm before suddenly is a great sniper and the brother who has not learned the martial arts is suddenly making the big gap. <br /> The plot, the action, etc. are simply ridiculous. My favorite scenes? Why not when Van Damne confronts an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of aiming and firing at Van Damne, he uttered a war cry as if he was wielding an ax and was running towards him. Van Damne then takes the pistol of a fallen soldier and shoots at him, ... while he is still about 50 meters away. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Yeung is a qualified martial artist. However, instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo throws barrels to Van Damne as Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating film that had so many promises. If you're a fan of Van Damne, save time and watch Hard Target or one of his previous films.
