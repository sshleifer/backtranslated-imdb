I am generally more willing than others to be open about Roma communications, but it was just not a very good attempt. It has nothing to do with comparisons with the British original - I have not seen, and doubt me. This has a lot to do with a sinuous plot, lack of chemistry between the main actors and a zany performance / character from his supposed main character (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon shows up on the screen dressed in his clothes and hairstyle for a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that. As you can see, he is supposed to be a teacher and, of course, it is well known that school districts around the world like to hire less mature people than the children they claim to teach. The character is so disturbed and irrational that I wonder if an actor could have made him lovable, but some reliable old characters such as John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to try it. Not Fallon, who is neither funny nor actor, but who seems to think he is both. Not once in the course of the film, do you not believe that Fallon is in his role or do you not believe that these two people should be reunited? Towards the end of the film, there's a scene where Barrymore (who was cute as usual but could not win alone - it's hard to have a one-man romance) tells Fallon that it's over, that too much has happened and that it's moving on. And instead of feeling bad about the scene, or making excuses for Fallon, you're actively encouraging her - well, she's doing what she should have done months ago. But of course, the mechanics of the plot will not allow that to be the end of it (an end that could have actually made a statement in this mess), and we instead see the daughter of the rational career throw all this in pursuit of this childish idiot and encourages his illusions. Of course, that meant being slimy and satisfying, but it made me more disgusted than anything else.
