Che's charisma and appearance have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation spread by leftist propaganda (such as this film) about him. <br /> <br /> I do not know what is worse: to be captured by one of Che's assassination brigades or to sit for 4 hours in this typical Soderberghian trash. The question is not why this animal project was created, but what took them so long. By "them", I refer of course to the left of Hollywood and its love "secret" of the Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... to you to choose). I am fascinated by the fact that it took decades for one of Tinseltown's less talented liberal directors to finally engage in such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand same? It's a mystery. All these over-rated "artists" have often engaged in similar and politically unilateral projects. Yet Che Guevara, who is arguably the most popular and well-known Communist, has not yet been a film subject for them. > <br /> "Guerrilla" has all the characteristics of an American story on an epic scale; There are as many factual details here as in other political biographies of big budget fairy tales such as "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi", that is to say almost none. The film stars Del Toro as the famous Argentine revolutionary. Nevertheless, controversial and criminal as this man's actions may be, one thing no one could take away from him is a clever manipulator from a wealthy family. That's why Del Toro is only visually additive. Del Toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and may look like Guevara physically, but he does not release any intellectual quality, which makes him seem too primitive. Mediocrities such as Bratt, Philips and Franka Incompetente only underscore the director's lack of discernment. <br /> <br /> The film is mostly extremely slow (unsurprisingly) and visually uninteresting. Even a director as brilliant as Kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a film exceeding 3 hours. So it is quite telling that Soderbergh, who only made one or two solid films and at the beginning of his career, thinks that his oceanic grandeur was up to the task. If you think the length of the film indicates that a significant part of Che's life has been shown here - think about it again. Soderbergh focuses on the last phase of Che and much of the film is a tedious absurdity in the jungle, full of Guevara's so-called idealism. (Psychopaths have no ideal.) I wonder what kind of mind this highly esteemed director really has to choose to ignore some of Che's past lives. Did he really consider it too uninteresting? A massacre of 600 people is of no interest to the spectator, eh? Unbelievable. Some directors far better than this charlatan too praised could easily have inserted not one but two complete biographies in a film of 4 hours. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh, in a sense, becomes an accomplice in never tackling the negative, dark side - which is more than 90% - of Guevara. By spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy, knowingly ignoring the ugly truth (God forbid that he should tarnish the holy image of Che), Soderbergh is not a humanist - a false image to which most of the personalities of the Hollywood music and pop struggle very hard all their career defend - but the opposite: he cares only ideas, never people on whom these ideas are tested (as on guinea pigs). Soderbergh and his ilk are elitists of the worst kind; these people often have latent contempt for the "proletariat" (what a stupid term) with which they seem to place themselves. <br /> <br /> Half of the students around the world wear Che's image on their red and orange shirts, but never know why. He has become an emblematic figure for the distraught, uninformed young people who often think that having the face of this man on the chest makes them look "upset", intellectual, trendy or interesting. In reality, wearing a Che T-shirt only underscores the lack of depth and total disinterest for self-education. (YOU would not want to know more about a person before you start advertising his face to the world?) Carrying Che's clich√© picture now has become as common as having a Bart Simpson coffee mug. All these "bearers" probably know more about Marge's blue hair than about Fidel Castro's dead ally. <br /> <br /> After all that has been done in the name of Marx, one would think that these "ideals" of half-breeds would finally be put to rest. It seems that humanity will never learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, the iron curtain, one hundred million dead, more than a billion in physical and / or mental ruins through this system ... then, nothing that, huh? <br /> <br /> The fact that Del Toro won a Cannes Award should only surprise those who do not understand how Cannes and the other European festivals work - and vote. Tip: Sean Penn presided over a jury not so long ago. <br /> <br /> For my speeches on music, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
