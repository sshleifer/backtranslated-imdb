I do not believe all the praise for this film. The play and the movie were a Sleuth scam. Michael Caine wants him to be Olivier and Reeves wants him to be Caine. Caine even had the nerve to remake Sleuth with Jude Law playing his original role. Jude Law? You mean the one who made the remake of "Alfie"? <br /> <br /> This film was shot at a time in Caine's career, where it was obvious that he had to pay off his gambling debts. He would do anything for money. He would play in such award-winning films such as this one and "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure". What seems to be the praise of this film is the death of Reeves. He deserves better than to remember this ugly film. And Caine too. This film can be found in the trash $ 5.97 at Walmart. With gems like "The Island" and "Blame it on Rio".
