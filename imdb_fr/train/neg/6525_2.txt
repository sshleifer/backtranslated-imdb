I gave a 2 to this film, and although I consider myself a fan of science fiction, I found this film very difficult to take seriously. It was on AMC late one night and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie is probably good for some laughs, but not much more. <br /> <br /> The special effects are pretty much average for the period - not horrible, but not great either. Of course, we know more about Mars now than at the time, but we really can not stick to this film. The main reason I did not like this movie is because of the story. <br /> <br /> The exploration of several parts of this film would have been a little more detailed - the injury of the astronaut, the city on Mars, the creature in the lake, etc. Overall, the film is very much like a long episode of the 1960s version of The Outer Limits - complete with a fine cheese.
