(r # 97) <br /> <br /> There is a good thing about this poor man's Pokémon (do what you want): the opening theme. It must be the coolest theme music of any Japanese consumer TV show, oops, I mean young fans. Unfortunately, it was necessary to add some kind of show after the opening theme. And they just could not find anything more interesting than people who were arguing loudly about which cards are better than the cards of others. Freud would have a day in the field, I can not imagine why a child would want to attend a show where the dialogues written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes represent 98% of the duration of the film. <br /> <br /> "My Uber-Fantastical Doomsday creature of Ultimate Doom will take your lean pyramid diamond animal in one shot! Do not you see that you have no chance of winning this battle, fool HAHAHAHHAHHAHA! " <br /> <br /> "Oh yeah, look at this, I'm about to use my Delta Times pie chart of Destruction Force that eradicates each of your Power Munchers and makes your Uber-Fantastical Doomsday creature ultimate Destiny destroyed beyond all meaning Useless attack! I bet you have not seen it coming! "<br /> <br /> Seriously, that's all they did on this show , speak. While in another shabby kids show I was watching, namely the Pokémon commercial phenomenon (the bane of every football mom), at least the monsters had the courtesy to fight from time to time, "Yu-Gi Oh "is just, in the quiet words of Roger Ebert's A Clockwork Orange," talkative and boring ". Not to mention the long breath (I realize that I am hypocritical considering the sentence I just wrote). <br /> <br /> This show goes on forever. I do not know if there is a plot, and the static monsters do not have the character of Pokemon. Even when I'm not compared to my favorite cartoon in my childhood, this show sucks. It's unintentionally funny, but not funny enough to be worthy of being seen. Goodbye, sleep well, have wet dreams.
