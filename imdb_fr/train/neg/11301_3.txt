Nothing will ruin a film as much as the combination of a mediocre scenario and direction. This is the case of "The tomb of the mummy". <br /> <br /> The script consists of the ideas left by older and better horror movies such as "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". The direction is banal and bland. The acting is mediocre. Even Chaney's Kharis is weak compared to Tom Tyler in "The Mummy's Hand", and the producers are stupid enough to add Christy Cabanne's movie, which is much better, and point out the weakness of their own movie! <br /> <br /> Universal realized how bad this film was and redid it from scratch two years later by turning it into "The Phantom of the Mummy" with a much better screenplay and a better director. The result was probably the best film in their "Mom" cycle, though far from being as good as Karl Freund's 1932 original. <br /> <br /> The Cabanne sequence elevates this film to three. is a 2 at best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably happy to see their characters disappeared so they do not have to look like crazy anymore!
