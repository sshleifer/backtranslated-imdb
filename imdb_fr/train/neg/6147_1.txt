I really do not get all the adulation this film has received. It is a mafia act, which unnecessarily manipulates and eliminates many of the big problems - namely Nash's business and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. That, I guess, in the context of a Hollywood commercial movie is pretty much tolerable, but what about all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to get along, clutching his briefcase and wearing a dirty hat, which seems to be called a good actor? Anyone who has ever known someone with mental health problems will realize that Crowe's performance is not far from caricature. It's also rather offensive. And, dare I say, just right to be really terrible
