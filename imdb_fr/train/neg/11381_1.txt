Now, I like sci-fi cartoons. However, when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada at the end of 2006, I watched first and I was inevitably dismayed. The characters are generic and stereotyped (do they really need to get an African-American to wear tiger striped clothes and speak with a jamacian accent?) Why are all the Asian characters bright yellow and squinting? Does the mother MUST have big thighs and chest and constantly complain?) To the point that things become unrealistic, predictable, gross and sometimes disturbing. There are great similarities with Astro Boy, even with stab wounds. Let me explain (names of duplicates for young people): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay, and so after. Short similarities to "My teenage robot life", "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Kamen Cavaliers", "Sailor Moon" and others. are on foot. Not to mention the abundance of racial / gender stereotypes. Do not even get me started on innuendo. I will just say that they are hidden and quite dirty. But seriously. Do not even try to look at this. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
