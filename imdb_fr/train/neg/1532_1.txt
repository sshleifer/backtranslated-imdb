Although correctly warned, I sat down to watch this movie. Partly because I usually give each movie an equal pause and because I thought only one movie could not be so bad. I was wrong. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could stop this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. I only laugh once during this parody of humor abandoned by a parody. Namely during the scene of Simon says. Other jokes are either poorly executed or simply ridiculous. And some of them that you actually see happen miles away. This film just does not have what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III) or Scary Movie. They had all A. funny gags, B. a good dialogue and the most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Men In White has D. none of these answers. To say that this film is bad would be a euphemism. AVOID THIS FILM IN ANY WAY YOU CAN! Consider yourself warned!
