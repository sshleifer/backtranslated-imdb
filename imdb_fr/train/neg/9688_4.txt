Greenaway's films are intelligent, scholarly and innovative. However, his style and his grammar are at the origin of the films made during the First World War: the composition of the frame, the use of the average plane, the static camera. It may be good to rub in mainstream movies with this style but it's not new. Perhaps like this other "innovator", TS Eliot, he is inspired more by the past than by a genuine innovative future. <br /> <br /> Yet, the biggest flaw in Greenaway is not knowing how to write. Its structure of dialogue and even intrigue is mechanical and logical, but without the vitality of another dramatic logician, Brecht. The most obvious weakness is in his humor, logic and logic, so the joke is dead before being delivered. The result is tedious: if it's not funny, it's a failure: ask a humorist to justify his act if the public does not respond. Perhaps the informed director could learn something from Freud about humor. <br /> <br /> Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work as clones. They speak the lines with a bored and sufficient air like narcissistic teenagers. <br /> <br /> This film, despite its design and lighting, is full of fantasy.
