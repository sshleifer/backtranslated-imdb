"A Gentleman's Game" uses the game of golf in a country club to illustrate a teenager's discovery of honesty, prejudices and other lessons of life. Many times I thought I knew where this movie was going to go, but I was wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that the filmmakers never knew where he was heading. The defining moment of this film is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise mocks "The Karate Kid" and refutes any idea that he will become a mentor to the teenager golfer. In a way, it is refreshing that this film refuses to follow most of the simplistic and overworked formulas of the film. However, too much is still considered artificial. On a hat-trick, people give up any claim of civility or fail to defend their beliefs, or are exposed for something much less respectable than their place in society supposes. Unfortunately, there is often no resolution at these times. And aside from the fact that the club serves as their backdrop, there is no continuity or connection between them. It is unfortunate that the writers and the director can not save a better film, especially considering the number of talented actors and the potential of the staging.
