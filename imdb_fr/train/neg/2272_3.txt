I'm not a regular Springer viewer, but I watch his show in the blink of an eye and I think the show is a pleasant guilty pleasure and a good way to waste time. So, naturally, I will watch this film hoping to see "Jerry Springer uncensored". First, Jerry appears in about twenty minutes of the movie's duration. The other hour and twenty minutes are devoted to the construction of this pseudo-stuffing on the blooper, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot like HELLLL) is a sled dog sleeping with her stepfather (Michael Dudikoff, a chain-smoking chain-smoker who eventually evades her character action). The mother learns the existence of this case, they argue, they want to go to the show "Jerry" (that's right, no Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take him to the show "Jerry". The characters collide. Blah, blah, damned blah! The trash has rarely been this BORRRINGG !!!! I wondered why the devil Springer had millions of fans, but none of them had seen his movie yet. Well, now it's TOTALLY obvious !! Whether you like it or hate it, you'll hate this movie! How can I explain? This is the total mess of a movie (if that's how you call it). It is so badly edited, with scenes that simply do not connect, and after a while, the plot virtually disappears and just on the map! Imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce. With laughs rarely. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is a hot girl girl scene. It's as risky as possible. Do not get me wrong, the scene is quite daring, but if you watch the movie as a whole, compare it to Springer's program - this disastrous farce seems extremely disinfected. <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)
