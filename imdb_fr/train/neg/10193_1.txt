With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all the power of the film while stating clearly in the film that his work is "objectivity". Obviously, it is not. For a reason, many scenes "drawn by pure chance" are obvious (when this poor goat accidentally falls off the cliff, you can actually see the smoking gun on the right side of the screen!). On the other hand, he concealed important information: the Hurdes were what they were for a specific reason mentioned in the film. That is, goiter, a disease caused by lack of iodine (salt). This goitre is the cause of their cretinism and if Bunuel had only taken the time to do his research (heck, if he had ticked "cretinism" in a medical dictionary, he would have found the word "goiter"), he could have finished to tell the truth about these people (again, doubtfully). Instead, with his film, he constantly judges them, talking about "morons", dramatizing the action, staging scenes to create the show, all this is unacceptable to a documentary filmmaker who claims to work for the cinema. all objectivity. Bunuel speaks all the time in this film, not leaving a word to the people he films. He speaks FOR them and, even then, the JUDGES. This piece is flawed for its roots, for its ideology and it's a shame that it is considered an excellent film.
