I will start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really liked the songs, everything was great, the costumes, the music, the lyrics (as long as the translation was good :)), the choreography, everything. <br /> <br /> I liked the crab scene and the kitchen scene. <br /> <br /> But that's about it. <br /> <br /> I understood, the arty cinema, blah, but too much is too much. Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of listening and moaning from time to time, really ...), too much trouble (no movie should be boring, as deep as it is! ), too many pornographic scenes (I really understand, I realize they were shooting a porn movie, but really, really, it's too much). I really think that cinema should be for watching and this one is certainly not visible under any circumstances. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for the songs.
