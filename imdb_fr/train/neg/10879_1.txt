Blade, lame, lame !!! A grimace of 90 minutes too long. An atmospheric setting and possibilities (an abandoned convent) are spoiled by the tiny content of a scenario filled with awkward, witty dialogues that weigh so heavily. It is especially embarrassing, and the horror attempts of the gonzo fall flat (a sample of the dialogue of this film: after showing his artillery, a quick shot was fired at a close-up of Barbeau's self-defense character - she: "questions?" hyuck hyuck hyuck). Bad acting comedies, fools, homophobes and judging by the effects of creature, it seems that the director has too often watched "The Evil Dead". <br /> <br /> I owe a lot to my friends for renting this turkey and submitting them to lost ninety minutes they will never find. What shit.
