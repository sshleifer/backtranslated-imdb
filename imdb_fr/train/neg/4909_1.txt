That's right, you heard me. I am a big fan of James Patterson. I own 10 of his books and read the whole series on Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the screenwriter should be shot. <br /> <br /> By what right has a director been able to shoot down a fantastic work of fiction and make a parody of the mystery genre? If I had already thought that Harry Potter had been slain, then Michael O'Hara proved me wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next writer who attacks this fabulous book makes it much more accurate. To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: do not quit your daily work.
