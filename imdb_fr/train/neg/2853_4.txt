Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a gang leader, leaving a psychiatric institution to return to his gangster world. How can a director have a cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very beautiful), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and such an important loss of time? This film is a comedy not funny, having a constellation in the cast. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Prazer em Matar-te!" ('The pleasure of killing you!') <br /> <br />
