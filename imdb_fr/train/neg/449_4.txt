I admit that I only watched a handful of episodes, but each seemed completely different from each other. It seems that after the first season, the producers have decided to completely reorganize the series, to remove characters, to introduce new ones and to rewrite all the dynamics of the series. <br /> <br /> As you have probably already guessed, the series has a quirky character. Holly (Amanda Bynes), an unpredictable teenager, moves to New York with her well-rounded sister, Valerie (Jennie Garth). Pretty decent premise: odd couple + fish out of the water + strong jinx. <br /> <br /> Although the sitcoms of yesteryear miss me, this show unfortunately misses to score several times, and it is sad because they have a decent talent. <br /> <br /> In addition to everything, they insisted on a change of show (Val lived with a regular distribution one season, then it suddenly disappeared, so she opened a bakery? what?) when things change drastically, we feel that even the * show * knows it's bad. I mean, completely new sets, striped characters and new regulars! <br /> <br /> By the way (it's just a grimace), I know it's a TV show and not at all real, but Val and Holly end up living in a huge duplex loft (there has stairs) with a terrace ... in MANHATTAN! Are you serious!?
