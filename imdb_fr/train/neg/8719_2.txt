Well, here's another industry B movie. It's pretty sad to see bad movies, but I do not care if an industry B or C industry produces the film. Show an effort in your work. The characters are really bad. The acting is not involved in this one (surprise), but the plot is. How can a united squad witness the killing of two of their fellow soldiers, then continue as if nothing had happened. What makes me sick is the way the writer even threw the other members a scene where they joked about the beauty of the doctor's ass. Leave me alone.
