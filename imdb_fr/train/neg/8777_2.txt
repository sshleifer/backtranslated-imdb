Okay, I had a hard time putting aside the fact that by selling EVP for real, the movie was lying to me from the beginning. I thought I did not believe in vampires, but I still loved Dracula so I could live with it. <br /> <br /> However, even accepted, the film is just not very good. He is done and acted with skill, but he does not capture you at all. There are several moments of "jumping", and I just looked at them and I thought "yeah, I did not expect that" without really jumping in the least. <br /> <br /> The resolution does not make sense either. If the force behind this is able to do what it seems to be, then why on earth does it need to use a proxy? Moreover, the end legend was absurd. They have obviously put that in the framework of "giving the film credibility by saying that everything is real", but for this to work, it really has to be at the beginning. But they can not say it at first because they then give up the plot ... sticking it at the end makes it stand out like a sore thumb.
