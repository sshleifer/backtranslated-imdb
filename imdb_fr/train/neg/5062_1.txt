This film is weird. Better, it's "weird". I could give you a summary of the plot or an analysis of the hotter, but I would consider it a waste of time. All that everyone needs to know about this film are two young sisters, an incestuous relationship, a homicide, a post-mortem mutilation and another that really bothers. At the end of the film, you feel obliged to go take a shower to get rid of it, but not in the right direction, like after "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It's as if you were a teenager (or a high school student being I'm still a teenager) and you just did something that you: A: wish you did not, and B: hopefully Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never know. And nobody likes that. My advice is that rather than defiling your mind and looking at a piece of free cinematic dirt, just waste your time on something less horrible and look at "Kazaam" (yes, I'd rather look at "Kazaam" rather than "Murderous Maids" ", read in what you want).
