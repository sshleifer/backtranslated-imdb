This movie was aired the other day and I did not like it at all. The first George of the jungle was a good comedy, but the rest ... completely horrible. The new actor and actress to play the main roles was not good at all, they should have had the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original actress (I forgot his name) for this movie to get the ranking 0 out of 10 movie you can sit and watch and enjoy is a movie that you turn on another channel or you bring back to the shop if it is hired or bought. It was good to see Ape the monkey back, but it was not as fun as the first, they should have had the new George as George's son, and still have Bredon and (what a face she has in the movie) I was a little better then.
