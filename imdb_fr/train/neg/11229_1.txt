They made me watch that at school and it was terrible. The film is obsolete. The episodes become confusing because the facts are combined with fiction to make the story more interesting. The teachers talked about it as a treat, but it was really a painfully boring experience. from them, they do what they do in the movie in real life. This explains the act of cheese. In addition, very often, the story becomes slightly scandalous and far-fetched. I do not like the way some of the lines have been written and want them to make more sense to them. Although it is written to be educational, funny, suspenseful and trendy, it ended up being boring, dry, far-fetched and old. I hope nobody takes the time to watch this movie because you'd be good not to see it.
