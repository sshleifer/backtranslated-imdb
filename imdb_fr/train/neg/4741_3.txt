Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good plot, but is marred by nerdy details throughout the movie. I am a younger teenager and did not like this movie. I thought the effects were horrible, but they might seem fun for the youngest kids. The movements of the matrix ruined the action, you know it was absolutely wrong. Then there was the Yen Lo, an evil spirit that temporarily possesses random people and returns to the country in which Wendy was striving to win. Everything ends up as a typical good film when Wendy and her Buddhist monk cousin Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy it forever) in the end. So Wendy learns a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I am ready for the next DCOM.
