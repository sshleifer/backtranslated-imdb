As a fan of Billy Bob Thornton and the diversity of his skills, I noticed that this movie was listed and I was surprised not to have heard about it. <br /> <br /> I had traveled more than usual during the two it was filmed in 2000 and more than two and a half years after its release in theaters (the passage of time is the first clue, all did not go well in production). <br /> <br /> Now Patrick Swayze can not act for sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough capacity to make up the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is a person it would be a pleasure to see, even if it showed her looking at dry painting. <br /> <br /> Being curious, I checked the production info of this website. His opening weekend was $ 600 per screen and just over $ 400 each, after the month of June at the theater. The gross gross amount was $ 261,000, which could cover the food and meals of the actors and the film crew for a week. <br /> <br /> The story is rather lenient, and even the use of Reno's usually interesting location is as dull as the rest of the events. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like many pieces of SNL all assembled, none individually too big, and the overall presentation even worse. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the costs of this production had to be considerable - even if all of them were working at a lower price than usual - so what made it a barely bearable opus is the quality of the filming and the gift of Billy Bob (although it is a bit laconic here, compared to his usual work. <br /> <br /> Think of the three superb, very diverse characters, he depicted in "Sling Blade", "Bandits" and "Bad Santa", and you know he's realized this s below the norm, long before viewers had the opportunity to confirm it. same here, and another because the production was better than, for example, the typical film of "Lifetime".
