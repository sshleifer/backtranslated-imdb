What happened in the making of this film so that it becomes total disorder? Just a year after "The Breakfast Club", a brilliant film with many of the same actors as in "St. Elmo's Fire" (who also played and acted in the latter rather as if they were still the unsuited of the high school of the old but without the control or the discipline in the description of their roles. <br /> <br /> Was it the staging or the writing? Since it was the same person ( Joel Schumacher), it must have been both, but Schumacher has since given us "The Phantom of the Opera", "Phone Booth", "A Time to Kill" and two Batman films, "Batman and Robin" and "Batman Forever" ", which go from good to great directors Something has gone wrong on" StEF "because he has no genius, no comedy is worthless, and is far removed from what is really precious in life. > <br /> Example: the character Wendy (a rich little girl who has the heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by Mare Winningham) reveals to Billy (an undisciplined slut who cheats on his wife and friends, drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life, which Rob Lowe played appropriately) that she is still a virgin. Billy really sees a challenge and a possible conquest but Wendy "is not ready". Wendy, in fact, is not ready, it's hard to believe she's part of this clique of friends. Later in the story, when Billy, whose wife left him, took his child and married another, he sort of pulled the strings of his life. Billy leaves for New York, gives up and abandons all parental responsibility towards his little girl. He convinces Wendy that his virginity would be the perfect "starting gift" on his part. And Wendy, who works as a social worker to help broken families, does not seem to be at all in tune with this despot. Leave me alone. The only thing she can give only once is a loser who leaves family and friends? Schumacher describes this scene as a wonderful and moving moment. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where there is a complete mismatch between what is real and the value that is thrown into the sea and where acts look like virtue. <I suppose some may say "it was the 80s", but I remember it was in the '80s that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered, whether they are in marriage or outside. <br /> <br /> I think this film is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really is valuable and right. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technique (not the story), it was terrible. It is disjointed and looks like a 3 hour movie that was edited at 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and jumps over time simply do not make sense. Pick up what's in the editing room, put it back in place and the movie would probably run a lot better ... but it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe Schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 (he must have) or maybe he was on his head when he came to write St Elmo's screenplay Fire or maybe that group of actors has taken over the board and has gone its own way - that's what I really think happened.
