You will find in this film redundant and eternal shots, useless shots, useless scenes. In other words, it seemed technically poor. The music tracks are directed in an amateur way (no synchronization in the current dance, bad synchronized post-synchronization, evident bad improvisation of the actors from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The film is long and boring. Finally, it makes little point and even less sense. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas though. Some elements of the comic strip are really effective, especially the opening scene. However, the film gets worse and worse, so it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand in the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, it's not true for the film. That is, the gap between the trailer and the film itself is like a scam.
