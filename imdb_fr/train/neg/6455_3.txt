Really a terrible movie. This is to be expected, however. Clearly a small budget: nothing but innovative, an actress (if you can call what she does "acting") who still has nudist roles in a shower scene, a man in a reptile costume almost modeled on a predator, wood, etc. But there are redemption points. Although the story is not new, most of the time, there are some parts that are not so regurgitated. On the one hand, the black man does not die when he is attacked (the first time) and he is not even one of the first couples to die. But it's minor. More importantly, there is a very interesting twist on the experiences of Kat and Wes & Steve that I did not see coming. When Steve told Kat that he knew what she had done, I thought what he said and Kat had answered. But when the creature revealed who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised by the novelty of the revelation. It may be because of my lack of experience with gender, or because it is a truly intelligent trick. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty bad and do not look at it if it's better ... Unless you're in the mood for a cheap scifi movie.
