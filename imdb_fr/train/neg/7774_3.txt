For a good half hour or so, I remember thinking, "Hey, that could be Bill Rebane's greatest success!" The opening sequences are atmospheric, there are immediately some frightening moments to live and our director even refers to his famous stinker "The Giant Spider Invasion" in a fun way. The concept is stolen shamelessly from William Castle's "House on Haunted Hill", where three millionaire millionaires extremely annoyed drag nine losers into an isolated mansion to win $ 1,000,000 in a playoff game. Naturally, participants begin to disappear quickly and one by one, and it takes them too long to realize that the elderly are sadistic ... or that there is another murderer among them. The film begins and ends with a strange narrator telling a lot of nonsensical things that are neither relevant nor interesting for the plot, but there are beautiful T & A to admire in the first ten minutes and this stupid bimbo (Shelly, I believe it's called) is really hilarious to watch. After the first half hour, of course, the inevitable happens and "The Cold" turns into a rebellious manual production with complicated scenario twists, silly dialogues and a total lack of excitement. There was no budget for bloody murder sequences, but our multi-talented director (?) Tries to compensate for this with countless sequences of disco dancers and an amateur rock band. The film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them are a bit satisfying. Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR: Return of the King? Avoid this movie, you will live longer and happier.
