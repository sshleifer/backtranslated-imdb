As a big fan of BSG's first two seasons and the BSG Razor standalone, I was hoping this release would bring the franchise back to its original glory time. Usually, I have no problem with science fiction that is mainly focused on dialogue rather than a visual boon special effects. If the scenario is tight with original ideas provided by good actors, one can create a deep film with little money spent in CGI. This suite does not meet any of these requirements. The world of virtual reality created by terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous and incredible. This scene was simply put there to raise the level of release to Restricted. Not that teens do not like virtual reality. Pits filled with sex, violence and heavy dance. It's the part about those same teenagers with intellectual depth and reason or political and religious passion to create a futuristic software or become kamikazes that puzzles me. These children are definitely not on this planet. The film runs like a soap opera, the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz giving his cyborg a divine consciousness through the student's firmware upgrade was fun, even entertaining. But this old concept was much better described and much more credible in the brilliant and classic "Frankenstein" of Boris Karloff. Caprica rips her only interesting idea of ​​an old Hollywood horror movie. No surprise there! Overall, this film was bland, unoriginal and cheap, using recycled synthetic images of Caprica from BSG. I doubt that I'm watching this soap opera when it first aired on the channel Sci-Fi. Unless of course I suffer from insomnia at that time, this show would undoubtedly be the cure. zzzzzzzz
