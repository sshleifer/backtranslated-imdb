This movie only offers the most silly conversations possible. In fact, I probably could not have imagined how insignificant a film was, how much dialogue could be synthetic until an hour ago, but again I saw this video. in a film that does not depend on a powerful script, we expect to at least see good acting conversations and good conversations and even a little humor maybe, but this film miss them all. you have heard me say that they miss them all. there is not a single point that I like in this film, none. I hate that. I'm sure anyone will do it too. the name is meant to give the target audience nudity and other ideas, but it even fails to nudity. I do not know how, but I've been watching this thing for about an hour, and I really recommend you do not do it. worst film I've seen in my life. if someone offers to watch it, ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your life
