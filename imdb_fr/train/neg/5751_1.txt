The film must have been shot in one day, there are scenes where you can see the reflections of the camera and its red pointer, even the green light of the landscape that merges with the actors! The plot and the lines are really horrible without the slightest inspiration (at least like a thriller genre movie). All that has to do with Poe in the film, has a shallow and childish approach. The movie is full of clise and not exciting. If you want to watch a funny movie b for a relaxing evening with friends then go for it, you will enjoy it (as I did) but there is no way to take this movie seriously!
