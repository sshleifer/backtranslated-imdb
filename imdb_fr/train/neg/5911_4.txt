POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The Spy Who Shagged Me is an overestimated and superhuman sequel. International Man of Mystery is out of nowhere. It was a lonely star that few people had heard of. But it was incredibly original, with sophisticated and ample humor, always good taste and a brilliant cast. The Spy Who Shagged Me was much more commercialized and excited. <br /> <br /> OK, I'll admit it, the first time I saw this movie, I found it very funny, but it's only after watching the movie or three times you see all the faults. The acting game was OK, but Heather Graham can not act. Her performance did not seem very convincing and she was not as good as Liz Hurley. The characters who flourished in the first (Scott Evil, Number 2, etc.) are thrown in the background and do not involve many isolated scenes. The film is simply invaded by cameos. <br /> <br /> In particular, I hated the way they totally ignored some of the scenes in IMOM. When they killed Vanessa at the beginning and Basil was sitting, he knew that she had always been a fembot. What was the purpose of this? They killed number 2 in the first, and now they bring him back without any explanation. It's supposed to be a parody of espionage, I do not think any of the characters have a gun in the movie. It's just going on a track, further and further away from the point. <br /> <br /> The new characters are very badly received. All the Mini-Moi "make fun of my size", the joke ages very quickly. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for rude humor. In total, there are about two or three good jokes. The others are either tasteless or revisited IMOM. <br /> <br /> If it was the first movie in the series, then I would probably be easier with that. But the series started on a dry note and then collapsed to a level of disgusting humor. So I say: look at this film only if you have not seen its predecessor, because The spy who played me is an ultimate disappointment.
