My Name is Modesty is a low budget film that tells the story of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the film is terrible, it's just not what I expected or hoped for. Although I've known Modesty Blaise's character for years, I'm not too familiar with comics or illustrated novels, so I start playing in this film as a foreigner. This can be part of the reason for my disappointment. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is focused on dialogue. I guess I was looking for something with a little more camp value. Right now, My Name is Modesty is an extremely serious movie. There are very few "light" moments, or none at all. The role of actor, at least Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing exceptional. As others have commented, she seems a little too frail to be completely credible in the lead role. The action scenes of My Name is Modesty are one of the weak points of the film. I never admitted that this woman could handle a group of skilled killers. <br /> <br /> I really hope that Quentin Tarantino will do the same and make the rumor a big budget movie based on the character of Modesty Blaise. I am convinced that the concept has a lot of potential and I would look forward to it.
