How do you spell a fat Italian who can barely make a martial arts move without the need for heart medicine? In this movie, Steven Seagal is at its lowest level of achievement. Since the beginning of his career, the behavior of the latter in pathetic and indulgent behavior has been a constant decline that has changed his career. In this film, it seems that most of his training was to order fetuccini alfredo every day at his restaurant. <br /> <br /> He's fat, slow and very old in this movie, barely an action hero in the martial arts, more like a laughing clown. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire; this film tells about 2 hours of reasons. <br /> <br /> Summary: A big Italian guy with a great reputation We realize that a criminal group can play with a drug designed by the army to create the ultimate reaction of the warrior. This claim, although pathetic and laughable, gives the opportunity to exceptional fighting scenes, including breaking down the walls like a comic book. <br /> <br /> Did I mention this film totally nil and Steven Seagal is a joke? Yeah. I did.
