Okay, I watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now I took it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and I have to say that I actually think this movie is good. This film caught the eye as a bootleg I know what you did last summer, a bit like Final Stab was for Scream 4, and although this movie is not so bad. I mean, there were flaws and of course it would be laughable to take it out to theaters, but still for a midnight popcorn movie, this movie is not half bad. There are fears, and really hot women that I could add. In addition, it shows the new look of beefy Joey Lawrence, although it has obviously not earned him big roles in Hollywood either. I feel bad to man, he had such a career in the early and mid-90s, with blooming, Some Disney movies and the everlasting Lawrence brothers show ..... Joey Lawrence was a little player in the scene from the sitcom, but then, as in a 360-degree turn, his career went south only with low budget movies like this one. <br /> <br /> The film also warns you, it makes you think of a team, there is really a secret that someone knows, to be simply disappointed in the end to discover the secret. This also throws you on the identity of the killer. I had an idea, but I still did not think the killer was who he was, but his motives, combined with the secret, were a huge disappointment. Now, has there been a secret that has been revealed? This film could have been one of the best-rated movies. But also, I'm a supporter of college and college topics, I went to spring break in a manor-sized beach house, similar to the one here, so that made me feel sentimental about about this movie. <br /> <br /> A film so-so slasher. Good for a midnight movie.
