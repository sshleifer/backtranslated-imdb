It's a problem I have with movies that go on television, while there's nothing else to watch. I'm kind of sucked into some really bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this one was pretty watchable. The concept of being the only ones to stay on Earth after a comet, then discovering that there are zombies makes me laugh. And that's the reason why I gave this movie a 2 instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but this way it makes you laugh (too stupid> funny). <br /> <br /> I think I only looked at him because the Star Trek guy was in the lead. I was surprised to see him as a young man ... and he was the only funny character anyway.
