Hilarious, laugh out loud moments ... and yet not a comedy. I especially liked the gagged planted ambulance that soaks the "dirty skull" that then yells at them angrily "you, dirty skull", I mean wow, someone's online diploma is worth it! The worst scenario imaginable, with introductions of the plot in an instant, a ridiculous move in the story, the development of characters ZERO (even between the characters who meet .. it's as if they knew each other and have been trusting for years) risky voiceover with extra echo effects, and plot holes .. oh my god are there plot holes !! To be honest, I do not even write this, but I hope that the last 30 minutes will not have the effect of improving the already pathetic attempt of cinema ... god we have a nice overview forget that the movie is a load of ... well ... use your imagination for the conclusion of this particular sentence!
