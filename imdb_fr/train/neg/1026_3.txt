Sensational. I do not think I've ever seen a film with so many great actors that had such a crucial role. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the worst actor to have had an important role in a movie with the power and money of the star behind Edison. <br /> <br /> His role was painful to watch. The story was good and all the other characters were played by professional actors, although LL Cool J was fine since he had many small scenes to cut teeth. How the director and the movie company thought that Timberlake was ready to play this role, there is no way to understand it. <br /> <br /> His character ruins the whole experience, because every time he is on the screen, you actually incite corrupt police officers. to style his buttocks, and he's supposed to be the hero ... I would not want to waste money on this one in the theater or on video. Maybe if you have HBO and you have nothing else to do at 2 o'clock in the morning on a Saturday night and you're drunk and stoned, everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'Kermit the Frog' act in a Hollywood blockbuster just did not work.
