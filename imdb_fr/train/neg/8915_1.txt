My comments on this film have been erased twice, which shocked me a lot, as I made an effort to judge this film for other people. Please be tolerant of the opinion of others. It is obvious that the writing in the mind of Nietzsche's works is not understood. I will change my comment completely. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is really bad for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Subject: One should be very careful in making a film about a philosopher who is still today not understood by the masses and between peers arouses passionate discussions. Philosophers agree that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So, making a film about his life, which obviously includes his "ideas," is something that you have to be extremely careful about, or preferably not doing at all. Wisdom begins with knowing what you do not know. One might think that this is not a critique of the film itself, but the film does not speak of an imaginary character, but of the life of someone who actually lived and had a great influence on the world yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about a tomato, I can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the chosen topic, the tomato. Producers have the responsibility to make a film about real facts. Especially in a case like this and this responsibility has not been taken. <br /> <br /> Scenario: One of the first things I noticed was ridiculous accents. Why? This distracts from what should be discussed; Nietzsche and the truths he found. It does not help to put things in a geographical perspective or at a convenient time! Come on, do it properly or better; German! Even Mel Gibson was right to let his characters talk a bit about the Aramaic mumbo jumbo of the Passion. <br /> <br /> Second, it's over-acted. <br /> <br /> 3d, Assante is not an actor to portray Nietzsche. Bad casting. <br /> <br /> 4th, the facts are far away. <br /> <br /> And so on. It's a waste of celluloid.
