The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, the parricide of Caesar being the junction point. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. Therefore, it is difficult for me to re-read this film in depth because I did not understand what had been said. Cleopatra being a historical icon, the game is very difficult and I found that for a newcomer, Leonor Varela plays just fine. She is strong, but she is also a tender soul mate and very supportive. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their love affair is the essence of the first episode. So it's not really a documentary, nor a peplum, but a great love story. <br /> <br /> After the parricide, a new lover comes (Marc-Antoine) but the flavor is gone: we always remember our first love. So I found the second episode boring and their tragic destiny is not revealed with force. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the production is luxurious: the decorations are large, decorated with taste; the exotic Moroccan live location and the splendid cabinets. Producers have a lot of money, but they do not spend anything on special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, Sphinx) that it's funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would really like to hear it in French or in English to give me a definitive opinion on these two films.
