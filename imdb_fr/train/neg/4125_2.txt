Fucking shit! What a terrible Spanish thriller! I've had it for about four years and I finally started it the other night. I watched an hour or two before going to bed. I am rather intrigued by all this. I finished it last night and I could not believe where I'd stopped it the night before. Literally, I stopped the second before the film goes down completely. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was rather intrigued and curious about where this mystery was going, but I stopped it as soon as Simon got the package in the bar. I picked it up when he opened the package to reveal a laser gun, then he played a "menacing" laser tag game. Phew! Then, the big revelation is that all this is a terrorist plot on the part of nerds of role plays. PHEW! You can say that the Spanish industry was definitely behind the director Mateo Gil (co-author of the two previous major successes of Amenabar). There is an excellent score and excellent photography. But this scenario is full of foolishness. How anyone who has spent the last 40 minutes with an impassive face exceeds me.
