What an incomprehensible mess of a movie. Something about a cop who fires bullets from himself after being wounded by a bullet and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and because of the size of the jar he has already been hit a fifty times) and an ultra secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason lead him to Mexico. Whether they were sent there deliberately or just really really lost is never specified. And you will never hear another scenario with the word "Butthorn" either. Gary Busey tests the role of Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon" and, although Busey is a useful actor, the screenplay condemns the whole film to mediocrity. William Smith made another round as a Russian soldier, the same character he had played in "Red Dawn" a few years earlier. After playing the heavy biker for most of the 70s, it was nice to see him expand his range playing heavy communist. Unfortunately, he will always be better remembered as the guy Clint Eastwood played in "Every Which Way You Can".
