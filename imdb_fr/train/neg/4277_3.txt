Veteran filmmaker and producer Allan Dwan, whose huge film channel includes both the most forgettable and the most popular movies (for example, John Wayne in "Sands of Iwo Jima"), has been trying a great comedy musical with "I Dream of Jeanie". Featuring a troupe of inexperienced cinematic singers and, as it turned out, he has virtually no future, he has told a fictitious and largely offensive story about the great American singer-songwriter Stephen Foster. <br /> <br /> Bill Shirley is the beloved young Foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay for the hospitalization costs of a wounded black boy. Her fate is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence) whose younger sister, Jeanie (Eileen Christy), realizes she is in love with the almost impecunious blacksmith. Foster is in love with Inez who is outraged by the composer's number 1 in The Parade Hit Parade, "O Susannah". Enter Minstrel Edwin P.Christy (Ray Middleton) to help launch the profitable phase of Foster's career. <br /> <br /> This is, according to the standards of the musical film of the early 50s, a big production. The sets are sumptuous, like Hollywood, which depicts fake with all accessories. The singers are not half-naughty and Foster's songs are almost impossible to ruin. <br /> <br /> But it is also a literal milk of lime of the antenna. The largest number presents a black face for all on stage, a historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of thoughtless racism. If these representations of blacks were close to reality, the abolitionists would be rightly condemned for their interference in such a beneficial institution. <br /> <br /> "I Dream of Jeanie" apparently collapses in the trunk of the workshop with barely a death whisper. Now relaunched by Alpha Video for the modest sum of $ 4.99, it's a period piece with charming songs and repulsive feelings about the victims of the great American crime, slavery. <br /> <br /> That's what Hollywood had published two years before Brown v. Council of Education. Must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who wore their sheets at the theater.
