Imagine that your date asks you which movie you want to see and that you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer on "The Grudge". So, in good faith, you recommend seeing this movie. It's Halloween season, after all. And it made it to the box office last weekend, so it must be pretty good ... so go ahead. <br /> <br /> And you're in a state of shock when the movie ends like this, and you hear yourself audibly saying, "It can not be the end of the movie ..." But, alas, it is. <br /> <br /> And imagine that you came out of the movie theater with the shame and shame of recommending such a movie. You think your date thinks you are a bone to suggest such an atrocity, and your suggestion will definitely end a promising relationship. In fact, it was so bad that we both burst out laughing and telling each other how bad it was. I see no future for Miss Gellar in the movies and I suggest she stay on TV. In fact, it will soon be sent to Buffy's memories by the flea market, and it will not happen soon enough, if you ask me. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The plot did not make sense; the continuity was terrible. It is obvious that the whole ending was designed to have a "Grudge II - The Return of 'Cat-Boy'".
