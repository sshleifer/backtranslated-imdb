This film deserves another bad review. Imagine a critic extolling the virtues of the film, including "no sex, violence or gore". Uh, excuse me. The very structure of the film makes us see Cody's young comrade, a lifelong lover who has everything to live on, has collapsed, leaving Cody to hold his body lifeless and bleeding. And, given the nature of the war, we know that Cody has witnessed horror almost daily. It's so much for those who watch this film with such a rose that the violence that defines Cody's character is erased from the viewer's memory. <br /> <br /> Without any of his families, Cody, like John Rambo, travels the country on a bicycle ride on his long journey to the hometown of the United States under the guise of a place called Nevada City. No mention, no realization of the obvious fact that Cody is a damaged property. We know this since his commander almost declared it, while he orders Cody to "rest" far from death and the destruction of the war. This explains, as no one seems to notice or neglect, the obvious "no glare" effect of Cody. It's not bad to act. This is the flat effect of post-traumatic stress disorder. Make no mistake, remember that his commander ordered him to leave the battlefield. <br /> <br /> What about this "accidental" kiss, as another opinion suggests? The fall was an accident, the kiss was not. How did Cody respect Faith by making fun of her, knowing full well that she was spoken? It was a moment of non-family value. A moment that is then announced to the immediate universe as if it were posted on YouTube. Of course, the fidelity of faith and the fact that Cody "meets" a woman who plans to marry another one are received in the spirit of the Christmas season, all applauding their heart and their deceived lips. <br /> <br /> We know little about Faith's fianc√©, except that she confides her love to her, she does not take more than a second to accept her proposal (could have waited there were doubts), he is generous, he loves her to death, the family has nothing really against him, he believes that the marriage is based on compromises and the two never discussed later plans at the wedding. No wrongdoers here. <br /> <br /> Asner is a talented actor who will discuss Hill like "we love you, son ...", literally "You are part of our family" a few days after meeting a stranger named Cody. And the speech of the "group of brothers" where the sentence should never before apply to virtual strangers outside the battlefield. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This film is a Christmas candy floss that betrays a lot. . Most crudely when he applauds Cody's disrespect for Faith by physically striking her, knowing full well that she is spoken. By redefining the family as we know it, that is, accepting a virtual stranger as a full and loving family member because we all love you. How many of you have done it or know someone who did it? DO NOT.
