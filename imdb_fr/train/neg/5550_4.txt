You realize you've been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, is not it? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers coexist on an island, but one might think that after watching neglected and stinking heroes running through the bush with an egg on a spoon for a decade, that would be enough to get you commit to something a little more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I do not even speak of the validity of the programs, which for the record seems doubtful to me. It is difficult to suspend disbelief because "Bushy Bill" eats a rat when all the crew of producers and photographers are housed in a makeshift bio-conditioned dome sipping iced mochcinnos with moxy. <br /> <br /> the call here? I do not care about these people or their sinuous lives. I just do not understand. But if you find yourself really captivated by hairy and unwashed people, I suggest you turn off your TV and go to the nearest bus station, where you can see such people in their real habitat. They call them homeless and, for free, you can relax and admire their incredible ability to collect various pieces of cigarettes from a plethora of garbage cans, and finally hit the filthy nets and shape Dr. Frankenstein's homemade cancer - stick, while praying people to get food when the stench of "Aqua Velva" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part? Just like Survivor, every week a tribe member "leaves" the island when they are sent to the local institution without ceremony, while the scary state of schizophrenia in the raw state and without medication is racing. ! Now THIS IS THE ENTERTAINMENT!
