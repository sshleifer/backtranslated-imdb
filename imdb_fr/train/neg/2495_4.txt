The problem with this type of film is that, literally, dozens of them are made each year. Fortunately, only a handful of these films are shown in movie theaters, while others go directly to video or television like this movie. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this film is its originality. It's one of those movies that uses the "Die Hard" formula of a tough but troubled guy being in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, it is a character played by Casper Van Dien, who works for a security agency that thoroughly tests security procedures for businesses and individuals. In this case, he is sent on a cruise ship, which is of course diverted. You can see this film as a kind of mix of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One" and the film does not even try to hide that these two films were probably his biggest source of "inspiration". So really, you can not consider this film as an original movie. He uses all the clich√©s of the book and this film really does not offer any surprises or anything remotely resembling anything original. <br /> <br /> As you can expect from a movie like this, it has very low scenario. Or rather, it has a very lazy writing. As I said before, the film does not contain anything original, but the story itself presents some elements that are far from likely and that are simply ridiculous. I mean, hijack a huge cruise ship with only about 8 men, half of whom carry only small arms and then demand a ransom of "only" $ 10 million, for a ship that is worth about 10 times more than this amount is already itself ridiculous enough. How do they even intend to divide this money afterwards? Each person receives a little over a million or something? It is hardly profitable for a company as big and risky. And then there is the case of taking the passengers hostage. One way or another, they manage to take all the passengers of the huge ship hostage and place them in a room, with only one guy with his pistol, that he does not even seem able to hold on the right, watching them. However, we never see more than 30 hostages, as if they were all those who were on board at the time. Moreover, when the character of Van Dien looks for his son and vice versa, whatever the room in which they borrow the huge cruise ship, they always meet instantly. Some examples of lazy writing in the film. <br /> <br /> But as it is of course an action film, the story of course becomes secondary. But again, it's not as if this movie had a good action. Half of the actors seem to have never held a weapon and the film is filled with idle ridicule. It becomes really laughable at times. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film does not present the best actors either, although I must say that Casper Van Dien is really not a bad "action hero" and an actor, as much as the genre and the B-movie circuit is concerned. However, he also suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise; no matter how old he is, he never looks convincing enough to play the father of a teenager. Van Dien has already made his debut as a promising young actor, but playing in movies like this one does not help much in his career. He is probably capable of something better, even though he has never really given him the opportunity to show it. All the other actors are also doing a fair job but their characters are so formulated that they never become really interesting. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not the worst genre movie I've ever seen, but it's also not exactly the most original or the most memorable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
