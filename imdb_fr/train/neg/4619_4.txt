Let me first say that I love the stories of Westerns and the Civil War. I also consider John Ford an excellent director. I also have the same feelings for the acting talents of John Wayne & William Holden. <br /> <br /> I do not remember having seen this film during its first release in 1959. Yesterday evening, I saw it for the first time since then. <br /> <br /> According to my 4 reviews, we can say that I did not like the film. <br /> <br /> I will now try to talk about some of its shortcomings. <br /> <John Lee Mahin who wrote the screenplay for Harold Sinclair's novel, was a very talented writer and wrote many quality scripts. This script is poorly written and poorly documented. They mention the terrible conditions of Andersonville Prison. At the time of the film, Andersonville was not operational. They also use rifles that were not used at the time. <br /> <br /> John Ford has been making movies for over 40 years and has won 4 Oscars. He must have been sick while filming. His usual style was gone. It may be a film facing south and east, not Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He normally owned a stock company of players that he had used in almost all his movie, MOST was missing this time. This time, only minor cowboy stars Hoot Gibson and Ken Curtiss have roles and of course, Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except the 3 stars. (see below) Mr. Fords' stock company made most of his films the classics they were; unfortunately regretted. <br /> <br /> We turn now to the main stars John Wayne & William Holden. The duke too must have been ill, he seemed out of place here. This kind of role usually fits his style perfectly, it was just good enough here. Wiliam Holden was doing his best, but nowhere was he as good as he usually was. <br /> <br /> It was imperative that there be an actress in this type of film. In her first main role (second film), there is Constance Towers, a very beautiful person, but not really an actress, she still has roles on television. Let me be nice and say that she had a long career, more based on her appearance than on her acting talent. Althea Gibson, the star of tennis, is also part of Mrs. Towers' servants. I'm glad she stayed true to tennis. <br /> <br /> The rest of production credits were far from the usual high standard of John Ford's other films. some military-style songs allegedly made by the cavalry on the march, not good at all. The action scenes were good but were at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Notes * 1/2 * (of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
