If you are under 6 or 7 years old, then you will really like this movie. My youngest daughter is stuck on television when she looks at her. As an adult, I can not stand it !! I am all for the suites .... when they have a decent history. But this is far from being good. Forgive me for saying what is after all a children's film, but if you have to watch it almost every day, when your kids love it so much, you'll understand why. My daughter would watch this movie again and again the same day if she was allowed to do so. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 4 out of 10 just for the fact that it entertains my youngest daughter.
