I just saw this movie on Flix after recording it. I grew up watching F Troop and had a lot of trouble with Wrangler Jane. So I was shocked, literally shocked, to discover, after seeing this film, that the degenerate homicidal nurse was Melody Patterson. poorly photographed. I would never have guessed it was her in a million years. What is she doing in a photo like this? I agree with the guys here that the film lacks what it pushes. No sex, no gore, no teasing. It is also a remake of the atomic brain aka monstrosity (1964 or so). Most actions are tedious; the main character spends a lot of time running around the crazy doctor's house and the basement, and the neighborhood in general, or being abused by the cop, all boring and tedious. Now, if the Italians had done it, half of the movie would have been the Slingblade Soldier / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam stroking the unconscious naked girls. But you only get it for 20 seconds.
