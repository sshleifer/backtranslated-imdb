Of course, if you ask any mother who is the most beautiful baby in the world, she will tell you that her son is the most amazing child in the world. She is right, at least in her own world. <br /> <br /> The film's producers were Biggie's mother and her good friend Puffy. Oh, should I say more? I will break down for those who do not want to make a simple deduction. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was wrong. You may be able to collect some MTV videos from Biggie and call them movie. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggie's mother. The real thing in life is like a dog. <br /> <br /> I just wonder why his name was big. Big body Small cock? Big mouth Small sound? Big fat Small eyes? Disclaimer: I am a person of color. So keep your racist remark to yourself.
