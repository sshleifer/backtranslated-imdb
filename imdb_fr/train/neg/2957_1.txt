What a mess!! Why was this film made? This, as well as other films of his "caliber", should be teaching tools on how not to make a movie. Children may love, but anyone over the age of 10 may disapprove or disapprove. To make matters worse, the fact that such talented artists as Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl have been completely lost in a movie unworthy of any notice.
