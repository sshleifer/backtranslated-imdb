I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and I liked the movie - even "without mystery" - so I decided to watch the whole series of "Deathstalker" movies. I bought I and II and got settled for laughing. <br /> <br /> Nothing about "Deathstalker I" was funny at any level and when the credits were obtained, I was embarrassed and sorry to have bought it! Too much ugliness and nudity. I suppose either "DS 3" was a much cleaner production, so MST3K had changed a lot because I was expecting something similar, that is stupid and carefree and simple. I was wrong. Even at $ 6.99, it seemed like a waste of money. I did not even open "DS 2" because I will send it tomorrow. Now I will probably throw this DVD because I can not return it and no one wants it - including myself! So really, do not bother with this one. Even nudity (many, by the way) is uninteresting and disgusting.
