I am sad that a period of history so fascinating and rich in filming material can be turned into a memorable event. Wm C Quantrill was barely featured in the film, probably the most interesting character of this period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, ditto, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who cried for his murdered sister every time he fought, was totally absent from the screenplay. Instead, we have been forced to look at fictional characters who have never become a close friend of ours. how sad. The costumes were beautiful, as was the filming location in Missouri. I hope that Ang Lee will shoot another film from this period and start again, or that another filmmaker will look at the immense wealth of material on which to write a play.
