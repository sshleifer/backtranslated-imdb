I watched 'Envy' two nights ago on DVD at friends' house. The premises of this film are quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with great potential, but which completely fails. I watched it with about five friends and no one laughed during the whole movie. Jokes (which are rare) are NOT funny in any way ... the scenario is rotten, and they never answer the question ... WHAT IS SH * T GO? Of course, the answer to this question is that nobody cares. This film has no comic value, and as some users have said, the only thing that makes it almost worth watching is Christopher Walken, the J-man. None of the characters are developed, the intrigues are so thin that they are almost transparent - and this song of the film is it supposed to be funny?
