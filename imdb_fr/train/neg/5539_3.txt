The Wimpy plush shirt, Armand Louque (unconditionally played by the famous actor Dean Jagger in a lead role), joins a group of researchers who wish to discover and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand crows for the charming Claire Duval (went to get the blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses the sweet sap for his colleague, Clifford Grayson (the desperately wood Robert Noland), the wife. Furious to be used and repulsed by Claire, Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to take revenge. Do you like it? Well, that's not the case. For starters, the static direction (no) of Victor Halperin lets slip the story confusing and without history that unfolds at an extremely slow pace. Worse still, Halperin absolutely fails to create tension, atmosphere and momentum in this extremely tedious procedure. Mostly bla-bling a largely tasteless casting does not help. only George Cleveland, the generous general Duval, and E. Alyn Warren, the irascible, Dr. Trevissant, manage to animate a little things with their reception and entertaining entertainment. The current partition of the film library, the painfully obvious decorations, and the coarse cinematography are equally ugly and unimpressive. In fact, this weak excuse for a fright is so bad that even the badly pierced eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can not alleviate this boredom that numbs the brain. A dismal failure.
