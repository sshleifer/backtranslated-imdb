The first was the best. The second sucked because the dialogue was terrible. Although the scenario is not so bad (in fact, all scenarios are good and bad). Throughout the film, I took several doses. I know Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expert, but not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker was not good either. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, a dreadful acting game (but it's based on his scenario). All the characters there were not so good. But some of the things I love about Rush Hour 2 are still action and fewer sex scenes. I know Jackie Chan does not do what's good for her.
