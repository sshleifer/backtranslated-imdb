Do not waste 90 minutes of your time on "Fast Food, Fast Women". His episodic scenario is annoying with three related stories, which is ridiculously bad because of predictable writing, dramatic play and even bad music. I found the anorexic main character upset to watch whenever she was on the screen. She needs fast food. <br /> <br /> Spend the 90 minutes you spend on this turkey doing something more exciting ... like cutting your toenails. You would have more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The only thing that rhymes with this movie is Louise Lasser, but she deserves a lot better than this tired scenario. It's as helpless as the older guy she's courting in the movie. <br /> <br />
