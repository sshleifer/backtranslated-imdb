I logged in just to comment on how stupid this movie is. In addition to being a scam of Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other kind of terrorist story, this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a film that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It is difficult to blame the actors when we offer them a scenario as stupid and imbued with clich√©s. It's bad enough if you moan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence, but when you find yourself moaning again and again, you have to conclude that the director is not the light bulb either. The most brilliant filmmakers are the producers who decided to bring this story to the screen in the first place. The mostly low-rent actors that you can excuse to assume this task, as they have probably come forward to get the money and visibility, without the fact of being part of this joke-movie will bring them rewards or recognition . It may embarrass them to have such a mediocre judgment that they could get involved in such a loser. I see no reason to summarize the plot or even give examples to prove my case, as it would be a cruel and unusual punishment that none of the people involved in this debacle could endure. Just as studying well-made movies can inspire you to create a successful and clever work of art and beauty, the only thing you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what NOT to do and what does not work! Be warned.
