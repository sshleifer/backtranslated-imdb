I love the memories of a geisha, so I read the book twice. it's one of the best books I read last year. I was impatiently waiting for the film and worried that reading the book would ruin the pleasure of watching the film. I did not expect the movie to be so bad. Part of the best part of the book was omitted from the movie and the characters were weak, Hatsumomo (Li Gong) being the worst. If I did not read the book, this movie would be a bit confusing and inexplicable. The plot of the film says "Nitta Sayuri reveals how she transcended her catch ..." Did anyone see how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri? Forget the movie and read the book.
