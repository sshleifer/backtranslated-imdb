Rebar is an astronaut who travels to Saturn for the first space mission in the world, but it is of course a horror film that goes wrong and he returns to earth as the only survivor. Reaching a strange illness that slowly melts him and makes him lose his mind unless he regularly consumes human flesh, he kills what is apparently the only nurse in the hospital and fled to the nearby city to hunt down other victims. I liked the premise and the monster and gore effects are actually quite good, but the scenes in the space are simply stuck together out of stock. The images of NASA and the hospital strangely resemble a warehouse. A very weak scenario, little character development and a generally mediocre acting game prevent this one from rising and being simply a mediocre slasher movie with the novelty of owning a living candle as a killer, interest. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, strictly for the most hardcore monster movie fans.
