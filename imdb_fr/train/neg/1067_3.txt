Only a handful of segments engage here. A segment with a car mechanic from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins gives reason, in turn, until the last shot beats everything. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that only a few of the clips evoke Paris. The others are so scattered about the theme, the tone, the will and the production that you can as well watch "The Years Best Commercials, 2006." It's really everywhere. It does not develop over time, and nothing allows the directors to prevail. No construction succeeds in joining the pieces. Boredom sets in. - commercial vampire, surplus product shtick. It has about as much to do with Paris as the old ladies knitting in Antarctica. I think first of all about Fantasy, in the Coen brothers segment (thanks J & E for ruining another movie), and then too many appearances. Being in Paris is that you do not need to pretend shit to make your days extraordinary. Why divide by neighborhood if the Quartier de la Madeleine is likened to vampires for a losing director? Has there ever been a genre more overrepresented than the vampire movie? Every three years, we receive the same lame vampire shots. <br /> <br /> Worse, the transition from one segment to another is quite naive. Transitions are lost. It does not feel intentional, it feels neglected.
