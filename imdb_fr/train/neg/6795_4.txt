The Comeback begins to be promising, with a brutal death scene with a mask carrying a killer. The mask itself is pretty cool too, and almost looks like the one used in the 1990s slasher film "Granny." From there, the movie is mostly boring. We still have a few deaths, which is still a good thing, but they are not numerous enough. The reason the dead are so good is because they are frantic and bloody. The story of the film is rather interesting and would have worked very well if it had not been so boring for most. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this unless you are an avid collector - there is not enough of it here to make it an average slasher movie.
