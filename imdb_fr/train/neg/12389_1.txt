The model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is brutally raped by a teacher (Chris Sarandon) of her sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He is brought to justice but is totally free. He then rapes Kathy! <br /> <br /> Abusive and sick rape film. This film was presented as an important drama dealing with rape. What is a badly written drama and (for the most part) badly done. He claims to have sympathy for the rape victim but puts the scene in front of us. To be quite honest though, Hemingway's game is so bad in this sequence that he loses any real impact he might have had. The court scenes were boring and predictable. And the film went too far when Mariel, 15, was raped (thankfully, this was not shown). I admit, however, that it ended in a fine ending when Margaux grabbed a pistol and killed Sarandon. But seriously - raping a girl is just revolting. <br /> <br /> Take action does not help. For example, Margaux was not an actress. She was certainly a gorgeous woman (and a current model, I believe), but her role left a lot to be desired. This decreases the film. Mariel was just OK but it was one of his first films. Sarandon does what he can as a rapist. It was not bad, but the terrible scenario had hurt him. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing that in 1976, during the screening of this film, some women got up and applauded when Sarandon was murdered. people. I found it boring, simplistic and really sick. A 1 all the way.
