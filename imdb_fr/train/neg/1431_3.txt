!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> You would think of a story involving Archie Gray Owl - an Englishman pretending to be a Red Indian - would have a huge amount of humor to play. In fact, I would say that the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man against the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy. However, Richard Attenborough is committing something akin to a crime by making GRAY OWL a serious tragedy. Even worse, he made an extremely terrible movie. Pierce Brosnan lacks the necessary charisma for the title role and the romantic sub-plot between Gray Owl and Pony (played by Annie Gaupeau, also in wood), lacks any kind of on-screen chemistry. But to be fair to the actors, they are not helped by the script, which fails to portray Archie as the insolent chappy, he deceives everyone into believing he is American. The producers and screenwriter made the major mistake of focusing the film on Archie's screenplay. That's why I wrote "Spoiler possible" and that the main character was not revealed until late in the film. English, but it is obvious that all those who watched this film knew that before, there was absolutely no surprise. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the landscape is charming and that it has a deep ecological message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first major environmentalist of the twentieth century to tell the truth. And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN (and maybe TWO TOWERS if you want to classify it as having a green message), there has not really been a big green film. In fact, most environmentally conscious films are void, and that includes GRAY OWL, a film that, unsurprisingly, posed serious problems in finding a distributor.
