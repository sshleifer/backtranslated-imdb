*** WARNING! SPOILERS CONTENT HERE! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical look at what might happen to Madonna if she finds herself stuck on a deserted island one day. Madonna has absolutely no challenge to play in this role, and it shows. She's just Madonna playing Madonna, and she can not even get THAT right. I know what you're saying, you say, "How do you know that's what Madonna really looks like, you've never met her!" Okay, I did not, but we all remember "Action or Truth", do not we? I know Kevin Costner knows. <br /> <br /> One could think, in 2002, that Madonna could have learned something, in one way or another, thanks to the crossovers that have also made their way around the world. money screen. For God's sake, did not Madonna see "Glitter"? Mariah Carey showed the world of cinema HOW IT IS DONE !!! Mariah gives the coup de grace to Madonna's trash: beauty, talent, presence on screen, charisma, characterization, name it! All we see from this glimpse of Madonna's world is that she is the only one in the world. <br /> <br /> If there is one thing to say for Madonna, it is that she is coherent. When she was a sweetheart of MTV, she relocated the 20-year-old women's fashion world. Now, in the cinema, she brings back the roles of women in cinema AND society 20 years by glorifying all the most hated, horrible, odious and odious qualities that women have the reputation of locking up in them qualities that they are desperately trying to prove they do not really possess. <br /> <br /> *** HERE ARE THE SPOILERS !!! DO NOT READ ANOTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ... *** <br /> <br /> Here is the good thing I'm going to say about this movie and that really impressed me. They did not go for the "Hollywood Ending" - the character lives off Madonna. In the typical and happy ending of Hollywood, Madonna's character would have died on the island and her whipped, oppressed and whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good and honest woman, a woman who would be exactly the opposite of his deceased wife, and they both live happily ever after. But in this extremely depressing conclusion, she is saved and, once again, this poor victim of a husband is again struggling with his demon wife and his life will become a hell again. <br /> <br /> *** HERE ENDETH THE SPOILERS ***
