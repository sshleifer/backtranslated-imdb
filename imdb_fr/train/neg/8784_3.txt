The idea was great, the actors were incredible, the story could be very scary, but the writing was mediocre and there was no depth. I could not really get into this movie. I could not feel the characters, there were a lot of cliffhangers and the movie ends very oddly. Was it a happy ending? I do not know. Was it a sad end? Once again, I do not know. You leave the theater with a feeling of dissatisfaction. The movie had a lot to give, but could not. It's not because you can edit that you should, right? I would not really recommend this movie because you can not say that you left it with the impression of being finished. You will be just confused. Believe me, you will probably thank me if you do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
