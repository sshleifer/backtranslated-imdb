Kirstie Alley, who looks a little thinner, but only a little bit, is in this mess with a man who looks like MacGuyver, with blond hair and whitened everything. The premise of the film is about an older woman (50 !!!) who can not get her screenplay because of age discrimination, so she sends her younger nephew to pretend to be the writer. This is not an original idea or a very good movie with a lousy acting, a crazy dialogue and a ridiculous plot. There is another conspiracy about a writer who has a crush on the character of Kirstie or who admires him, and why this is included is a mystery. The actor who portrays Kirstie's brother is so wooden and mistaken that it was a torture to watch their scenes. What is there to say about this film? Avoid it.
