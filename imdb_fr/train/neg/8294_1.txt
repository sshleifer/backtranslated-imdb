There may be something poetic to see dentists suffer. They are suffering in this terrifying and truly fearsome film, but they are also hurting the public. If you have always wanted to see a movie full of screaming, barffing, sick children, full of long, meaningful looks, an impassive woman and a worried husband: everything is there for you. Annoying, prolonged, it stands out as one of those glaring examples: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes there is. There is a short scene of Nabucco, with some very good songs. Save your money, or if it's on TV or cable, save your time. You can always read a book or make an omelette.
