Although, unfortunately, has considered (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, this film is fortunately much too fast. The scenario does not make sense, the idea of ​​the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely banal, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of a film, why he would never had to drop his music. His performance is an irritating note. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say is that Harvey Keitel manages to give a good shot. His later, Bad Lieutenant, would show how good actors can play, but fortunately, his performance here is limited.
