<br /> <br /> Attacking killer tomatoes is a "parody" of bad monster movies that ends up being worse than the movies it is portrayed. The story (very thin) tells the story of tomatoes revolting against those who treat them badly. Basically, they turn and growl (yes, they growl) and the next thing you know that the person is covered in ketchup. The actors are not names and have never shot movies after that. It would be useless to name them. There is a guy who has been hired by the government to try to stop the threat of tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black man, master of disguise, a girl and a man who dives. Anyway, there is another woman who is spying on the first guy who works for the government. if it does not make much sense to you, you understand. This film would never have been very good in the first place, but it does not even miss laughing while making fun of stupid attack scenes. The film is horribly shabby, which, although it is essential, really hurts what could have been a (reasonably) entertaining film. At one point, a giant tomato with wax "slides" on an undisclosed wooden board with wheels! I might have recommended the film if it had a nice camp value, but even this movie lacks this terrible movie. 2/10
