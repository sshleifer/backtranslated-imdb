Faith Domergue (better known as "Dr. Ruth" in THIS ISLAND EARTH) is the only reason to watch this movie. The story is very thin and once the Air Force's friends have returned to the United States with a cobra curse, the action is no more than a waiting game. See Faith the Snake Woman and try to pretend that the rest is not happening.
