Yes, Marie Dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is a poison and she runs away. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea, but it is a solid artist who surely holds the screen. <br /> <br /> I watched this for Polly Moran, whom I saw elsewhere. Here, Moran is OK - just OK - as a shrewd friend / foe of Dressler. Too bad it fell into an almost total forgetfulness. <br /> <br /> The plot has a good heart. The bad guys are trying to steal city dwellers. Dressler triumphs and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> I wonder about the central mechanism of the plot: the links. This came out during the Depression, so everyone may be aware of the links and what they can do if they are well used and misused. However, not from that time, I know them vaguely. They are like only different stocks, right? It seems odd to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity.
