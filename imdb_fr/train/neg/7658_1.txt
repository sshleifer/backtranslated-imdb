The kick of Uwe Boll in Hollywood after the punch in the face of House of the Dead is unique in the dark. <br /> <br /> If that proves how Boll is a true manipulator. After forcing Artisan to shut down on the House of the Dead flop, it can not be assumed that the highly credible Lion's Gate Films released AITD under contract only after acquiring Artisan's assets. Because AITD is an even more glaring example of the total lack of consistent film making ability, intrigue exposure, and mediocre flight of other films, as it was supposed to look cool instead of to register as part of the film. <br /> <br /> But then that's the point, is not it. Boll does not try to make a coherent movie because he's not trying to make Alone in the Dark. He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark, like House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the 3 or 4 other projects that are "announced" or "pre-production". <br /> <br /> These are not films to direct, but investment portfolios. Each of them has gone into production under the pretext that the tax law exploited by Boll and its investors could be closed within two to three years. The greater the number of explosive projects he can launch in this time frame, the more he and his investors will be able to earn money. Why bother to make a good movie when a bad movie makes you a mint anyway? The result is movies like the dreadful tragedy of Alone in the Dark. <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark, like all his films, is nothing but a cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current tendency to make lazy films. <br /> <br /> And to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood, congratulations, by making this man a cult figure, you simply make it easy for him to get investors, but in him giving a reputation. <br /> For more information, visit http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread. php? s = & threadid = 21699 By the way, do not ask me how he gathered his roles. Unless the players embark on the investment scam, this mystery remains to be discovered.
