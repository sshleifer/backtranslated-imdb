After watching this movie, I went to IMDb and read some of the reviews, which compared it to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that, I immediately saw the meaning of the critics. <br /> <br /> This film was a mediocre attempt on a similar theme. Interestingly, the film format is almost identical, but the PACING is incredibly different. "10 elements" throws the viewer into the timeline of a film day, while "Lost In ...", a more elaborate project, seems to span a few long days. <br /> <br /> I 'I'm sure some people will see this because he has Morgan Freeman and will be disappointed. It seems that his best roles today are supporting roles in big blockbusters, rather than leading roles in limited-release films and independent films under $ 10 million.
