If John Waters had written and directed "House of 1,000 Corpses" after being repeatedly hit on the head with a heavy object, the result would probably be something like "The Blood Shed". It's a little entertaining for the first half-hour, but then it slips into a kind of glop without constant shouts and people doing genitals to each other with knives, cutlery and tongs. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly boring and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad in what he does on camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that it will not take long for most viewers to forget about it.
