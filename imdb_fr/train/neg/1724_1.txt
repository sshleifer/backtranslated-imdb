... and it's this movie. I imagine that if there is indeed a life after the negative death, the cursed souls are attached to a couch rather uncomfortable and forced to watch this film loop for eternity. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it's probably the worst film I've ever seen next to "Manos, the hands of fate". .. and I saw a lot of bad movies, believe me. <br /> <br /> This is just a shabby B movie, a bad achievement at its best (or is it the worst?) relief. Now, a little comic relief is a good thing, but most of the film is centered on the adventures of these two morons, rather than on the "heroes" of this film, who actually participate in it less time! <br /> <br /> To be fair, Crown International really destroyed the film by adding bad music and doing a bad editing job. But honestly, it was probably a bad movie to start, so Crown really could not have done that much to hurt him. <br /> <br /> This must really be in the list of the last 100. I would not want this one on my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's my kind of movie B campy. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite my star rating.
