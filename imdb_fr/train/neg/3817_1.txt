Seriously. It's one of the most stupid family shows of all time. <br /> <br /> Intrigue - A motherless family and three "dads" raise 3 little girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters: the neat monster Danny, Joey, cartoon lover, Jesse obsessed hair, spoiled boy Michelle, the stupid DJ and the almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this series really want you to hate characters, right? <br /> <br /> Therefore, I do not think anyone should watch this show. I only laughed a few moments during the entire series and I think that instead of a lethal injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this show, a torture much worse than anything else. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
