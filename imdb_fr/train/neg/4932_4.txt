Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the last of the series and, like the fourth part, it has nothing to do with the first three, except for the title and the fact that it is a movie of horror on the theme of Christmas. <br /> <br /> Except for the unconscious, there are obvious things ... Mickey Rooney plays a toy maker called Joe Petto and the name of his terrifying son is Pino. Ring a bell, someone? A little boy named Derek heard a knock on the door one night and opened it to find a present on the doorstep. Even if he says "do not open before Christmas", he still starts to open it, but his father stops him and reprimands him, sends him to bed and opens the gift himself. Inside is a small red ball that grows arms and a Santa's head and kills his father. Oops, maybe he should have been alone enough. Of course, Derek is traumatized by the incident as he watches from the stairs, but he does not become a Santa killer, he just stops talking. <br /> <br /> A mysterious stranger is hiding, who seems very interested in the toys Joe Petto makes. We even see him buy a bunch when Derek's mother takes him to the store to find a gift that would get him out of his trauma. And what exactly does this guy do? Well, we're not sure, but he seems to take those toys apart to see what motivates them. He prevents his owner from evicting him by promising to pay him cash the next day and presents him with a toy "Larry the Larvae" for his child, but of course, "Larry" is not a good toy and stands out . Box in the car and of course, things are not pretty. <br /> <br /> Anyway, what's finally happening with Joe Petto and Pino is of course revealed, and as in the old story, Pino is not a "real boy". Pino is probably even more agitated and naughty because he suffers from "Kenitalia" (a smooth plastic crotch), which could explain his bad habits. And the identity of the unknown who is hiding is revealed too, and there is even a kind of happy ending. Whee. <br /> <br /> One step ahead of part 4, but not much. Again, Brian Yuzna is involved, and Screaming Mad George, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make it awesome. Some remnants of Part 4 also hang around, like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but that makes no difference. Anyway, I now see the whole series out of my system. Now, if I could remove some of my brain. 4 out of 5
