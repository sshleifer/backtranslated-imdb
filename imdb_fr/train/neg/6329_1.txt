I saw this cinematic misery in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (at the time when the tickets were actually selling for a dollar). This is the only movie I ever released (with my friend, while the skit of the movie "Laser Bra 2000" was silly). Obviously, the reaction of my friend and my friend to the movie was common. It's not that I found the film offensive (either at 18 or now), but rather that it's stupid and stupid and obviously not funny, lacking even the unintentional humor that makes a movie This is the real reason why NBC has refused to broadcast it, rather than not understanding Mike's "vision" (unless, of course, his vision is to lead the founders of the film to bankruptcy). <br /> <br /> I was surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made the list of "10 worst films of all time". This is certainly mine. You were warned.
