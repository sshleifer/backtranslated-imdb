Thank you for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This film is nil at so many levels, it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this retreaded tire makes me yawn. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (the poor man's Kevin Bacon) drives around Mexico with a surfboard containing a hidden compartment containing his vampire slaughter equipment ala Antonio The Banderas guitar cover in DESPERADO. He picks up lame "hunters" along the way (including a fiercely feminist infected girl who takes pills to prevent him from becoming a vampire), and they try to stop a vampire master woman who is not given a past, so we could worry about it. less on his quest (walking in the sun by stealing the black cross and performing a ritual to allow him to do so). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen that and done a lot better. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately. Frankly, I think it's past its peak and is unable to make another horror classic. The only film he has made since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. All the rest is complete shit, until the incredible GHOSTS OF MARS ... and now this celluloid waste. Where are the greatest characters like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), NEW YORK ESCAPE and THE THING? <br /> <br /> The fellow carpenter Wallace proves that he can not get out of a paper bag with his paper -Min script filled with yelps, groans and recycled gags from the original. Did I mention that I hated all the characters in the movie? There was not one memorable character in the entire movie. How's it going? This film has nothing to recommend. Even the presentation of the DVD is not good. the menu is awful. <br /> <br /> For comparison, JASON X: "FRIDAY 13 IN SPACE" was a masterpiece. Here's how to create a sequel and (re) energize a franchise, ladies and germs, and create an exciting DVD menu.
