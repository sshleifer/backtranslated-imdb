Judging by the hype and other reviews on this site, I was ready for an awesome horror movie focusing on junkies. What I got was a complete shit focusing on the junkies. I wonder if there is another movie called "Cookers" that these people have seen again? There are only 3 main characters and none of them seemed well written or played. Basically, all the film I just had to shake my head and marvel at the stupidity of these addicts. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not rent this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or another decent horror movie. Hell, praise "Mary Poppins"! Animated penguins are more scary and more convincing than anything you find in "Cookers".
