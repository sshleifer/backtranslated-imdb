Anyone who thinks this movie was not appreciated for its comic genius must have smoked with the two smokers of the movie. This film is NOT underestimated ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparison between this movie and The Naked Gun or Airplane since the last two films are well written and entertaining. Reunion class is none of these things. The sad thing is that it has such potential (good distribution, good narrative lines), but good jokes are rare. Scenes that are supposed to be funny are more annoying than amusing. The stoner guys, the vampire, the blind girl ... not funny. The only funny character was Delores (the one who sold her soul to the devil). <br /> <br /> National Lampoon has done some great movies (Animal House, Vacation) but it's not one of them. I was certainly expecting more from John Hughes.
