I know that actors and actresses like to try different types of movies - hey, nobody wants to be cast - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should have known better than that. "Angels in the Outfield" is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something happens like magic and saves the day. Do I even need to tell you how it ends? The film is simply a modest escape (the various science-fiction films of the 1950s are examples of high-level escape). If these films had a political connotation - or at least offered us a new look at life - then everything would be fine; this one is just useless. Much closer to the diabolical than the angelic. Also starring Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I guess they do not wish to dwell on this point in their resume.
