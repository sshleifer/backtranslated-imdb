First of all, I have to say that I worked for Blockbuster and that I saw a lot of movies that made it hard for me to find something I did not see. Given that, I want everyone to know that this film is by far the worst film ever made. It made me love Pin, Gigli, my boss's daughter and any other junk you've ever seen. BeLyt must be crazy, I only found one person who likes it and even they could not tell me what the film was about. If you are able to decipher this film and tell me what it is, you must be a writer or a fortune teller, because there is another way to allow a person to understand this shit. <br /> <br /> FOR GD'S LOVE STAY AWAY!
