I bet none of you knew that the famous conquistador Hernando Cortes had made a first exploration expedition to Mexico before facing the Aztecs. It's a good thing he did, because he would never have heard of those T Rexs who lived in a valley where people worshiped them as gods. <br /> <br /> It was understandable. What was not, is the casting of Ian Ziering blue-eyed in Cortes. Even with the blond hair made famous in Beverly Hills dyed black, Ian looked absolutely ridiculous. At least he did not try any Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> Tyranosaurus Azteca's true hero is Marco Sanchez, also late for a television series with a near-recurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of Dallas PD. He finds true love with an Aztec princess and life would be perfect if the adorable prehistoric beasts are not worshiped by the natives. <br /> <br /> Tyrannosaurus Azteca seems to have used extracts from the famous Sid & Marty Krofft series the land of the lost. There was only a few Sleestak missing to appear. <br /> <br /> If you want to know more about this reconnaissance expedition that has not quite been done in history books, see Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then, try to sit across with an impassive face.
