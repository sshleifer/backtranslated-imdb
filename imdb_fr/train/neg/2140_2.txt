The mission of Assassin Hauser (John Cusak) is to hit a Middle East oil minister, whose name is Omar Sharif (Neikov), in the country of Turaqistan that is led by American interests. Hauser presents himself as a producer of trade shows to enable him to travel to Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a satire can be so exaggerated that it becomes very boring. Here is too much: the government, the politics, the music, the war, the people that society generally does not accept, and I talked about "war". And, that's what we have here: a very boring film that borders on a very bad nightmare. I still wonder why I continued with the DVD. In addition, there are so many members of the Cusak family in this film that John Cusak seems embarrassed by the presence of the family, or is it just for me? <br /> <br /> It was a film by John Cusak, while a little offbeat, was finally good enough. Not here. Believe that John Cusak participated in the writing and production of this mess. Do what you want. <br /> <br /> There's too much going on in the film, along with constant gunfire, shelling and shouting that you really can not focus or was that the goal? Probably. It just takes too long to set up the hit, which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes. In the meantime, we have jokes meaningless among all the actors. And the chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I do not think so, but you know: the boy ?? girl thing ???? and they needed something to take longer. <br /> <br /> Yes, for what they were supposed to be (offbeat and annoying), the performances of Duff and Kingsley were good. But when I saw Dan Aykroyd's character at the beginning of the show sitting on a toilet dump, I knew that the rest of the show would also go to the tank. I was not wrong. I'm sure some will sing praises about this effort, but if a rose is still a rose under another name, so is the mess ?????????? <br /> remember why I continued with the DVD. I hoped the story would stabilize and run away. Never done. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Gender: No. Nudity: No Language: Yes.
