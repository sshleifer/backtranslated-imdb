There are probably more people who are scared of the dentist than scary little monsters or dolls. Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) is a renowned dentist for many years now, but when he surprises his wife, he cheats on him with the pool purchase, he takes a picture, and he brings his anger and frustration at his job. Well, give a tooth and a mouth to a crazy dentist, and you can probably guess what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> As I said, a brilliant idea, but not delivered too although she should. In particular, the end is a huge disappointment. Last remark: watch Mark Ruffalo (You can count on me, eternal Sun ...) in this one. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
