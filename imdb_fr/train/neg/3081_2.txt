Good sorrow! Although I still maintain that Manos: The hands of fate is the worst act of mental torture available, Hobgoblins has gone terribly close. This ... this ... thing ... insults the public at every opportunity. <br /> <br /> At least films like Space Mutiny and Future War can be viewed on mst3k, this one was hard to get. I was literally writhing on the couch with anxiety. This thing managed to embarrass me - all alone! <br /> <br /> Even if you are an unconditional fan of MST3K and have a mission to see all the experiences, think twice. <br /> <br /> It's so bad.
