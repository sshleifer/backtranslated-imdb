Although I had heard that this movie was a little dry, I look at what Scott Bakula has to do. At the beginning of this film, I had high hopes for the classic and fun ending of Scott-gets-girl and until 20 minutes before the end, it was fine. The plot was crazy and unexpected and very intelligent. I kept my fingers crossed for this to work and that all this was a horrible misunderstanding, until the credits took place, and I realized that there would be no happy ending. Unfortunately, I still had to regret watching her and hurriedly jump into a quantum leap to restore my confidence in the goodness of Grand Scott!
