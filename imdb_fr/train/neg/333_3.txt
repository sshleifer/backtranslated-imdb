I remember that when THE GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986, it was unanimously criticized by critics. I speak so badly that it ended more or less in Eddie Murphy's brilliant career. It begins badly, when Buddhist monks kneel before a child with an empty expression on their face. The bad guys enter the temple <br /> <br /> A child sitting with an empty expression <br /> <br /> Bad guys cutting the monks <br /> <br /> A child sitting with an empty expression < The wicked go out a giant birdcage and lock up the child inside who is now sitting with ... Come on guess? You get the impression that even if they took him for a pajama party at Michael Jackson's Wonderland Ranch, he would still have the same white expression, this movie would be better titled THE WOODEN CHILD <br /> <br /> The sequence of titles begins and being a film of the 1980s, a pop soundtrack is very present. Obviously, it could have been cool and funky at the time, but now, in 2004, it seems very dated. Not only that, but it slams completely with the opening a little bloody. In fact, this is the main problem (and the boy is a serious problem) with this movie - The mood seems to change so much from one scene to another that sometimes it's like watching scenes from totally different films assembled. I personally blame the director, but it should also be emphasized that the screenwriter and the producer should also be held responsible. Did anyone know before the start of filming what kind of movie it was going to be? It's both fantasy, martial arts, a boyfriend movie, a comedy and everything is shit
