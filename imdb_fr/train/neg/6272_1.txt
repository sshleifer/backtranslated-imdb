This is an excerpt from the dialogue of choice offered by the wicked lady assistant of a famous scientist at her prima just before attracting three incredibly stupid college girls into a mansion for behavior modification experiments. Meanwhile, at the local bar, people are drinking and dancing to 80's rock songs. A punk biker makes love with a cycle bitch on a pinball table in front of a crowd, then tries to rape the virgin girl Scientist Jessica (Debra Hunter), in love with another biker (Dale Midkiff, from PET SEMATARY). who, in turn, is in cohorts with the assistant! Back home, the sorority group bimbos swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with men from the bar. A small silver ball (part of the experience) flies in the mouths of victims and turns them into killer and slobbering zombies! <br /> <br /> If that's not enough, there's a hilarious theme song ("Nightmare Fantasy"), rollerblading, serious daisies and a psychic puppet (!?) that warns "DANGER! DANGER! "Just like the LOST IN SPACE robot, hitchhiking is recommended as one of the best ways to recruit men! <br /> <br /> This mess filmed in Florida is so abominable that many sessions are recommended to soak it And, hey, is not NYPD Blue detective Jill Kirkendall who turned CNN reporter Andrea Thompson in one of the most bimbos? It's certain! Supposedly, it started in 1982 and new images were added later for the release of the video in 1985. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10 (and I say that in a good way !)
