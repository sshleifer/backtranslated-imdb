The film has the longest, most tortured and most anguished end of all the movies I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, it starts right after the opening credits. January Jones gives such a wooden performance. I was surprised that she did not stay in flames when she approached the candles of the movie. I do not really remember her in the other films she made (a blessing I must believe) I never criticize an actor's performance because in the film there are too many things that can affect it but in this case, it's so bad that it actually has lines and situations that would be a problem for Meryl Streep, but I sometimes swear she reads from a memory card. other times, I thought she could learn to become disabled or slow down in one way or another.The plot, dialogues and rhythms are as bad as you'll ever see but there is still no excuse for this performance, nor for the director who lets it continue.I'm sorry for the other actors.a small Indian club / breakfast pushed in a rotten burrito then regurgitated by a scriptwriter-director of primary school .
