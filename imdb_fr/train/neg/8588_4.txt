Revenge of the Sith begins with a long sequence of action that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then becomes really boring for the next hour and a quarter, with the same awful dialogue and bland machinations that affected the rest of the previous series. The only thing that improves the procedure is the slow - and I mean slow - implementation of what we know to be the birth of Darth Vader. And when it finally happens, everything is fine. Not great. Not even good. But pretty good. This film is praised because it does not reach the high level of the sky, unlike the previous suites. Instead, it's just turgid, boring and routine. But you must say, wow, these CGI environments are sometimes really impressive. Lightsaber fights? They are all a fuzzy mess. I think the dark side grabbed Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed it. That will make a ton of money, but thank God it's over, this once-revered franchise has been reduced enough to nothing. I saw the show at 12:01 and after, I heard a group of very young children say: wow, it was great! But everyone over the age of eight has grumbled the same: I fell asleep in the middle. It was rather boring. I just thought that seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better. So tell us all.
