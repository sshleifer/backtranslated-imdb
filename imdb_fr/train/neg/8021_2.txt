Visually disconnected and full of himself, the director apparently chose to look for the false depth to turn a 5-minute plot into an 81-minute snoring festival. <br /> <br /> The moments that work in this movie are VERY limited and the characters do not even feel real. How could you feel invested in a main character that has been rendered so surreal? <br /> <br /> Substantially AND stylistically, this sounds like a weird dream sequence. An irregular camera work, awkward silences and lack of action, and what about the small spider image that crawls on the screen? Anyone who has thought of this should go back to film school. It did not make any sense, just cheese, and did not even work stylistically with the rest of the movie (assuming the movie had a style, which is close). What flop.
