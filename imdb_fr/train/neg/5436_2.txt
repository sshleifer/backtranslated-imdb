A friend of mine gave me this movie. One of my friends is now in the hospital where a team of doctors is trying to surgically remove a DVD case from his ***. <br /> <br /> The perspectives of another film by Michael Chabon excited me. After all his novels brought me a lot of entertainment and previous adaptations to the script were excellent, but damn, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the people who did the casting had to be asleep. I imagine that the castings had something like that. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I really like fish." "I marvel, you're hired, take money." <br /> <br /> Then there is the script. I read Chabon, who, I hope, went blind before he could see that piece of dong, and that has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I'm not sure why it annoyed me as it was, but it may be related to listening to a drunk 90-year-old duck hunter with a speech disorder with a malfunction. Right cranial lobe would have been a pleasure compared to the one-liners that these children of the 2nd degree massacre model spat. <br /> <br /> This is a replica of the movie; "If you tell me something that you have never spoken aloud to anyone before, then this moment becomes unique!" Unique? Does he do it? Is it really? Of course, no board. Please, pass me Imodium. I'm going to have a whole band of work. <br /> <br /> The staging is ... well. I have nothing Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just learned that his grandmother exploded or something. Stick to directing comedies. No stick to direct advertisements. <br /> <br /> This film is so horrible that it let me bang my head against a wall so strong that it brought me back to the Stone Age. I give it 2 stars because I do not want to be the guy who watched a 1 star movie.
