First of all, I would just like to say to all who have seen this movie that the actor who played the "Transvestite" is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he is a great actor, even he does not say much about his filmography, he has played in several plays and musicals. He currently resides in Terrace, British Columbia. That's where I come from, he comes to us almost every Saturday * laughs * Well, about the movie, I would not recommend it to anyone who did NOT see it, it's not a movie worthy of being watched, The main reason I found the movie bad is that it never stays in place, it keeps bouncing back in time, so hard to track at times, and second, is really boring * laugh * Even though the game is awesome, the movie just does not compare.
