Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. What else can I say? Kate Jackson must have been desperate to lead. Maybe she should start playing ... well, she was a bad actress. Who would put money to produce something so bad. I love anti-Christ movies and usually have a good laugh and a strange fear, but this one is just Bad Bad Bad. The game of stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera. Special effects, if you can call them that, are laughable. I would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion, you would see the tubes from which the blood spurted. We had to turn off the disk after only 30 minutes. Original copies of films must be destroyed, all records and cassettes must be destroyed and all those involved in the making of the film must reimburse the persons who rented the film. Then, these people should never be allowed to play, direct or film anything other than their own personal movies.
