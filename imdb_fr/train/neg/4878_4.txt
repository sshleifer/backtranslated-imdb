If you want to make a film like this, the threat must be real. Do not surround your friend with a bunch of bonzos. There is no credibility here. The plot is dull and incredible. The acting game is even worse. I thought I was looking at Arthur Lake (Dagwood), who is one of the worst actors in history when I saw the main character. Oh well, at some point, he has to deal with music and go crazy fighting. I do not care. Do you? All these long scenes take place in this austere office (furniture in cardboard or masonite). People talk, smoke and do nothing. Most actions take place in a five-minute sequence. After that, it's over. Do not bother yourself.
