this movie was definitely the worst movie I've seen in my life and I've seen some really bad movies. I did not like the way this film was filmed. all the actors are unknown, and it seems that a group of friends got together and decided to shoot their own film. but it's absolutely horrible. I have never seen a worse movie. the story is so wrong and I just found that it took a long time to get to the end of the film. there was no plot, it was as if it was not planned before the shoot. the story is too weird. I did not like the slowness with which we arrived at the goal of the film. there was no point in even filming this film. if you plan to watch this movie, do not do it. you are only wasting your time.
