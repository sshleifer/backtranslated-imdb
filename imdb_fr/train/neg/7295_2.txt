First of all, the reason why I give this 2-star movie instead of 1 is at least because Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this attempt to make an absolutely useless movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I was excited to read a commentary on a poster that Andrew Stevens in this film gave "the performance of his career." For me, it was the dreadful performance of Stevens that completely ruined this film, and so I was ready to throw all kinds of insults to the person who made the comment above. Then I thought, what else did Stevens do? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. For 17 years since this Columbo film was shot, apparently, each of Stevens' 33 projects since then has been completely shitty, so it's doubtful whether anyone has seen the rest of his career. <br /> <If you like Columbo, look at each of the 69 tracks before watching this one. Do yourself a favor and keep the worst for the end.
