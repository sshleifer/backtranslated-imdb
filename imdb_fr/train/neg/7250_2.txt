After reading the other reviews of this film, I think high scorers are probably paid lackeys in the studios, because the film I saw was absolutely disastrous. This film features breathtaking scenery with breathtaking views, dramatic skies and vast meadows. Unfortunately, when the most memorable part of a movie is the part behind the actors, it must serve as a token of the film, overall, it is an uninspired addition to the western genre that it is best avoided, even at a very reasonable price, on DVD.
