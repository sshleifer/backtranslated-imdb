If there was a 0 star rating, I would gladly distribute it to this absolutely horrible rubbish heap. The fact that the current summary is perfectly correct and if it had been made different, it could have been brilliant only makes things worse. The basic task of locking a group of people into an experiment chamber is acceptable, but WHEN THE EXPERIENCE? All I can see is a group of unsuspecting surfers and blondes discussing music and culture that I do not know or want to know ... The challenges are pathetic and stupid. The goal of reality TV is to show reality. If you set a "challenge", do not play them with exaggerated food accessories and stereotypical cultural elements in the "Friday night games". make them meet a real challenge. And in terms of "winning" money, it's good, if they win! These people are nuts. If only they made the show better, the real idea would be glorious. But it will not happen!
