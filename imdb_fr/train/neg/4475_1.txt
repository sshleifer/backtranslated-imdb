horrible, just horrible! my former roommate used to look at this junk and it made me crazy the book is one of my favorites and it's a shame that some people never know what it really looks like because their first impressions come from the dribble like this. they have changed so much that it is hardly recognizable. which bothers me because the book is like a soap opera, providing enough fodder for modern entertainment. it's like one of those Lifetime movies that say "based on a true story" but are completely fictitious. there is none of the emotion or the depth of the book, just a brainless melodrama. If you are a high school student looking for a way out of reading, I suggest you try another version.
