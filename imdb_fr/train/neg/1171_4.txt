I find it hard to believe that this inert film, turgid and poorly staged was directed by a filmmaker whose other works I liked very much. The experience of enduring THE LADY AND THE DUKE (and no other word that "endure" will suffice), left me in a vile mood, relieved condition only by reading the comment of the user IMDb by ali-112 . Because not only Rohmer tried (successfully) to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century France, but, as ali pointed out, has shown (at the price of alienating his audience) the effects of class consciousness and the revolution she inspired through the eyes of an incredibly elitist woman of her time. The director did an undeniably difficult job, but I wonder if it was worth it, but also for us to observe the poor results of his work.
