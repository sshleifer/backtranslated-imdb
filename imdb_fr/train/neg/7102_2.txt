Okay, I admit I watched this movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (of which I'm a big fan), but I'm not one of those who automatically assign a score of 1/10 to a MST3K movie. Although I hate most of the movies they air, and some of the worst movies I have ever seen, I have enjoyed some MST3K movies. That being said, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (It's no wonder, in fact, that the MST3K authors themselves have stated that this one was one of the worst, do not believe me, check their site.) <br /> <br /> For me, this film is a good example of what NOT to do in filmmaking. The dialogue is very bad, the acting is worse, the cinematography is pathetic, the direction (while perhaps being the best thing in this film) is bad. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is the worst aspect of this film. A few times in this film, the viewer had to wait literally a few minutes for something to happen. Although the minutes do not always sound very long, it can be in a movie, especially in this one. I'm sure it was supposed to create an atmosphere, but I was really bored. It really looked like ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If "suspension of disbelief" means "falling asleep almost during a movie", it does not miss things. But THE SCREAMING SKULL is so horrible, I could never have been interested in anything that really happened in the movie and the "suspension of disbelief" was therefore nonexistent. <br /> <One of the worst movies, and probably the most boring I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
