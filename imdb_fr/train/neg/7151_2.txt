I'm proud to say that I saw the three Fast and Furious movies. Of course, the intrigues are a little ridiculous and they may be a little old-fashioned, but I love car chases, as well as all the fine cars and clandestine midnight races. And I would gladly see a fourth. <br /> <br /> Do you want to know what's the difference between these three and Redline? A decent acting game, a conspiracy a little thoughtful, even if it's about pots and finally, directors who have a clue. All three were made by very competent directors, all took the films in a different, equally exciting direction. Redline seems that the producer chose a dozen women with whom he slept on the casting couch, and did the extras And then the script.Yes.My Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad.This is made for the TV movie 70's bad. <br /> <br /> Yeah, the movie had some cool cars, but you can not really see so much in action, and the action is so badly directed that you can not be excited by the lawsuits, a d if cars do not excite you, why go to a movie like this? <br /> <br /> I'm in the audience with a group of teenagers and I can not help laughing out loud.I start looking dirty but <br /> > Rent the F & F movies. Go to the NASCAR race. Go on a kart track and race as you please. Whatever you do, avoid Redline as a bad cheese.
