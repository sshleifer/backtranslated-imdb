I rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend nor I had ever seen it, even though a mutual friend had told us how "awesome" it was. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm pretty conservative in my views, but I knew it would be pretty liberal given who was running it. Before starting the film, I thought that Michael Douglas would play a popular and compassionate liberal loved by the masses, and that there would be a heavy conservative opponent as his antagonist. But I thought that was where the political declaration would begin and end. <br /> <br /> The plot is solid: the sole president falls in love with a lobbyist. OK, this has a potential that I thought was quite amusing, since the plot was unique. But then, the film turned into a liberal informative advertisement. The film focused more on gun control and environmental issues than the relationship between the president and Sydney (Annette Bening). <br /> <br /> There were several ridiculous premises in this movie: 1) The character playing Sydney A six-digit lobbyist who is a "closer". Could she have been lighter? She was constantly disorganized and seemed impressed by everything. Barely a "closer". I am a saleswoman and she could not "close" the sale of a glass of water to a man dying of thirst. <br /> <br /> 2) Second, is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing the right-wing fanatic? She is the most liberal man in Hollywood and she plays a right wing ideologue. Leave me alone. I liked the way it took on its conservative character and made it as sinister as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) The speech at the end was just ridiculous. The phrase "I am a proud member of the ACLU card" was a joke. First, no president would ever admit something like that, as an active member of an ultra-marginal group. Second, why even bring something like this. You have just insane more than half of the audience of the film that is moderate or conservative. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot was great and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the film went from a "film" to a political declaration on the left, which is why the film failed. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see a big plot ruined by Hollywood that has to force its political views to the audience
