I watched this movie hoping to find a nice and interesting story, but the screenplay was not good at all. The acting game was not better. <br /> <br /> Of course, Shahrukh Khan was there, but he was not enough to make this film "credible" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I read that this film was based on Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovary" and yet I did not see it match the Indian mentality. <br /> <br /> In general, we buy a movie to dream and have a good time, not waste our time and change our mood into worse. I just do not understand how he could get a vote "so high" with an average of 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> So that's the kind of movie you should run away and ignore because he there is nothing to appreciate in it! You will simply lose your time unless you like "dark movie" with "strange and meaningless story".
