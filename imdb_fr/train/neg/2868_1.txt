It is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the murderer of BTK. The events in this film are not even close to the truth. Why they could not make a movie about real events makes no sense since the actual events are more interesting than this invented joke. Do not even waste your time looking at this for free. A small budget and a shameful description of events that should not be considered as a joke is really what this movie did. If they allowed me to give a -10 to this movie, I would do it. The acting was bad and it looks like it was shot on an old video camera VHS 80s. Save your time and money by not watching this movie.
