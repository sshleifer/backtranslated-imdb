It was, until now, the worst movie I've seen in my life, and I've seen some really bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover looked like a decent horror movie. I did not know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? The shooting of the film was scattered and boring. At one point, there is a one-minute scene where no one is talking, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence. All the movie is boring, with annoying and unbelievable dialogues and basically no conspiracy as such. If you rent this movie, watch it with friends and it could make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, launch.
