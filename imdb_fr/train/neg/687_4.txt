I am a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And in addition to them, Charles Butterworth (a very nice supporting actor) was in this movie, so why did not I particularly like him ?! Well, despite a good distribution, it is one of the poorest written and most clichés of "images" that I have ever seen. Given the talent and money spent on making this film, it's shocking to see how slippery the writing was. I knew that the film would be tedious when, many times at the beginning of the film, I found myself predicting exactly what would happen next - and I was always right! And it's not because I'm a kind of "cinema scholar", but because almost no imagination or effort went there. In fact, it seemed almost that the film is only a long series of shots together! In addition, I found it a bit irritating that Fred had treated Carole so badly throughout the film and yet, true to the convention, she finally ran to him. Uggh! There is MORE suspense in a Lassie movie ("will he bring people to save Timmy or the rope he hangs at the break?"). <br /> <br /> Despite the very very tired and cliché scenario, there were some positive points about the film. It was really cool to see Fred look like a broken lump at the end of the movie - it was pretty believable and he did not seem to eat, shave or sleep for days. In addition, Charles Butterworth's "heckling" provided some slightly humorous moments. But all this was not enough to give this film an appearance different from that of a "film B". It's a shame ... it could have been so much better.
