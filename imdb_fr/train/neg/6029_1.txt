If you're wondering where many conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the UN, Israel and international affairs come from, look no further. <br /> <br /> This is not a Hollywood-based supernatural film loosely based on biblical passage. Instead, this film was directed by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) on the political and religious agenda. As a film, the end result sometimes resembles excerpts from a televangelism program (with family prayers and flashes of light through church windows during the harp play). <br /> Hard to believe, but many people literally believe in these things, as presented in the film. And that may make the film important. You will probably not find a more concise statement of the strange views of a large number of your fellow citizens. So, if you visualize it, consider it as a social / cultural document. If you're a fan of all the media, you do not need to be warned of the insidious propaganda and manipulation attempts in the film.
