This film had the potential to be really good, given that some elements of the plot are borrowed from the sci-fi THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always brings a cheesy appeal to his roles. But someone, somewhere, really dropped the ball on this one. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays the role of a monk (!) Who travels to New York to retrieve a key that opens a door under his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years. He must fight the minion, who is a mind that jumps from body to body, like THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL. The minion, of course, wants the key to let out the Antichrist. For the ride, a boring archeologist woman and together, she and Dolph are pursued by the bodies possessed by the henchmen. <br /> <br /> If I make this sound entertaining, forget it. The pace is very clumsy and slow, the acting game is at best mediocre and the fight scenes poorly organized. Dolph somnambulum through his role and launches some of the worst dialogues of his career. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor makes sense in the end when the servant fights an army of machine guns brandishing monks at the monastery. the rest of this film is the most minute. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I really wanted to love that.
