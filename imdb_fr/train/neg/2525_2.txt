This film was, as Homer Simpson would have said, "more boring than the church." Maybe I do not understand it well enough and I thought everything had started well, but after (BEGINNING OF THE SPOILER), Hermann Braun is sent to prison and Maria starts working / sleeping with her boss. to stay awake. Again, this may symbolize something, but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place. (END OF SPOILER). In the end, I do not see why others think it's so good, because I found it extremely boring. By the way, I did not watch this movie of my own free will, because I had to see it for a cinema class.
