The recovery period is the game that is played in this drama and the intrigue of revenge is annulled by the absurd intrigue that sets the stage for the upcoming fireworks. Why would a man get involved in the trophy wife of a ruthless gang leader in the gangster's own house with suspicious henchmen all around? Why would an unhappy wife encourage a stranger's attention and wait for her to carry her away and leave her husband and her boredom behind to live happily with her new love? The hero, here Kevin Costner, had to expect a reaction from the cuckold husband who gives the film an excuse to indulge in senseless gore and violence. Anthony Quinn, great actor he deserved, certainly deserved better, and Madeleine Stowe is the tragic figure who suffers enormously while she clings to his prince charming. Stowe is fine but his Spanish accent does not work. The cameos of less important players are of high quality, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a rock star endangered.
