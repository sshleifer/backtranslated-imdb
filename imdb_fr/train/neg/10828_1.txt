It's not only my opinion of this film, but also the essence of what has been written about it. Now, do not get me wrong either, I'm not an absolute philistine, I did not hate the movie because it was not enough, like "Police Academy 9" or whatever, I appreciate more than my share of high fronts. or artistic stuff, I swear. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" is poor, and I really do not understand why he is apparently so acclaimed. Long breath, complacent and absurd, from beginning to end, there are so few things that could really be what people like so much about the movie. There are high caliber actors that are good enough, and none of them turn into average performance or worse. In addition, my wife (an avowed Tom Cruise) tells me that this is by far her best career performance. But the plot is so completely meaningless, sneaking between the stories of several characters vaguely linked to a snail speed such that even when shocking events are described, they seem so pointless and uninteresting that you find yourself in screaming for someone to blow themselves up or something. . <br /> <br /> It does not help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or understand (well, I did not think so, but I do not like most people, it is true). They all play at length their rather unenthusiastic life stories, demonstrate their character flaws and emotions with ever-complex details and highlight their deep and meaningful relationships with more than one waffle monolith on the way. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack is also terrible, with this irritating and succulent quality that I thought until then unique to the music of Alanis Morisette. <br /> <br /> In total, it was about as enjoyable as three hours Watch an episode of 'Friends' repeatedly while being stung intermittently in the ribs by an upset goat. The piece with the frogs is good though.
