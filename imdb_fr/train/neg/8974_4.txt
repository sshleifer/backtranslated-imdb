this film, I will not call it a "film", essentially concerned nothing and functioned mainly for the popular acts of the time. Yes, the war was in full swing (pun intended), and this film made the happiness of the troops and our audience. <br /> <br /> but take a little more content. <br /> <br /> I loved seeing a young Buddy Rich on drums. the music was good overall. <br /> <br /> but one cameo after another is aging rapidly. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Zero Mostel! So, if you belong to the "greatest generation", as they say, you will definitely enjoy this movie ... <br /> <br />.
