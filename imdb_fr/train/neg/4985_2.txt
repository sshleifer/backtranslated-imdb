In 1993, "the visitors" was a huge success in France. Thus, the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence ranks among the worst ever. <br /> <br /> It's a film that does not keep its promises. Indeed, he is supposed to tell a single story. Jean Reno must leave in the twentieth century and bring back Christian Clavier in the Middle Ages so that time can normally follow its course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century and so it is quite difficult to get him into the Middle Ages is rather difficult ... Instead, the film tells several other stories without being able to follow the main lines. ground. As a result, the film sometimes becomes confused, sometimes a little messy. <br /> <br /> But the film also suffers performances from almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap they were able to avoid in the first film: they go beyond and become annoying. So why did filmmaker Jean-Marie Poiré hire Muriel Robin in the female lead? He made a mistake because he looks uncomfortable and is absolutely pitiful. The other actors are not better: Marie-Anne Chazel is non-existent and Christian Bujeau, unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film contains some good moments with effective gags, but it often falls into vulgarity and ease. Some sequences and dialogues are affected. It also seems hollow because Poiré takes elements that ensured the success of the first film. For example, a girl takes Reno for a close relative of her family and asks her to take part in her wedding. <br /> <br /> A painstaking and disappointing follow-up. Anyway, what is the point of this otherwise commercial film? <br /> <br />
