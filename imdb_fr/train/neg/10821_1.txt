I read the novel Jane Eyre for the first time in 1986. It was around this time that I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and much like the book. Years later, I laid eyes on this version and was horrified. William Hurt is totally wrong as Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a passionate character, where William Hurt describes it as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. It's a story of love and passion, but I could not see it in this version. No, let's go back to the BBC version. A wonderful time is guaranteed.
