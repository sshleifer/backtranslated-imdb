What a desappointment! Piper Perabo is adorable, Tyra Banks is beautiful but pitiful as an actor and the beautiful and talented Maria Bello is lost! Bello must have been embarrassed by some of the lines! The plot, the scenario and the premises are a joke! <br /> <br /> I'm not against silly movies, I think something about Mary is a masterpiece, but Ugly Coyote is a 90-minute loss ..... .. .
