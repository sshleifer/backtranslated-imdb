The sad thing is that it's 87 minutes that I will never come back. I knew it was terrible from the start, with the guy dressed as a whimsical Indian chef on the roof. (See if they could get away with this in 2008) My 10 year old boy loves baseball so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. Although he seemed to enjoy some parts of it, I must have shuddered when I heard all this coarse useless language. Bad, bad movie. It was a terrible scam of Bad News Bears. Completely shameless and completely predictable. I do not care about a predictable movie if it's done right, but it was not.
