I pity people who call kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan', maybe for them, ulagam is tollywood! Comeon Guys..This film is a thrill-free thriller .. <br /> <br /> get out of your ulagame and watch high-class thrillers like The Usual Suspects or even The Silence of the Lambs. <br /> <technically good but the style rather than the kamal stuff does not look like a policeman, there are no shivers either to drag and boring until the end. You could save 3 hours of your life if you do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> kamal at its best is the best of tollywood
