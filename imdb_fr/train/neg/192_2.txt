The only good thing about this movie is the beauty of the landscapes. This film was long and boring. The minister should have withdrawn from the pulpit when his son Paul departed from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can his boys take the name of the Lord in vain while this film comes from a Presbyterian milieu? It's not right. I wish Paul had been trained at the beginning of the river without a boat at first to spare us Paul's idiotic, sneering, and selfish story (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler that Norm wants to save but does not know what to do anymore. It's very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites that Paul is standing up for because of his American daughter. It was the only part that was of interest and might have become a true wild west. What we see only is a sleepy city where the sons of the two ministers have nothing to do but 1. Norm hunt a lame girlfriend and take care of his family and 2. Paul invent silly stories at the store of the paper while scratching his head and taking a lot of swigs and tying a lot of flies. I would rather watch a fishing show that features this movie - which will never be.
