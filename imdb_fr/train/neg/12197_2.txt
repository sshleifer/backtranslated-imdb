Beast Wars is an overestimated, overestimated and overestimated series. Let's meet the characters of this odious show whose creators had to play acid to try to make such a show. <br /> <br /> Cheetor- Seriously, they need censorship bars on this guy. How is it that he does not bring out the viewers in the same voice as the baby Taz? (At least Razzoff from Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is voiced by Slip & Slide) Blast Action - If you want a series of shows that fears, buy G4 Tranceformers Cybertron - A show that should take place in the restroom. Good Job Creators (Sarcasm) Show it both delayed and boring (at least, the Super Mario games are better) This show has had a lot of followers who have reported it, but I believe it has been canceled for his own good.
