this film is of the MANDINGO & DRUM <br /> <br /> it's terrible, BUT they are 100% better than these guts, <br /> <br /> Badly acted and manufactured Oliver Reed is the main name & Eartha Kitt is also in it. Too bad. The rating is 1/2 * as low as you can get <br /> <br /> as always <br /> <br /> jay harris
