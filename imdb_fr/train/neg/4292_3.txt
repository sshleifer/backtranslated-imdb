I usually like to watch Burt Lancaster's films - especially when he has to go crazy with his awesome screen presence, as in Elmer Gantry. However, his greater strength, his magnetism, was also sometimes his greatest weakness, for he seldom underestimated, if ever, anything. And it's this lack of subtlety that really prevents The Rainmaker. I now understand that her character was supposed to be some sort of showman, but the way Katherine Hepburn might fall under her spell is totally inexplicable. She's supposed to be smart but she does not seem to be, when Lancaster blarney is thrown on the screen! On top of that, the story is perhaps one of the strictest films I've ever seen and it's all too obvious that it's a movie based on a play. It looks like the film was shot mainly in a sound stage and not in the big west, as it was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a very overestimated movie.
