Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again. If he does, he should be arrested on the spot ... at least for petty larceny. Anyone who pays even a penny to rent one of their garbage should make a claim and be compensated. It was innocently my first vision of his "work" ... and it will be my last. Ed Wood looks terribly good right now. <br /> <br /> When I put this shit back at the video store, I will personally ask that it be removed from the shelves. As an active supporter of gay cinema, I am furious and irritated that this distorted and extremely talented child-man is allowed to distribute and pack something like this, with a nice boy from the front cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who luckily did not a IMDb) and an interesting synopsis at the back, used as bait, then sold as a rental "movie". Believe me, this has no place anywhere else. it's just not a film, in the broadest sense of the word. This kind of offensive and irresponsible mail can only hinder efforts to promote and support homosexual cinema (hell, the rights of homosexuals in general!). Those who will want to rent this because of the cover will be disappointed. Gabel is not as flattering on the film as on the cover, and he appears once or twice without a shirt - that's all. Instead, the simple Mroavich inflicts on us his own filthy and desolate nudity of dough boy. <br /> <br /> This "thing" that he "assembled" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. He and his friend Michael Habousch (who, as I understand it, throws similar sordid garbage) are terrible in this regard. Mraovich deliberately presents himself as an absolute non-talent (in all areas), desperate to attract all the attention of the "loser" he can for himself. He is to be pitied.
