It's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this movie. But the problem is that it's not very good. There was nothing really original in the film and, even if the plot was well presented, the main characters were a little too superficial and you did not bother. <br /> <br /> Fairly bland (and sometimes downright bad) photo leaves a little to be desired but I guess you can not expect too much from people who are just doing a low-budget movie for the devil. It is unfair to review the film and compare it to other big budget movies. But alas, that's what you have to do. In itself, it's not very good. And compared to others, it's still not very good. But it's not without its good points! I liked the plot. It was built pretty well and well connected at the end. Sometimes, in really dark scenes, he also managed to create a goose-bump sensation. <br /> <br /> However, the film fails to impress. The characters are almost non-existent and we do not care. Any of them could die, but it is possible to identify the "survivor" very early.
