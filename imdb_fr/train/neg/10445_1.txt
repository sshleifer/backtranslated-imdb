It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, the pathetic script and the biggest question is how this rather discreet script got into the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like. all kinds of movies, from the deepest dramas to the most masculine, kill everything you see as a type of movie, so I can not say I'm difficult. I have been trying to find something to compare it, but I can not think of anything that fits this, maybe spacecraft soldiers. in comparison, its effects are excellent. The superb actors play and the script should be awarded. You know, when a movie is bad in a funny way, well, it's not one of those that kills your soul minute by minute.
