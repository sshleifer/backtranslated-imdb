I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and thought it would be nice to see places I know in a movie. I really knew when I got into the movie that I was not going to have the jokes inside, so I was not surprised when I sat with the deer in the lighthouses' gaze. What surprised me was the anti-non-mormon actions that were placed in this film. <br /> <br /> I know it's a Mormon movie for LDS church members, but I found it shocking because of the typical stereotype of people who are not of their faith. All the non-Mormons, who were not numerous, drank, smoked and had an attitude of incredible selfishness, why? <br /> <br /> It pissed me off about this movie, they made the Mormons so pure, yet the rest of I guess the state of Utah is filled with punk psychologists just because they do not follow the scriptures of the LDS Church. <br /> <br /> I can understand that the intrigues revolve around all members of the LDS, but one might think. Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which is not even close to the truth. And as I said, the non-Mormons in the movie have been portrayed as drunken morons, please! <br /> <br /> I guess I just do not understand because I do not belong to their faith and I guess I never will.
