Well, I like to be honest with the whole audience that I bought it because of Kira's sex scenes, but unfortunately, I did not see much. All the sex scenes were short and random with all the odd, old-fashioned background music, like all other B-movies - it just does not look like two people fucking. There is a very small plot towards the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Whoa !!! it's shocking !!! Why do not we name this film for an Oscar? I can not imagine what the film would look like if it was rated R (mine is imported from the UK, ranked 18). Conclusion? Put it down and stay away so you do not become a jerk like me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
