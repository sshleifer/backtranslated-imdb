They really can not become more stupid than this movie about 3 losers trying to capture the spirit of college during the annual spring festivities in many of our higher education schools. The problem is that these losers are trying to do that 15 years after their college years, when we are in charge of monitoring the daughter of a senator who is prepared to become the next vice-president. <br /> <br /> The trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular, but of course she gets out of it all. The girls live drunken rages, exotic dances and other absolute absurdities. <br /> <br /> It really can not be worse than this horrible movie.
