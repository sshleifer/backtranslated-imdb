In a recent biography of Alec Guinness, I did not find much about To Paris With Love. I'm sure Guinness did the movie to get a free trip to Paris. The film has no other reason to exist. <br /> <br /> Paris is of course photographed with this wonderful opening of Guinness and his son on the Champs-Elys√©es with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, the situation is deteriorating from there. <br /> <br /> There is simply no chemistry between Guinness and the girl with whom he has a brief adventure in Paris. According to Guinness's recent biography of Guinness by Piers Paul Read, Guinness positively hated this girl and found her conduct unprofessional. As for what Odile Vernois thinks of his co-star, no record is available. They have as much chemistry as two sterilized cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good time in the film that comes directly from one of his comedies Ealing while climbing a tree trying to recover a badminton shuttlecock. But I would not wait for the movie to watch it. <br /> <br /> At least, Alec had a trip to Paris with this deal.
