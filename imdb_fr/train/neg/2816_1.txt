It's one of those movies you see in the video store that you just have to get because it's so horribly bad. And indeed, we could not take more. There was a lot of fast progress going on. <br /> <br /> But then we came across a scene in which Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (his name makes me lose my head at that moment). Cripes. I have never watched so many scenes from a movie (I'm forty). And I have never laughed so much in my life. You see, Englund has this thing to show his loins. I saw the film for the last time a few months ago, but I do not stop laughing while typing. Anyway, the scene is a montage of shots - Englund tore the girl's lingerie, Englund riding a naked horse and a mysterious woman falling on a snake's head. It's the absolute genius. You must see it for yourself.
