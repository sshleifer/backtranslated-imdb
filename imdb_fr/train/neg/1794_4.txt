It's not your typical story of vamp, bram stoker or rice here. an original vampire story. these vampires are genetic mutants that sunlight does not disturb. they are pure evil. <br /> <br /> the film is not perfect. many actors are clearly amateurs. the two leaders playing van helsing and rallying the vampire chick are pretty good. the film is intensely violent and can disturb some people. In addition, it is full of scientific details that many people will have trouble understanding and may be bored. I was sold on the smart scenario and the couple of good performances. we do not know how successful this film could be if it had a larger budget and received a mass distribution
