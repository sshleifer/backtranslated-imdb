You expect to watch a comedy with a cast directed by Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. These expectations are further enhanced when the film is directed by Stanley Donen, including DAMN YANKEES !, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE, whose sense of comic was so obvious. For the first five minutes or so, it seems that these expectations can be met, then? Nothing. What is supposed to be a light comedy plunges into a leaded and hard melodrama, with a sneering laugh to have. <br /> <br /> The newcomer, Suzy Parker, has often been criticized for her performance or absence in this film, but in a film in which even the great Cary Grant often appears flat and wooden, Parker seems unfair. Not even a light as brilliant as Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have changed the fate of this sinuous, monotonous and totally useless scenario, which dragged on and dragged the spectator's attention and patience. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, continues to try to give some vitality to the procedure, but the scenario is horrible and can not be revived. The desperate and insane effort to bring a half-hearted laughter into the final moments of the film only reinforces the insult of the wounds. <br /> <br /> This film is only a big disappointment at all levels.
