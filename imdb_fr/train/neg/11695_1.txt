Calling a movie like "Thinner" bad is like calling Earth or Pauly Shore without talent. No news, but that's what people want to know. How did they arrive? This book was good, even though it was a small derivative of others "pay attention to what you want" like. Burke plays the role of an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by his father (Constantine of "Room 222" on television) at the rate of several kilos per day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it starts well, but why involve the gangster (Mantegna)? Why shoot with automatic weapons? Why make something so dependent on the FX? I thought it would have been much more effective if he had focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss madness, disease, death, gypsy tradition, and so on. <br /> <br /> But no, it's not to be. Remember, we are talking about Stephen King. <br /> <br /> And the end ... almost identical to the book, but a little too talkative. In fact, the whole film speaks too much, considering that it must explain each plot entrusted to us. Not that I expect "The Dead Zone", but I could have done without another "Pet Sematary", thank you anyway. <br /> <br /> A star to at least try doing a decent mid-point makeup job. However, only the rest of the film remains ... say it with me ... "Diluent".
