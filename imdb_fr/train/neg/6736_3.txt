No film making here, however it's not even the important issue. How is he doing in his efforts to become a competent date film - and a star vehicle? <br /> <br /> The formula requires a pretty female actress at the Ryan or Aniston - check; there is an integrated television audience! <br /> <br /> Add to that obese and complacent men, which usually include the ex-boyfriend / fiance problem - check. <br /> <br /> Assemble a field that optimizes the possibilities of financing the stars. So far, so good. <br /> <br /> What is the male lead role? It must instantly piss off all women in the film and the public (and gay flight attendants). But ... he can not be brave enough to threaten the male audience, and he can not overshadow the star. Roll the cameras ... <br /> <br /> The problem is that Messing thinks she's still in a sitcom ... she only has one presentation: as a wide-eyed doormat which she made a career. A capable actress could have succeeded after the love scene, where things quickly plunged into the soap foam. <br /> <br /> You can not help but feel good about Mulroney ... you can read on his face that he sees through all this. He got all the respect of a .260 threshing machine. This time, he hits one on the warning trail, and no one knows what to do, as he picks up the plate at home.
