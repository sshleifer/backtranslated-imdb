I just saw this movie in preview on MTV. I must say that it was extremely mediocre (at its best). The dialogue does not explain the story very well, and I felt that there was a lot of intrigue. There is not a nice character in this adaptation because of a bad acting. I just think all the characters are too possessive when it comes to someone they love. In addition, the love of Cate and Heath seems very incestuous. They are more like a brother and a sister than lovers. I do not understand why the father would accept such a thing under his roof. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and that I enjoyed watching in previous films, but as I said, it is extremely difficult to love one of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was horrible, which was a complete shock. She was terrible as Edward's older sister, and there were just not enough lines for Aimee Osbourne to be able to criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great to see him in something new and even though his character was a bit weird, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, but they were hissing and too dramatic. <br /> <br /> I just did not like this movie, nor its music. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band, MxPx, but this little appearance would not convince me to see this movie again. MTV did a remarkable job convincing me that it was a movie he was not. I just described something completely different.
