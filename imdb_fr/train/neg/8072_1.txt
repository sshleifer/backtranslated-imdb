(One or more possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is most likely the worst film released in the movie theater. Nothing makes sense, there is a plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead. The whole movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that are not really related at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> It does not exist, the work of the camera is jerky and the scenario is so confusing that the film is even harder to watch. <br /> <br /> I was always waiting for something to link the movie together but nothing came. Certainly the worst film of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
