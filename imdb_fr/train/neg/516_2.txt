Ever notice how, in his later films, Burt Reynolds' laughter sounded like a cry-down brake? <br /> <br /> Must spend too much time with Hal Needham. <br /> <br /> And the look of "Stroker Ace", way too much. <br /> <br /> Can you believe this is based on a book? Me neither, but it was the case. And probably not a best seller, I bet. <br /> <br /> Burt is another good old boy from the NASCAR circuit who meets Beatty as a fried chicken mogul with drawings from his team. Anderson provides what interest of love there is and Nabors makes his umpteenth impression of Gomer Pyle as a mechanic / best friend Lugs. <br /> <br /> Many people here are friends of Burt or Hal. Others must have needed work. And even the real NASCAR drivers come on the scene and are looking for more talent than those with a SAG card. <br /> <br /> As for laughter, Bubba Smith (before the "Police Academy") gets them as a Beatty driver. And Petersen, in full fashion Elvira, receives many laments from a lady eager to know Lugs well. TRUE OK. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Burt wasted so much time and effort in a movie like "Stroker Ace", that it mattered little or nothing. They did not bother to write a character for him. Why bother to act? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly for Petersen and for the catch in the end. Now they are funny.
