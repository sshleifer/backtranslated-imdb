This film is a perfect adaptation of Flick Unfaithful English. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran the one of Olivier and Malikka, the role of the perfect misleading wife of Lane. They changed the second half of the film to fit the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even in this case, the film bears all traces of Infidels, although it can not catch up with the original. It was a cheap soft porn of Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran has played more roles like this and has even been dubbed the serial killer. In the future, if Indian filmmakers plan to remake a film in English, they must examine the feasibility of the plot with Indian censors. Although the film was bombarded at the box office, the actors were unduly recognized. In the future, filmmakers should be a little more cautious when redesigning an Oscar-nominated movie. <br /> <br /> That said, it's not a family film, so be very careful when you watch it at home, with your family.
