The writer had a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took him so far away from the movie that they were nearly made unassailable. Basic elements such as character development have been overlooked at best. Inconsistencies have also raised their ugly heads. A massive mansion in the middle of the rural Irish countryside? Characters "appearing" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very good times, could I add)? Overall it was not "bad". I rated it 4, mainly because of the story and talent of Alison Elliott.
