I must say that the viewing of this film was very curious and that this film was considered a notorious disaster by the 20th Century Fox, in 1970. It also appeared on several lists of critics of bad films, which did not that strengthen its interest. It was enough for me to see what made this film so bad. After seeing it, I think I have my answers. Although I would say that it makes viewing curious, the acting, the staging and the script are so bad to laugh that the so-called satire has completely disappeared. Racquel Welch seems to be trying to carry the film, but after the opening sequence of the sex-change operation, the movie is so depressed that she can not handle the task alone. John Huston in the role of Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help, because he licks and eyeing on the screen, he sometimes seems to wonder what he's doing there. Rex Reed bounces as Myron, his alter ego, and even has his own masturbation scene celebrated. Congratulations for the beginnings! Farrah Fawcett plays a silly blonde; she certainly seemed convincing in this role. But, of course, the most notorious role probably went to Mae West. The sight of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face making sexual insinuations seemed more appropriate for a horror movie. I do not want to put this font personally; but in this film, no one is handsome. The direction seems so insecure and non-existent that the film is not only bad, but boring. Add some old movies from old stars and the movie becomes even more disconnected. To everyone's tastes, to everyone who loves it, and I was happy to have seen it at least, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that he has always been known to be from the beginning.
