Kitten Natividad, film celebrity Russ Meyer, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has discovered breast cancer. So she goes to South America to get a special fruit (Crockazilla?) Supposed to have healing powers. After falling on some of this fruit (which seems to be plastic bananas on stems), chastity is endowed with mystical magical powers that make it a superhero, specifically the Double D Avenger. Note that she also wears a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, all this seems very good. In execution, well, it leaves more than a little to be desired. It seems that Chastity owns a pub and a local strip-tease band is upset by the fact that it is taking over their belongings. Some of the strippers (including Haji, also known for his film Russ Meyer) will lose it. Of course, chastity defends itself as the Double D Avenger. Watch her take a "Wonder Woman" ride to change into an outfit and lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame double senses fly as if there is no tomorrow. With the crazy theme song being played over and over again, this comes across as a tweaked "live action" children's show from the '70s with adult content, although it's not graded, it could probably be s' shoot at worst with PG-13. And it's probably a blessing that faded stars stay well covered. This makes the films of Doris Wishman on Chesty Morgan incredibly beautiful in comparison. Special appearance of Forest J. Ackerman but what. Very stupid, and I never buy another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10
