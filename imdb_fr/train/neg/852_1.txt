I will stay brief. This "adaptation" of King's wonderful book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course, there are many fans of Kubrick and Nickolson on this site and, as a result, this film has mysteriously found its way into the top 250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is laughable like Torrance and Shelley Duvall as well. The story, which has nothing to do with the book, is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes. <br /> <br /> My advice to people who have not read the book and want to understand the characters in this story: stick to the TV series .... <br /> <br /> > Oh, and those who say that Kubrick was perfectly entitled to destroy King's story because King is ... not a good writer should stick to criticism of "masterpieces" as " the big eyes closed ".
