There are so many negative reviews on "Stay away, Joe" here I just can not stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen. Here is one side you have not heard yet. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's films are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason: they are perfect movies for pure relaxation, because I do not have to think when I look at them. . This means that I do not have to worry about missing a complex plot because there is never a proper plot to start. I can just put on my shoes, grab a beer, sit down, disconnect my brains and enjoy all the wacky and catchy rock n 'roll tunes of the most popular decade. <br /> <br /> In my books, "Stay away, Joe" definitely falls into the category "so bad it's good". Now, if you're like me and enjoy "the value of the trash", that's the ultimate 1960s camp experience. It's so bad that it's almost surreal to look at and when you think it's not can not be worse, it surprises you in the most imaginable way. In the end, you are so surprised by all the new levels of stupidity that you simply do not know whether to laugh or cry. In a nutshell: I like it because it's so much fun that there was a generation that made films like this. I still give him 1 in 10, but once he reaches the last 100 points, he will instantly become a classic of the bad movie.
