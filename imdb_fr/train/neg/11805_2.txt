Look at the original with the same title of 1944! This is done for the TV movie, it's just awful! Although he uses (as far as I know) about the same dialogue, it just does not work! Is acting the poor leader? OK, so it's done for TV, but why look at a bad copy, while you can get your hands on the superb original? Especially that you will be spoiled by the plot and you will not enjoy as much of the original as if you had already watched! <br /> <br /> There are a few things that are different from the original (it's shorter for once), but all go for the worse! The actors who play the roles here, just do not do the trick! You simply do not believe them and that could surpass the performance of Edward G. Robinsons compared to the original? If you wish, do not look at it until you have seen the original and even then you will be very brave if you look at it all the way! It's almost a sacrilege!
