Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Begins with an opening scene that is a great example of absurd comedy. A formal audience of orchestra is transformed into a mad and violent crowd by the crazy songs of its singers. Unfortunately, the whole time remains absurd, without a general narrative, which ultimately makes it too disgusting. Even those of the time should be extinguished. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level, it is better than you think with a good cinematography of the future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
