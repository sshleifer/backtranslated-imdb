I think Jason Lee has huge potential, but it was the wrong vehicle to try to be a star. The plot is awful, the comedy is awful. I laughed twice, I think of relief, because in retrospect, they were pretty lame jokes. I found myself scared of Fletch's future and had to comfort myself by saying it was the movie that was flawed, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are exciting, but I recommend looking at the still photos on this site to find out, instead of this movie. Save your time. 1 star
