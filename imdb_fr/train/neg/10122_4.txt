Yet another first Alfred Hitchcock film that seems to have been made out of contractual obligation. As with Juno and the Paycock, you can say that Hitchcock had little interest in this movie. There is almost no style or craftsmanship. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple, who earns money and goes on a cruise, which is a testamentary test for their marriage. Emily has a chance to start a new life with a rich man, who falls in love with her, but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband. It may seem more believable if Fred was not a completely insensitive and pompous donkey who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife to another woman. The couple ends up staying together, but the film lacks a real reconciliation scene. The third act goes in a completely different direction, the couple failing on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry gives a very moving performance as a faithful wife of an unfaithful husband. That's about all you can say for this one.
