"It could mean the end of the white race!" gasps a general while a dozen indigenous zombies roam the battlefields in Europe during the "Great War". The purpose of an expedition is to put an end to this type of situation in the long-lost city of Kennif-Angor, and to leave the battlefield clear so that honest and honest whites kill each other by the dozens thousands. <br /> <br /> It's a bit difficult to say when people are zombies or not in this movie because the acting is so much wood. Even in 1936, the game in this film is bad. From a previous decade. It looks like it comes from a correspondence school book entitled "How to act" <br /> <br /> ------------- Chapter Three: Emotions ----- - ------ <br /> <br /> "How to express fear and disgust (Woman) Clench both fists Place the fist with one hand on the heart Open the mouth to make it scream Place the other fist, palm down, hold the pose more than 10 seconds later than necessary, then quickly turn the head 90 degrees away from the direction of a hated and sobbing object. "<br /> < br /> "How to have a difficult, emotionally charged scene with an ex-fianc√© Explain your love for someone else DO NOT make eye contact, do not move, show no emotion. do not move your eyes too much when you read the lines on the wall of the studio. <br /> <br /> To give us a respite from the leaded action of the director, the director cleverly cuts long breaks where nothing happens. except that the film continues to scroll through the projectors. Thus, 35 minutes of history are completed in 60 minutes. <br /> <br /> The revolt of the zombies is so slow! Freed from mental slavery, the armies of the ex-zombie henchmen turn to their old master by slowly climbing the hill, then stab a little door and break a window. "Yes ... let's go ... oh, I do not know either, let's go get him, Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana." (Although I have just found some hidden symbolism, Jagger has been photographed by an indigenous man as a kind of ironic counterpoint to all the natives being shot by the Germans at the beginning of the film, see, even the needy do not want end of the white run!) The hunt (so-called) through the swamp thrown back is hilarious and is worth only the price of the admission ticket. Roy D'Arcy spends all his time camping, but he is completely lost, like Colonel Mazovia. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting moment in this film. A nice little montage of native zombies and white members of the cast who fall in love with bad eyes. face after face, fade. It works, although there is a strange little shine in the middle of each close-up, as if a frame had been cut. I guess it must be the frames of Neg Cutters between fades. <br /> <br /> Watch out with friends and with a silly mood.
