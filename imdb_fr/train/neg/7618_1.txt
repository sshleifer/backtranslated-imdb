It's not cinema. It's not talent. It is not informative. It's not scary. It's not funny. It's nothing at all. <br /> <br /> I got it because my cousin was saying, "Diablo! COOL!" Yes indeed. The only nice thing about this experience is the fact that I did not buy it but rented it instead. <br /> <br /> It's shot like a bad soap opera. No wait. The soap operas at least look professional. This? It looks like it was shot with someone's camcorder. It's horrible! Wretched! It's sux. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is hateful! WHO IS this director anyway? I do not even care enough to watch it. He pushes! The performances of these poor, unsuspecting actors were far better than what this shit deserved. <br /> <br /> 2.6 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> That saves about .3 / 10 on the "A" scale of ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend :.
