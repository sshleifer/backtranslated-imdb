Personally, I would advise people to stay away from this movie. It's generally boring to watch and the fights are poorly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends version of this movie on DVD, you will only be able to listen to Bey Logan's audio commentary. <br /> <br /> But in any case, since when is a Ninja movie worth watching? I can not think of anyone and, frankly, I do not wish. <br /> <br /> Overall, when it comes to movies, I have a golden rule: avoid movies containing the word "Ninja".
