The worst movie title of all time is one that is distributed quickly and often. Most of the time, this is an exaggeration, but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark, who is on the list of the real candidates: Plan 9 of Outer Space, Battlefield Earth and the Adventures of Pluto Nash. <br /> <br /> As I watched the 90 minutes, I found it difficult to stay awake even as I tried to laugh at the movie. But alas I felt alone in the dark (I was going to try to avoid the pun but I could not resist) as I looked around in the hope of seeing Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Alas, my friends and I had to provide a comedy throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie itself. Let's talk about the action and effects since this should be the only positive aspect of the film. The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xenos in Aliens (they even call them Xenos) and the creatures of Pitch Black. It can become invisible at random (and I assure you it's random) and be hurt by the light. There are also small centipede creatures used to control humans that turn them into something that looks like a zombie. All these elements are accompanied by obsolete special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and impossible to follow. People shooting at random on a blue screen scene or in an empty scene with inserted monsters. The light flashes quickly on a dark screen, which burns your pupils while bad rock music resounds in the background. <br /> <br /> And those were the strong points. The story revolves around a paranormal investigator (Slater) whose idea to look hard is to wear a black tshirt with a black trench coat and not to shave for 2 days. An archaeologist (Reid) rather inept. And a government agent (Dorff) whose lines involve barking the order. All three should be ashamed of their performances (not that they have really done a good job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers in the movie, I suppose. The film contains the most delicate love scene I have ever seen in between. <br /> <br /> Then comes the plot. Frankly, the parts that make sense are not interesting. The rest is illogical at best. The holes in the plot may contain the collective ego of the three stars. The film begins with a text and a voice explaining the past. This opening lasts more than a minute and the viewer already knows that he is going to have something terrible. This opening narration is then repeated in a very clumsy and cumbersome manner in the clumsy dialogue in the rest of the film. And the end did not make an ounce of meaning. Not only did it make no sense in the film world, it just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally, the direction of a Uwe Boll. Disgrace is all that can be said. Its use to shake the camera to simulate the suspense. His lack of direction with the actors. Just watch Reid in scenes where she is not in the center of the stage. The complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects. And finally, choosing to use the voiceover to explain something that should be painfully obvious to viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to see this show in a second theater. And although the laughter my friends and I have provided was worth every quarter, I would advise people to avoid paying more for this film. Catch about 3 friends and split the cost of the rental and destroy this movie. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Uwe Boll. Shame on you Tara Reid. Shame on you, Christian Slater. Shame on you, Stephen Dorff. Shame on anyone associated with this movie.
