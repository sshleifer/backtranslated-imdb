This is a review of The Wizard, not to be confused with The Wiz, or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a film from the late 80's about the ability of a very quiet boy to play video games and walk through the opening credits. The Wiz is a useless update to The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is the guy who stuck 100 straws together and allowed one kid to drink it. <br /> <br /> Now that we got it all Let me say this: There is really no reason to see this movie. It's just a 100-minute ad on Nintendo designed to capitalize on Powerglove, the legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the broadest possible sense because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team that has never played Nintendo and is run by a less stylish man than my grandmother. Maybe if the writer and director sat down and played games together, they would realize that they were about to film garbage and instead went to the vocational school to learn how to install stereos for the car. hope it has been a rewarding experience for you. This is certainly not for me. In fact, I think I might have lost a bit of talent watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you go to the video store and you see the Wiz, the wizard and the Wizard of Oz sitting on the shelf in a pretty little row, let them all go by and play Duck Hunt instead.
