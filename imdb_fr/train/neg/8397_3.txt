After reading the previous reviews, I'm just happy not to be the only person who remains confused, especially in the last 20 minutes. We see John Carradine twice down in a pit and close the lid after him. I was anxiously waiting for an explanation for this strange behavior ... naturally, I thought he had something to do with the evil events of the house, but since he was killed by the first corpse that rises (called hereinafter Zombie # 1), these scenes made absolutely no sense. Please, if anyone knows why Carradine keeps going down to the graves, let us follow! <br /> <br /> Since all the action is limited to the last 20 minutes, I will try to summarize. John Carradine goes to the cemetery to investigate and is strangled by Zombie # 1. So far so good. But then we have the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, filming at the cemetery in the moonlight, discover Carradine's corpse. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from where Zombie # 1 emerged, but Ireland manages to tilt it into the open grave instead, and PRESTO! Strickler appears as Zombie # 2! Yes, I guess we can deduce that Strickler was dead from the beginning (a witch?), But why he went from his normal appearance to a rotting flesh-stained version by stealing from Zombie's grave # 1 is never Explain. (Considering how extremely slow these zombies are, I thought he would have preferred to stay in his "normal" form until the conclusion of his business). This scene also raises a question: who is the # 1 zombie? We can only assume that Zombie # 1 is one of the first victims of the murder shown in the opening credits of the film, but who knows which one, or why he has a particular grudge against the film crew. <br /> <br /> Ireland sees this transformation and flees, we see the same EXACT Zombie N Â° 2 plane sneaking between the trees as we saw for Zombie # 1. to a momentary confusion about the number of zombies present). Then, in the best horror movies of the 1950s, Ireland manages to stumble by fleeing. He conveniently hits his head on the small gravestone of Faith Domergue's dead cat (was not John Carradine so nice of carving a tombstone for a cat he barely knew?) <br /> <br /> > Meanwhile, Zombie # 1 has been in ruins at home. He easily sends three members of the film crew, then climbs the stairs. Faith Domergue hears it and thinks that her lover, John Ireland, is back from his night shoot. Seeing that it's only zombie # 1, she screams and retreats to a bedroom where she retrieves the Irish revolver. While starlet Carole Wells is showering at that moment and can not hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (who is boozing and hurting a mirror in her bedroom) does the same. Taking his sweet time (and only after a few extra swigs of his hip flask), he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this film is the slowness with which the stars scream and the shots are slow). Domergue returns to the hallway armed and ready, but confuses Macauley with Zombie # 1 and shoots him six times! He makes a nice acrobatic jump over the railing, then a horrified Domergue steps back, right in the arms of No. 1 Zombie waiting for him. <br /> <br /> Carole Wells is now out of her shower and dries up when she hears shots and cries of Domergue; she also feels no urgency to run to investigate. So, during this time, Zombie # 1 has time to put Domergue on the neck with a rope. Wells sees Domergue's suspended body and faints. The next time we see her, she is in a stream outside the house (???) - but we'll talk about it later. In the meantime, Ireland has regained its spirits and falls into the house where it discovers the bloody carnage of Zombie # 1. Even though Ireland has just stumbled upon three people murdered, it is more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined! Fortunately for him (and the public), Zombie # 1 throws film equipment from the 2nd floor. This is the last time we see Zombie # 1. At this point, the audience receives a montage of all the dead, showing that the new ones "reflect" the old ones. How deep is it? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Zombie # 2 approached home (remember, these zombies move as slowly as Molasses in January) where she happens to see Carole Wells float in a stream and fish its way out. How did she get there? Did Zombie # 1 take her inside, throw her inside, and then zoom out just in time to crush John Ireland? Apparently, one of the first victims was drowned in the tub, so Wells must also drown (but why in a stream, instead of being in the tub, is never explained). Zombie # 2 never comes home (everyone is dead now, anyway, thanks to Zombie # 1), but he brings Carol Wells back to the graveyard. While the end credits appear on the screen, we see Zombie # 2 with her dead love still in her arms, descending into the open pit. <br /> <br /> The viewer wonders: yes, but was not that Zombie? The tomb # 1? Why is Zombie # 2 installed? And what if Zombie # 1 arrives and wants to go back - will Zombie # 2 let him, or will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share the grave and the deceased Carole Wells? And what about John Carradine, now deceased - where will he stay? After all, previous scenes, we know that he is clearly at home in the grave ... If this synopsis of the plot of the final left you confused, do not worry, you are not alone.
