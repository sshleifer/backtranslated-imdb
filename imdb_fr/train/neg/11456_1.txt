This is one of those movies that makes you think: Hulk "The real American" would he do the same? Frankly, I do not think so and he would have been right. I am Italian, I can not be proud of my country for several reasons, but I would never have rowed for another team (the French for example), simply because I am in love with Juliette Binoche. In addition, the protagonist does not fall in love with a British girl at the end of the film but a compatriot, so why row against Yale. As far as acting is concerned, all players act very badly. And then, you know, I hated this atmosphere of "dead poets society". In fact it's another film that I hate.
