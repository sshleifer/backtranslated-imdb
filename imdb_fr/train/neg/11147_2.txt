I have nothing to say about this movie. It's so bad that I had to put my first comment on the IMDb website to help some viewers save time and do something more interesting, instead of watching this "movie" ... everything will be fine Even looking at the walls is better. <br /> <br /> And because I have to write at least 10 lines of text, I also tell you that it's a low-budget movie, a bad actor, no actor's name, a stupid idiot like the wolf, etc. And the story does not bring anything new, the special effects are created in the style of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The film is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So have fun! ;) (do not watch this movie)
