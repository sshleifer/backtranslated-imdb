Marilyn Miller shot only three films before her untimely death - the wonderful SALLY (1929), the comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this trifle - SUNNY (1930). It's pretty poor both as a beginner and as an attempt at a musical - although she has four dance acts, she only sings two songs (WHO? And ONE MAN ALONE). The rest of the score, including the spritely title melody, is dropped, although we can hear the latter in the background notation. Miller looks overweight and amateur here - no star quality at all. Even his dance is dominant. The film is very poorly written, full of jokes and insignificant jokes and stupid situations. If you're interested in Miller as an interpreter, go ahead, take a look, but for entertainment in general, stay away.
