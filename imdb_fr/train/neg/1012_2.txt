How can there be so many corrupt cops without any of them slipping? With enough cops to conduct a mini-war including weapons such as flamethrowers, one would think they would have been arrested before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper heard someone say "thank you" to a corrupt cop. <br /> <br /> You will never find your 90 minutes. Life is too precious to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel bad about the big actors who made the mistake of making this film. <br /> <br /> If you like Justin Timberlake, do not hesitate to rent this movie. He has a very important role to play, so fans may like to see him. <br /> <br /> However, I think most of her fans are young girls, who may be shocked by the violence in this film.
