The plot and the characters are ridiculous and barely describe AS as a plot and a character. The biggest problem is that everything is dark, fuzzy and blurry. The fact that Fulci has covered the entire film with fog does not help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely weird and filled with sex and violence. The inconsistencies are quite amusing, one of the main characters says he has no friends, but he clings to the new guy in a minute on the screen and has a bunch of women aside. Although he shows his antisocial tendencies by randomly placing an arrow in a poor boy who deals only with his own business! Images of blood or flowing blood attract more attention than the characters but what do you want from Fulci. It may have ruined his career, but it was not really stupider than Zombie. Worth the rental if you like bloody Italian movies or if you are looking for sword and witchcraft or something weird. How do you sleep when someone is sucked into a pit two feet from your head and screams for help?
