Once again, Disney manages to make a children's movie that totally ignores its background. The names are pretty much common to this and Gadget's original drawings. The most egregious mistakes are the characters - Penny does not have her book, Brain has been reduced from a character to a fantasy prop, Dr. Claw is more of a show than an evil villain, etc., but there is has more than that. The horrors begin in the first minutes of the movie - Gadget, a security officer named John Brown, does not help to identify him as the classic gadget inspector. And right from the start, we see Disney's blatant attempt to turn each story into a love story between a man and a woman - they present Brenda, who only serves to make this film compatible with Disney. Add to that the fact that the "claw" seen in this film and the classic Dr. Claw are almost diagonally opposite and you'll see that it will be far from the original scenario. What would help would be a better scenario to replace it - but as you guessed, Disney also failed. The whole movie is just Gadget acting stupid for stupidity and coveting Brenda. As if to add insult to injury, Disney introduced the "new" Gadgetmobile - it does not look like the old Gadgetmobile at all, it's just the canonical figure of "comic relief." Obviously, Disney recognized that Gadget cartoons were a comedy. So they made the movie a comedy too, but they pulled out all the clever gags (like the mission paper explodes on the chef's face) and replaced them, Gadget being a moron, the Gadgetmobile being an idiot, and "Claw" showing himself. Someone should tell Disney that the "children's movie" does not imply "the total absence of brain use". Gadget should be targeted at children from 10 to 12 years ... not children from 10 to 12 months like this movie. Whatever this movie is supposed to be, it's NOT, repeat NOT, the real Inspector Gadget. Because I like the old gadget, I hate it.
