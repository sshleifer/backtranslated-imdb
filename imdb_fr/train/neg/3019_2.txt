how can you take seriously his bounty hunter story, so harsh and glamorous, with that accent? It's absurd. Apart from that, the visual style of the director is nauseating and whimsical, the plot is a gangster film filmed to say the least sad, boring and confused, and the acting is not convincing. The film features new characters throughout the film and is told in a fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - apparently just to keep you nice and confused. The film always shows you things that do not really happen, then he says later "it did not really happen, that's what happened" - see the (apparent) murder of (false) "first ladies". What did we see the first, wrong, sequence of events for next? <br /> <br /> Terrible choice in a casting, a complicated and messy scenario and a director's style that causes headaches. 1/5.
