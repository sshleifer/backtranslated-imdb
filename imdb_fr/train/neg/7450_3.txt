I saw this film at the movies many years ago and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any redeeming virtue in the movies: Dennis Quaid was chosen as a policeman who never smiles and smiles never. two of its brands. Danny Glover was described as mean, but, again, the imagination of most viewers could not go far enough to believe him in this role. In addition, Jared Leto was not credible as a former medical student. The tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early. The final was, again, neither dramatic nor tense: no one around me cared what would happen next. All we could expect was the end of the movie. In the end, a disappointing evening at the cinema.
