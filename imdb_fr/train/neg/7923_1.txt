I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels and the original "Corpse Grinders" are the main reason, but it's probably the worst film I've ever seen. Even the brilliant casting of the legendary Liz Renay ("Desperate Living") could not save this trash worthless. This film should serve as a lesson to all filmmakers of the past, present and future ... when you have a film as successful as the original "Corpse Grinders", you should probably let the sleeping dogs come and you absolutely should not try to revitalize it. more than twenty years later (unless you have the financial means to shoot a superior sequel like Herschel Gordon Lewis did with "Blood Feast 2: All U can Eat"), even if you decide to do so, you should probably spend a little more money than you have on the original and for God's sake ... NEVER shoot a movie on video ... why do filmmakers even try to do it? when everyone knows that the quality will be hideous ... Personally, I still have to see a film this way that is worth farting in hell ... if you can not afford to do a sequel that's better than your original movie, sell the movie rights to someone who can do it. ... and what was Ted V Mikels thinking (or who was he smoking) when he wrote this god-a naughty script? I mean, dog and cat "extraterrestrial" from another planet? A cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of crushing human bodies ... bones, clothes and everything? If one of these actors, aside from Liz Renay, has been paid more than five dollars for his hideous performances, he is not overpaid! Avoid this movie at all costs and look at the original instead.
