During his 40 years on Earth, author Jack London has managed to accumulate the most adventures and incidents that would seem possible. This 90-minute film, supposedly a biography of this man's life but obviously fictional, does not even scratch the surface, and remains a very ripe story for a modern replay. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his leading roles, describes London and his performance is both robust and friendly. It is not the problem here. Susan Hayward, young and very beautiful, embodies his future wife, Charmian, whose biography of London is the "base" of this film. London's life has been broken down into a series of episodes that the film passes through. So we have brief incidents with London as an oyster pirate, seal hunter in the Bering Sea, gold prospector in the Yukon and correspondent during the Russo-Japanese war ... colorful events, of course, but without much interest. in-depth treatment. And Alfred Santell's direction (he also directed one of Susan's first films, "Our Leading Citizen," in 1939) is, at best, chaotic. Making things harder here is a DVD of very poor quality, with an unhealthy print source and a hissing sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, was one of the extras of the DVD: a catalog of all Alpha Video movies, featuring hundreds and hundreds of color movie posters. Hope these movies are in better shape than "Jack London"!
