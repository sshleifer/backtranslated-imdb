For those who decide to watch or not this movie and read these comments to better understand, I first propose these four words: Do not waste your time! "Chungking Express" was sloppily filmed, quickly slammed, and seems to have been designed in its entirety by someone standing in line in front of a Hong Kong Burger King. I do not remember ever watching a movie with an assortment of one-dimensional characters trying to make their way through such a banal scenario! It is an absurd effort with a philosophically ridiculous dialogue (a man wanders in his flooded apartment and offers the astonishing revelation that "tears can be dried with a tissue, but the water takes time to clean itself"). We also see the same character maintain a deep and meaningful relationship with his towels, his soap, his stuffed animals, his dirty laundry, etc. The shaky, wandering, hand-held photographic work was another boring aspect that I could do without. And if that's not enough for you to throw up in your popcorn, we hear the California 60s California ode to moms and dads constantly sounding on the soundtrack for a particularly long sequence . <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for this loser in America through his company Rolling Thunder Productions, although I am not able to understand why a man with his talent would upset. He was known to have noticed, "I'm happy to love a movie so much." Many of us, however, hope that it will focus on the satisfaction of its audience with more interesting discoveries in the future.
