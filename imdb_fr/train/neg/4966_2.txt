I understand that this film was made with a very small budget, but it's not an excuse for Grendel's monstrosity. Deathstalker, the throne of fire, the barbarian queen, the conquest, the invincible barbarians were all executed with a limited budget and mediocre special effects. They nevertheless managed to create cult classics by adding slightly dressed warriors and a sense of humor. The primitive costumes, the dark castles and the beautiful Bulgarian landscape made Grendel a very good low budget sword and sorcery film, but the designers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely mediocre CGI effects and colorless characters. . Compare this movie to Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane, but it's a good example of how a low-budget, science-fiction / adventure adventure movie can be made with credible special effects and characters attractive.
