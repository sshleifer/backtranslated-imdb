The Story: Young-Goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She finds herself in a psychiatric facility after she starts believing that she is actually a cyborg. At the institution, she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her. <br /> <br /> If you're reading this, you probably already know how good Chan-wook Park is. But 'I am a cyborg ...' is a great departure from familiar territory and (unfortunately) stronger. I am a big fan of any film or story that tries to do something different. God knows we are all subject to enough shit in our local cinemas. The main point of the film I must say is that it fails to say anything about mental illness or to create a character that is important to you. <br /> <br /> This story must be one of the strangest things I've seen in years ... but weird is not enough. The film has no heart ... just surrealism and confusion. The confusion seems to be the main theme of the film. The characters are all trying to understand their own issues, but Chan-wook Park itself is the most confused of all.
