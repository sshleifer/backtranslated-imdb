It is an acceptable film but lacks real depth, either emotionally or narratively. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events, which limits the number of actions to virtually no action, without creating real suspense. <br /> <br /> Washington is credible in mind but he is sleeping through him, it is not possible to flex the muscles that act for him or for the casting. <br /> <br /> The story simply falls flat, although I never heard of the main character, the end was obvious, but unlike other films about such injustices, this one it has no emotional impact, you do not care and the motives of those from outside who seem more academic What is worried about his well-being. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to inject emotion by using the boy outside the hero who worships Carter, but it seems forced. <br /> <br /> It's an OK movie but instantly forgettable.
