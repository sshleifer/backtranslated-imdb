Oh my god, what a horrible movie! Designed to be a commentary on the state of society, it only reflects the worst of the worst reality TV. The interstitials organized by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most odious part, written in a tone that may be reflexive and insightful. These moments are rather scary as they speak on camera with a dialogue written by a person who is very fond of the insulting and condescending remarks that sinks the "meaning" of the film into the spectator's throat. <br /> <br /> a point for future filmmakers: long shots and quiet scenes are not equal for art. Neither extreme angles nor logic go to the point of absurdity. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in watching this movie, please do not do it. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
