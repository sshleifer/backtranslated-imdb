Special mention, only technicolor, costumes and sets deserve an honorable mention. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the lowest point of BING CROSBY's long career at Paramount. The scenario is about as clumsy as you might imagine and neither the unexpected Bing nor William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do anything to fix it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks extremely stupid in a boy's wig page. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a role as a costume heroine that forces her to look at Bing with admiration and little else, except to stir two uninspired ballads in a voice probably dubbed for the occasion. The spirit of Mark Twain is not evident in any scenario. Only regular fans of Crosby can enjoy the mess of a film given by a misguided direction. Even the extras seem not to know what they are supposed to do. <br /> <br /> In summary: Dull like dishwashing water. Not recommended, even for children.
