Mr. VanHook took a good idea and hit like a football. Unfortunately, the goal has not been reached. The historical subject of the giants is a good subject, but pour milk and you will end up with a huge wheel of cheese. I say, take this wheel and roll it on a cliff. I could not even watch the whole movie. That says a lot because I rarely move away from a movie. I always like to give them a last-minute chance of redemption. It is impossible to buy something so bad. At least the acting game was good ... NOT! <br /> <br /> The only thing that "falls" in this film is the rating. 1/10 and sink into negative numbers!
