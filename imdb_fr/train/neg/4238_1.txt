This film is awful. In the end, you will realize that many hours of your life have been stolen and you can not recover them. The end "twist" is very artificial. The development of the character leading to this end is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation - assuming that Rob Lowe's character will die on Christmas Eve - is explained in ninety seconds: "No, we were just playing you a trick." So the character of Rob Lowe is not even angry about it! "I will forgive you if you can forgive me", is also upset that he is hurting himself. If someone took weeks to convince me that I was about to die and then said, "No, sorry, I'm just fooling myself," I would raise a serious hell. I do not feel bad giving the spoiler because I might be able to stop some of you from watching. Please save yourself and DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM.
