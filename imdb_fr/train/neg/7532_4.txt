Something I really like in this woman's short films is the elusive nature of her theme - especially in "Living with Happiness". This film has a good beginning - unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment, but fails with an awkward exposure dialogue, uneven performances and a very intense television coverage. ordinary cinema. The ideas are so rich that they almost feel like a TV commercial. But the feeling is good, so we can not complain too much. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this director do a full animation and try to work with a producer who does not ask for so much trouble.
