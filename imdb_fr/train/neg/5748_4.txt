I must say that I hated this movie. I do not like saying that because Gerard Butler is there. After about half an hour of boring conversation, sorry for anyone interested in the plot, I started moving quickly towards Gerry's scenes. I really do not know the end, I was so bored. If Gerry was not there, I probably did one of the following: I fell asleep or I turned it off, but Gerry is the light of the movie, just like he did with most of his previous films. If you're a Gerry fan, do not worry, it's as sweet and precious as ever, but if you really want to watch the movie for the plot, be lucky, because you'll need it, unless you have a coffee or a soda to keep you awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and that's just because the casting director made sense to put Gerry in this film, even though he did not know how to spell his name!
