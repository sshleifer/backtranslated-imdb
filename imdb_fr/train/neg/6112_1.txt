I was thirteen when I saw this movie. I was expecting a lot of action. As Escape From New York had 16 people in Germany, I entered the movie as a retreat. It was so boring. Later, I realized it was just shit when a husband exposes his wife. I mean, today you do it over the Internet and you pay for instant access. More than 20 years ago, but I'm still angry at wasting time with this movie. This is a soft-porn for school kids. Undress Bo Derek and paint her with colors - nice. But then they should name the movie Undressing Bo and paint it.
