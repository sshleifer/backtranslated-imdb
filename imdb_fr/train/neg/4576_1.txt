At first glance, this documentary / fiction / cartoon is quite entertaining and provocative. Of course, when something causes thought, it can then be examined. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with unfounded insinuations and conclusions. The link between "science and spirituality" that you see between science and spirituality is actually not rooted in science. The study on transcendental meditation mentioned in the film asserts that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given region, Washington D.C. in this case. In fact, the HRA crime rate (homicides, rapes and assaults) was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. The homicide rate did not decrease at all during the study. In fact, every statement that links metaphysics to science can and has been denied. <br /> <br /> My conclusion from this information is that this movie is a mediocre attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke. Anyway, I suggest you do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a long film about science that can provoke thoughts, consider Mindwalk (1990).
