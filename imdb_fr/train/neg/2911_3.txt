This film is overflowing, predictable, pretentious and hollow. The sets are true to the time but their magnification by prolonged exposure makes them shy. The persistence of the artifacts stops the action and cleans almost as much as the empty dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to be wandering in the manner of Bruce Willis during the Hart War. Tom, you can not give depth to a character simply by making your face empty! The content did not justify the histrionic act of Paul Newman. It's a rat wrapped in an atomic bomb case.
