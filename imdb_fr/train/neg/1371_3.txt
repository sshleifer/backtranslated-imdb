I can not understand how one can get a budget for such a bad movie. It's as if the TV channel was desperately searching for everything, anything. They are buried under thick snow, the electricity is constantly flashing, but, magically, a background light remains constant. Where does all this (false) light come from? That, and all those stupid quarrels between the characters. They seem more interested in complaining than trying to invent ways to survive. He tries to create that sense of urgency and help people. But since it's so bad to lead and act, you will not solve your problem with Florence Nightingale with this movie, sorry. I agree with the negative comments and I agree that this is one of the worst movies of all time.
