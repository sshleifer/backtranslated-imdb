This film did not have huge stars, but a very good cast filled with excellent side actors and Gene Tierney before becoming a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, you would expect more than what the film actually delivered. I guess most of this is due to a second-rate scenario, because director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the helm. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in East Africa during the Second World War. just before the Americans go to war. The British are trying to control their African colonies as subversive Nazi elements attempt to stir up trouble among the local population. One of the whites in the film is a double-dealer who works for the destruction of the British Empire! But the charming Tierney, who plays the daughter of a sultan (!), Aims to save the world for the good of Britain. <br /> <br /> American directors have long since sided with the Empire and the 30s and 40s have a plethora of pro-empire films. Nowadays, with the change of sensibility, the idea of ​​seeing the black and happy blacks die for Queen and Country seems ridiculous - and it would be hard to take root on both sides! Yet, in his time, this propaganda was an effective way to support the British - although seen nowadays, the film suffers from a long script and an idiot cast. The only highlight of the film is the final confrontation between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Too bad after such a powerful scene, the movie seemed to talk and talk, losing some of its strength.
