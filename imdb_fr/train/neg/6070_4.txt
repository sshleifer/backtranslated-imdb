Tony Scott runs a thrilling sports film that should attract even sports fans. And some say that baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too slow. Well put away! Outside, he appears to be an unhappy salesman (Robert De Niro), while inside he is a psychotic fan of the San Francisco Giants. Then comes a new hitter (Wesley Snipes) and designated savior of the marasmus. Our salesman has a murderous obsession when the hard-hitting star falls into the worst slump of his career and there is a fear that the giants will collapse with him. De Niro is the personified terror. Snipes looks very natural like the baseball player. The other notable of the cast are: Ellen Barkin, always attractive, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You are a free agent ... so enjoy it. You must expect violence and strong language and you will get your money's worth.
