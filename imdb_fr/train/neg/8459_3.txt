A very interesting camera work and a story with a lot of potential. But this is never anything more than a graduate thesis at the film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons for this. Fist, there is not a single sympathetic character, not even a villain that we could admire for his chutzpah. Secondly, all the actors are awful, even from veteran Willem DaFoe. Here, the ham is so hearty that you feel like you're at a picnic - but one of those worst picnics of the company's employees, where you drink too much cheap beer and you have the hangover before even stop drinking. Then you eat a badly done hot dog and throw up. <br /> <br /> All right, I'm a little hard with a young director who could still go to some places - as I said, the camera work is pretty good. <br /> <br /> But I feel cheated - the introductory text of this film suggests that we will see a "western western", and the packaging of the DVD contains images that also suggest it - but nobody's is actually connected to the movie. Making seems to know that this is the kind of movie they are supposed to shoot. <br /> <br /> It's treason that hurts; but even without it, the fact remains that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly confused and, in the final analysis, we do not care. <br /> <br /> I took it out of the DVD player about halfway through. but the rental store would not give me back my money. <br /> <br /> Now, it really hurts.
