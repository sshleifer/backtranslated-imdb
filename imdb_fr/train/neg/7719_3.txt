The best way to describe this movie is to make a satire. The target of satire is quite large, from the US government to American companies. It's not a scathing satire either, but rather stupid. <br /> <br /> Imagine this movie as a mix between Fried Fried's movie series, Airplane and Police Squad, made with a much smaller and fun budget. I can see how this movie is a satire of many science fiction drama movies of the '50s and' 60s. I see this film as a great influence on Tim Burton's attacks on Mars. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. Genetically modified giant tomatoes become "crazy" and start attacking people and cities. At first, there is a concealment, then the war breaks out. <br /> <br /> The film covers the full range of characters and features: Lois Fairchild (a clone of Lois Lane), very ambitious presidential. Press Secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent who has not worked since the Bay of Pigs), useless president (who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack New York), a very inept Congress , a ladle Marketing CEO and Mason's team consists of an obese East German swimmer, an autonomous diver, a crazy World War II parachutist and an expert in Afro disguise American (disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally tomato). Did I forget to mention a lot, a lot of tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes, from small tomatoes to giant plastic tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, tomato juice and people dressed as tomatoes. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this, you have a couple of music numbers as well. They are not so good and seem to be doubled. The best song is by far the theme of the movie ("The Attack of the Slayer Tomatoes"). It's way too catchy and you could end up humming or singing in public. Be warned. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is quite entertaining and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various kinds of entertainment. I do not think I laughed, but most of the time smiled at me and scratched my head. I highly recommend this film to fans of category B and C movies, but only for rent. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
