This film was so bad that I had to move almost everything to get to the good side. Hah what good pieces? the only thing that was worth it was the end (those who saw the movie will know what I mean). I was expecting a lot of this movie, as an underworld meets the dawn of the dead, Freddy versus Jason, but what I got was this shit. The story was forgotten, the casting was badly used and what the director thought when he turned it. It could have been great, but I turned out to be the most boring movie I have ever seen. OK, and if there was a good piece of T and A, I was after the gore and I was bitterly disappointed. Do not expect a movie that is good, but if you want a horrible horror, then watch it and see how a horror movie SHOULD NOT BE DONE.
