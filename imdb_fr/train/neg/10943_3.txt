It's a very bad movie, with bad acting and a very boring rhythm. Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! All the characters are just boring (except Lamas), and there is absolutely no one to root or take care of it!, And the action is very boring. The film gives us 3 villains who were supposed to find threatening and disturbing while they were boring, laughable and a bunch of morons I wanted to shut up !, Plus this looks very cheap and amateurish !. Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma, but he can not save that shit, and believe it or not, the opening was really cool, as was the end, but the middle is incredibly boring, and made me want to press the fast forward button!, plus The dialog is particularly laughable !. There was a cool bar scene that I really liked, but once the llamas went to the dock, everything collapsed, as well as the scene where the villains torture Jennifer's family, and kill them were supposed to find it disturbing while it is laughable! It's a very bad movie, with bad acting and a very boring rhythm, Lorenzo Lamas is really cool !, But it's not enough, not recommended. The direction is very bad. George Erschbamer does a very bad job here, with poor camera work, a bland location and a boring movie. The acting is pretty bad (except for the lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is great here, and although he does not have to act, he's quite funny to watch, he has a really cool character and he has a lot of charisma, even though he can not save this one . no chemistry with the cast either! (Llamas rules!). Josie Bell is terrible here, and although she looks decent, she is not very convincing and has no chemistry with Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot, but does not have much to do, but screams and is afraid, she does not care. Robert Scott is INCREDIBLY boring as the main villain, and is not threatening at all, he is laughable like the other 2. The rest of the cast is bad. Overall avoid! Avoid! Even if you like llamas (like me). * out of 5
