I do not know what I missed here, but I can not believe all those positive comments from so many people on this movie. I thought it was silly and a little excessive. I enjoyed the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, but the others were just ... boring. <br /> <br /> Now, I like B movies, really, but it was a little further in the alphabet for me. I've seen someone compare the humor and horror of this film to "Army Of Darkness" and "Shaun of the Dead", as well as to "Tied With The Re-Animator". You must joke. I did not find this movie funny, he tried, he made an effort (maybe too much), but he failed. By the time I was hit by the 3rd or 4th one-line, I rolled my eyes and checked my watch. <br /> <br /> There were certainly tributes to several other movies, which is always cool, kind of like a joke inside for us horror fans. But here it may come from a lack of original thought. Certainly, there were pretty special effects, good blood, but it can not contain a whole movie. Grant, who had mutated, looked like a cross between Jabba the Hut and, at the beginning of the mutation, Chet of "Weird Science" (after being turned into a monster) and one of the extraterrestrial animals / creatures of "The Explorers" . It just did not work. I thought it sounded like something a fifth-grade child in art could have conceived. Then there was Brenda, the woman Grant was pregnant and chained in the barn. When the help finally arrived, she looked like a giant tick waiting to be ejected. The design was once again completely devoid of imagination. Round flesh colored ball with a face in the middle. * yawn * <br /> <br /> Now about zombies: the more I see movies with zombies these days, the more I would like George A. Romero to have a patent on them and be the only writer / director allowed to make movies on them. He is the only person to have succeeded so far, with the exception of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (but it was a comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but it was a different style of Zombie. Perhaps Mr. Romero ruined a zombie movie for me because of his ingenious ability to moan, moan and move his actors as if their joints were dry and lacked even a drop of synovial fluid, and their muscles combated the effects caused by the rigor mortis which had begun to settle just before their resuscitation. The people from "Wheelsy" just did not have the proper motivation ... they were horrible zombies. <br /> <br /> So I end up giving "Slither" a 3, for some bursts of laughter and some beautiful gore scenes.
