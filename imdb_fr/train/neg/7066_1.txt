I was expecting something really good, but after the damage inflicted on me, I'm just happy to think about it. It's hard to think of what Filmmakers (HA!) Was a good movie. the stories, and I use the world vaguely, are inconsistent and make no sense. There are just stupid things happening at random. the acting game, if we can say that the acting is horrible, I saw the dough playing in pubs! I know they're low budget video bins, but that's still not what they tried. After thinking about it, I will feel very sleepy and I will stay # yawws, I'll lie down. <br /> <br /> WARNING: CAN NOT DRIVE, WALK, READ OR DO AFTER Watch CHILLERS.
