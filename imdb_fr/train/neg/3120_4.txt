I did not really expect a lot of "The Night Listener" and I had never heard of it before seeing the cover in the video library. However, the film is very effective at creating a suspension and a tension. Occasionally, it lags a bit, but it really helps you to wonder what will happen and more importantly: when. As the film progresses, the character portrayed by Robin Williams is dragged into a kind of "cat and mouse" to the point of becoming obsessed with the discovery of the truth and the existence of a mistreated boy. years when no one seemed to have thought. have never seen in person. The Night Listener is an interesting story, which is excellent for creating suspense throughout the movie and you are virtually kept in the dark about who's lying and what's real. However, in the end, it disappoints and does not realize the potential it could have. This does not really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character, which would have been useful and interesting.
