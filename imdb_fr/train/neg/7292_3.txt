Sunshine is a European import established in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it is the epic story of the Hungarian Jews, of the Sonnenschein family. This name translates literally as Sunshine. The family has modest beginnings, then flourishes, becomes mobile up, changes its name and hopes to integrate into Hungarian society so that successive generations can progress professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son of each of the three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed World War II and the Holocaust in Europe, Sonnenschein's approach to life is not working very well. <br /> <br /> Sunshine is considered an artistic success, but it's a missed opportunity. History, dominated by the history of the world, is predictable and transparent. this is reinforced by the narration of voice coverage and news footage. The family "conspiracy" arises from a foreseeable event [ie, Habsburg, World War I, World War II, fascism, communism, etc.], with little continuity, depth or detail. The theme of Jewish assimilation is not targeted and important sub-themes [the diary and family philosophy] that could have given the family a character and credibility endure to the end. Alternatively, filmmakers provide continuity of generation using common themes of incest / infidelity. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of genius, but his performance is far from an award-winning material. The "3 for 1" broadcast format is a distraction for the viewer and is more like a cheap movie gadget than a good theater. Sunshine is essentially Hungarian "History Channel" material. It has the appearance of Winds of War transformed with Forrest Gump transformed with Something About Sex. <br /> <br />
