There must have been no children's program on Saturday morning on TV that was so bad. After all, these producers had to rely on the return of the public. Well, in this appalling offer, they could at least count the money saved on the trays. The scenario could have been a rejection of a long-forgotten series of operas, with some complicated lines added for the cool guy, Gerald Mohr, to whisper to Naura Hayden. No director could have done anything decent with such a crazy story, so the action is boring. Spaceship accessories are absurd - a Bulova wall clock and a portable typewriter, for example - but the sets on the planet must be among the worst in film history. Most are rudimentary drawings, and everything is bathed in a red light often poorly focused. Even Mohr's naked and hairy torso is used as an accessory. And it's a bad one - as thin as the plot. Any viewer who reaches the end of this film will hear a message from the Martians - and will probably agree completely!
