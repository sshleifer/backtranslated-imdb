I saw this movie at the premiere of London and I must say that I did not expect much, but I was expecting something that was at least slightly entertaining. <br /> <br /> The original "Basic Instinct" was not This is a very good movie and it's still a "coal classic", but it was fun. I remember countless times having flipped through the TV channels on Friday or Saturday night late and seeing myself start paying attention. <br /> <br /> However, this lame brain, waaay- late continuation has nothing. Is Sharon Stone still so beautiful? Well, let's say this: for a 47-year-old woman, she's pretty sexy. Is she as beautiful as she was in the original? No. She also clearly had a cosmetic surgery surgery on her face and her haircut in this film is somewhat unpleasant. She does not look as sweet, authentic, or innocent as in the original - which is somehow the very purpose of being a diabolical seducer, and all the rest. <br /> <br /> The rest of the performances go from bad to terrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (a sure director, who does not always do a good job but manages to make films worthy of interest) has formally presented his first real turkey; a film so bad that people were laughing at times that were supposed to be serious. <br /> <br /> I hear the film undergo multiple montages, and it's very clear from the beginning. Nothing makes a lot of sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the end - oh my god! Talk about stupid and unbelievable. (Still predictable, though.) I saw "Gigli", I saw "The Son of the Mask" - and although I'm not trying to "smear" this movie, I can say it with my own authority. agree with the fact that I prefer these two films rather than this catastrophic failure. <br /> <br /> By the way, Stone left five minutes before the movie started and the theater people started throwing things off the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside a nightclub like orgy. <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" - basically, it stinks too.
