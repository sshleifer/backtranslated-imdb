... Did I miss something ??? "unexpected developments"? "conspiracy plot with subversive joy"? do these viewers look at the same Arquette vehicle I just submitted to (in a sub-conscious sadomasochism now obvious) ... I just joined this site just to make sure no one else is renting it. ..this movie was embarrassing for everyone involved ... quick question: did Sir Stevie read the script before giving in to Kate C.? if so, then it must be the same Spielberg that announced "Howard the Duck" ... do not give me that, "it was a hit play" shit - I guess Mssr. Reddin is not very happy ... the DVD cover promised "surprising corners" and a "twisted story ..." Story !! History ?? It's bullshit like that that makes old Bobby McKee and his group of wandering structuralists sound like geniuses ... Sundance "Berlin" - Toronto. I have a video at the house of my fart cat, which evokes more interest than the representation in negative dimension of the loss anxious by Arquette ... and speaks of two ex machina for Mr. Stanley T .; thank you my god, just when he thought he'd call Dave by the police! and thanks shiva that the cops just catch the real killer ... what! Until the credits, I was still waiting for a kind of grievance against Arquette and her "hidden millions" ... no, Mrs. Spielberg, you will not escape unscathed: what is this kitchen scene with "the athlete's foot in my crotch "gag ???" are you worse in this area or "just cause" I do not know ... hey moviegoers: why not make a great party and rent it with "jersey girl "and" white chicks ", then commit sepukka (or is it seppuka) ... and take E. Dunsky with you ....
