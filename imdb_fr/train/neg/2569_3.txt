Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is quite amusing in this turkey of 1970, but the scenario is so lame and insulting that even the youth of Goldie Hawn (just after his Oscar win) can not start to get her out of the mud. Celebrating in his forties, Sellers is usually embarrassed to the nth degree. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10. Best performance =? Nicky Henson plays a young type of study. <br /> <br /> I hope Hawn and Sellers have been well paid because I do not see any other reason to cheat like this in 1970 (a very good year for movies - CATCH-22, MASH , MARI, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PARTS and many more). You can not win them all!
