I love the special effects and the observation of new technologies that make science fiction seem real. The special effects of this film are very good. I have seen most of this film since it aired on HBO for two months. I must admit that I may have missed a few scenes, but I am generally attracted to movies and have already seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see "Hollow Man", I feel depressed, almost like a "black film". I do not know why maybe I do not want Kevin Bacon to be mean, and that disappoints me. But I think it bears witness to how he becomes ruthlessly perverse. Anyway, I can recommend this movie as exciting (although some parts move slowly), but I do NOT recommend it to kids under 14 (maybe 12, if they are mature).
