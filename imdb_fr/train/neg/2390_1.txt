I love all of Tom Robbins' books, so I was very excited and interested in seeing a film made after one of his books. I knew there would be no way the movie would even capture half of Robbins' magic, but after watching the movie, it did not make me want to read the book again. Even Cowgirls movie Get the Blues does not include an eighth of the book's content and seems to focus more on the love affair between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. In addition to the incredibly weak plot in the film, I think that better actors could certainly have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the film who, in my opinion, played their roles inspired by Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five-minute clip at the beginning of the film. Those who have not read the book may appreciate the film, but as a big fan of Tom Robbins, this film was a disappointment.
