Could it be the same director as Do not Look Now or Bad Timing? Act badly, <br /> <br />, edited in disorder. Just compare the different accident scenes in this movie with similar scenes in Do not Look Now to see how much Roeg lost his touch <br /> <br />. <br /> Even reliability in general Teresa Russell (who looks a little stocky these days, I'm afraid to report it) can not save this one. The plot is a pure pseudo-religious hokum, the acting is wood and Roeg's attempts to dislocate time are pitiful. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one like the plague.
