Some elements prevent this film from being a total disaster, but are eclipsed by bad acting, holes in the plot, deus ex machina, stupid dialogues, a weak scenario and predictable cliches ... br /> <br /> What we have here is a horror movie with a scenario that is going nowhere for most of the time. A group of unlikely heroes, including a black who understands it first (yeah, this shot seems to be still alive, even in Finland), seems to have a hard time getting out of a mysteriously empty hospital. There are screaming ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at one point, I thought at least they did not use them, but they came), and a Finnish glam-rock band with demonic makeup that obstructed them. There is also a little time present, but it does not add anything to the scenario. An autistic girl and a tramp seem to have a deeper understanding of the situation, but never tell the viewer or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of deep life lessons such as: "What will happen ..." or "The light can not live in the darkness ..." or the disturbing "I need a red pencil ... a red pencil. " So all these characters (including the anxious father and the kind doctor in distress) end up running around their dark floors and those of the demons or, wrongly, of them. From time to time, a ghost or a group of zombies presents itself, and if it seems that a demon keyboard can not see a group of six people coming towards him, waving a flashlight and conversing, it's was that pretending. And apparently, this demon can pierce the walls without much concern, but the opening of the elevator door is beyond his abilities. <br /> <br /> In the end, we even get a sequence of sequences "it was a dream". Or maybe not. Oh, man, I'd like this movie to be, and that kind of thing that gives the impression that time is moving faster, so it's all done in just 10 minutes ...
