I'm really sorry to say that, but "Thunderbirds" does not even come with a strong pop, not to mention thunder. At one point, I seriously considered going out of the cinema, I remained in despair that the film could improve. I was disappointed, it did not improve, it got worse if it was possible. If I had gone to see the film with the idea that it would be a "parody", I would still have been dropped. They had an excellent opportunity to make a great film franchise here, they totally wasted this opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to have names attached to this film and Jonathan Frakes as well as I can say he should be embarrassed and shame would not be so far from the truth. I saw this film during a preview screening, I was looking forward to seeing it, having grown in the sixties with the original series. To say that I was disappointed would be a euphemism. One last thing I would say about the movie is that the puppets in the TV shows were a little bit more wood than the actors in the movie.
