It would be a mediocre Hollywood observable if he had a good editing. It is based on the typical American thriller scenario - "that will thwart everyone". Playing is less than average, but with the brilliant appearance of the detective who is the best actor of the film and who is mainly responsible if the tension rises in the film. The film was completely smothered by blank video and sound footage and most of them looked like raw film material. All in all, if you see a film that looks like a student film project, it's a movie to watch. I guess that would be enough to say on this film, that everything else could really spoil the tension which is probably quite low.
