NOTE TO ALL ADMINISTRATORS: Long is not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. However not good. The scenes were drawn, path, path, path, much too long. Sex scenes were useless and often too long. The film was 2 hours and 10 minutes would have been exceptional, but unfortunately it became so boring that I can give him only 2 out of 10. It is well below average. <br /> <br /> Some other problems also exist in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays a whole family tree. The guy who played the great-grandfather does not look like him, but the grandfather, the father and the son (who gives us a still useless voice) are all Ralph Fiennes with different hairs and the same bull head personality. Nobody seems to notice that each of these children looks like a clone of the last one, even though pictures are taken at each turn. This one is minor, but if the film had not lasted three weeks, it would not have been so annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) The fact that no news from Germany has even been whispered for a long time about Rallying Jews and expelling them is ridiculous. Something would have been said to them and the idea of ​​trying to escape would probably have been discussed. The uncle in France would surely have sent a warning to try to convince them to leave. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories of this movie are totally wrong. You spend this thing forever and the development of relationships between the main characters is extremely short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost instantly ... married. Then have children. Then we draw things for 6 centuries and forget to develop relationships. Again, it would not have been that difficult in a 2-hour movie, but with the time, nothing has been given to us. <br /> <br /> 4) The end was really bad. I do not want to ruin anyone, but you will not like that either ... unless you are sadistic. <br /> <br /> The director / screenwriter must be tortured to have to look at this swollen trash every week, I mean endless loop, oops, it's the same thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this film. I think I think that Ivan Szabo should be inspired by his career as a director. A long film that completely ruins any substance of the film. Short description of 'The Whisperer' and Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, perfect title. If you start watching while the sun is shining, it will probably be fine after dark when you leave.
