Andie McDowell is as beautiful as a 40-year-old woman whose late start to a serious relationship brings her to a much younger man and a sub-couple arguing with two best-old friends. <br /> <br /> See a gigolo / researcher of gold at the sincere young man, the "girlfriends", powerless to put an end to this "idiotic relationship", goes beyond the call of duty in " helping "his friend (who is obviously blinded by this gigolo delicate game". <br /> <br /> A short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous.What is far away no longer covers it.) Without these incredible scenes, we could have hopefully a sweet love story Instead, the whole viewer I still have an involuntary jerk of the head - these things do not happen! Without revealing the details of the cliff, I warn the viewer that he has high expectations for this film, most (like me) will be very disappointed.On a scale of 1 to 10, it ranks a low 4 with me.It is not worth your time.
