Okay, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time, I was able to sit down and watch it TWICE !!! The scenario was rather horrible and during the first part of the first story, I wondered what I was watching but at the same time, it was so awful that I loved it. Cheap laughter all the way. <br /> <br /> And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this film. The only thing that let him down is that he put an end to his idiotic calls. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was rather treacherous, but if you're looking for laughter see it in the pound there passes.
