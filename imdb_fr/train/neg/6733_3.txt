The exclamation point in the title is appropriate, although it's a euphemism. This film does not just cry - it screams loud enough to break the glass. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone produced strident, humorless thrillers that aspired to a semi-documentary sensation. Here, they shot in real New York locations with a "real" acoustics that enhances the likelihood. But the naturalism of the sound recording only amplifies the awkward dialogue of the Stones and the embarrassing histrionic tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. <br /> <br /> In a performance totally devoid of modulation, Stevens plays the wife of electronics Whiz James Mason (looks haggard and bored); the two are held prisoner by extortionist Rod Steiger (who looks puffy and bored) and his slimy cohorts in a ploy to blackmail an airline with a lethal bomb that Mason contributed to the unwanted construction. <br /> example of a criminal brain so brilliantly attentive to every detail, yet smart enough to hire a degenerate addict as a subordinate. The idea of ​​the Acerbic Stones is to trap the hysterical Stevens alone with the rapist Neville Brand, the ravisher of Benzedrine, filling the frame with his sweaty and drooling kisser. But the work of the camera is so complex and the mark so discreet that the effect is barely terrifying and even less suspensive. The Stones, a couple of heart at heart, do not even have the courage of their own lack of conviction. <br /> <br /> The film ends with the stout Steiger chasing Stevens in a subway train. The track is as awkward as its heaviness. With Angie Dickinson as Steiger's amorous girlfriend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
