A high school principal (Keenan Wynn) with a losing basketball team involuntarily engages a coach who turns out to be not only a gorgeous blonde (Cathy Lee Crosby), but also a catalyst for their new victories. Are you really surprised? Over time, a relationship develops between coach and star team player Jack (Michael Biehn). The police are never informed. <br /> <br /> Packed with other pictures of Crown International Pictures as a grindhouse movie really does not make this movie any service. This can easily be edited in a TV movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great as a coach Randy Rawlings, especially in her tight outfits, but I was expecting more than just a titillation of a R-rated movie. A plot involving a dorky center that's hypnotized by her teammates pretending to be Sydney Wicks, a former NBA player, is the real reason for the team's new success rather than his coaching. Too much teasing and not enough sleaze make it a major disappointment.
