Okay, the movie festival crowd probably loved it. But your average movie buff, who eats popcorn and has accumulated $ 10 or $ 15 for a movie these days, will probably wonder why he made that choice. If it's marked "Copolla", it's automatically great, right? False! It's a neat parody of filmdom's claims. But it's terribly "in". I worry when filmmakers are more concerned with entertainment than the public. It's interesting like cinematic curiosity and there's a laugh or two in it. But once the film and television have had their day, the dust gets thicker on the boxes of film and the boxes of cassettes that hold them. Not really period or an epic!
