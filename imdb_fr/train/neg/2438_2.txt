This famous late career of Koen Wauters caught my attention through the "Night of bad taste". Judging by the index of comments, I was not the first and I am not the last person in Western Europe to have learned that this musician (undoubtedly one of the best of our contemporary pop scene, even the Dutch agree on this), tried to be an actor. Whether he had to make the attempt or not, can not be judged. <br /> <br /> In "Intensive Care", he is very friendly, but he seems uncomfortable with the film in which he participates. Nobody can blame him. He deserves his ranking in the Hall of Fame of Verheyen by all means and standards. The story of the deadly maniac supposed to have died as a result of an accident, but alive and angry has already been told dozens of times, and even without original twists, a director can deliver a story that is more than mediocre thanks to decorations and an innovative cinematography. <br /> <br /> IC is content with a hospital wing and some middle class homes. The rhythm is dull. The tension loses its last credibility within the score, as each appearance of the murderer is accompanied by a tedious and threatening melody, followed by orchestral chipping during the murders, which is largely suggested and bloodless as a small budget. can do them. The sex scene is free but not at all attractive. The Amsterdam couple could have made it work. When dealing with the couple: the entire sub-plot between Wauters and the girl does not work. A more effective emotional connection could have been established on the screen if they had just been future victims, who relaxed in the middle of a physical relationship. I will not even give dignity to other members of the cast because they should all have been cut into tiny greasy pieces. In fact, most of them do it. The ones I remember were obvious for the genre: a pretty nurse and two cops. <br /> <br /> Therefore, in a slasher, the cavalry arrives only in time to need to be saved. The (anti) heroes must defeat the villain, mainly by intelligent thought, because the old red berets are not often part of the film; they could overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the murderer. Translated to events, Wauters kills the doctor and saves the woman in distress. <br /> <br /> No people, I'm not finished. That's not how the story goes. Wauters tries heroically but gets beaten with a fury that is close to "A Clockwork Orange". It is therefore up to the girl to take up the act of killer drillers and pierce the brains of doctors. Although this method kills the killer more than the usual 9mm bullets, the doctor survives to allow IC to reach the 80-minute mark. <br /> <br /> I should have made myself understand now. Intensive Care is a bad movie, which can only be enjoyed by lovers of Bad Taste, who can check Verheyen's catchy statements and invent some, and thus try to go unnoticed. For example, the (involuntary) parody value of the doctor's clown mask (Halloween) and the final confrontation in the park (the hunt on Friday the 13th). <br /> <br /> However, let me conclude by giving a glimpse by a few lean elements that give IC some credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is endure a horrible monologue from a fellow French doctor / actor and look horrified to let him fall into flames so he can make his big name on a replacement. He could have played his Naked Gun role again, to finish as an ox, but with a longer screen time. The final can be one of them. I had never seen a maniac shot down by throwing a firework at him to crush him against a flexible fence. It's good to laugh. <br /> <br /> Name the point on ICU ... Koen Wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career. I wonder how many editions of the race Paris-Dakar must abort before regaining consciousness. <br /> <br />
